0,2020/02/04,Lakers' LeBron James picks No. 2 jersey for All-Star Game as tribute to Gianna Bryant,"LA Lakers forward LeBron James had a choice for the NBA All-Star Game later this month in Chicago.

He could choose to have his team wear No. 24 to honor Kobe Bryant, who died January 26 in a helicopter crash. Or he could opt for his team to wear No. 2 to honor Bryant's daughter, Gianna, a budding basketball star who died with her famous father and seven others on a foggy morning in Southern California.

James, who has a 5-year-old daughter of his own, quickly chose No. 2 to honor Gianna.

“It felt like these last three years were the happiest I've ever seen him,” James told reporters of his mentor and Lakers predecessor. “I think we all can say that. It was the happiest I've ever seen him, being able to just be with his daughters, be with his family.

“To see him these last three years just being ... y'all see 'GirlDad,' the hashtag. I'm a girl dad. My brother right here (Anthony Davis) is a girl dad.”

James told reporters that he thought of his daughter, Zhuri, as he chose No. 2.

More tributes

Monday was another day of tributes to Kobe Bryant, who died with Gianna and seven others in the crash in the hills of Calabasas, Calif. University of Connecticut women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma wore Bryant's Lakers jersey under his jacket and over his shirt and tie during his team's home game against Oregon.

The Huskies honored Gianna last week by placing a No. 2 jersey on its bench. Gianna had said she wanted to one day play at UConn.

Also on Monday, the Lakers took down a large public memorial to Bryant across from the Staples Center on Monday. The team will store the donated items and may relocate the memorial or donate it to the Bryant family depending on the family's wishes.

James said Bryant remains at the top of mind for players on the Lakers, who pulled away for a 129-113 win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday after scoring 81 points in the first half.

“The fact that we scored 81 points ... in the first 24 minutes, how eerie that was, and then both teams' combined points were 242, (like 24 for Kobe and 2 for Gianna), there was some weird stuff going on,” James said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ltng9w/article30733937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAMES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lakers-lebron-james-picks-no-2-jersey-for-all-star-game-as-tribute-to-gianna-bryant/article30733938.ece
1,2020/02/04,"India’s proposal to host Common Wealth Games shooting, archery events backed by UK House of Lords","India’s proposal to host the additional shooting and archery events for the 2022 Commonwealth Games has been endorsed by the British House of Lords after an extensive debate.

Last month, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) had withdrawn its threat to boycott the Birmingham Commonwealth Games over shooting’s omission and instead decided to submit a formal proposal to host a shooting championship, where the medals won will be counted in the tally of the Games.

The proposal was backed by the UK’s House of Lords.

“The government welcomes the Indian Olympic Associations statement on confirming that India will take part in the games,” Baroness Diana Barran, the parliamentary under Secretary of State for digital, culture, media and sport, said in her summation address.

“The government also welcomes the proposal from India to the CGF for additional events in the sports of shooting and Archery and the CGF is currently discussing this proposal with its membership and following this will inform India of its decision,” she added.

When asked if she could confirm that the government would ensure that in future versions shooting would be made a compulsory sport at the CWG instead of an optional one, she said she will pass on the matter to the minister of sports in the House of Commons.

She also said that the minister of sports in the House of Commons is simultaneously “meeting with the CGF discussing that very point and all of the costs for that event shall be met by the Indian Olympic association.”

House member Lord Karan Bilimoria described the proposal “as a manifestation of a member of the commonwealth family coming forward as a member of the family to assist in providing a solution to the issue of shooting and archery being proposed to be held in Delhi or Chandigarh.”

He also congratulated sports minister Kiren Rijiju, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President Narinder Batra and National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) chief Raninder Singh for offering an “innovative solution“.

In a letter to the CGF President Dame Louis Martin, Batra said the cost of the shooting’s conduct will be met largely by the NRAI while the archery programme will likely be funded solely by the Government of India.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ii8p6c/article30733340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARCTH04HERY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indias-proposal-to-host-cwg-shooting-archery-events-backed-by-uk-house-of-lords/article30733122.ece

4,2020/02/04,Twitter adds Bitcoin emoji; Dorsey uses it in bio,"Micro blogging site Twitter has finally added a Bitcoin emoji, which appears when users write a hashtag alongside the word “Bitcoin” or the letters “BTC” and a Bitcoin emoji appears next to it.

Jack Dorsey, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Twitter, showed off the platform’s newest feature. This is demonstrated in his Twitter bio as well, which contains nothing but the hashtag and the symbol.

Dorsey also tagged Unicode, the consortium that manages character standards, in his tweet in what seems to be an effort to suggest that it does the same thing, Finance Magnates reported on Monday.

Meanwhile, according to an observation from Jason Yanowitz, who pointed out that 12 hours after the hashtag emoji was added, Bitcoin was a top trend for him on Twitter (it isn’t clear if it was a personalised trend or global trend), with many in the community publishing tweets with the fresh-faced hashtag, according to Crypto Slate.

Increased local manufacturing, prudent pricing and refined go-to-market strategies helped Apple attain market success, said the CyberMedia Research (CMR’s) ‘Mobile Handset Review Report’.

“Apple turned around its India story in 2019, by doubling its market share to two per cent, on the back of the successful iPhone 11, and the iPhone XR. Apple’s shipments grew 17% (YoY),” said Prabhu Ram, Head, Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR.

7,2020/02/04,5G smartphone sales to hit 144 million in India by 2025,"The year 2020 will see the first wave of 5G-enabled smartphones arriving in India and the volume of such phones may reach 144 million units by 2025, according to a report by CyberMedia Research (CMR).

The first wave of 5G smartphones will contribute to roughly one per cent of the shipment volumes in 2020, primarily driven by a hyper-competitive market conditions with smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) aiming to establish their market leadership early.

“In 2020, India will see the first wave of 5G devices from leading smartphone OEMs, mostly Chinese, aiming to establish their 5G leadership early. We anticipate around 10-12 5G smartphone models to hit the market during the year,” said Prabhu Ram, Head, Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR.

While 5G shipments will remain nascent, for early tech adopters, it represents more choices than before.

“With the onset of 5G, the field of play will get increasingly limited for Indian brands. Unless they start investing, and upscaling their R&D and innovation efforts around 5G, they will be further marginalized,” added Mr. Ram.

According to the report, the shadow of coronavirus looms large on the Indian smartphone industry as of now.

Also popular are health and fitness apps, such as Keep, which live-streams fitness classes. Its revenue surged 15% for the week, while healthcare app Pingan Good Doctor saw downloads jump 1,186%.

“We believe that China internet and logistics companies are somewhat sheltered,” from the impact of the virus outbreak, analysts from Bernstein Research wrote in a Monday note, amid a growing trend for all products and services to move online.

Tencent’s blockbuster mobile game Honour of Kings made up to 2 billion yuan ($286 million) on the January 24 eve of the holiday, estimated Pei Pei, an analyst with Sinolink Securities Co, exceeding all the Chinese mobile games on Apple’s app store during the entire week-long break in 2018.

10,2020/02/04,Pakistan Parliament passes resolution asking India to revoke its decision on Kashmir,"Pakistan’s Parliament on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution expressing “unflinching and unwavering support” to the Kashmiri people and demanding India to reverse its decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

The National Assembly or lower house passed the resolution on the eve of what Pakistan observes as the Kashmir Solidarity Day on February 5 annually.

The resolution demanded India to immediately reverse its actions of August 5 and October 31, repeal the “draconian laws”, withdraw its forces and immediately lift lockdown in the valley, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have spiked since India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.

India’s decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has categorically told the international community that its move to scrap Article 370 of the Constitution revoking the special status of J&K was an internal matter and has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.

The resolution reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent political, moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmir people and asked the UN Security Council to enforce a peaceful settlement of the issue in accordance with its resolutions.

11,2020/02/04,I wish to serve all Sri Lankans: Gotabaya,"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Tuesday said he would look after all citizens and not just “a particular community”, in his first Independence Day address to the nation, even as his government dropped the Tamil national anthem from the ceremony.

Weeks ahead of the celebration, the government announced that it would not play the Tamil version of the national anthem — Tamil is an official language in Sri Lanka — departing from a practice re-introduced in 2016 by former President Maithripala Sirisena, who Mr. Rajapaksa succeeded in November 2019. The move drew criticism from citizens who said the omission of the Tamil anthem would impair post-war reconciliation in the country.

Despite last minute calls from some Tamil politicians and local newspaper editorials, urging the government to reconsider its decision, authorities stuck to their position. By rejecting the Tamil national anthem at the Independence Day celebration, in front of local and international community, the government has justified discrimination, and has disappointed patriots, said Mano Ganesan, a former Minister of National Integration, Official Languages, Social Progress and Hindu Religious Affairs. “As a Sri Lankan, I am ashamed and worried,” he tweeted.

Addressing a big gathering at Colombo’s Independent Square that included senior politicians, military men and diplomats, President Rajapaksa said: “I have the vision that I must serve as the leader of the country looking after all citizens rather than serve as a political leader concerned only about a particular community. As the President today, I represent the entire Sri Lankan nation irrespective of ethnicity, religion, party affiliation or other differences,”

President Rajapaksa said a legitimately elected leader in a democracy is for all the people of the country. “During his term of office, he must serve the entire Sri Lankan people. He is not bound to serve only the interests of the people who voted for him.”

Further, Mr. Rajapaksa said maintaining the balance of power between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary was very important to “balance equilibrium in democracy”. However, he added: “I do not envisage public officials, lawmakers or the judiciary to impede” his “commitment” to fulfilling the needs of the people. “A strong executive, a legislature and an independent judiciary is essential for the well-being and advancement of any democratic society,” he said.

Critics of the Rajapaksa administration that ruled the country from 2005 to 2015 – with current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa serving as President, and his younger brother President Gotabaya Rajapaksa as a powerful Defence Secretary – accused it of an authoritarian slant, threatening democratic freedoms.

Promising enhanced national security, freedoms of thought, expression, religion and assembly, President Rajapaksa told citizens on Tuesday, “if your conscience tells you that the government is moving in the wrong direction, you always have a duty to point this out boldly.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c72j0g/article30737010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gotabaya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i-wish-to-serve-all-sri-lankans-gotabaya/article30737012.ece
12,2020/02/04,Pakistan lawyer moves SC against suspension of Musharraf’s death sentence,"A Pakistani lawyer has appealed to the Supreme Court to set aside the verdict of a High Court that annulled the death sentence of self-exiled former President Pervez Musharraf.

The special court in Islamabad on December 17 last handed down the death penalty to the 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, after six years of hearing a high-profile treason case against him.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

Trial declared ‘unconstitutional’

On January 13, Mr. Musharraf’s trial in the high treason case was declared as “unconstitutional” by the Lahore High Court (LHC), leading to the annulment of the death sentence against the former President.

The LHC declared that the formation of the special court was “unconstitutional” and that the treason case against Mr. Musharraf was not prepared in accordance with the law.

In an appeal on February 3, senior counsel Hamid Khan, representing petitioner, advocate, Taufiq Asif, requested the apex court to set aside the LHC verdict by declaring it illegal and without lawful authority, Dawn newspaper reported on February 4.

The petitioner argued that the High Court, through its order had virtually invalidated and rendered ineffective Article 6 of the Constitution, which has special significance and importance in the constitutional history of Pakistan.

In its order, the High Court had declared the constitution of the special court a violation of the Criminal Law Amendment (Special Court) Act, 1976 and said the amendment to Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with high treason under the 18th Amendment, could not be given retrospective effect to constitute an offence committed much earlier.

The trial in absentia by the special court was also held to be illegal by the High Court.

The senior counsel questioned the acceptance of Mr. Musharraf’s petition by the High Court when a similar matter was pending before the Supreme Court, particularly when an effective order was already issued by the apex court on April 1, 2019.

‘Hierarchy of courts violated’

He argued that the entertainment of such a petition on the part of the High Court violated the constitutional hierarchy of the courts.

It is established on the record, the petition argued, that Mr. Musharraf had already been declared an absconder and, therefore, he had no right under the law to seek a stay on the trial against him before the special court. He has no right to even seek a stay against the announcement of the verdict by the special court.

Therefore, the entire proceedings before the High Court were contrary to the law and the Constitution, the petition said, adding that the High Court could not sit over the April 1, 2019 verdict in which the apex court, while deciding the case of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, had issued directives to the special tribunal to proceed with Mr. Musharraf’s trial.

Mr. Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008, was the first military ruler convicted for subverting the Constitution. Three Pakistan Army chiefs including Gen Ayub Khan, Gen Yahya Khan and Gen Zia-ul-Haq also abrogated the Constitution but never faced any court.

The former military ruler, who has been living in Dubai since March 2016, left Pakistan for medical treatment and has not returned since, citing security and health reasons.

Dr. Muhammad Amjad, Musharraf’s close aide and the ex-chairperson of his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party, has said that the former President was rapidly becoming weaker due to an unknown disease, which is why he was unable to return to Pakistan to face the treason case.

13,2020/02/04,No takers for Indonesia’s ‘pluck a tyre off the croc’ contest,"Indonesia has called off a contest offering a cash reward to anyone brave enough to remove a motorbike tyre stuck around the neck of a giant crocodile.

Authorities in Palu, capital of Central Sulawesi, said no would-be crocodile wrangler stepped forward to take up the challenge of removing the unwanted necklace from the 13-foot (4-metre) reptile.

The contest was rolled out last month, but made headlines again last week when an unspecified reward was offered.

The local conservation agency offered few details about the reward -- or how outsiders might pull off the dangerous task -- but its chief said the money would come out of his own pocket

Conservationists who fear the croc is being slowly strangled have been trying -- and failing -- for years to find a way to untangle the beast.

Rumours circulated that popular TV personality Panji the Explorer -- Indonesia's answer to late Australian ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin -- was keen for another shot after a failed attempt two years ago.

Officials said a team from the environment ministry will now redouble efforts to free the croc from its rubber stranglehold.

""The contest has been cancelled,"" said Central Sulawesi Natural Resources Conservation Agency Head Hasmuni Hasmar.

""But we now have back up from the ministry and government experts to help us.""",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/90gniz/article30733247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDONESIA-ENVIRONMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/no-takers-for-indonesias-pluck-a-tyre-off-the-croc-contest/article30733248.ece
14,2020/02/04,"Pompeo message in Europe, Central Asia trip: beware of China","The countries Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited on a five nation-tour over the last week varied from longtime ally Britain to ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia. But the message he conveyed to his hosts stayed the same: Beware of China.

In his trip to Europe and Central Asia, Mr. Pompeo denounced China’s human rights record, criticised its aggressive trade practices and urged his hosts to be wary of Chinese investment and influence. He warned that China poses a risk as countries develop next-generation, high-speed wireless networks.

His language was blunt. The Chinese Communist Party presents the central threat of our times,” Mr. Pompeo said last week in London, just days after the European Union unveiled security guidelines for 5G wireless networks that stop short of a ban on Huawei in the latest setback for the U.S. campaign against the Chinese tech company.

Mr. Pompeo’s tough rhetoric, on a trip coinciding with the rapid spread of a new virus that originated in China and threatens global growth, underscores his preoccupation with the country and its recent diplomatic and trade victories.

His comments contrast with President Donald Trump’s more conciliatory language on China. That’s partly because Mr. Trump is working to complete a trade deal with President Xi Jinping.

When he signed the first phase of the agreement last month, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi a “very, very good friend of mine” and said he planned to visit China in the not-too-distant future.

Mr. Trump said then that he and Mr. Xi have developed an incredible relationship.” Mr. Pompeo’s comments in London, however, maintain the tough approach that he and Vice President Mike Pence have espoused about China, driven mainly by the country’s repression of Muslims and ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang Province, but also by what they say are Beijing’s predatory trade practices and development projects that they say put small and poor countries at great risk.

Mr. Pompeo’s visit to Britain came just 48 hours after the country, which is eagerly hoping to secure a massive post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S., ignored American threats and allowed Huawei to have a role in its 5G network.

The decision highlighted the limits of the Trump administration’s ability to lobby for its policies as it defied a U.S. threat to sever intelligence sharing if Huawei had any presence. U.S. officials believe that the security of information on a network that uses Huawei technology or equipment could be compromised.

The U.S. has been lobbying European allies to ban Huawei over concerns it could be compelled to help with the Chinese government with electronic eavesdropping. U.S. officials also worry that 5G networks would rely heavily on software, leaving them open to vulnerabilities, and have repeatedly warned they would have to reconsider intelligence sharing with allies that use Huawei. The company has denied the allegations.

Stung by the British move but still hoping to retain and boost the U.S.-Britain special relationship,” Mr. Pompeo appeared to step back from the threat on intelligence sharing, saying that he was certain a way could be found to avoid it.

Yet, he made clear that the Trump administration would continue to confront China on multiple fronts, including commerce, infrastructure and technology, militarily and diplomatically, even as the administration pursues a second phase of a massive deal to end a current trade war with Beijing.

We have to collectively — the West — ensure that the next century is governed by Western democratic principles, he said. And that will take a concerted effort not just by the United States but by all of those who love freedom and cherish democracy and the rule of law to ensure that that remains the predominant model for the world for the next century. In Central Asia, where three of the five nations share borders with western China, Pompeo denounced Chinese human rights abuses.

The United States urges all countries to join us in pressing for an immediate end to this repression, he said on Sunday in Kazakhstan. We ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum to those seeking to flee China; protect human dignity; just do what’s right. In Uzbekistan on Monday, Mr. Pompeo played up the benefits of Central Asia doing business with the U.S. rather than China.

They have long borders, they sit in a region where both China and Russia are present,” he said.

What we want them to do and what America is here to do is to support their capacity to make good decisions, to have transparent rule of law investments be present.”

We remind them constantly of the benefits of American investment and warn them against state-sponsored, politically driven transactions of the kind favored by China, Mr. Pompeo said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/feiul5/article30474226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POMPEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pompeo-message-in-europe-central-asia-trip-beware-of-china/article30733145.ece
15,2020/02/04,Hyundai to suspend South Korea production on China coronavirus impact,"Hyundai Motor plans to gradually suspend production at its South Korean factories from Tuesday, the first global major automaker to do so outside China, due to supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

Many global automakers including Ford, French car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen and Japan's Nissan and Honda Motor have already suspended some plants in China this week in line with Beijing's guidelines.

Most of Hyundai's South Korean factories will be fully idled from Feb. 7 to Feb. 10 or Feb. 11, a union official said, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.

Schedules for suspension will vary by production line, a spokeswoman for the automaker said.

The idling, which had been discussed by Hyundai management since Monday, was due to a shortage of auto parts called wiring harnesses, auto industry officials told Reuters earlier.

The automaker and its affiliate Kia Motors do not keep a large inventory of the parts, a majority of which are manufactured in China, said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.

“Hyundai and Kia may be more affected (than their rivals peers) as they tend to import more parts from China than other global automakers,” Mr. Lee said.

He said Hyundai's reliance on China has grown sharply as it built a huge production capacity in the country several years ago when its business was booming there.

“South Korean parts makers followed and built their own facilities along with Hyundai,” Mr. Lee added.

Hyundai Motor has seven factories in South Korea, which caters not only to the domestic market but also U.S., Europe, Middle East and other countries. Hyundai's domestic production accounts for about 40% of its global output.

16,2020/02/04,Pakistan will ‘compensate’ Malaysia by buying more palm oil after India withdraws: Imran Khan,"Pakistan will do its best to buy more palm oil from Malaysia after top buyer India put curbs on such imports last month amid a diplomatic row with the Southeast Asian nation, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday.

India has put general restrictions on refined palm oil imports and informally asked traders specifically to stop buying from Malaysia, the world's second-biggest producer and exporter of the edible oil, in retaliation for Malaysia's accusation that recent Indian policies discriminate against Muslims.

India is a Hindu-majority country while Malaysia and Pakistan are mainly Muslim. Neighbours India and Pakistan have been mostly hostile to each other since the partition of British India in 1947, and have fought two of their three wars over competing territorial claims in Kashmir.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he discussed palm oil with Mr. Khan - in Malaysia on a state visit - and that Pakistan had indicated it would import more from Malaysia.

“That's right, especially since we noticed India threatened Malaysia for supporting the Kashmir cause, threatened to cut palm oil imports,” Mr. Khan told a joint news conference, referring to India's Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.

“Pakistan will do its best to compensate for that.”

Pakistan bought 1.1 million tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia last year, while India bought 4.4 million tonnes, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council.

Strong ties

India has repeatedly objected to Mr. Mahathir speaking out against its move last year to strip Kashmir's autonomy and make it easier for non-Muslims from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to gain citizenship.

In the news conference, 94-year-old outspoken leader Mr. Mahathir did not refer to Kashmir but Mr. Khan did.

“The way you, PM, have stood with us and spoken about this injustice going on, on behalf of Pakistan I really want to thank you,” Mr. Khan said.

The former cricketer said he was sad he could not attend a summit of Muslim leaders in Malaysia in December. The summit was outside the ambit of the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and Saudi Arabia - a close ally of Pakistan - had said the gathering was “dividing” to the Islamic world.

“Unfortunately our friends, who are very close to Pakistan as well, felt that somehow the conference was going to divide the ummah,” Mr. Khan said, using the Arabic word for the Muslim community but not mentioning Saudi Arabia by name.

“It's is clearly a misconception, as that was not the purpose of the conference,” he said.

Mr. Khan also said Malaysia and Pakistan were working on a joint media project to broadcast a positive image of Islam, fight Islamophobia and develop content for young Muslims.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sxa6zv/article30606634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-PALMOILIMPORTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-will-compensate-malaysia-by-buying-more-palm-oil-after-india-withdraws-imran-khan/article30732878.ece
17,2020/02/04,Shaky start for Democrats as Iowa results are delayed,"Democrats were off to a shaky start of their internal process to pick a challenger to U.S. President Donald Trump, as the results of the Iowa Caucuses were delayed due to technical difficulties around a phone app used to tally the data. The Iowa Democratic Party said it would release results later on Tuesday.

“This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion,” spokesperson for the Iowa Democratic Party, Mandy McClure, said via a statement. “The underlying data and paper trail is found and will simply take time to further report the results.”

Although the state provides just 41 of the 1,991 delegates required to win the party’s nomination, every candidate who has won the Iowa Caucuses since Al Gore in 2000 has eventually won the Democratic nomination. The first race provides crucial momentum to its top performers through the primary season.

Candidates had spent large amounts of time and money campaigning to win in the Midwestern state but were left on Tuesday morning without concrete results, leaving some frustrated, and several others indicating they had won, as they moved on to New Hampshire, where the next contest will be held.

Several candidates claim victory

Thirty-eight-year-old Mayor from Southbend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, claimed victory after the night based on his campaign’s internal data.

“So we don’t know all the results, but we know by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious,” Mr. Buttigieg told supporters in Des Moines.

Bernie Sanders, independent senator from Vermont and progressive candidate, said he expected to do “very, very, well” when the results are announced. Mr. Sanders was leading the polls going into the caucuses.

Mr. Sanders’s team put out internal results that it claimed covered nearly 40% of the precincts showing him in first place, followed by Mr. Buttigieg, Vox reported.

General Counsel for former Vice-President Joe Biden, who was second in the polls going into the Caucuses but appears to have slipped in the ranking as per his opponents’ data, filed a complaint with the Iowa Democratic Party, citing the “acute failures” of the reporting system. Nevertheless, he told supporters he would be walking away with his share of delegates. Progressive candidate and senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren appeared optimistic.

“When I left Iowa, I said it is too close to call and it still is — but I feel good,” Ms. Warren said after landing in Manchester, New Hampshire, according to the New York Times.

Trump wins

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump won all 38 delegates in the Republican Caucuses in Iowa, as expected.

Mr. Trump won over 97% of the vote, defeating former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld and former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh, who was a member of the conservative and populist Tea Party movement and hosted a right-wing radio show.

Mr. Trump, who is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night and is all but certain to be acquitted at his impeachment trial in the Senate on Wednesday, took to Twitter on Tuesday morning calling the Democrat Caucus an “unmitigated disaster”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wwicaw/article30732869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OO6H8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sanders-claims-iowa-lead-ahead-of-buttigieg/article30732870.ece
18,2020/02/04,Coronavirus: South Korean woman tests positive after Thailand visit,"A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, South Korean officials said on February 4, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the southeast Asian nation.

The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan. 19 after traveling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.

Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan. 25, the woman did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added in a statement, and was confirmed positive on February 4.

The statement did not explicitly rule out a visit to China by the patient, and KCDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong declined to comment further.

Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Thai Department of Disease Control, said the woman could have contracted the virus in Thailand. “It's possible because the virus is already spreading domestically in Thailand,” Tanarak said.

19,2020/02/04,Kenyan president says ex-president Daniel arap Moi has died,"Daniel arap Moi, a former schoolteacher who became Kenya’s longest-serving president and presided over years of repression and economic turmoil fueled by runaway corruption, has died. He was 95.

Moi’s death was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta in a statement on the state broadcaster on Tuesday.

Moi, who ruled Kenya for 24 years, had been in hospital for over a month.

Despite being called a dictator by critics, Moi enjoyed strong support from many Kenyans and was seen as a uniting figure when he took power after founding President Jomo Kenyatta died in office in 1978. Some allies of the ailing Kenyatta, however, tried to change the constitution to prevent Moi, then the vice president, from automatically taking power upon Kenyatta’s death.

So wary was Moi of any threat during that uncertain period that he fled his Rift Valley home when he heard of Kenyatta’s death, returning only after receiving assurances of his safety.

In 1982 Moi’s government pushed through parliament a constitutional amendment that made Kenya effectively a one-party state. Later that year the army quelled a coup attempt plotted by opposition members and some air force officers. At least 159 people were killed.

Moi’s government then became more repressive in dealing with dissent, according to a report by the government’s Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission that assessed his rule.

Political activists and others who dared oppose Moi’s rule were routinely detained and tortured, the report said, noting unlawful detentions and assassinations, including the killing of a foreign affairs minister, Robert Ouko.

""The judiciary became an accomplice in the perpetuation of violations, while parliament was transformed into a puppet controlled by the heavy hand of the executive,” the report said.

Corruption, especially the illegal allocation of land, became institutionalized, the report said, while economic power was centralized in the hands of a few.

In 1991, Moi yielded to demands for a multi-party state due to internal pressure, including a demonstration in 1991 during which police killed more than 20 people, and external pressure from the West.

Multi-party elections in 1992 and 1997 were marred by political and ethnic violence that critics asserted were caused by the state.

By the time Moi left power in 2002, corruption had left Kenya’s economy, the most developed in East Africa, with negative growth.

Moi often blamed the West for bad publicity and the economic hardships many Kenyans had to endure during his rule.

As with his predecessor, Kenyatta, many government projects, buildings and currency notes and coins were named after Moi.

Fed up, Kenyans voted for a new constitution that was implemented in 2010 and made provisions to bar personality cults.

This story was corrected to show that Kenya’s president’s name is spelled Kenyatta.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/297qxz/article30732467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KENYA-MOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kenyan-president-says-ex-president-daniel-arap-moi-has-died/article30732468.ece
20,2020/02/04,Hong Kong records first virus death,"Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, the second outside mainland China from a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed 427 people and threatened the global economy.

China’s markets steadied after Shanghai’s main market lost nearly $400 billion in stock values the previous day, and global markets also recovered from a sell-off last week.

On the ground, bad news was relentless. Chinese-ruled Macau, the world’s biggest gambling hub, asked casino operators to close for two weeks to help curb the virus. And in the latest major corporate hit, Hyundai Motor was to gradually suspend production at South Korean factories because of supply chain disruptions.

Chinese authorities, meanwhile, reported a record daily jump in deaths of 64 to 425. The only other death outside mainland China was a man who died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the virtually quarantined city at the epicentre of the outbreak.

Total infections in mainland China rose to 20,438, and there have been nearly 200 cases elsewhere across 24 countries and China’s special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.

Thailand’s tally of infections jumped to 25, the highest outside China, while Singapore’s rose to 24, four of those from local contagion as opposed to visitors from China.

New cases were reported in the U.S., including a patient in California infected via someone in the same household who had been infected in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.

The outbreak did not constitute a pandemic but an epidemic with “multiple foci”, WHO director of global hazard preparedness Sylvie Briand told a news conference in Geneva. The uncertainties have spurred strong measures by some countries — offending Beijing’s communist government which has called for calm, fact-based responses instead of scaremongering.

Battling misinformation

The deluge of misinformation on social media — from a recommendation to eat more onions to a warning of spread via a video game — has led various Asian governments to hit back with arrests, fines and fake news laws, alarming free speech advocates.

At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts on social media in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to an island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan began screening some 3,700 passengers and crew aboard a cruise liner held in quarantine at the port of Yokohama, after a Hong Kong passenger who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive.

Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong, which had seen months of anti-China political protests, held a second day of strikes to press for complete closure of borders with the mainland after three checkpoints were left open.

21,2020/02/04,"Japan quarantines 3,500 on cruise ship over new coronavirus","Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,500 people and was testing passengers for the new coronavirus on Tuesday after a passenger who departed in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus.

Television footage showed images of several quarantine officers entering the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the port of Yokohama on Monday evening to check the health of all 2,500 passengers and 1,000 crew members.

The move comes after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus.

Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said on Monday that Japanese authorities would quarantine the vessel, which arrived at Yokohama Bay a day earlier than originally planned.

A woman in her twenties who was sailing with her mother on the ship told private broadcaster TBS on Tuesday that all passengers ""were asked to stay in their rooms to wait for virus tests"".

She said they had been waiting inside their room since Monday and had no word of when they would be tested as of early Tuesday.

After the ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday evening, passengers were told their departure from the area would be delayed by 24 hours, a passenger told Kyodo News agency.

The cruise ship has already been quarantined once, on Saturday at a port in Naha in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa.

But a second quarantine was organised after the man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to be infected.

Since Saturday, Japan has been barring foreign nationals who have been to Hubei in recent weeks, as well as holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei. Arrivals displaying symptoms of the new virus can also be denied entry.

A total of eight foreigners have been barred from entering so far, Suga said on Monday.

The health ministry said as of Monday that 20 people in Japan have tested positive for the new virus, of whom four showed no symptoms.

22,2020/02/04,"Seattle City Council passes resolution against CAA, NRC","The Seattle City Council, one of the most powerful city councils in the U.S., on Monday unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s recently-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Reaffirming Seattle as a welcoming city and expressing solidarity with the city’s South Asian community regardless of religion and caste, the resolution “resolves that the Seattle City Council opposes the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act in India, and finds these policies to be discriminatory to Muslims, oppressed castes, women, indigenous, and LGBT people“.

Introduced by Indian American City Council member Kshama Sawant, the resolution urges the Parliament of India to uphold the Indian Constitution by repealing the CAA, and to stop the National Register of Citizens, and take steps towards helping refugees by ratifying various UN treaties on refugees.

“Seattle City’s decision to condemn CAA should be a message to all who wish to undermine pluralism and religious freedom. They cannot peddle in hate and bigotry, and expect to have international acceptability at the same time,” said Ahsan Khan, president of Indian American Muslim Council.

23,2020/02/04,"2 women killed, child hurt in shooting at Texas dormitory","Two women were killed and a child was wounded in a shooting on Monday morning at a university dormitory in Texas, officials said.

A recommendation for students and employees to shelter in place was lifted early Monday afternoon at Texas A&M University-Commerce, and police said there appeared to be no other threats. Officials have not identified the suspected shooter.

University police Chief Bryan Vaughn said officers responding to a call at about 10-17 a.m. found two dead women in a room at Pride Rock residence hall on the campus in Commerce, about 105 km northeast of Dallas. He said a boy about 2 years old was also in the room and was taken to a hospital, where he was in stable condition.

Police Chief Vaughn did not take questions after a news conference and did not say if the women were students.

The university canceled classes after the shooting and later said classes will not resume until Thursday.

The university lifted the shelter-in-place recommendation about an hour and a half after it was announced on Twitter. But the university said that even with the lifting of the recommendation, the residence hall and the surrounding area was still blocked off due to the ongoing investigation.

The university said the student center would be available for displaced students and that counselors were available there.

Larry Cooper III, a freshman who lives in the Pride Rock residence hall, told the Dallas Morning News that he left his room Monday just before the shelter-in-place was announced. He said he was waiting in a friend’s room on the first floor of the residence hall.

""There’s police blocking the doorways, but other than that we’re all just kind of sitting in and waiting on the news to happen,” Cooper said.

24,2020/02/04,"Iowa Democrats begin caucus meetings, kicking off search for Trump election challenger","Iowa Democrats began meeting at caucus sites around the state on Monday, kicking off what could be a bruising months-long national nominating fight to choose a November election challenger to Republican U.S. President Donald Trump.

Voters poured into more than 1,600 schools, community centers and other public locations to render judgment on a field of 11 Democratic contenders led by front-runners Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, who have battled for the top in recent Iowa opinion polls.

Long lines and heavy crowds were reported in some locations, but doors to the caucus sites were supposed to close at 7 p.m. CST (0100 GMT on Tuesday), and results are expected to begin rolling in within an hour or two.

Mostly white, rural Iowa is the first test in the state-by-state battle to pick a Democratic nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 3 election. After more than a year of campaigning and more than $800 million in spending, the results in Iowa could begin to provide answers for a party desperately trying to figure out how to beat the businessman-turned-president.

Do voters want someone with appeal to centrists, independents and disaffected Republicans, like moderates Biden, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of neighboring Minnesota? Or should the party choose a candidate who energizes its liberal base and could bring out new voters, like progressives Sanders and fellow Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts?

Also read: U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

The race has been overshadowed in recent weeks, with Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar relegated to part-time campaigning in Iowa as they were forced to remain in Washington for the Senate impeachment trial of Trump. They heard closing arguments on Monday, just hours before the caucuses.

Because voters may register as late as Monday, the caucuses could draw a late surge of attendance, especially among independent voters or Republicans turned off by Trump.

At the caucus sites, voters gather in groups by candidate preference in a public display of support. If a candidate does not reach a threshold of support of 15% of voters in a caucus needed to be considered viable, that candidates' supporters are released to back another contender, leading to another round of persuasion.

Even if one candidate wins by a commanding margin in Iowa, Democrats may still lack clear answers as the race moves on to the other three early-voting states of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina later in February.

Whoever remains in the race by Super Tuesday, when 15 states and territories vote on March 3, will also confront billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is skipping the early states in favor of focusing on states rich in delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July.

Sanders, who finished in a virtual dead heat with Hillary Clinton in Iowa during his first presidential run in 2016, surged recently in many Iowa opinion polls to move just ahead of Biden.

Warren and Buttigieg remain within striking distance, and many polls show a big bloc of undecided Iowa voters, creating the potential for upsets and late surges.

Record turnout

Iowa state party officials are expecting a record turnout, exceeding the nearly 240,000 voters who attended the caucuses in 2008 amid the excitement over Barack Obama's first presidential candidacy. During final rallies across the state, all the contenders made their cases for why they would be the best choice to beat Trump.

Biden touted his experience after decades in elected office, most notably a track record of achieving progressive goals through bipartisan relationships with lawmakers.

“He is scared to death to run against me, and he has good reason to be concerned,” Biden said of Trump during a rally in Muscatine, Iowa. Accompanied by his wife Jill, Biden greeted supporters and said he was “feeling good” as he delivered pizza to volunteers at a field office in Des Moines on Monday.

Sanders has shrugged off a barrage of attacks from rivals who warn the self-identified democratic socialist would doom the party to defeat against Trump, pointing to polls that show him beating the president.

Warren, who has been slipping in polls, portrayed herself as the candidate who could bring the party together. She also made explicit appeals to women voters.

Buttigieg promised to usher in a new era of optimism in politics and cast himself as an outsider who has not taken part in Washington's gridlock and is attracting bipartisan support.

“Were seeing folks come out of the woodwork. Not just diehard Democrats, but some more independent-minded folks, disaffected Republicans looking for a change, wanting to turn the page,” Buttigieg told Fox News Channel on Monday.

Minnesota's Klobuchar may have the most to lose in neighboring Iowa, where she has spent most of her campaign time and resources, but said she could win conservative areas that Trump captured in 2016.

Republicans were also to hold Iowa caucuses on Monday but Trump, who has around 90% support in his party, faces very little threat from two challengers.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z1mppy/article30732001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020IOWACAUCUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iowa-democrats-begin-caucus-meetings-kicking-off-search-for-trump-election-challenger/article30732004.ece
25,2020/02/04,Coronavirus | Hong Kong reports first death; death toll in China rises to 425,"Hong Kong has reported its first death from a new virus in a 39-year-old man who traveled from mainland the China epicenter of the outbreak.

The man who died was the 13th confirmed case in Hong Kong and just the second to succumb to the illness outside mainland China.

Toll rises in China

China said Tuesday the number of infections from a new virus surpassed 20,000 as medical workers and patients arrived at a new hospital and President Xi Jinping said “we have launched a people’s war of prevention of the epidemic.”

Xi presided over a special meeting of the top Communist Party body for the second time since the crisis started, telling the Politburo standing committee on Monday the country must race against time to curb the spread of the virus. He also said those who neglect their duties will be punished, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

The mainland’s latest figures of 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed infections with the new coronavirus were up from 361 deaths and 17,205 cases the previous day. Outside mainland China, at least 180 cases have been confirmed, including one fatality, in the Philippines.

Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country. A plane carrying Malaysians from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province where the illness has been concentrated, arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday morning, and the 133 people on board were to be screened and quarantined for 14 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus.

Medical teams from the People’s Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to staff the new 1,000-bed hospital. It was built in just 10 days, its prefabricated wards equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems.

A 1,500-bed hospital also specially built for patients infected with the new virus is due to open within days.

With no end to the outbreak in sight, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, due to end this week, well into February to try to keep people at home and reduce the spread of the virus. All Hubei schools are postponing the start of the new semester until further notice.

Chinese scientists said they have more evidence the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan in December, likely originated in bats. In a study published in the journal Nature, Shi Zhen-Li and colleagues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported that genome sequences from seven patients were 96% identical to a bat coronavirus.

SARS is also believed to have originated in bats, although it jumped to civet cats before infecting people. Scientists suspect the latest outbreak began at a seafood market in Wuhan where wild animals were on sale and in contact with people.

The World Health Organization last week declared the virus a global health emergency and expressed concern about how it was spreading in other countries, beyond those who were Chinese or who had traveled in Hubei recently.

On Tuesday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 42-year-old South Korean woman tested positive for the virus, days after she returned from a trip to Thailand with chills and other symptoms.

It is South Korea’s 16th case. Thailand has confirmed 19 cases, mostly Chinese tourists but also in a Thai taxi driver.

A passenger on a Japanese-operated cruise ship tested positive after leaving the vessel while it was in Hong Kong, and Japanese officials were considering a quarantine of the more than 3,000 people on board.

The Diamond Princess returned to Yokohama after making port calls in Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. A team of quarantine officials and medical staff boarded the ship Monday and began medical checks of everyone on board, a health ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with department rules.

The ship’s captain said Hong Kong’s health authorities notified the ship about the passenger’s infection on Saturday, according to a recording of the announcement tweeted by a passenger. The patient is recovering, and his traveling companions so far have not been infected, the captain’s announcement said.

""I wish we were informed as soon as they found out, then I could have worn a mask or washed hands more carefully,” the passenger said. “I was in Hong Kong nine days ago and it seems to be too late now.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vuj8nz/article30731995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OO3ZN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-death-toll-in-china-rises-to-425/article30731996.ece
26,2020/02/04,Denmark arrests three Iranians on spying charges,"Denmark said on Monday it had arrested three leading members of an Iranian Arab opposition group on suspicion of spying for Saudi Arabia.

Danish security service chief Finn Borch Andersen said Monday that the suspected spying took place for six years from 2012.

Borch Andersen said the three individuals had spied on people and companies and that the information was sent to an unnamed Saudi intelligence service.

An unnamed Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent was arrested on October 21, 2018 on suspicion of helping an unspecified Iranian intelligence service “to act in Denmark” and of alleged involvement in the assassination plot. That suspect has denied wrongdoing and is being held in custody.

The three members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) had already been charged by Danish police for supporting an attack in Iran in 2018.

“It is the view of PET (The Danish Security and Intelligence Service) that the three people, in the period from 2012 to 2018, have been spying for a Saudi Arabian intelligence service,” PET chief Finn Borch Andersen told reporters. The three Iranians have been under close police protection and One of them was the subject of a 2018 assassination plot that was prevented by security officials after a major police operation.

In 2017, Ahmad Mola Nissi, an Iranian exile who established ASMLA, was shot dead in the Netherlands. A Norwegian citizen of Iranian background, who was held in connection with the plot in October 2018, was still under arrest. In addition, it said it had on Monday arrested in absentia a member of the Iranian intelligence service on suspicion of espionage and complicity in the 2018 murder attempt.

The Iranian government has previously denied any connection with the alleged plot. ASMLA seeks a separate state for ethnic Arabs in Iran's oil-producing southwestern province of Khuzestan. Arabs are a minority in Iran, and some see themselves as under Persian occupation and want independence or autonomy.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/denmark-arrests-three-iranians-on-spying-charges/article30728688.ece
27,2020/02/04,Trump impeachment trial to resume for final arguments,"President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial resumes for final arguments on Monday before an expected acquittal later in the week that Democrats have said will be invalid because no witnesses testified.

The President was impeached in December for abuse of power over pressure on U.S. ally Ukraine to announce investigations that would have helped him politically, including into Joe Biden, a leading challenger for this year's presidential ballot.

Mr. Biden is among the candidates Monday in the Iowa caucuses that choose the state's Democratic nominee and mark the official start of election season.

The selection process in largely rural Iowa, coinciding with final impeachment arguments in Washington, will be closely watched as a sign as to which of 11 Democratic candidates are gaining early momentum to challenge Trump in November's election.

At only the third impeachment trial of a U.S. President, Mr. Trump is all but assured of being acquitted on Wednesday, the day after his annual “State of the Union”.

Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate to 47 for the Democrats, but a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is needed to remove him from office.

Adam Schiff, the leader of the House prosecutors, known as impeachment managers, told CBS on Sunday that it was “pretty remarkable” that Senators on both sides had acknowledged that Democrats proved their case against the President.

“But I'm not letting the senators off the hook. We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed. It will be up to the senators to make that final judgment, and the senators will be held accountable for it.”

Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Joni Ernst on Sunday said Trump's behavior was troubling but not impeachable.

Alexander, of Tennessee, suggested Trump had been naive in asking a foreign ally to look into Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine, which Republicans have claimed without evidence were corrupt.

But he added: “The bottom line: it's not an excuse. He shouldn't have done it.”

Just two Republicans

Ernst said it was “up to the American people” to decide on Trump's behavior, adding that she would vote Wednesday to acquit the president.

“I think generally speaking, going after corruption is the right thing to do, but he did it in the wrong manner... I think that he could have done it in different channels,” she told CNN.

Trump is also accused of obstruction of Congress for ordering officials not to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry.

On Friday, just two Republicans -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine -- joined Democrats in voting to introduce witnesses, a practice they said was followed at every other impeachment trial in US history.

‘Wrong manner’

A narrow majority of Americans believe Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress by withholding documents and testimony during the impeachment inquiry, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll.

But they remain divided on whether he should be kicked from office, with 46 percent hoping to see him removed and 49 percent saying he should keep his job.

Democrats had been eager to hear from Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other key administration figures caught up in the scandal.

Bolton reportedly says in a forthcoming book that Trump told him military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev's investigating Biden -- corroborating the central claim against the president.

After the failure to call witnesses, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the chamber “did not live up to its responsibilities, turned away from truth and instead went along with a sham trial.”

Four contenders for the Democratic nomination -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- are required to be back in Washington Monday at the impeachment trial even as the Iowa caucuses take place.

“The Senate is the jury today but we are the jury tomorrow,” Pete Buttigieg, who is running third in Iowa, told CNN.

“And we get to send a message at the ballot box that cheating, lying, involving a foreign country in our own domestic politics, not to mention abuse of power more broadly and bad administration, that that's not okay, that we can do better,” he said.

Trump, though, on Sunday complained again, in a Fox News interview that he has been treated unfairly “from the day I won.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-impeachment-trial-to-resume-for-final-arguments/article30728666.ece
28,2020/02/04,China says it urgently needs protective suits and masks,"China said on Monday it urgently needed medical equipment and surgical masks as the death toll from a new coronavirus jumped above 360, making it more deadly than the SARS crisis nearly two decades ago.

The 57 new deaths confirmed on Monday was the single-biggest daily increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans.

Reported in 24 countries

The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on arrivals coming from China.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first foreign death from the virus was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday.

“What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a press briefing.

Authorities in provinces that are home to more than 300 million people — including Guangdong, the country’s most populous — have ordered everyone to wear masks in public in an effort to contain the virus.

But factories capable of producing around 20 million masks a day are only operating at between 60 and 70% of capacity, industry department spokesman Tian Yulong said, adding that supply and demand remained in “tight equilibrium” as a result of the Lunar New Year break.

Mr. Tian said authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the U.S., while the Foreign Ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies.

All but one of the 57 new deaths reported on Monday were in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks.

Exceeds SARS fatalities

The national death toll reached 361 — exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.

The number of infections also jumped significantly, passing 17,200.

SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people — with most other deaths in Hong Kong.

The virus is taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses across China, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands.

The Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight percent Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday as investors played catch-up with last week’s global retreat.

China accused the U.S. on Monday of spreading “panic” in its response to the deadly coronavirus, including imposing a ban on Chinese travellers.

The U.S. “hasn't provided any substantial assistance” and has only created “panic”, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing.

Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders, while semi-autonomous Hong Kong announced Monday it was closing all but two land crossings.

Also on Monday the Cruise Lines International Association, that represents some of the world’s largest operators, said vessels will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China.

Last week over 6,000 passengers spent around 12 hours in lockdown on the Costa Smeralda cruise ship in an Italian port until two Chinese tourists feared to have the virus tested negative.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2s16mu/article30728625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-virus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-says-it-urgently-needs-protective-suits-and-masks/article30728626.ece
29,2020/02/04,"Two dead, one wounded in shooting at Texas university campus","Two women were killed and a toddler was wounded on Monday in a shooting at a residence hall on the Texas A&M University campus in Commerce, authorities said.

The wounded toddler, a boy about 2 years old, was in stable condition at a local hospital, Texas A&M-Commerce Police Chief Bryan Vaughn said in a briefing. He provided no more information about the women or the child.

The three victims were found by officers responding to a phone call by a student at 10:17 a.m., he said.

Earlier, the university said in a statement that police were actively investigating three gunshot victims at the residence.

Officials at the campus, located about 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Dallas, did not respond to a request for further comment.

The shooting is the latest in a wave of gun violence on U.S. college and high school campuses in recent years. The bloodshed has fueled the debate over tighter restrictions on access to guns in the United States, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.

In October, two people were killed and about a dozen more were wounded at an off-campus Halloween party near the campus, part of the statewide Texas A&M University system. Many of the 750 people at the party were students, authorities said at the time.

“My son is safe today but tired of the nonsense on this campus!” a Facebook user named Yolanda Temple posted after Monday's shooting at the campus, where 12,000 students take classes.

Students and staff were initially told to shelter in place, but campus police later lifted the order. Classes were canceled for the rest of Monday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-dead-one-wounded-in-shooting-at-texas-university-campus/article30730934.ece
30,2020/02/04,"One dead, five wounded in shooting on Greyhound bus in California","A man cursing and muttering incoherently opened fire aboard a packed Greyhound bus in Southern California early Monday, killing one person and wounding five others in a seemingly random attack before passengers disarmed him, authorities and a witness said.

The driver of the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bus pulled off onto the shoulder, where some of those aboard led the killer off the vehicle, and he was quickly taken into custody, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Brian Pennings said. The driver continued on to the next exit as passengers performed first aid on the wounded, he said.

The motive for the shooting was not immediately known, and there was no indication the gunman knew any of the victims, Sgt. Pennings said. He said several ammunition magazines were discovered along with the gun.

The bus was traveling on Interstate 5 near the small mountain community of Lebec, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, when the passenger started shooting with a semi-automatic handgun shortly before 1-30 a.m. Forty-three people were aboard, including 6- and 8-year-old children, who were not hurt.

The dead passenger was identified as a 51-year-old woman from Colombia. Two victims were hospitalized with serious injuries, Sgt. Pennings said.

Passenger Mark Grabban, 29, told that the gunman had been sitting with his leg sticking out into the aisle, muttering to himself incoherently.

""He was just saying weird stuff like ‘you don’t know me like that,’ ‘wait til we get to the station,’ ‘get away from the dude in the striped shirt,’ ” Mr. Grabban said in a series of Instagram messages.

Suddenly, the man started cursing and shooting, Mr. Grabban said. Mr. Grabban hid beneath the seat in front of him. He said the gunman seemed to fire eight or nine shots that “seemed to go on forever.” He added- “I was waiting for one to hit me.”

""I thought I was shot because I felt a rush of heat on the back of my head as I went down,” he said. “But I guess I just smashed my head on the seat as I went down to the floor.”

Then, silence fell. The injured passengers began moaning, and others started panicking. It was dark outside and they couldn’t see what the gunman was doing after he got off the bus. Mr. Grabban said the driver of the stopped vehicle asked over the loudspeaker if anyone had been hurt and did not immediately pull away. “Everyone was screaming at him to drive off,” Mr. Grabban said.

Sgt. Pennings said the driver’s actions “were very appropriate and one could say heroic.” The officer gave no immediate details on how the passengers disarmed the killer or made him get off the bus.

No immediate charges were brought against the the suspect, whose name was not released.

Mr. Grabban, who was sitting near the back of the bus with his girlfriend, picked up the gun’s empty magazine clip and handed it to the driver. A casing ended up on Mr. Grabban’s lap, he told NBC News.

""I saw the blood on the floor of the aisle,” Mr. Grabban told the network. “I looked to the woman on the left, and she wasn’t responding, wasn’t moving or anything. She was lifeless.”

Authorities were looking into whether a video camera aboard the vehicle captured the attack, which happened when the bus was at the top of Tejon Pass. It rises to an elevation of more than 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) in Lebec.

Greyhound prohibits passengers from bringing guns, explosives or dangerous chemicals on board its buses or in their luggage, according to its website.

31,2020/02/04,Anti-CAA protest held at UN headquarters in Geneva,"Indian community across Europe came together and held a peaceful protest outside the UN headquarters in Geneva on February 1. Despite inclement weather, they held banners, sang songs and recited poetry to register their opposition against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), according to a press release.

Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan spoke to the people gathered there via a live call-in facility and Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekar Azad’s audio message was then later played at the protest.

In his statement, Chandrashekhar Azad said, “In India, black laws like the CAA are being passed as an attempt to turn Dalits, Adivasis, Backward Classes, Muslims, and other minorities into second-class citizens. It is an attempt to deprive them of their constitutional rights, to make them slaves in their own country. This law is discriminatory and violates our fundamental right — the right to equality. To everyone at the UN, to Indians all over the world, to all citizens who ask for and believe in social justice, I appeal to you, keeping Baba saheb’s liberty, equality and fraternity in mind, raise your voice against this black law.”

The new features will include access for parents to see their children’s chat history and will allow them to keep a track of the accounts, which are blocked or unblocked on the application, the company said.

Parents can also see the most recent photos or videos sent and received in the app’s inbox, and can remove them if needed, Facebook added.

In August, Facebook acknowledged a flaw it fixed in Messenger Kids that allowed thousands of children to join group chats in which not all members of the group were approved by their parents.

Facebook has been under scrutiny by multiple governments over child safety protections on its suite of apps, especially since announcing its plan to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging services last year.

Lawmakers warn strong encryption blocks them from accessing evidence of child abuse, protecting predators.

Facebook has not said whether Messenger Kids will be included in the encryption plan.

Houston co-founded Dropbox in 2007 with Arash Ferdowsi. He has led the company’s growth from a simple idea to a service used by over 600 million people around the world.

Today, the company is one of the world’s leading business collaboration platforms with 14 million paying subscribers and 2,300 employees across 12 global offices.

Facebook has undergone various board changes in the recent past.

In April last year, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings left Facebook’s board after serving on it for eight years.

The social networking giant then added Paypal’s senior vice president of core markets Peggy Alford, who became the first African-American woman to serve on its board.

Facebook’s current board members are: Mark Zuckerberg; Peggy Alford, Senior Vice President, Core Markets of PayPal Holdings, Inc; Marc L. Andreessen, Andreessen Horowitz; Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and Managing Director, General Catalyst; Drew Houston, Co—Founder and CEO, Dropbox; Sheryl K. Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook; Peter A.

38,2020/02/04,Twitter says state-backed actors may have accessed users’ phone numbers,"Twitter said on Monday that it had discovered attempts by possible state actors to access the phone numbers associated with user accounts, after a security researcher unearthed a flaw in the company’s “contacts upload” feature.

In a statement published on its privacy blog, Twitter said it had identified a “high volume of requests” to use the feature coming from IP addresses in Iran, Israel and Malaysia. It said, without elaborating, that “some of these IP addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors.”

A company spokeswoman declined to say how many user phone numbers had been exposed, saying Twitter was unable to identify all of the accounts that may have been impacted.

She said Twitter suspected a possible connection to state-backed actors because the attackers in Iran appeared to have had unrestricted access to Twitter, even though the network is banned there.

Tech publication TechCrunch reported that a security researcher, Ibrahim Balic, had managed to match 17 million phone numbers to specific Twitter user accounts by exploiting a flaw in the contacts feature of its Android app. TechCrunch said it was able to identify a senior Israeli politician by matching a phone number through the tool.

The feature, which allows people with a user’s phone number to find and connect with that user on Twitter, is off by default for users in the European Union where stringent privacy rules are in place. It is switched on by default for all other users globally, the spokeswoman said.

Twitter said in its statement that it has changed the feature so it no longer reveals specific account names in response to requests. It has also suspended any accounts believed to have been abusing the tool.

However, the company is not sending individual notifications to users whose phone numbers were accessed in the data leak, which information security experts consider a best practice.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/45mx2r/article30732452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04NETTWITTER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/twitter-says-state-backed-actors-may-have-accessed-users-phone-numbers/article30732453.ece
39,2020/02/04,"Alphabet shares fall as Google misses on sales, YouTube revenue disappoints","Alphabet Inc’s new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai unveiled sales figures that investors have long demanded, but shares fell 5% as Google’s advertising business and the new data about YouTube and Google Cloud broadly disappointed.

Pichai had sought to counter slowing revenue growth in the company’s main advertising business by pointing to the Silicon Valley firm’s younger units.

But Pichai’s reveal that Google’s YouTube video-streaming unit is generating ad revenue at a pace of $15 billion annually put it below rough estimates as high as $25 billion.

Divulging 53% quarterly revenue growth for Google’s cloud services compared with a year ago meant it grew slower than the business it is trying to catch up to, Microsoft Corp’s Azure. It reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39% when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units.

While financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20% in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years.

Alphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks.

“We continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,” Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. “But there will be variability over time because we’re very focused on what’s in the right long-term interest.”

Shares of the company fell about 4.5% in extended trading to $1,416.

“The stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “YouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloud less so at $8.9 billion.”

Other financial analysts said YouTube’s ad revenue was underwhelming too.

“YouTube is smaller than generally assumed, but on the flip side, search seems to have accelerated and is growing faster than feared,” said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.

Google through its namesake search engine as well as properties such as YouTube has been the web’s biggest draw for advertisers for a decade, enabling it last month to become the fourth listed company to top $1 trillion in market capitalisation.

But new concerns have emerged among investors about whether its dominance will last as U.S. antitrust regulators investigate Google and as Amazon and Facebook Inc continue to grow their ads businesses globally. Both beat analysts’ expectations last week.

Alphabet’s overall sales in the fourth quarter were $46.08 billion, up 17%, compared with an average estimate of $46.94 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv.

Google ad sales in the holiday shopping quarter were $37.93 billion, up 16.7% from the same period last year

Alphabet’s expenses have ballooned with hiring of thousands of salespeople, building of new data centres and marketing the Google brand through hardware and other ventures.

For the fourth quarter, Alphabet’s total costs and expenses rose 18.5% from a year ago to $36.809 billion.

Porat said hiring and infrastructure spending would accelerate in 2020.

Alphabet’s fourth-quarter profit was $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per share, compared with the analysts’ average estimate of $8.787 billion, or $12.53 per share.

Hardware sales fell in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, Porat said. Results could suffer further from any protracted work stoppages in Asia as companies combat the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, she said.

Google last week temporarily shut down all its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan due to the coronavirus. It has thousands of engineers across the region, including a hardware engineering center in Taiwan.

YouTube Premiere

In December, Google CEO Pichai gained the additional role of Alphabet CEO from Larry Page as he and fellow co-founder Sergey Brin stepped back even further from day-to-day management.

The new YouTube disclosures under Pichai showed ad revenue grew 31% compared with last year.

Pichai also said YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users, generated about $750 million in subscription and other non-advertising revenue, but did not reveal a figure for the year-earlier period.

Pichai said YouTube had 20 million paid subscribers between YouTube’s Music and Premium ad-free viewing packages, and separately had 2 million paid subscribers for YouTube TV, which competes with Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV and Walt Disney Co’s Hulu to stream television online.

Amazon recently said it has 55 million music subscribers, while Apple Inc last year announced 60 million such subscribers. Sling had about 2.7 million subscribers as of last year, in line with estimates for Hulu.

Shares of Alphabet were up 28.1% in the last 12 months entering Monday, compared with 21.8% for Facebook shares, 23.5% for Amazon, 68.1% for Microsoft and 88.7% for Apple Inc.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/j479y3/article30732434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04NETSUNDARPICHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/alphabet-shares-fall-as-google-misses-on-sales-youtube-revenue-disappoints/article30732435.ece
40,2020/02/04,Man causes virtual traffic jam on Google Maps with 99 phones,"Call it bizarre but a German artist, Simon Weckert, has posted a video on YouTube, showing how he “hacked” Google Maps with 99 smartphones and a wagon to create “virtual traffic jams” on the streets of Berlin.

Weckert put 99 smartphones with Google Maps on into a small wagon cart and then wheeled that cart around various streets in Berlin, including outside the Google office, Android Authority reported on Monday.

The smartphones “apparently fooled Google Maps” into thinking that there was a high concentration of users on those streets.

Because the second-hand phones were in a cart, Maps was further tricked into believing that the traffic was slow-moving.

As a result, the navigation app started showing virtual traffic jams by turning green streets to red in the online navigational tool, showcasing how digital technology can have a real impact on the real world.

Basically, Google Maps’ servers interpreted the situation as traffic congestion, and began showing this to others on the street. This, in turn, prompted drivers to turn away and avoid streets where there was actually no traffic.

Google was yet to officially comment on Weckert’s experiment.

“I work for Google Maps and I know quite a bit about how this works. I believe this is possible,” tweeted a senior software engineer for Google Maps.

With its geo tools, Google has created a platform that allows users and businesses to interact with maps in a novel way, well, unless Weckert aims to play around it.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/cpcaat/article30732371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04NETGOOGLEMAPS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/man-causes-virtual-traffic-jam-on-google-maps-with-99-phones/article30732372.ece
41,2020/02/04,Nominal GDP growth projections ambitious given structural challenges: Moody’s,"Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday said economic growth projections made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2020-21 appear ambitious given the structural and cyclical challenges facing the Indian economy.

The Budget expects nominal GDP growth of 10% in the next fiscal , followed by 12.6% and 12.8% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.

“These forecasts appear ambitious given the combination of structural and cyclical challenges that the Indian economy faces,” it said.

Even before the significant slowing in economic expansion in 2019, nominal GDP growth had averaged about 11% over the five years from 2014 to 2018.

“We expect the economy to rebound at a more modest pace, with nominal GDP growth rising to around 8.7% in fiscal 2020 and 10.5% in fiscal 2021, from about 7.5% in fiscal 2019,” it said.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/nominal-gdp-growth-projections-ambitious-given-structural-challenges-moodys/article30734099.ece

43,2020/02/04,"Govt. fund will catalyse investment in infrastructure, says Expenditure Secy Somanathan","The government is striving to push spending into the most productive uses to spur the economy without becoming fiscally imprudent and has projected receipts and expenses in as realistic a manner as possible, Expenditure Secretary T.V. Somanathan said, detailing the Budget’s provision.

For the coming year, we're looking at expenditure to GDP ratio going up by nearly 0.33%. While this is significant, some analysts compare it to this year's performance, where you have an actual 0.43% actual fall in spending…

The projections that we have given for the coming year are are our best case estimates. It's neither the most optimistic case nor the most pessimistic case. It's our most probable case. We have actually tried to be as realistic as possible.

Expenditure estimates obviously have a link with revenue estimates. There is a 10% nominal growth assumption, which I think is eminently reasonable, and a 12% revenue growth is very likely in a normal year, if there are no structural changes like the corporate tax changes that were made in the middle of this year. So we have projected approximately 11%-plus expenditure growth, with capital expenditure growing by nearly twice that. The idea is to husband the available sources and push it into the most productive uses, use it for growth-inducing as much as possible.

Click here to read the full Budget speech

But all of this is done with a background of staying fiscally prudent, because we don't want a repeat of a cycle where you suddenly break all the barriers, then two years later, you have a crisis where you suddenly have to roll everything back. So we pushed expenditure to the limits that it can be pushed without being imprudent.

How do we push capex in particular?

By reprioritising and changing from low value add schemes to more of capital expenditure and even within those, (projects) with high-multiplier (effect). That's the direction we would like to go. These are tasks which take time to do and quite a lot of analysis. It's not something that can be done overnight or at the press of a button, but we intend to look at them very carefully.

Some sectors like infrastructure, we talked about a lot of spending in terms of the new projects. But the allocations seem very modest.

The national infrastructure pipeline that the FM unveiled on 31st December is ₹102 lakh crore - with the central government, States and the private sector expected to chip in. As far as the central sector projects are concerned — nuclear power, railways, highways — we have provided very reasonable provisions for those.

In addition, there is a provision under the Department of Economic Affairs which will create a fund to catalyse private investment in infrastructure. The amount is approximately ₹20,000 crore. It’s the government's seed contribution or catalyst which can also be augmented, if the offtake is good. The exact manner in which it will be used is being decided. It could be PPP, it could be others, but it's basically a funding mechanism that has been created.

Also Read Data | Markets not enthused about Budget 2020

When you look at some of the infrastructure projects, they will be viable with market borrowing and a little bit of government equity or a viability gap fund. It is the amount of money that is needed from the public exchequer to induce people to invest both equity and debt into the projects.

We heard a lot about new schemes in the Budget, but it also mentioned rationilising central sector schemes.

We are quite serious about doing that. We intend to look at them quite carefully, to see which are the schemes that may have outlived their use, schemes designed for yesterday, which are not relevant for tomorrow, which we can now reprioritise and use more productively for higher value-add.

With regard to the interim report of the Fifteenth Finance Commission, the one thing you have rejected is the Special grants to States. What is the thinking behind that?

There has never previously been a special grant. So it is something new and we need more time to consider its logic, its implications. The Commission has chosen a certain formula. Whatever that formula has implied, has been provided for. They've assessed revenue deficit grants, that's also been provided for. Beyond that, there are a couple of new things. The report was received shortly before the Budget preparation. We just need more time to look at the implications and to discuss them with the Commission.

The Finance Commission is also likely to propose measurable performance-based incentives for States for some grants, and you have been going down that road of linking performance to allocations for some centrally sponsored schemes as well. Is that a specific strategy?

There is a move towards incentivising those states which are better at performing towards the objectives of a scheme. So if a state does well, it should look to get something more for having done well. And if some state is not progressing, then it is perhaps desirable in the interest of the overall attainment of the mission to redirect money towards others. In many cases, it does work well. Smart cities for instance, if a state government is not interested, you cannot get a smart city built. If a state wants to use the money, then they apply.

There could be exceptions where some universal minimum needs are involved. So we don't do that for food security. But certain kinds of developmental projects don't succeed without deep state level or local level commitment. Evaluation studies have shown that you can push, but if there's no pull from the other side, it's not a good use of public money. It's better to direct that money to something else. Otherwise, you announce a scheme and then it takes five years for someone to decide where in the State that should go, because they've not asked for it. And then the money gets locked up and can’t be used for anything else. There are many States that are actually good at using centrally sponsored schemes. And often, they don't get the opportunity of getting more, even though they've done well.

This year, you have given strict instructions to ministries that they should avoid the usual bunching up that happens in the last two months. So is there some change in the spending plan?

No. The revised estimates for this year are explicitly and avowedly lower than the budget estimates for this year. But there is no further cut from the revised estimates, except that we have asked Ministries to stick to the quarterly pattern of expenditure, stick to 25% in the last quarter. Any exceptions to that will require the authorisation of the expenditure department. Otherwise, there tends to be a lot of low value spending in the last quarter, because otherwise it lapses. These instructions are intended to ensure that does not happen. Because we are tight, and we want the spending to be productive. Wherever there is a valid case to go beyond that 25% on something that is productive, we will look at this, but they'll have to come to Expenditure department. It's not a right.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/2em7e4/article30729943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOMANATHAN-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2020-expenditure-secretary-tv-somanathan-interview/article30729851.ece
44,2020/02/04,"Will not splurge to end slowdown, says Nirmala Sitharaman","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday asserted that the government was not going to repeat past mistakes and try to splurge its way out of the economic slowdown, in an apparent reference to the UPA government’s response to the major slowdown in 2008-09.

Speaking at a meeting of the FICCI’s national executive committee, the Minister said the NDA government is willing to spend to pump prime the economy, but stressed that it “shall not repeat the mistakes of the splurging.”

The money that is being spent now will be spent with a clear picture of public asset creation — such assets being that bring greater connectivity, Ms Sitharaman said, adding. “We are showing where the money raised will go so that you can plan your investment.”

Responding to speculation that the fiscal deficit could cross 4% or 5% of the GDP, the Minister said, “I want to tell you that the experiences of the last time that India had a real tough economic situation and the call taken at that time, and post that call, the fiscal deficit number was touched by the government then.”

Alluding perhaps to the 2009-10 budget , when the fiscal deficit target was raised to 6.7% of GDP given the sharp growth slowdown triggered by the global financial crisis, she said: “The splurging with which the economy was expected to reach a better level and rise from the bottom it had reached, are all fresh in our mind.”

After the effects of the 2009-10 fiscal stimulus wore off, growth had plunged sharply again over 2011 and 2012.

When asked why the stockmarkets were not happy on Budget day, the Finance Minister said: “But I see it being happy today. It was weekend mode then, Monday is the true working mode.”

After a sharp 988 point fall during Saturday’s trading, the Sensex gained a modest 136.7 points or 0.3% on Monday.

Defending the move to cap employer’s contributions to Employees’ Provident Fund, the National Pension System or a superannuation fund at ₹7.5 lakh a year, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said this will only affect those earning over ₹60 lakh a year.

“In the U.S., they have a 401 (K) account, where also I think there’s a limit to how much employer can contribute. It is being done in many parts of the world and we have tried to see up to what limit,” he said.

Having no limit on EPF contributions, he pointed out, allowed some scope for reducing one’s tax dues by restructuring the salary into various components in such a way that the EPF/NPS component could be hiked. “Therefore, this is not something very unusual that we have done,” he underlined.

The Budget has not factored in the receipt of telecom firms’ dues on account of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), Atanu Chakraborty, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, in the Finance Ministry clarified. The government has pegged receipts from the telecom sector at ₹1.33 lakh crore for 2020-21, more than double the ₹58,686 crore expected this year.

The expo is expected to see the conclusion of several cooperative agreements between Indian and foreign companies to manufacture defence equipment and components in India.

Key role

“Our target is to make India a $5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 and the defence sector will play a major role in that… We are working to make India a defence manufacturing hub and the Defexpo 2020 will help in that,” Mr. Singh said addressing the curtain raiser to the event. He said the Defexpo provided a platform to work with U.S., Russia and South Korea and other countries to build India’s defence capabilities.

In this regard, several agreements are expected between Indian and Russian companies for term supply of spares and components. This flows from an India and Russia agreement for long term supply of spares in India for Russian military platform with Indian military. The agreements are expected on the sidelines of the fifth India Russia Military Industry Conference to be held on February 6. Over 100 Russian and over 200 Indian industry leaders are expected to participate in that. In addition, some progressive announcements are expected on Ka-226T helicopters and AK-203 deals which are very big deals with ‘Make in India’ through technology transfer and in advanced stages on conclusion.

Sharing of info

Agreements are also expected between Indian and U.S. companies following the conclusion of the Industrial Security Annex (ISA) recently which allows sharing of classified information by U.S. companies with Indian industry.

The 11th edition of Defexpo is scheduled to be held from February 5 to 9 which will see participation of over 60 countries and 40 Ministers apart from service chiefs and senior officials. In all, over 1,000 companies have registered for participation in the expo, which has substantially gone up from 702 companies in Defexpo 2018 in Chennai. These include 856 Indian companies and 172 foreign companies. The exhibition area has gone up from 27,000 square metres in 2018 to 53,000 sq m this year. The expo is scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

An India-Africa Defence Ministers conclave is scheduled on February 6 in which over 30 countries are expected to take part. Over 24 Defence Ministers have indicated willingness to participate and 14 Ministers have confirmed participation so far.

China not to attend

However, a Chinese delegation, which confirmed its participation, cancelled its participation in the last minute following India’s decision to cancel all e-visas from China due to the scare of coronavirus.

The Ministry had announced two defence industrial corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.

Speaking at the curtain raiser, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said his government had identified six nodes for the corridor which include Lucknow, Kanpur, Chitrakoot, Jhansi and Agra.

Assam published the final NRC on August 31 last year where more than 19 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants were excluded. As per Rules, those excluded can challenge the exclusion with the Foreigners Tribunals, a process that has not begun yet.

Such experiments have proven to be successes in the last 25 years and even government think-tank Niti Aayog has taken note of the proposal and come out with draft guidelines, he said during Question Hour.

The Minister asserted that the step is permitted under Sector 2(5) of the Medical Council of India (MCI) Act 1999 and made it clear that was not being done to promote the private sector.

Responding to a supplementary query, the Health Minister said: “We will offer district hospitals to the private sector without compromising on the interest of patients.”

The Niti Aayog has come out with draft norms to link existing private medial colleges with district hospitals through viability gap funding, as announced in the Budget 2020-21 for aspirational districts, he added.

The Minister also disagreed with a CPI member’s view that the entry of the private sector into medical education was eroding the quality of education.

“Some of the best medical colleges in the country are of international repute and providing better services,” he added.

The government said the Clause 2(5) of the MCI’s Establishment of Medical College Regulations, 1999, prescribes that the appropriate government may allow utilisation of facilities of a hospital owned and managed by it for establishing a medical college by a person/agency /trust/society/company by entering into a Memorandum of Understanding for this purpose.

The Minister said that the hospital to be linked would be of minimum 300 beds with necessary infrastructural facilities capable of being developed into teaching institution for the proposed medical college.

Responding to a separate query on dialysis for poor patients, the Health Minister said dialysis services are provided at district hospitals for management of chronic kidney diseases under the Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP).

Dialysis services under PMNDP are provided free of cost to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients. In Andhra Pradesh, the programme has been implemented in all 13 districts with 35 centres, he said.

As per Central government norms, there is no provision of pension for BPL dialysis patients.

On December 16, 2012, the paramedical student was gang-raped and brutally assaulted by six men in a private bus and thrown out of the moving vehicle along with her male friend. The victim later succumbed to injuries.

Death sentence

All the four convicts have been sentenced to death. The order has been upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court. Except Pawan, all convicts have exhausted their legal remedy available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court. The President has already rejected the mercy pleas of convicts Mukesh and Vinay.

A juvenile convict in the case has been released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

49,2020/02/04,"Study on bats | No rules were broken, says NCBS","Under the scanner after the government ordered an inquiry into a study conducted in Nagaland by researchers from the U.S., China and India on bats and humans carrying antibodies to deadly viruses like Ebola, the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) said researchers based at the NCBS collected samples of serum from bats and humans. These samples were tested at the NCBS with the technologies supplied by Duke-NUS.

Two of the 12 researchers belonged to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the study was funded by the United States Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

The NCBS has said its researchers have been studying bat antibodies in Nagaland since 2012. In 2017, the NCBS and Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School (Duke-NUS) started a collaboration in which researchers based at the NCBS collected samples of serum from bats and humans. “These samples were tested at the NCBS using the technologies supplied by Duke-NUS,” it said.

The NCBS says researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were not directly involved in the study. “They were listed co-authors only because they supplied reagents. This is a standard practice for scientific authorship.”

The published study, however, notes the WIV researchers contributed in writing review and editing.

The NCBS statement further adds that it is not a direct recipient of research funds from the DTRA, which funded the study and no biological samples or infectious agents were transferred into or out of India. The Hindu report, however, does not mention anything about samples being sent out of the country.

Mukund Thattai, head, academics, NCBS, told the media that “there were funds transferred from Duke-NUS to NCBS as part of the joint study”. He said that while the Department of Atomic Energy had approved the study and had “given security clearance to the Duke-NUS collaborator but the ICMR brought to our notice that this still requires a Health Ministry Screening Committee/ICMR approval.”

The paper mentions that funding acquisition was one of the roles of Uma Ramakrishnan from the NCBS, a co-author of the paper.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vneirn/article30736883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05NIPAHVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/study-on-bats-no-rules-were-broken-says-ncbs/article30736884.ece

51,2020/02/04,"Six months on, top Jammu and Kashmir leaders to stay in jail","As they completed six months in detention on Tuesday, Jammu and Kashmir’s top mainstream leaders such as Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are unlikely to be released anytime soon by the administration. The day, however, saw the release of two known persons as part of a phased-manner release policy.

Top government sources said the administration was not immediately reviewing the cases of NC president and Srinagar MP Dr. Abdullah, whose detention was extended for three months in December under the Public Safety Act (PSA) for the second time. Detained on August 5, the five-time ex-Chief Minister is detained in his house, which has been turned into a sub-jail. The PSA dossier was based on his numerous public speeches made in the past few years.

The sources said the Home Department and the magistrates have not started any process to review the cases of NC vice-president Omar Abdullah and PDP chief Ms. Mufti. Both the former Chief Ministers were being held in separate sub-jails under Section 107 and 151, which allows detention of people in the cases of apprehensions of breaching peace.

A top official said the combined Sections of 151 and 107 allowed preventive detentions up to one year without any review and release in such cases remained the prime prerogative of the local magistrate, who judges the feasibility of their release on the basis of reports of the Home department and other security wings.

Iltija Mufti’s reaction

Reacting to the prolonged detention of her mother, Ms. Mufti’s daughter, Iltija Mufti, said, “Ideally putting former elected representatives behind the bar indefinitely shouldn’t happen in a democratic set-up. But when you see sedition cases slapped against nine-year-old kids, its not a surprise”.

On the family decision not to approach the court for relief to her mother, Ms. Iltija said: “Which court are you referring to? The same court that has adopted a tone deaf attitude when it comes to Kashmir? They have turned their backs to Kashmir and its people. A court that couldn't muster the courage to order the Government of India to restore Internet despite a six-month ban”.

Valley businessman released

Meanwhile, the Valley's known businessman, Shakeel Qalander, who was also a member of the economist C. Rangarajan committee to formulate an employment policy for J&K in 2010-11, was released after six months from the Srinagar Central Jail.

“It has been an agonising period for the whole family. We were waiting to see him released every week since August 5”, Qalander's son Ahtisham Qalander, an IIT graduate, said.

PDP former legislator Aijaz Mir was also released from the MLA Hostel, also a sub-jail. From over 40, only 15 mainstream leaders, including Ali Muhammad Sagar, Naeem Akhtar, Sajad Lone, Waheed Para and Shah Faesal remain detained in the MLA Hostel now.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ysh628/article30737364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Farooq-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/six-months-on-top-jammu-and-kashmir-leaders-to-stay-in-jail/article30736844.ece
52,2020/02/04,Kerala MPs demand govt. statement on Coronavirus,"Lok Sabha members from Kerala asked the Union government on Tuesday to send specialist medical teams to the State where the first cases of confirmed Novel Coronavirus infection have been detected.

They wanted the Centre to make a statement in Parliament on the steps taken to contain the spread of the virus.

“Speaker Sir, Coronavirus has become a dangerous epidemic all round the world. In our country, there are thousands of cases under observation. The first Coronavirus positive patient was confirmed in my district of Kerala,” said Congress MP T.N. Prathapan. Around 3000 patients were under observation in Kerala alone and the State government had declared Coronavirus a State disaster, he said.

“I urge the Central Government to facilitate a fully functional medical team, including an efficient team of disaster management, to Kerala and other reporting States. ...I also appeal to the Health Minister to give a detailed explanation in the Lok Sabha regarding the current situation,” he added.

RSP MP N.K. Premachandran said better facilities should be given to the students who were airlifted from Wuhan, now quarantined at Manesar. “At the earliest, the country wants to know what is the global status, and what is the status in our country, particularly in Kerala. We would like to have a statement from the honourable Minister under Rule 372,” he said.

Congress chief whip K. Suresh also joined his fellow MPs and demanded a statement. “Speaker Sir, through you, I would like to request the government to make an immediate statement in the House as to how this emergency situation is being tackled by the Government of India,” he said.

53,2020/02/04,"Parliament proceedings | BJP hits out at Congress, AAP over anti-CAA protests","The BJP on Tuesday said in the Rajya Sabha that the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were supporting the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, while the Opposition said the issues raised by the Centre were a distraction from the real problems facing the country, including the state of the economy.

Kicking off discussions on the motion of thanks to the President’s address, BJP MP Bhupender Yadav said: “Today, a movement is being run through the people in our Opposition in Shaheen Bagh.” He added that Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Shashi Tharoor as well as AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan had gone to the protest site and given speeches. The Congress and AAP had given moral support to the supporters, he said.

However, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the government had brought “destructive” laws that had led to the protests in the country. “Shaheen Bagh is your [BJP] creation,” he said, adding that there had been no discussion of the economy and unemployment in the President’s address.

The Congress leader said the government had said Jammu and Kashmir was lagging behind in development, which was one of the “excuses” given for revoking the State’s special status under Article 370 and splitting it into two Union Territories on August 5, 2019. He then cited the Reserve Bank of India’s reports in which J&K had performed better than the national average on 80 of the 114 parameters, including health and education. He asked the government to bring a Bill to convert the new UTs of J&K and Ladakh into a State again.

Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the President's address made no mention of “the unemployment, which is the highest in 45 years”. He said his party was forced to move amendments to the motion as the address had not given the real picture.

Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena, which broke its 30-year alliance with the BJP last year, said: ""The President's address is usually the mann ki baat of the government. There is another voice being raised in the country today that should be heard.”

Speaking of the anti-CAA protests, Mr. Raut said the government should have gone to the people to allay their fears. “There is a civil war-like situation,” he said. He added that the biggest problem was unemployment, which had not been addressed by the President.

54,2020/02/04,Facts gave way to fiction in President’s address: Tharoor,"“Facts gave way to fiction in the President’s address to Parliament,” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. He accused the government of abrogating its moral responsibility of dealing with the “constitutional and political crisis” in the country.

Taking part in the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to Parliament, he said the “government was dividing the country into “Hindus vs Muslims”, “us vs they” “Ramzade vs I won’t say”.

“The present dispensation is abrogating its moral responsibility of dealing with the constitutional and political crisis facing the country,” he said, adding that government schemes should really be named as “sit-down India, shutdown India and shut-up India”.

The government was paying “lip service” to Skill India, Digital India and Startup India, and no mention was made of Standup India as “you are so busy banning stand-up comedians”, he said, referring to a flying ban on stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra.

Raising the issue of “prolonged” detention of leaders of Jammu and Kashmir, he said the country had seen the largest number of Internet shutdowns, including that in the Valley.

National Conference member Hasnain Masoodi said the dilution of Article 370 and revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status were a historic blunder. The decision did not help to curb militancy. “The basic value of truthfulness was murdered,” he said.

Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav said the BJP government talked about ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’, but it neither took everyone along, nor did it bring on any development.

Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM asked the Prime Minister to clarify whether the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were the two sides of the same coin.

55,2020/02/04,"Parliament proceedings | BJP doing ‘Godse politics’, says Congress in Lok Sabha","The controversial remarks made on Mahatma Gandhi by BJP MP Anant Kumar Hegde led to sloganeering, a walkout and an adjournment in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. And Congress members accused the ruling party of doing ‘Godse politics’.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi hit back, saying the Congress members were followers of ‘nakli (fake) Gandhis like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi’, and called the BJP as real “bhakts” of the Mahatma.

Last week, Mr. Hegde, at a public event in Bengaluru: ““Freedom fighters who did not sacrifice anything made the country believe that it attained independence through ‘Upavas Satyagrah [hunger strikes]’ — Gandhi’s preferred mode of agitation — and became ‘mahapurush’ (great person)”.

Mr. Joshi informed the House that though Mr. Hegde had clarified his position, he had been asked express regret unconditionally.

The issue even led to a rare adjournment of the Question Hour. The Speaker adjourned the House until 12 noon after the Congress, DMK and NCP members refused to relent and continued their protest in the Well of the House.

Post noon, when the House convened, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the BJP leader had insulted the Mahatma, a revered a figure across the globe. He made a personal remark against Mr. Hegde.

Speaker Om Birla, however, disallowed it to go on Parliament’s record.

Opposition members led by Congress MPs were in the Well, displaying placards, shouting slogans. They didn’t heed to the Speaker’s request to return to their seats.

“I have no expectations from people who are doing Godse politics”, Mr Chowdhury said and walked out in protest.

Speaking during the Zero Hour, BJP member from Jharkhand, Nishikant Dubey, demanded that the government should implemented a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Today, I make a request to the Centre to implement NRC nationwide,” he said. Mr. Dubey accused the Congress of doing vote-bank politics in the name of Muslims of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. He said the party wanted division of the nation and the country should be saved from it.

BJP member from West Bengal Locket Chatterjee too accused the Mamata Banerjee government of this. “There is such a situation in West Bengal that people are not being allowed to celebrate Saraswati Puja,” she said, while Opposition members were protesting against Mr. Hegde’s controversial remarks.

To lighten things up a bit, the Speaker asked the members if the House should take a ‘lunch time’ break. “I will go by whatever Mulayam Singh ji [Samajwadi patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav] says,” he said.

“Lunch is very essential,” replied Mr Yadav amidst laughter from members.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3u11wg/article30736513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5TH-LOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-bjp-doing-godse-politics-says-congress-in-lok-sabha/article30736514.ece
56,2020/02/04,nCoV: Govt. earmarks aerobridges at dedicated gates at airports,"The government on Tuesday said it would take extra measures to screen passengers for the novel coronavirus (nCoV) such as earmarking aerobridges at airports for passengers evacuated from Wuhan to prevent the virus from spreading.

“Earmarked aerobridges will be used at 7 international airports [Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Cochin, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai] at the dedicated gates to screen passengers for symptoms of coronavirus to ensure effective prevention,” said Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), on Tuesday.

Advising the States/UTs to be more vigilant, the Secretary said screening of passengers is now on at all 21 airports.

This comes after it came to light that all the three Indians who have tested positive to the nCoV were co-travellers on the flight from Wuhan on January 24.

A release issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) says 534 suspected cases have been tested as on Tuesday.

Till date, three of the 534 tested are confirmed laboratory positive for the 2019 virus. Of the tested samples till date, 160 are from the quarantine centres set up for the individuals evacuated from Wuhan. In addition to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, 11 Virus and Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) are testing for the 2019 virus from respiratory samples from suspected cases as on Tuesday.

57,2020/02/04,CJI has to take the final call on live-streaming of proceedings: Bench,"A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to direct the court’s administrative side to frame rules and implement a September 26, 2018 judgment to live-stream courtroom proceedings, especially in nationally important and sensational cases.

The Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra told senior advocate Indira Jaising, who is the petitioner in the case, and Attorney General K.K. Venugopal that “there cannot be any mandamus from the judicial side of the Court. The decision has to come from the administrative side alone, there cannot be a judicial command”.

Justice Mishra said the Chief Justice of India, as the administrative head of the Supreme Court, had to take the final call on live-streaming of proceedings and the Bench cannot “compel” him.

“Can we issue a command to Parliament to do this or that? It's effect will be zero”, Justice Mishra compared the situation.

The side of the Secretary General of the Supreme Court, meanwhile, informed the Bench that action was being taken to implement the 2018 verdict.

Justice Mishra repeated, “We cannot pass any mandamus nor can we compel [SC administrative side for live-streaming of important court proceedings]”.

To this, Ms. Jaising said “very well, I will pursue the matter with the Chief Justice”.

In September 2018, the court upheld the plea for live-streaming of its proceedings, observing that the use of technology was to “virtually” expand the court beyond the four walls of the courtroom.

“Live-streaming of court proceedings has the potential of throwing up an option to the public to witness live court proceedings which, they otherwise could not have due to logistical issues and infrastructural restrictions,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar wrote in the judgment for a three-judge Bench.

In a separate and concurring opinion, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud wrote that the live-streaming of proceedings was the true realisation of the “open court system” in which courts are accessible to all.

Justice Khanwilkar had said live-streaming should start as a pilot project in the Supreme Court for cases of national importance. Specified category of cases or cases of constitutional and national importance being argued for final hearing before the Constitution Bench may be live-streamed as a pilot project.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cji-has-to-take-the-final-call-on-live-streaming-of-proceedings-bench/article30736470.ece
58,2020/02/04,"Analysis | On his visit to Assam on Friday, Modi will seek to regain lost ground","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be travelling to Assam this Friday to address a public meeting at Kokrajhar after the Centre signed the Bodo Peace Accord that brought together all the different factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, once known for violent ways to press for its demand for a separate State.

Calling it a “historic” achievement since the Bodos — an ethnic tribal group — had given up on their demand for a separate State, Mr. Modi’s visit is meant to take forward the process of bringing peace. Quite literally.

Since mid-December last year, when the Government of India was forced to call off the Indo-Japan summit because of spontaneous student protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the violence that followed, Mr. Modi had to put off his scheduled visit on at least one other occasion.

PM unwelcome

Apart from the bilateral summit, the Khelo India Games of January was the other event the Prime Minister was expected to inaugurate, but didn’t, as the All Assam Students Union (AASU) had announced it would welcome the games but oppose Mr. Modi’s visit.

Emotions in most parts of the Brahmaputra Valley were running high as five protesters lost their lives to police bullets in December 2019. Internet bans, curfews, bandhs and finally, artistes resorting to cultural protests ushered in the new year.

The sudden outburst in Assam that eventually triggered the anti-CAA protests took the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by surprise both in Assam as well as the Centre.

After all, despite the BJP clearly stating in its 2019 manifesto that the citizenship law was a part of its unfinished agenda, the party won nine out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats from the State.

So, perhaps, the BJP could be forgiven for thinking that Assam was now ready to accommodate undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh on religious lines: that is, accept the Hindus immigrants but reject the Muslims.

Ignoring the past

But such a reading can come only by ignoring the past that had seen a six-year-long anti-foreigners’ agitation, 855 deaths (accorded the status of martyrs) and, eventually, the signing of the Assam Accord, not just to “protect Assam from large-scale migration but also its indigenous culture, language and history”.

The new citizenship law, as it stands today, makes the Assam Accord redundant and that’s precisely one of the concerns that the Prime Minister will seek to address when he speaks in Kokrajhar.

There are other important political signals to be conveyed as well. The Prime Minister’s rally comes ahead of the elections to the 40-member-strong territorial council.

Irrespective of who wins the council elections — the BJP’s ally, the Bodo People’s Front, or some other party — the BJP’s popularity will certainly ride high on the back of the ₹1,500 crore development package announced by the Centre.

This will also help the party in the 12 Assembly seats in this belt. A rousing welcome to the Prime Minister would show that not everyone in Assam is angry with the ruling party.

And most certainly, it will mark the beginning of the BJP top leadership’s outreach before next year’s Assembly polls.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k4wjy0/article30736465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-on-his-visit-to-assam-on-friday-modi-will-seek-to-regain-lost-ground/article30736466.ece
59,2020/02/04,Parliament proceedings | Anurag Thakur faces the heat in Rajya Sabha,"The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday functioned without adjournments despite renewed demands from the Opposition for a debate on the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register for Citizens (NRC). They also rose in protest every time Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur stood up to speak.

The trouble started when Mr. Thakur rose to lay the paper listed against his name. The moment his name was called, some Opposition members started shouted “goli maaro” in a reference to Mr. his campaign speech in Delhi where this slogan was raised. The Election Commission of India has barred him from campaigning after the controversial remarks.

The Opposition members once again demanded that under Rule 267, which allows suspension of the day's business, a debate on the protests against the CAA and the NRC be done. Chairman Venkaiah Naidu reminded the Opposition that he had disallowed invoking this Rule.

In protest, some TMC and Congress members trooped into the Well of the House and started slogans like 'Goli Marna Band Kero', 'Modi Tere Tanashai Nahi Chalegi', 'Loktantra Ke Hatya Nahi Chalege', and several other slogans against the NRC, the CAA, and the National Population Register (NPR).

Mr. Naidu once again explained why he had disallowed the motion under the Rule to suspend the day's business to debate issues of national importance. He said the President's address had referred to the CAA and any discussion on the issue could happen when the Houses debated the address. “And then, if you want to criticise it, criticise it. If you want to support it, support it,” he said. On the Rule, he said he too had had an experience on how many times it was allowed and under what circumstances. The Rule was rarely invoked. The Opposition was “killing democracy” by not allowing the House to function, he stated.

The Opposition halted it’s sloganeering every time one of their member stood up to speak, and raised the decibel of protests when it was turn of the Treasury benches to speak. YSR Congress member Vijay Sai Reddy pointed this out. “You can't take away the right of the House. Why is this selective protest by the Congress? They are not democratic. That is the reason why the Congress has been taught a lesson by the people of this country,” Mr Reddy said.

60,2020/02/04,Coronavirus | Odisha medical student tests negative for nCoV,"A medical student, who returned from Wuhan on January 11, has tested negative for the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

A native of Phulbani in the Kandhamal district, Mryutunjay Muni was admitted to the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack after he approached the local authorities to undergo tests.

Director of Medical Education & Training CBK Mohanty told the media here on Tuesday that the medical student would be discharged soon.

Five of the six samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune had tested negative, Dr. Mohanty said and added that report of a woman medical student also admitted to the SCB was awaited.

The woman student, who returned from China was admitted to the hospital after undergoing thermal screening at the Biju Patnaik International Airport here and was found in poor health.

Dr. Mohanty said 13 persons from China and one from Thailand had arrived in Odisha so far and a close watch is being kept on them. While 12 persons were kept under home surveillance, the woman student was in the SCB isolation ward, he said.

The Centre has advised the State government to make arrangements for at least five beds in the district headquarters hospitals and 30 beds in the premier government medical college and hospitals for suspected patients, he said.

He said the State government was well prepared to handle any situation. An 80-bed isolated ward is fully ready at the SCB with a team of dedicated doctors and paramedics.

The Regional Medical Research Centre here had on Monday imparted training to paramedical staff from across the State on how to collect swab and blood samples of persons with suspected nCoV.

The Health department has requested people to inform the authorities if they come across any person who had recently returned from China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.

The Paradip Port authorities said they had taken preventive measures to stop any possible outbreak.

The victim was Mangudu Huluka of the K. Gulumiguda village. According to the complaint filed by the victim’s son before the police, he had been murdered on January 29 near the Jaguguda village. His attackers had blamed the victim of causing ailments and deaths through his witchcraft.

The body of the deceased was not found as the assailants had burnt it down to destroy evidence. On Monday, the police reached the spot where the body had been burnt down, to collect forensic evidence, said Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Aswini Kumar Nayak. Police investigation led to the arrest of the five persons involved in the murder.

The victim had two wives. His first wife lived at K. Gulumiguda while his second wife stayed at Jaguguda village. According to the First Information Report filed with police, the victim had visited K. Gulumiguda on January 25 and returned from there to Jaguguda on January 28.

Coincidentally, on January 29, a person named Pushika Disa had died at K. Gulumiguda, after ailing for a long time. For some reason, some superstitious inhabitants of the village alleged that sorcery practices by the victim were the cause of Disa’s death.

64,2020/02/04,‘Natural Resource Accounting is a promising assessment tool’,"The 35th meeting of the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board (GASAB) has discussed the “Natural Resource Accounting (NRA)” as a promising tool for environmental impact assessment of projects in which usage of resources is envisaged.

At the meeting chaired by Anita Pattanayak, Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General, some members suggested that the NRA, being an important and current topic associated with the attainment of sustainable development goals and management of resources, could be an important tool in assessing the projects sanctioned by the Centre.

The GASAB has prepared a concept paper on the NRA in coordination with the Delhi University’s Economics and Environmental Sciences Department. It will be the basis of accounting for four major natural resources — land, water, forests and mineral wealth.

The Due Process of GASAB, the concept paper on the NRA, four cash-based International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) — Disclosure Statement on Contingent Liabilities, Prior Period Adjustments, Recipients of External Assistance and Recognition of Revenue Receipts — and the Knowledge Centre were discussed at the meeting.

The Board was informed by the participants that the cash-based IPSAS were being formulated to make the cash basis of accounting in Union and State governments compliant with internationally accepted standards for greater transparency in financial reporting.

The GASAB has taken up formulation of standards relating to revenue recognition, prior period adjustments, external assistance and contingent liability for compliance. A draft concept paper has been prepared on these issues and testing is under way in two States.

65,2020/02/04,Nirbhaya’s parents urge Delhi HC to expeditiously decide Centre’s plea against stay on convicts’ execution,"Nirbhaya’s parents urged the Delhi High Court on February 4 to expeditiously decide the Centre’s plea challenging stay on execution of the four convicts in the case of their daughter’s gang rape and murder.

Advocate Jitendra Jha, representing the parents of Nirbhaya, given name of the victim, said he mentioned the matter before the court for early disposal of the government’s plea.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, who had on February 2 reserved order on the Centre’s plea after holding special hearing on February 1 and 2, said the decision would be passed at the earliest.

The trial court on January 17 issued black warrants for the second time for the execution of all the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) — in Tihar jail at 6 a.m. on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

On January 31 the court again stayed the execution as the counsel for three convicts — Pawan, Vinay and Akshay — urged it to adjourn the matter “sine die” saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.

While the mercy pleas of Mukesh and Vinay have been rejected by the President, Pawan has not yet filed it. Akshay’s mercy plea was filed on February 1 and is pending.

The Centre and Delhi government challenged the trial court’s order staying the execution.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing them, had contended that it was a deliberate and calculated design of the convicts to “frustrate mandate of law” by getting their execution delayed and they were not entitled to any more time.

The counsel for the convicts opposed the plea saying it was not maintainable and that the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court and while the government was accusing the convict of delay, it has woken up only now.

Nirbhaya, 23-year-old paramedic student, was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 in Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

66,2020/02/04,"CBI books 10, including 2 IPS officers, in ₹4,000-cr. I-Monetary Advisory scam","The CBI has booked 10 persons, including Karnataka cadre IPS officers Hemant Nimbalkar and Ajay Hilori, in connection with the ₹4,000-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) scam.

The registration of the case followed an the Karnataka government’s approval to probe the charges against Mr. Nimbalkar, a 1998-batch officer, who was the Inspector General of Police (CID); and Mr. Hilori, a 2008 batch officer, then posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police (Bengaluru East).

Among those named in the FIR are Inspector M. Ramesh and Sub-Inspector Gowri Shankar of the Commercial Street Police Station in Bengaluru, and Deputy Superintendent of Police E.B. Sridhara of the CID's Economic Offences division.

The group, its head Mansoor Khan, and other directors, Nizamuddin, Vaseeem and Arshad Khan, have also been arraigned. The CBI had earlier registered three cases against the company, its sister concerns, Khan and others for their alleged role in the scam. It had also filed two charge sheets against the accused persons.

It is alleged that since 2013, the group collected Rs.4,000 crore from thousands of investors on the pretext of high rate of returns on the investments.

Since 2016, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had been highlighting the issue of unauthorised collections by the IMA group at the State level coordination committee meetings presided over by the State Chief Secretary. They were attended by officials of all the enforcement agencies and market regulatory bodies.

RBI shares findings with police

RBI, through a letter on August 12, 2016, shared the findings of its Market Intelligence Unit with the then Director General and Inspector General of Police.

The reference was shared with the area Station House Officer, Mr. Ramesh, through the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru East. He sent a closer report to Mr. Hilori in January 2017, saying that no action could be taken without any complaint from the depositors.

It is alleged that Mr. Hilori kept the matter pending for almost four months and then sought a fresh report from the Inspector that contained the same findings. It was forwarded to the Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime), Bengaluru City, in May 2017.

RBI did not accept the report and the Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) was again asked to look into the matter. As alleged, Mr. Hilori did not take any action despite several references, stating that the matter was being dealt with by the CID.

The Principal Secretary then directed the Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban, to prefer a complaint against the IMA group and its directors. The complaint again reached Mr. Ramesh. He and the accused Sub-Inspector had received complaints against the group from a social activist but they allegedly buried the matter.

In July 2018, the Inspector General of Police (CID) was directed to take necessary action. He submitted a report, prepared by Mr. Sridhara, in January 2019 claiming that the collections were not unauthorised.

The FIR alleges that the police officers received quid pro quo from the IMA group directors for not taking any action against them.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y15udq/article27150184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-books-10-including-2-ips-officers-in-4000-cr-i-monetary-advisory-scam/article30734353.ece

Nazbunnisa, 26, the mother of the girl who participated in the play, and Fareeda Begum, 52, the head teacher of Shaheen School, who staged it, were arrested by Bidar New Town Police Station officers.

The two were booked under Sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes), 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting, attempting to promote disharmony) and 34 (common intent) of the Indian Penal Code.

69,2020/02/04,"No decision yet on nationwide NRC, Minister tells Parliament","The government informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that till now it “has not taken any decision to prepare National Register of Citizens (NRC) at the national level.”

Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai was responding to a question by Lok Janshakti Party’s (LJP) Chandan Singh and Telengana Rashtra Samithi’s (TRS) Nama Nageswara Rao on whether the government had any plans to introduce the NRC all over the country.

While replying to another question, Mr. Rai said the “government is in discussion with the States having concerns in regard to the preparation of National Population Register (NPR)”.

Mr. Rai said in a written reply that “during the exercise of updation of NPR, no verification is done to find individuals whose citizenship is doubtful”.

Several Opposition-ruled States have vociferously opposed the NPR, slated to begin from April 1 onwards along with the decennial Census. According to the Citizenship Rules, 2003, the NPR is the first step towards the compilation of the NRC.

Form not finalised

The NPR form is yet to be finalised and notified but the trial form last year collected details from 30 lakh respondents on 21 parameters, including the place of birth of father and mother and the last place of residence.

On December 9 last year, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had told Parliament that “there is no need to create a background for NRC; we are clear that NRC ought to be done in this country, our manifesto is the background.”

To a question on whether the government had finalised the questionnaire for the NPR, Mr. Rai said, “The demographic and other particulars of each family and individual are to be updated/collected during the exercise of updation of NPR. No document is to be collected during this exercise.”

Mr. Rai added that “an instruction manual for updation of NPR 2020 for enumerators and supervisors has been prepared. The NPR updation will be undertaken through house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual.”

“The respondent has to provide the information true to the best of his knowledge and belief. Aadhar Number is collected voluntarily,” Mr. Rai said.

In reply to another question on NPR, Mr. Rai said, “Population Register is a register containing details of persons usually residing in a village or rural area or town or ward or demarcated area within a ward in a town or urban area. NPR was first prepared in 2010 and [was] updated in 2015. In pursuance of Sub-rule (4) of Rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, framed under the Citizenship Act,1955, Central Government decided to prepare and update the population register during April to September, 2020, throughout the country except Assam for collection of information relating to all persons usually residing in village or town.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/agp24e/article30096417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NITYANANDRAI-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-decision-yet-on-nrc-at-national-level-mos-home-nityanand-rai/article30734265.ece
70,2020/02/04,"In reply to BJP leadership, Anantkumar Hegde says he never mentioned Gandhi","BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde has written to the party leadership that he made no mention of Mahatma Gandhi in his speech, which has faced flak for its swipe at the Father of the Nation, and controversial remarks attributed to him are “incorrect”.

BJP sources said Mr. Hegde sent a detailed reply to party president J.P. Nadda, and the party’s disciplinary committee, which issued him a show-cause notice on Monday, is studying its content before deciding its next course of action.

Mr. Hegde has claimed he did not name Mahatma Gandhi nor did he insult him in his speech and news reports about his speech are “incorrect”. He added he also did not use words like “nautanki” or “drama” to describe the freedom struggle led by Gandhi.

There is a view in the party that what the former Union Minister said might be in bad taste but its content was distorted in some media reports, a senior BJP leader said.

Speaking in Kannada at an event in Bengaluru on Saturday to commemorate Veer Savarkar, an iconic Hindutva figure, Mr. Hegde said freedom fighters who did not sacrifice anything made the country believe that it attained independence through ‘Upavas Satyagrah’, Gandhi’s preferred mode of agitation by undertaking fast.

“Such people became ‘Mahapurush (great person),” said Mr. Hegde, who is no stranger to controversies.

71,2020/02/04,"Why no action on pleas on T.N. MLAs disqualification, asks SC","The Supreme Court on February 4 gave the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal a week’s time to confirm when he will take cognisance of disqualification petitions filed under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) against Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and 10 other AIADMK MLAs for voting against the confidence motion moved by Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami in February 2017.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde asked Tamil Nadu Advocate General Vijay Narayan and State Additional Advocate General Jayanth Muthuraj to confer with the Speaker and report back on February 14.

The court questioned the Speaker’s inaction, repeatedly asking why he kept the disqualification petitions pending for three whole years without even issuing notice.

“The three-year delay was unnecessary. You (Speaker) needed to have taken action. Prime facie, if there is inaction on the part of the Speaker, it has to be cured,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Narayan.

Speaker’s jurisdiction

However, the court made it clear that it had no intention to “go wandering into the Speaker’s jurisdiction” of deciding anti-defection petition.

“Of course, there is nothing we can do about the Speaker deciding to do it (take cognisance of the anti-defection pleas) or not... But we must take cognisance if he keeps them pending... Why did you not take cognisance for three years?” Chief Justice Bobde asked Mr. Narayan, appearing for the Speaker’s office.

Mr. Narayan replied that multiple forums, from the Election Commission to High Court to the Supreme Court, were engaged in the dispute over the past three years. The Speaker had simply decided to wait for the outcome of these litigations.

He explained to the Bench that the Tenth Schedule petitions were filed against Mr. Panneerselvam and the 10 other MLAs, represented by advocate Balaji Srinivasan, for defying the party whip on March 20, 2017.

However, before the Speaker could proceed, the Election Commission recognised Mr. Panneerselvam’s faction as a “separate group” on March 23. Subsequently, the Panneerselvam and the Palaniswami (OPS-EPS) factions merged on August 20. On November 23, 2017, the Election Commission had declared the duo as the leaders of the AIADMK.

DMK’s petitions

Meanwhile, the DMK had approached the High Court for disqualification of the 11 MLAs. The writ petitions were dismissed, following which, the DMK had moved the Supreme Court in May 2018.

“Now all these difficulties are over, now you decide whether to take cognisance or not,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Narayan.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for the DMK, referred to a January 20, 2020 judgment of a three-judge Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman which directed Speakers to decide anti-defection law petitions within three months maximum.

At this, the Chief Justice turned to Mr. Narayan to stress that the judgment had made it all the more necessary for Mr. Dhanapal to take cognisance.

But senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, the lead counsel for the MLAs, said the Justice Nariman judgment had no validity because the question of whether a constitutional court can judicially review the inaction of the Speaker had been referred to a five-judge Bench way back in 2016 in the Sampath Kumar case.

Mr. Sibal countered that the reference was made by a two-judge Bench in the Sampath Kumar case. Justice Nariman was heading a numerically stronger three-judge Bench, thus cancelling the reference itself.

Besides, Mr. Sibal said a 2007 judgment by a Constitution Bench in Rajender Singh Rana case had already laid down that the “failure of the Speaker to exercise his jurisdiction will attract judicial review”. The Rana judgment has been highlighted and reiterated in the January 2020 verdict authored by Justice Nariman at the head of a three-judge Bench.

The CJI acknowledged Mr. Sibal’s submissions and reminded Mr. Rohatgi that the Justice Nariman’s direction to Speakers to decide within a “reasonable period” of three months was a part of a judgment and demanded compliance.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/olz09z/article30733613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPANNEERSELVAMBUDGETTNASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-questions-tn-speakers-inaction-on-anti-defection-pleas-against-o-panneerselvam-10-mlas/article30733614.ece
72,2020/02/04,Parliament proceedings | AAP raises in Rajya Sabha issue of delay in hanging of convicts in Nirbhaya case,"Aam Aadmi Party member Sanjay Singh, in the Rajya Sabha, on Tuesday sought the intervention of Parliament, the President and the Chief Justice of India to ensure that convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape case are hanged at the earliest.

Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, concurring with Mr. Singh’s submission, said the matter was “very sensitive and serious” and the court judgment must be

implemented at the earliest.

‘Date after date’

Speaking during zero hour, Mr. Singh said delay in delivery of justice in Nirbhaya cases was unfortunate. Though a fast track court was set up, the accused were convicted and sentence was given, the hanging had been repeatedly delayed. “Tarikh per Tarikh (date after date),” Mr. Singh said, in an apparent reference to a famous dialogue of the film Damini revolving around a rape trial.

Mr. Singh sought intervention from the top echelons of the government. “With folded hands, I request you, whether it is President of India or Chief Justice of India, the convicts must be hanged at the earliest. They have no right to escape,” Mr. Singh added.

Observing that people were agitated and concerned over the delay in execution of the court order, Mr. Naidu said those in the system must fulfil their responsibilities.

He said the convicts were given all legal opportunities. “After getting all those avenues and opportunities exhausted on some pretext or other, if things are getting postponed people are becoming restive. This has to be understood by one and all,” Mr. Naidu said. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar blamed the Delhi government for the delay in executing the punishment.

The MP present at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting said Mr. Nadda emphasised that the decisions taken by the Modi government, especially that of legalising nearly 40 lakh unauthorised dwellings in the city be communicated to people. “Also, the Kejriwal government’s moves to overplay what it has done for health and education and the free water and electricity that has only been provided just before polls, needs to be exposed,” Mr Nadda is reported to have said according to the MP.

The polls in Delhi are scheduled for February 8, with February 6 being the last day of campaign.

The probe has been launched following a Manipur High Court order on a petition. The petitioners had alleged that marks were tampered with, examination controller was not appointed and that procedures for evaluation and tabulation of answer sheets were not laid down.

The Commission as well as a court-appointed committee found that marks were altered in 523 answer scripts in respect of 24 papers/subjects, without the initials of examiners. They had not put their signatures in seven papers/subjects out of the 8,163 answer sheets, while supervisors did not sign 15 papers.

Marks were not awarded for three answers in Education Paper-II and Public Administration Paper-II, while 12 answers of General English Paper-I, Education Paper-II and Public Administration Paper-II were not recorded for awarding scores, but the marks were added while totalling.

82,2020/02/04,Siachen troops given poor gear: CAG,"In a report tabled in Parliament on Monday, the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) pulled up the Army for deficiencies in the provision of special clothing, rations and housing for troops in high-altitude areas, including Siachen.

As for the Indian National Defence University (INDU), proposed by the Kargil Review Committee in 1999, the CAG said the institute was “yet to fructify”, even as the project cost had been revised from ₹395 crore to ₹4,007.22 crore, up 914%.

“There were delays of up to four years in the procurement of high-altitude clothing and equipment, leading to an acute shortage of essential clothing and equipment. There was a critical shortage of snow goggles, ranging from 62% to 98%. The troops had not been issued ‘multi-purpose boots’ from November 2015 to September 2016, and had to resort to the recycling of available boots,” the CAG said in the report on the performance audit of provisioning and procurement during the period from 2015-16 to 2017-18.

Furthermore, as the old models of face mask, jacket and sleeping bags were procured, the troops did not get the benefit of using improved products.

Dependence on import

“Lack of research and development by defence laboratory led to a continued dependence on import,” the report said.

The INDU was recommended by the Kargil Review Committee in 1999 to address the deficiencies in India’s security management system. The Union Cabinet accorded in-principle approval in May 2010 for establishing it in Gurugram at an estimated cost of ₹395 crore. “The land was acquired in September 2012; however, the setting up of the INDU is yet to fructify even after two decades of the Kargil War,” the report said.

The cost of the project was also revised from ₹395 crore in May 2010 to ₹4007.22 crore in December 2017, an increase of 914%. The draft INDU legislation had been lying for approval with the Cabinet Secretariat since December 2017, the CAG said.

On the special rations authorised for troops in high-altitude areas to meet their daily energy needs, the CAG said substitutes for the scaled items were authorised on a “cost-to-cost’’ basis, and this resulted in the supply of a reduced quantity. “This compromised the calorie intake of the troops by as high as 82%.”

Housing project

The housing project, aimed at improving the living conditions of the troops in high-altitude areas, was executed in an ad hoc manner.

In the first two phases of the pilot project, extensive summer and winter trials were conducted. The third phase constituted the confirmatory trial, at a cost of ₹63.65 crore, the report said. “This was avoidable, since the first two phases were exhaustive.”

The sanction was not obtained from the competent authority for the main project, and the handing over of the assets, created under the pilot project, to the units got delayed beyond the stipulated time. “There were discrepancies between the assets shown in the Numerical Asset Register and those on the ground,” the report said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pzu56h/article30728490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04SIACHENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/siachen-troops-given-poor-gear-cag/article30728491.ece

NCU is a network of activists, researchers, urban practitioners, lawyers, informal sector workers, collectives and individuals. Condemning the CAA-NPR-NRC as unconstitutional and anti-constitutional, the organisation said surveys they conducted in five States revealed that 99 per cent of all homeless persons do not have birth certificates. The survey was done in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. So far, the Home Ministry has not notified the NPR form. However, according to reports the respondents will have to give date of birth and place of birth of their parents too.

“30 percent of urban homeless population do not have any identity proof. Similarly, there are a number of Nomadic and De-Notified Tribes, as well as migrants driven by rural distress who do not possess and will not be able to furnish the requisite documentation that the NRC-NPR process will undoubtedly expect,” NCU said in the statement. The organisation said that the burden of proof of citizenship should not fall on citizens but on the State.

The NPR-NRC exercise will directly target the unorganised sector workers, homeless people, migrant workers, basti dwellers and transgender persons.

85,2020/02/04,Delhi extends reach in IOR with Madagascar relief effort,"India’s flood relief outreach to Madagascar will be followed up this week, as the island’s Defence Minister Rakotonirina Leon Jean Richard travels to Lucknow and Delhi from Tuesday — the first such high level visit since Delhi incorporated the island into the “Indian Ocean Region (IOR)”.

During his visit, Mr. Richard is expected to discuss implementing the MoU on defence cooperation signed during President Ramnath Kovind’s visit to Antananarivo in March 2018. The Minister will travel first to Lucknow to attend the Defexpo, and later attend the India-Africa Defence Ministers’ conference in Delhi, and hold a bilateral meeting with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday.

Strategic capability

Mr. Richard will also discuss the devastation in Madagascar due to flooding after a cyclone and heavy rains in the island’s north-west left at least 31 dead and affected nearly 100,000 people. Last week, the Indian navy conducted “Operation Vanilla”, with INS Airavat delivering relief material including food, clothing, medicines and water. Officials said the humanitarian gesture by New Delhi also showcased India’s strategic capabilities in the furthermost islands of the IOR.

“INS Airavat delivers relief supplies to cyclone-hit Madagascar. SAGAR Policy at work — India as an early responder,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar tweeted about the operation on Sunday, referring to India’s policy of “Security and Growth for All in the Region”(SAGAR) for IOR islands.

The SAGAR concept was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2015, during his visit to Mauritius and other Indian Ocean islands. At the time, Madagascar, as well as Comoros and the French island of Reunion, were a part of the East and South Africa Division at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

Reworked approach

However, recently the MEA decided to include the three islands as part of the IOR (Indian Ocean Region) desk along with Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritus and Seychelles. In a December 16 circular on the decision, the MEA said the incorporation of the “Vanilla islands” as they are called, reflected “the growing strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Islands within the framework of Indo-Pacific”.

In October last year, Minister of State in the MEA V. Muraleedharan travelled to the Reunion islands and met with the leaders of all the ‘Vanilla Islands’ as well.

The inclusion of the region in the IOR signals the government’s increasing level of comfort with the “Indo-Pacific” concept that describes the entire neighbourhood from the coast of Africa to the U.S. west coast. In one of many changes, effected last week, to the MEA organisational structure, Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla decided to club the entire Indian Ocean Region, Southern and Indo-Pacific divisions under one additional secretary (Indo-Pacific).

Naval patrols

According to officials, the specific outcomes from Mr. Richard’s visit are still being finalised, but that the effort would be to offer Madagascar strategic cooperation similar to what is currently shared with other IOR countries. The Indian Navy undertakes Joint EEZ patrols with Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius, which have all joined India’s coastal radar chain network.

Maritime Domain Awareness has also emerged as a high priority area and India has signed a series of white shipping agreements and logistics agreements with several countries.

In addition, the Indian Navy has established an Information Fusion Centre (IFC) for Indian Ocean Region (IOR) at Gurugram and has invited international observers for information exchange of movements on the high seas.

87,2020/02/04,Centre to bar domestic RO systems in places where tap water meets BIS norms,"The Union Environment Ministry has published a draft notification that effectively prohibits users from installing membrane-based water purification, mainly reverse osmosis, systems in their homes if the water has been sourced from a supply that meets the Bureau of Indian Standards’ drinking water norms.

“Installation or use of MWPS [Membrane based Water Purification System] shall be prohibited, at the point of use or at the point of entry for purification of supplied water which is subjected to conventional flocculation, filtration and disinfection process or is from any sources which are in compliance with acceptable limit for drinking water prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standard 10500:2012,” the Ministry said in the notification, made public on Monday. The proposed regulation is not the final word and the Ministry will await comments from the public for 30 days, after which it may incorporate the changes before it becomes a law.

The Delhi Jal Board, among others, claims that the water it supplies meets BIS norms.

The Ministry has issued this order to comply with an order of the National Green Tribunal, which has prohibited the use of reverse osmosis (RO) purifiers in places where total dissolved solids (TDS) in the supplied water are below 500 mg per litre.

The Water Quality Association of India, which represents companies that make RO systems, had moved the Supreme Court for a stay of the NGT’s order. The SC declined to intervene and the NGT had directed the Environment Ministry to issue a notification that restricted the use of water filters. The NGT had ordered a ban on RO filters on the grounds that they wasted water and that, in the process of removing salts, they often deprived drinking water of essential salts. RO while useful in reducing salts does not tackle bacterial agents or trace chemicals and manufacturers often claim that additional filtration is required to deliver potable water.

“This is a work in progress... users will not be prosecuted for installing RO systems,” Jigmet Takpa, Joint Secretary, Union Environment Ministry, told The Hindu. “However, this is part of a significant change we are implementing to regulate RO manufacturers and inform consumers that RO systems aren’t needed always,” he added.

Current BIS regulations consider 500 mg/litre—1,200 mg/l of total dissolved solids, which consists of salts and some organic matter, as acceptable though there is no lower limit.

The regulations also put the onus on commercial bottlers, who make RO water, to ensure that water that is lost in the RO production process is stored in “safe, hygienic” conditions and that a record of such water “wasted” is maintained. Makers of such systems have to register with the Central Pollution Control Board. By June 5, 2022, RO manufacturers can only supply home purification systems that waste no more than 25% of the water and these systems must be able to inform consumers of the TDS levels at the inlet and water outlet, the Ministry adds.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/j1n57y/article26339628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WATERTAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-to-bar-domestic-ro-systems-in-places-where-tap-water-meets-bis-norms/article30728356.ece
88,2020/02/04,A long wait for care at hospital for Bhopal gas survivors,"As tens of doctors quit the only government-run super speciality hospital for the Bhopal gas tragedy survivors in 2014-2015, former Supreme Court Judge Faizanuddin wrote: “handing over the hospital to the Government of India has in fact proved to be its burial order.”

After the Bhopal Memorial Trust — the custodian of the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) for a decade — was wound up in 2010 by the court, the former Judge had called it “nobody’s child”, before its adoption by the Centre.

Yet on January 22 this year, 13 of the 19 doctors resigned from the BMHRC, managed by the Centre’s Department of Health Research, citing lack of promotions and infrastructure, low pay and fearing loss of seniority to new entrants, adding to a string of “mass exodus” of experts and consultants that has afflicted the hospital ever since the Centre became its manager.

Autonomous institute

The 350-bed hospital, catering to the survivors of the methyl isocyanide gas leak in 1984 from the Union Carbide pesticide unit here, has changed hands three times in a decade. It is set to be tossed back as an autonomous institute under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a bid to improve the availability of doctors by rolling out post-graduate programmes, according to the minutes of a High Power Committee’s (HPC) meeting on August 13, 2019, perused by The Hindu.

The earlier proposal to merge it with the AIIMS, Bhopal, meanwhile, has been junked.

ICMR’s inefficacy

This is despite the illustration of the ICMR’s inefficacy in managing the hospital from 2012 to 2015 in the sixth report of a Monitoring Committee headed by retired Madhya Pradesh High Court Judge V.K. Agarwal. Noting that the situation at the BMHRC “appears to be constantly deteriorating”, the report said, “ICMR has not been able to mend the situation and to rectify the problem by filling up the vacancies which is adversely affecting the treatment facility in the hospital”.

As on January 27, there are 19 doctors, including the 13 whose resignations are yet to be accepted, against 57 sanctioned posts at the hospital, with the strength just a little over 30% against the sanctioned one. There are just three professors against a sanctioned 18, according to the BMHRC’s data.

To facilitate the teaching programmes, the hospital would be “run along the lines of” the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), an autonomous institute in Kerala, which “would help retain doctors”. The minutes, however, do not mention why the institute was picked specifically. Moreover, in an attempt to improve bed occupancy, which is at an abysmal 30-50%, the committee recommended its facilities should be “made available to the general public”, at the charges prevailing at the SCTIMST. The Centre plans to convert it into an Institute of Excellence.

‘Affected patient care’

At an earlier meeting of the HPC, BMHRC Director Prabha Desikan had admitted to a lack of enough faculty which “adversely affected” patient care. “Existing doctors have been given one promotion to the next higher grade, advertisements for contractual medical consultants have not attracted adequate response and the vacant posts could not be filled even on temporary basis,” the minutes quote her.

Moreover, the HPC noted recruitment of staff through the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) was a “time consuming process” and the UPSC was “not able to recommend suitable candidates for all the vacant posts expeditiously”.

A doctor for 10 years at the BMHRC wrote in his resignation letter to the Director in 2018 that his appeals regarding due promotion went unheard. “I am suffering mentally, professionally and financially. The same has been brought to your notice repeatedly, but I got nothing more than false assurances. Also, the working conditions here are pitiful. We are working with significantly compromised manpower and many of the necessary departments are functioning without appropriate faculties. This is condemnable at the same time unacceptable.”

Despite several doctors resigning, the HPC decided that consequent upon the fulfilment of its recommendations, including the take over to the ICMR which may expedite recruitments on account of its greater autonomy than the UPSC, that “there may be no changes in the service conditions of the employees of the BMHRC, scales of pay, allowances, age of retirement.”

In quarterly reports since 2014, the monitoring committee has noted there has been unilateral change in the terms and conditions of the employee’s service and it was “high time” to ensure that the BMHRC should not “slide downhill”.

‘No experience’

“The ICMR has no experience or expertise in running a hospital,” said Rachna Dhingra, coordinator, the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. “The hospital in Kerala runs on a 60-40 [public-private] model, which the BMHRC followed when it was under the Trust. Back then, the survivors were discriminated against, drug trials were conducted on them and doctors made huge amounts of money as private share. In the minutes, there is no mention of the survivors. It is all about protecting the doctors”

Meanwhile, Purnendu Shukla, member of the monitoring committee since 2004, said under the Trust, two-thirds of the doctor’s salary came as an incentive for operating upon general patients, which was removed later. “We’ve always recommended to the Centre that if doctors are to be retained, they must get the salary as per the structure of the government of India and an incentive, which it didn’t implement,” he told The Hindu. “In the past five years, the quality of care has declined drastically, despite adequate infrastructure.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j2f84/article30720755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THLTBMHRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-long-wait-for-care-at-hospital-for-bhopal-gas-survivors/article30720756.ece
89,2020/02/04,Amaravati farmers pour out their woes to Venkaiah Naidu,"A farmers’ delegation, led by members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC met Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi on Tuesday with an appeal to urge the Centre to look into their problems.

In a memorandum, the farmers explained the Vice-President about the prevailing conditions in the State, their concerns on the proposed shifting of the Capital to Visakhapatnam and the “indifference” of the YSRCP government to their woes, said R.V. Swamy, a JAC member.

‘Autocratic behaviour’

Nanda Kishore, another JAC member, said the team had apprised the Vice-President of the “autocratic behaviour of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who has not bothered to speak to the protesting farmers so far.”

He said that Mr. Venkaiah Naidu had assured the delegation that he would hand over their memorandum to the persons concerned in the government.

The farmers told him that they were agitated because they had given their lands for construction of a Capital at Amaravati, and now, when they tried to question the Chief Minister’s move to shift it out of the place, they were being subjected to police high-handedness. Cases were being framed against us for staging peaceful protests, they alleged.

‘Police ill-treatment’

They said that Mr. Venkaiah Naidu had accepted the photographs and videos submitted to him as proof of their “ill-treatment” by the police.

They also drew the Vice-President’s attention to the key aspects of the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014, and the fact that the Centre had allocated funds of ₹2,500 crore for Capital construction. Besides, the State had generated nearly ₹2,000 crore through the Amaravati Bonds. A total of ₹9,500 crore had been spent in the capital region by the government so far, and shifting it now would defeat the purpose of the whole exercise, they said.

Accusing the State government of unleashing anarchy in the State, they said the ruling party leaders were now resorting to “caste politics” to mislead people on the capital issue.

“It is a misconception that people of one particular caste dominate the capital region. In fact, farmers belonging to the Scheduled Castes outnumber others in these villages. We have lost the lives of 12 SC farmers for the cause of Amaravati so far,” said a farmer.

In an interaction with farmers, led by local MLAs Alla Ramakrishna Reddy and Undavalli Sridevi, Mr. Jagan said all concerns of people in Tadikonda, Thullur, Tadepalli and Mangalagiri mandals would be addressed. This interaction is the first since the agitation against relocation of capital to Visakhapatnam was launched by local residents.

Mr. Jagan assured that the concerns of farmers would be addressed and all support would be given to them to take up agriculture. The farmers explained to the Chief Minister that their multi-cropped lands fetched more value than the farmlands in uplands of Thullur, but the TDP government tried to give equal plots.

Irregularities alleged

Later, briefing mediapersons, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy alleged that the TDP regime had indulged in irregularities beginning with land pooling scheme and now, the YSRCP government was trying to bring all the accused to justice.

“The farmers appeared convinced about the idea of three capitals, after the Chief Minister told them of the historical necessity of decentralisation and the need to ensure equitable development of all the three regions,” he said.

92,2020/02/04,CID sees well-oiled network to corner lands in Amaravati,"As the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of the A.P. Police tightens its noose around those accused of indulging in questionable deals in the purchase of large land parcels in Amaravati during 2014-2019, more skeletons are tumbling out of the closet.

The CID has come out with “startling evidences” of some influential people tampering with the land records and surrendering the “non-existent” lands allegedly with the connivance of the Revenue and Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) officials in lieu of returnable plots from the CRDA.

For instance, in Lingayapalem, the total assigned lands acquired under the Land Pooling Scheme is 153.9 acres, which is under encroachment. They were allotted returnable plots under Jareebu classification. The CRDA had even started the process of regularising encroachment of 50 cents at Uddandarayunipalem.

The CID also unearthed “irregularities” in the allotment of lands to various private healthcare and educational institutions.

The CID, in its report, said that 850 acres of land was allotted to various institutions between July 2016 and December 2017 at variable prices. In contrast, 204.77 acres of land was allotted to the Central public sector units after taking a decision to fix a uniform price.

Land was allotted to private universities at ₹50 lakh per acre, and some lands were allotted at variable prices ranging from ₹15 lakh to ₹30 lakh. Similarly, 124.67 acres of land was allotted to State government institutions and two charitable trusts.

In the Capital region, 2,353.28 acres of land was assigned to the ex-servicemen and “political sufferers.”

The then government had framed the land pooling rules allegedly without amending the provisions in Rule 3 of the A.P. Assigned Lands POT Act, 1977, or the provisions in the SC/ST PoA Act, 1989.

Since the lands were assigned before 1954, they were listed in the prohibited properties under Section 22 A (1) (e) of the A.P. Assigned Lands POT Act.

Even the assigned lands were not spared, as the government orders were passed (GO Ms. Nos. 258, 580 and 575) to allow buyers to register the lands. They were later allotted returnable plots, which were registered in their names, after rejecting the claims of the original assigned land-holders after three years, the report said.

Many original assignees felt cheated as the government orders were issued much later and by that time, a lot of land had been purchased by the buyers after allegedly threatening the original land owners that their lands would be taken away by the government.

The CID probe revealed that 280 acres had allegedly been grabbed by the SC/ST land owners.

‘Cases will be registered’

“All these dubious land deals indicate that a well oiled network of politicians and their supporters connived with the Revenue and CRDA officials. We will register cases against all the accused. The Enforcement Directorate, Chennai, had taken cognizance of the CID report on dubious land deals in which white ration card holders bought lands worth ₹200 crore,” said Additional Director General of Police, CID, P.V. Sunil Kumar.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cid-sees-well-oiled-network-to-corner-lands-in-amaravati/article30737362.ece
93,2020/02/04,Amaravati will not be neglected: Minister,"Minister for Sports and Tourism Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has said that the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam can be built with minimum expenditure.

Addressing a meeting after inaugurating the newly laid synthetic tennis courts on the premises of the BR Stadium here on Tuesday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the decision to set up Executive capital in Visakhapatnam would have a long-term effect. It would spur development of the backward districts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. He lauded the Chief Minister for deciding to decentralise governance.

At the same time, Amaravati would not be neglected, he said. Besides being the Legislative capital, it would be developed into an educational hub, the Minister said.

The Minister’s observations came in the backdrop of the decision of government to expedite the shifting of the Heads of Departments out of Amaravati.

The G.O. issued on January 31 to shift the Offices of the Commissioner of Vigilance and Inquiries to Kurnool was challenged in the High Court.

The Minister also said that Guntur and Krishna districts had already been developed into trading hubs and it was the turn of the backward north coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions to witness development.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/amaravati-will-not-be-neglected-minister/article30737345.ece

Addressing the media here, Mr. Nayeem said the Katrinekona police booked cases against the PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited under the Petroleum Act, 1934, and the Negligence Act.

Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) Pilli Subash Chandra Bose said a meeting with officials of the PFH, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the Collector, and the SP was held to review the situation in the wake of the gas leak incident.

“We have discussed about the various government and private companies involved in the gas and oil exploration in the KG Basin. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who enquired about the incident, sought a report on the exploration works in the Konaseema region,” he said.

Social Welfare Minister P. Viswaroop said that 90% of the oil and gas operations were being carried out in the region, particularly in the Amalapuram Parliament segment. “But the security aspect has been ignored,” he alleged.

Compensation

“We discussed about the setting up of an integrated office by all the departments at Amalapuram to enable it to respond during emergencies at the earliest. We also discussed about payment of compensation to the Uppudi farmers and villagers and laying of the roads damaged due to the incident,” the Minister said.

Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu said people were afraid of the closed well at Uppudi village. A status report would be submitted to the State and the Central governments in 48 hours, he added.

Instructions had been given to Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy to estimate the loss occurred due to the gas leak at Uppudi and the neighbouring villages, Mr. Kannababu said.

Amalapuram MP Chinta Anuradha said the ONGC would submit a report after conducting a preliminary investigation. The government would pay compensation to the farmers and the villagers soon, she said.

95,2020/02/04,Officials study conditions for setting up water aerodrome,"Special Chief Secretary to the Government Karikal Valaven, along with district officials and a technical team, on Tuesday visited the Punnami Ghat and other areas in the catchment of the Krishna to assess the conditions for the proposed setting up of a water aerodrome project.

A water aerodrome is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes, or amphibious aircraft, for landing and taking off.

Later, talking to the reporters, Krishna district Collector A.Md. Imtiaz, who was part of the team, said the government, in association with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, would create the new facility near the Prakasam Barrage.

He said, besides promoting regional connectivity, the project would provide a major impetus to tourism as the planes would take off from here to tourist hubs such as Papikondalu and Nagarjun Sagar, besides operation of services to places such as Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru.

He said that Mr. Valaven, along with a team of technical experts, had gone around places that were connected to the project, and the government would move forward based on the suggestions of the technical experts.

Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Ltd. CEO Neena Sharma said the Civil Aviation Ministry would contribute funds to the tune of ₹50 crore and the State government would invest ₹10 crore for the project.

UDAN scheme

The proposal to set up water aerodromes across the country is part of the Centre’s UDAN scheme meant to promote regional connectivity by setting up regional airports.

Andhra Pradesh is one of the five States selected for the first phase of the project, besides Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Assam.

The move is aimed at promoting tourism and connect places of regional importance.

Ms. Roja flagged off and took part in the 3K marathon walk organised by the American Oncology Institute (AOI) and others to mark World Cancer Day as part of Nyla, a long-term campaign aimed at awareness on early detection of cancer in women.

Speaking on the occasion, she said early detection of cancer could not only prevent fatality but also lead to permanent cure.

97,2020/02/04,Paddy procurement: ryots urge govt. to clear dues,"Farmers on Tuesday staged a dharna here demanding payment of the pending amount for the paddy procured by the State government and compensation for the spurious seeds of paddy and maize in different parts of Krishna district.

The farmers under the aegis of the AP Rythu Sagnam and AP Kowlu Rythu Sangam (APKRS) gathered at the Koneru Centre where they raised slogans highlighting their plight.

“The authorities are yet to initiate action to clear the pending amount for the paddy procured through purchasing centres for more than two months as against the deadline of 72 hours since the procurement,” said M. Haribabu, Krishna district secretary of APKRS.

The farmers also alleged that the district authorities did not conduct a joint meeting of farmers and marketing and agriculture officials to discuss their issues. The paddy farmers in Bantumilli and Krithivennu mandals were badly hit due to the spurious seeds supplied by a Hyderabad-based firm.On the other hand, many farmers did not receive the bonus of ₹200 per quintal for maize offered by the State government.

“In the western Krishna, maize farmers from Bapulapadu and Mylavaram mandals have been waiting for compensation of ₹62 lakh to be paid by a government agency for supplying poor quality seeds,” said Mr. Haribabu.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/paddy-procurement-ryots-urge-govt-to-clear-dues/article30737031.ece
98,2020/02/04,YSRCP defends LPS for providing house sites for the poor,"Decrying those opposing Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) for providing house sites to poor people, YSR Congress Party spokesman and Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath said on Tuesday that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had taken a courageous decision to provide house sites to all people.

Addressing a press conference here, he said the TDP and Left parties were trying to give an impression that the scheme was aimed at giving away valuable lands to corporates and others. He said the intention of the Chief Minister was to see that no one remained homeless in the State.

Mr. Amarnath said one should understand that the government could only provide 50 house sites to poor besides 200 square yards to those surrendering assigned lands for each one acre acquired under LPS after leaving space for common amenities. He said the Chief Minister being a visionary had hit upon the novel idea to spend a huge amount for acquiring an estimated 3,200 acres in Visakhapatnam to give sites to all eligible families.

He said all the political parties should appreciate the government decision and extend their full cooperation to the novel gesture instead of trying to make baseless allegations. He also found fault with the allegations made by TDP leader and former Minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy earlier in the day on LPS.

Three capitals

Hailing the announcement of the Centre that the decision to choose capital was the discretion of the States, he said with this the formation of three capitals would become a reality soon.

Mr. Amarnath said in response to a question by TDP MP Galla Jayadev, the Home Ministry in a written reply stated that it was up to the State to decide where to locate the capital. He said at least now TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu should stop misleading the farmers of the Amaravati area.

Accusing Mr. Naidu of resorting to dirty tricks to stall the implementation of three capitals, he said he was trying to safeguard his interests after indulging in ‘insider trading’ before finalising Amaravati as the capital.

The YSRCP leader came down heavily on Mr. Naidu for stating that during nine months after the new government was formed in the State, the financial position had worsened, he blamed the TDP for borrowing ₹2.5 lakh crore during 2014-19 entailing a huge burden on the exchequer.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mtkavq/article30735324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05-VZ-YSRCP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-defends-lps-for-providing-house-sites-for-the-poor/article30735325.ece
99,2020/02/04,TDP criticises move to sell govt. land,"The YSRCP government’s proposal to sell government land is ill-conceived and any proceeds from such sale in Visakhapatnam should be parked with the VMRDA and spend for infrastructure in the district alone, former Minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said.

He criticised the manner in which land pooling was being taken up for housing for the poor in the district and the proposal to sell government land under ‘Mission Build A.P.’ at a press conference here.

“From where land would be provided for development in future like setting up of new institutions if government land was sold away?” he asked. “While 6,111 acres of assigned land was proposed for land pooling for housing for the poor, 4,000 acres in the district was reportedly identified for ‘Build A.P.,” he said.

Recalling that the then VUDA (VMRDA now) auctioned bulk land in Visakhapatnam for resource mobilisation when Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy was the Chief Minister, he said the urban development authority was later slapped an income tax notice of ₹150 core and it was still fighting the case.

The TDP leader threatened to sit on an indefinite fast if even a single rupee from such sale went out of the district. Admitting that the TDP government had also sold land, he said the proceeds were used for flyovers, drinking water etc.

Stating that farmers protested against land pooling for housing in Anakapalle, Bhimili and Parawada constituencies, Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy opposed any coercive means in land pooling. The government’s move to allot 48 square yards of land was itself in violation of municipal rules as no house should be constructed in less than 60 square yards, the former Municipal Administration Minister said.

He demanded that the poor be allotted 144 square yards of land and the government should complete the houses taken up by Township and Infrastructure and Development Corporation (TIDCO). It should also come out with how many houses would be constructed in the 6,114 acres under land pooling.

He said that his name, that of his son and Lokesh were dragged into land pooling at Mudapaka and wanted the YSRCP government to give his portion of the land since charges were made by MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy. Land pooling was not taken up by the TDP at places where people opposed it, he claimed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kskuin/article30735187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05-VZ-BANDARU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-criticises-move-to-sell-govt-land/article30735188.ece

Gas started gushing from a closed well in Katrenikona mandal in the district around 3 p.m. on Sunday, when the employees of PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited, which took lease of the well opened the valve of a pipe connected to it.

Mixed team of experts

ONGC Crisis Management and fire personnel from Rajahmundry, Narsapuram, and Mumbai were pressed into service to plug the leak. The Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Response and Fire Services personnel and some private agencies assisted the ONGC’s Crisis Management team in the operation.

About five companies, including a few government and private organisations, are involved in gas and oil exploration operations in the basin. However due to poor maintenance of the wells and pipelines, leakages were occurring creating panic, locals allege.

Fear and panic in villages

“Around 3 p.m. on Sunday, we heard heavy sound and the residents came out of the houses in Uppudi village. We found gas leaking from an abandoned well, and after sometime, the leakage has doubled. Village elders alerted the police, revenue and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) authorities,” said Aithabattula Mounica, an intermediate student of Uppudi village.

“Though gas was leaking from the well for the last 30 hours, ONGC personnel said it was natural gas and there was no danger to humans, animals or crops. But oil and kerosene smell was emanating from the gas gushing out of the well,” said Kunche Raju, who was taking shelter in a rehabilitation centre due to the Tuesday’s blow out incident.

Frequent incidents unsettling

“We saw the Nagaram, Devara Lanka and now the Uppudi gas and oil leakage incidents. The frequent mishaps are creating unrest among the villagers. Many people are suffering from respiratory problems. We request the officials to take measures to maintain the pipelines, closed and operational wells properly,” said Mr. Raju.

A farmer, Guttula Satyanarayana of Uppalaguptam mandal, said the Uppudi gas leak will impact the paddy crop and mango flowering. The gas and fog will form a layer on the crop and will effect the growth of the paddy crop,” he asserted.

“The frequent gas and oil blow outs are creating health problems to the aged and children. Some villagers are bed-ridden and can not come out immediately without the help of others. We are facing severe problem due to the negligent attitude of the officials,"" Mr. Satyanarana lamented.

“Property tax collection is the basic income source for the civic body. That is why we are focusing on collection of ₹ 48 crore long pending dues with the directive of the Special Officer of the Corporation and Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal.

The discovery of remnants of Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple atop the hill and two idols of Anjayenya Swamy and Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy and a tall broken statue of Kataya Vema Reddy has garnered attention, says Kalli Siva Reddy, convener of Kondaveedu Fort Committee.

The remnants of a Shiva temple was also discovered so was a pond, that has been converted into a Dargah where people still pray.

“The remnants indicate that the kings had patronised cultural forms, literature and performed many rituals for the well being of their kingdoms. We have also discovered a mandapam dedicated to Yogi Vemana,” said Mr. Siva Reddy.

Yet another temple, which caught their attention was Gangadhara Rameswaralayam, built by Miriyala dynasty. A beautiful pond constructed beside the temple and an anicut built connecting two hills, reveal the existence of a developed civilization. A mud baked wall was used to fortify the imposing kingdom.

106,2020/02/04,Green Cover project ushers in winds of change in drought-prone areas,"Global warming continues to affect rural livelihoods across the country. With the threat of climate change looming large, farmers are becoming concerned about its adverse impact. A sudden instance of a cloud burst, or a heavy downpour or a delayed monsoon can wreak havoc in a farmer’s life.

Tobacco major ITC, through its Green Cover campaign covering 1,350 acres in drought-prone Prakasam and Nellore districts, is driving a change in the rural hinterlands while providing farmers a cover against climate change, under its Mission Sunehrakal Programme.

Unlike the conventional tree plantation, the integrated approach in increasing green cover has been helping in sustaining trees and plants.

Under this programme, a village is taken as a base unit. Village panchayats are encouraged to adopt this programme and resolutions are passed regarding the maintenance and care of the green cover.

“We have made it mandatory for sheep and goat-rearers to ensure control on grazing in identified common lands,’’ said Venkateshwara Reddy, president of Village Institution for Commons Protection, Thimmareddypalem village. Cattle proof trenches are done around the borders of all the sites to restrict the grazing animals from entering the green cover area.

Improves soil health

The highlight of the project is integrating all the aspects of watershed management in the area to ensure improvement in soil health and increase moisture levels. In addition, the project ensures area treatment covering 3,400 hectares of watershed delineated in the area with 303 water ponds and 24 large water tanks built to conserve rain water in these common lands.

Some of the innovative techniques include construction of water absorption trenches, cattle proofing trenches around the borders and sunken ponds in small streams to arrest the top soil erosion.

109,2020/02/04,Absence of flowering worries mango farmers in Chittoor,"Less than 20% of flowering in about 1.4 lakh hectares of mango orchards in Chittoor district by January-end is definitely a worrisome phenomenon, maintain senior officials of the Horticulture Department. However, at the same time, they exude confidence that the district is all set to reap a golden harvest this year, though delayed.

Chilly nights and scorching heat in the day is the climatic description of Chittoor district, which continues to be the premier exporter of mangoes abroad apart from bulk supplies to the pulp industries.

In 2018, the district administration had to intervene to check unrest among mango growers in the wake of inordinate delay in the crop pattern, leading to purchase of the pulp category produce at ₹7 a kg in coordination with pulp industries. Some pulp industries claim that they were yet to receive the pending amount from the government. Then the crop pattern was delayed by nearly three months, but giving relief to farmers.

The year 2019 too witnessed a distressing spectacle in mango business, with highly plummeting yields, but registering superior quality.

Farm activity hit

In the last decade, agriculture activity took a beating in Chittoor after the district faced perennial drought from 2011 to 2015, forcing the farmers to switch to options such as mango. After some rain in November and December of 2015, the district once again witnessed nil rainfall for the next three years. In 2019, the northeast monsoon remained active in Chittoor, incredibly increasing the groundwater table. The unusual soil moisture pattern is now playing truant with the prospects of mango growers.

Weather blamed

Deputy Director (Horticulture) B. Srinivasulu told The Hindu that by November-end, the flowering should be rich in the district, as of now it is only 20%. “Drastic fluctuations in day and night temperatures are adversely impacting to the flowering aspect. Due to active north-east monsoon, the fresh vegetation on the mango trees occurred in October and November. This fresh vegetation would take at least three to four months to be ready to give into flowering. Hence, we are facing the problem,” he said.

“In spite of these conditions, our department scientists are hopeful of a bumper crop this year, coupled with the prospects of high quality produce,” the official said. The fluctuations in temperatures and moisture patterns were expected to be balanced in a few weeks, Mr. Srinivasulu added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/x52kk1/article30729905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-VJ-MANGOORCHARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/absence-of-flowering-worries-mango-farmers-in-chittoor/article30729906.ece
110,2020/02/04,CID seeks ED probe into ‘insider trading’,"The Crime Investigation Department (CID) of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) has found prima facie evidence of the defining of the boundary of the capital area (Amaravati) in such a way that it benefited some ‘connected people’ holding land on the fringes, during its inquiry into a fraudulent sale.

For instance, the sale-cum-agreement of land belonging to P. Bujji, a resident of Venkatapalem village in Guntur district, in October 2015, which led to the exposure of huge cash transactions and numerous land registrations done before the declaration of Amaravati as the capital was just one case.

As per sources, it is one of the several irregularities which Additional Director-General of Police (CID) P.V. Sunil Kumar requested the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Chennai, and also the Income-Tax Department (ITD) to examine the evidence and submit their findings to enable the CID to proceed further in the matter.

‘2 major irregularities’

The CID has drawn their attention to two types of irregularities which formed a part of the larger ‘insider trading’ scandal that allegedly took place in Guntur and Krishna districts to the tune of 2,280 acres and 1,790 acres respectively.

The two major irregularities are redesigning the boundaries of the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) area such that the land of the suspected prominent individuals or their relatives fell right adjacent thereto and redrawing of the boundaries of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) to bring in areas belonging to such persons into the CRDA zone.

These transactions took place between June 1 and December 31 of 2014 and the period thereafter and verification of the records of the Sub-Registrar Office and land pooling records maintained by the CRDA and Lands and Registration and Revenue Departments showed a clear breach of laws and multiple modus operandi of offences.

The lands were purchased in Thullur, Amaravathi, Tadikonda, Pedakurapadu, Mangalagiri, Pedakakani and Tadepalli mandals of Guntur district and Ibrahimpatnam, Penamalur, Vijayawada rural and Chandarlapadu mandals in Krishna district.

Citing these transactions, Mr. Sunil Kumar requested the ED to inquire whether money laundering or such fraudulent activities took place as some persons who did not even have PAN cards, and holders of white ration cards bought the lands by spending huge sums and most of them were cash transactions.

These buyers did not allegedly declare their incomes and were avoiding the payment of I-T in spite of having assessable incomes.

The I-T Department was asked to take suitable action against such defaulters.

Persons who were privy to the location of the capital purchased the lands just before a formal declaration thereof, certain highly placed individuals procured land through benami transactions, lanka, poramboke and government land towards the Land Pooling Scheme were fraudulently surrendered to receive returnable plots and the provisions of the A.P. Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act, 1977 and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 were violated.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cid-seeks-ed-probe-into-insider-trading/article30729834.ece

118,2020/02/04,Entire workforce of LIC Dharwad division go on one-hour strike,"Reacting sharply against the Budget proposal to list LIC in the stock exchange and sell part of its stake via public offering, the entire workforce of the LIC Dharwad division went on a one-hour strike here on Tuesday.

The insurance employees and officers affiliated to the Federation of LIC Class I Officers Associations, the National Federation of Insurance Field Workers of India (NFIFWI) and the All India Insurance Employees Association (AIIEA) staged the one-hour strike from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.

The protesting staff staged a demonstration in front of the LIC divisional office here, condemned the Union government’s move to sell of one of the premier public sector enterprises and urged the Centre to drop the proposal and take steps to strengthen the LIC in the larger interests of the people.

A release issued here stated that the joint front of three major unions representing over 90 %of LIC staff strongly opposed the Union government’s move. The LIC mobilises small savings of the people and makes them available for national development. Since its inception in 1956, the LIC has earned the trust and goodwill of millions of Indians and has set unprecedented performance records in the life insurance business.

Commencing its operations with a paltry sum of ₹ 5 crore in 1956, the LIC, today, commands an astronomically huge asset base of over ₹ 31 lakh crore. The total Life Fund of the LIC as on March 31, 2019 was ₹ 28.28 lakh crore and its market share in the insurance business is over 73 %, despite competition from private players during the last two decades.

Besides, the LIC has the proud distinction of contributing over 25 % to the total budgetary efforts and it recently paid a dividend of ₹ 2,611 crore to the Union government against an initial equity of ₹ 100 crore. The total dividend paid by LIC till date stands at ₹ 26,005.38 crore. LIC’s contributions to Independent India’s planned development and its investments in the social sectors of the economy have been phenomenal, the release said.

Union leaders U.M. Gadagkar, Krishna Anavatti, L.A. Naik, B.N. Poojary, Ashok Bongale, N.B. Kadam, Abdul Khan and others led the protest.

119,2020/02/04,Coronavirus: Isolation ward set up in K.R. Hospital,"As a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus, the health officials in Mysuru have set up a five-bed isolation ward in K.R. Hospital.

The district administration was ready to add five more beds to the isolation ward if the need arises. “The patients will be kept here for a minimum of 14 days and provided free treatment,” he said.

The isolation ward was receiving full cooperation from Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute. The treatment of patients suspected with coronavirus would be only symptomatic. “There are no vaccines available for this. The symptoms include fever, cough, running nose and in a few cases diarrhoea and breathing difficulties.”

While anti-inflammatory and anti-biotic medicines will be provided to patients suffering from fever, cough and running nose, persons with breathing difficulties will be provided with oxygen support. Private hospitals too have been told to set up isolation wards in their respective establishments.

Dr. Venkatesh said their team of officials had begun screening passengers arriving at the Mysuru airport from Monday. Similar teams will be spread across railway stations, bus stands, Mysuru zoo and palace.

“We will be only creating awareness and not spreading panic. If symptoms are found, we will carry out the medical investigation for free,” he said.

The standard medical test for persons suspected of coronavirus include throat swab test and blood serology test.

The samples will be sent to government medical institutions in Bengaluru for test and to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for confirmation.

“Only if the tests confirm the virus, will we declare. Doctors cannot disclose the same,” he said before adding that confirmed cases of coronavirus will be declared either by the District Health Officer or the Deputy Commissioner.

121,2020/02/04,Greens see red over appointment of mining baron to wildlife board,"The appointment of a mining baron to the State Wildlife Board has drawn the ire of conservation activists who have questioned the government’s decision.

A government circular dated January 22 cleared the names of four individuals, including Dinesh Singhi who is the owner of Bharat Mines and Minerals, Ballari.

The reason the appointment was being questioned is that the State Wildlife Board reviews the applications of various projects such as mining, highways, dams and other similar activities that come up in or around tiger reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and protected areas.

Kappatagudda

Activists have pointed out that this was a clear case of conflict of interest and the appointment was questionable as there are vested interest groups lobbying to de-notify the Kappatagudda Wildlife Sanctuary in Gadag. Though there were protests against its denotification, sources said there was pressure on the government by the mining lobby to de-notify the wildlife sanctuary status to Kappatagudda.

This is not the first time that stakeholders with conflict of interest with wildlife conservation have been appointed to the State Wildlife Board. This is similar to the appointment of a mini-hydel owner with a few forest offences to the wildlife board a few years ago.

The current move has been questioned by activists on the grounds that people with vested interest are being appointed to what should be the domain of ecologically concerned individuals.

Instead of appointing experts drawn from conservation and environmental sciences, the government is abetting lobby groups by clearing their appointment to such important statutory bodies, say the activists.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/greens-see-red-over-appointment-of-mining-baron-to-wildlife-board/article30736646.ece

The couple, residents of Angadihalli in Belur taluk, returned to their village on Monday after attending the programme and taking part in interactions with the Prime Minister and the President, among others.

Mr. Hooraja, on Tuesday, said that he along with other tribal people from different States met the Prime Minister on January 24. “I submitted a memorandum of our demands to Mr. Munda. The Prime Minister also took note of our demands and assured to look into them,” he said.

When he highlighted the fact that his people did not have a burial ground at Angadihalli, Mr. Munda was surprised.

“He wondered why the State government had not responded to the demand so far. The Minister assured me that the Ministry would make suitable recommendations to the State government. He also asked me to keep in touch with the department,” he said.

For years, the tribal community in the village has been demanding suitable land for a burial ground. Whenever someone dies in the community, they bury them in a vacant land or on the roadside, a practice normally opposed by other people. Mr. Hooraja has also demanded that the Centre resolve the difficulties that tribal communities face in continuing with their traditional occupations.

“We collect forest produces and prepare medicines for various ailments. But, the Forest Department has put many restrictions. We cannot freely collect plants we want and with that, it has been difficult for our livelihood. I have raised this issue during my interactions in Delhi,” he said.

Swaraanubhuthi will be held at the KSOU convocation hall in Mysuru between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. on February 9. Funds raised from the musical event will be used to further expand the programme. To buy tickets or make donations, call on 98863-79529, 88616-94057 or 99004-08284.

After starting a home-based care for the terminally ill during 2009-10, SVYM extended the facility to Hassan in association with Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences in June 2018. Presently, the home-based palliative care offered by SVYM is serving 392 patients in Mysuru and 270 patients in Hassan.

In January 2019, SVYM started a comprehensive palliative care centre in association with Mysore Medical College and Research Institute at PKTB Sanatorium and C.D. Hospital. It provides institutional care to patients when it becomes difficult to manage them at home as symptoms will be severe. “When they report acute symptoms, we admit them to our inpatient facility,” said Dr. Vibha from SVYM.

The centre currently has eight patients. “We have occupancy of 50% every day.” With the home-based care restricted to Mysuru and Hassan districts, the centre offers outpatient facility to patients from villages in Chamarajanagar, Mandya and Kodagu districts as well.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qojdwb/article30736614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMYSURUPALLIATIVECARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/musical-event-for-a-charitable-cause/article30736615.ece
125,2020/02/04,"IMA case: CBI books five police officers, including Nimbalkar and Hilori","The CBI has registered an FIR against five police officers, including IGP Hemanth Nimbalkar and DCP Ajay Hilori, in connection with the multi-crore IMA scam, charging them under various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

The FIR has been filed after getting sanction prosecution accord from the State government last week. The other officers named in the FIR include the then Inspector M. Ramesh and Sub-Inspector Gowri Shankar, working at Commercial Street police station, and E.B. Sridhara, Deputy Superintendent of Police, CID Economic Offence Wing.

Mohamed Mansoor Khan and three directors, including Nizamuddin, Vaseem and Arshad Khan, are also mentioned in the FIR. The CBI also mentioned other unknown government servants and private parties and further probe might includes their names.

The CBI in the FIR stated that since 2016, the Reserve Bank of India, which came to know about the IMA irregularities, asked the the then DCP East Mr. Hilori to conduct a probe and submit a report. Mr. Hilori in nexus with the Commercial Street police did not conduct proper inquiry and closed the case on August 2016, giving clean chit to IMA.

The case was later referred to the CID in July 2018, and the Investigating officer Mr. Sridhara was appointed as an inquiry officer, who gave a clean chit to the company on January 2019.

Mr. Nimbalkar, the then IG (CID-EOW), forwarded the report to the DGP, asserting that the inquiry did not find any wrongdoing on the part of the company, helping the IMA to continue its fraudulent activities unabated.

The above acts disclosed the accused officers’ concerted effort to protect the interest of Mohamed Mansoor Khan, instead of protecting the interest of the depositors, the FIR said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pqlvua/article30736307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGAJAYHILORI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ima-case-cbi-books-five-police-officers-including-nimbalkar-and-hilori/article30736309.ece
126,2020/02/04,Kalaburagi all set for sammelana today,"Kalaburagi is set to host the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana for the fourth time since the tradition began. The 34-acre ground on the Gulbarga University campus is ready with a huge pandal named after Sri Vijaya, the author of Kannada’s earliest available work Kavirajamarga.

With a capacity to accommodate around 25,000 participants at a time, this main venue will host all important events, while two others named after Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi will host all parallel sessions.

The huge kitchen built near the main venue saw hectic activity on the eve of the sammelana. Apart from 1.5 lakh groundnut holige, three lakh sweets – one lakh each of Besan Laddu, Motichur Laddu and Mysore Pak – have been prepared. Six lakh rotis have been brought from outside. Over 50 tonnes of rice have been stocked. As many as 618 stalls have been built to facilitate the sales and exhibitions of books, with stall clusters named after Kagina, Krishna, Bhima, and Karanja rivers that flow in the region.

The event will begin with Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi in-charge Govind Karjol and Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Manu Baligar unfurling the national flag and parishat flag on Wednesday, followed by a colourful procession in which president of the event H.S. Ventakeshamurthy will be brought to the venue traversing 5.5 km.

Later, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will inaugurate the fest and deliver his inaugural address. Chandrashekhar Kambar, president of the previous sammelana, will speak before Mr. Ventakeshamurthy will deliver his presidential address. Cultural events have been planned for all three venues every evening.

The valedictory event is on Friday at 4.15 p.m. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah and Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar will be chief guests.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kalaburagi-all-set-for-sammelana-today/article30736078.ece
127,2020/02/04,Kannada Sahitya Sammelana: Relevant to many in multiple ways,"Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, beginning on Wednesday at Kalaburagi, is the 85th edition of the annual event organised by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP).

While the annual event attracts thousands from across the State and carries the air of a fair (jatre), a question often asked is whether it has become a mere ritual or if it’s significant to language and culture. While perceptions vary on how the event should be structured, most believe that it is a tradition that has to go on and has takeaway for everyone.

“We cannot wish away a sammelana. It attracts lakhs of art and literature lovers from across the State. It also helps the book publishing business. I have attended 10 sammelanas and they have helped me build my brand,” says Bengaluru-based publisher Guru Hejjaji, who runs Akruti, a book shop. “Teachers and students come to buy books from our stalls. They are introduced to various kinds of books. They place orders for rare books. People from small towns that do not have large bookstores throng to the stalls.”

However, Mr. Hejjaji’s grouse is the absence of a platform for discussion on serious issues. “For example, this time I expected a discussion on CAA and NRC. I was disappointed,” he said. “KSP should be critical of the government. It should retain autonomy, even though the government funds sammelanas.”

Kalaburagi-based tour operator S.P. Patil feels the sammelana boosts tourism. “A large section of people approach us to hire taxis or mini buses to go around the district for sightseeing. This time, there have been a lot of inquiries from people wanting to visit Ganagapur Datta temple and Basava Kalyan,” he said.

Ramanna Sugandhi, a folk artiste from Haveri, finds no difference between sammelanas and other cultural programmes. “It helps us and other artists part of our troupe earn some money,” he said, adding that those who watch them perform at the sammelana give offers to perform elsewhere.

New Delhi-based young Kannada scholar Ramesh Aroli is not very optimistic of the event’s outcome. “Each year, the resolutions of the last sammelana are forgotten. There should be some review or action taken report by the KSP. But we spend all our time in organising the next event. We also waste time on avoidable controversies. There are lobbies of region, caste or political ideology in selection of the president and the venue,” he points out.

The sammelanas have lost their relevance, says S. Channabasavanna of Lohia Prakashana, a Ballari-based publishing house. “None of the parishat office-bearers or senior writers opposed the State government’s high handedness in the Chickamagaluru district sammelana. This shows that the parishat has moved away from real life,” he said.

Sammelana president H.S. Ventakeshamurthy says the sammelana should be welcomed and seen as a literary and cultural festival. “It brings together those interested in language and literature. Every writer responds to happenings in the world in his own way. But some may not to do so directly. It’s their individual perception,” he said. “Each sammelana has its significance.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p5jriw/article30739866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGPAGE5SAMMELAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kannada-sahitya-sammelana-relevant-to-many-in-multiple-ways/article30736077.ece

129,2020/02/04,51 cases against Made Gowda and other farmers withdrawn,"In a relief to farmers who participated in various protests, the State Cabinet on Tuesday decided to withdraw 51 cases pending against them.

Out of 51 cases, 35 are pending against farmers and their leader and former MP G. Made Gowda of the Cauvery Raitha Hita Rakshana Samiti of Mandya. At a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa it was decided that cases booked in connection with protests seeking Cauvery water would be withdrawn.

Briefing on the decisions taken by the Cabinet, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said criminal cases were pending against farmers who participated in protests related to the Yettinahole project in Hassan and the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project in Belagavi.

Asked whether the government had decided to withdraw cases against BJP and RSS activists, the Minister said no such decision was taken and a large number of cases were related to farmers.

Conspiracy case

In another major decision, the Cabinet authorised the police to further investigate a case of allegedly conspiracy against Sri Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swami of Ramachandrapura Mutt.

During the Kamadhana Poornima Utsav at Gokarna, some people are said to have distributed “vulgar” CDs and articles against Raghaveshwara Bharathi. The accused “conspired to create communal disharmony and committed acts which threatened the unity and integrity of society”, the Minister said.

Mr. Madhuswamy said the case was booked on April 1, 2010, at the Gokakarna police station under the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. The case was brought before the Cabinet during the rule of the Siddaramaiah government in 2015 for withdrawal, but a decision was not taken, the Minister said.

Public holidays

The Cabinet also decided to reduce the number of public holidays from 15 to 10.

Three policemen, along with two female members of the Child Welfare Committee, arrived at the school at 10.30 a.m. with a list of eight students. Mr. Hira, the investigating officer in the case, summoned the students in two batches in the afternoon and questioned them for over two hours.

It is learnt that the investigating officer asked the same set of questions already asked to other students — such as who scripted the play, who wrote the dialogues, who taught the dialogues, whether or not they watched the rehearsal and so on. The police also asked the students whether or not their parents had watched the play when it was staged during the school’s annual day celebrations. In such cases, the police took down details of the parents. Eighty students have been subjected to questioning so far.

Bail pleas

The petition for anticipatory bail filed by five people related to the school, including its head Abdul Qadir, and another petition for interim bail filed by Nazbunnisa, the mother of the child who delivered the controversial dialogues in the play, and Fareeda Begum, the headteacher who supervised the play, are posted for hearing on Wednesday.

132,2020/02/04,700 cameras to secure Manasagangotri,"The century-old University of Mysore (UoM) has taken up the major task of securing its 739-acre sprawling Manasagangotri campus by installing 700 high-definition closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs). The entire campus will soon be under camera surveillance as the work to put in cameras has taken off.

Though some locations of the campus had been already under camera surveillance, they are said to be inadequate considering the size of the campus and new facilities that have come up.

The campus, located in the heart of the city, is one of the biggest in the State. Kukkarahalli Lake, a major lung space and bird habitat, is considered a jewel of Manasagangotri.

Despite having private security for guarding its properties and patrol teams going around the campus in the night, the University authorities felt the need for camera surveillance and set up a centralised control room with dedicated staff for monitoring the camera footage.

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemanth Kumar told The Hindu over phone from Indore that the camera surveillance was proposed for keeping the campus safe.

“The places where the cameras have to be installed had been identified and the agency installing the cameras is on the job. In less than one or two months, the installation work will be completed,” he added.

Prof. Kumar, who is in Indore on an official visit, said the footage retrieved from the cameras will be monitored round-the-clock by the staff appointed for the purpose. “This will keep the campus protected from any untoward incidents.”

The area abutting Kukkarahalli Lake is spread across 239 acres. The lake environs attract hundreds of walkers in the mornings and evenings.

The University has 63 PG departments offering 76 postgraduate programmes with more than 1.20 lakh UG, PG, M.Phil, and Ph.D students. There are 11 PG departments with national research facilities where Indian and international students pursue research. The students also include those pursuing courses in the PG campuses of Mandya, Hassan and Chamarajnagar.

Manasagangotri campus is also a hub for international students with students from about 63 countries pursuing various courses and doing research.

This could be one of the biggest exercises of installing surveillance cameras in Mysuru by a public institution.

The Mysuru City Police have installed around 50-plus cameras for identifying traffic offences and law and order management.

The visuals from the cameras are monitored at the centralised command room set up in the office of Police Commissioner. The real-time images help the police in catching those flouting the traffic rules on camera.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9iz1x8/article30735641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MYSUOMCAMERAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/700-cameras-to-secure-739-acre-manasagangotri/article30735031.ece
133,2020/02/04,Kerala passengers screened at checkposts on Karnataka border,"Passengers arriving by various modes of transport from Kerala were being screened at two checkposts on the border in Chamarajanagar district after Kerala declared a State calamity following three confirmed cases of novel Coronavirus.

So far, no suspected cases had been reported in the district but the health authorities are on high alert as Chamarajnagar shares its border with Kerala and a lot of people travel between the city and the towns in Kerala.

“The screening for passengers is being done as a precautionary measure since Sunday. There is no need to panic since all preventive measures had been taken for the prevention and control of the disease. The surveillance had been stepped up with three Coronavirus cases reported from the neighbouring State,” said District Health Officer Ravi M.C.

Two health teams had been deployed at Moolehole and Bandipur checkposts for the screening of passengers.

The teams screen for symptoms and seek the passengers’ travel history besides finding out whether they had any contact with the people who had recently visited China or with the patients/relatives tested positive.

“We don’t see all of them suspiciously. If they show noticeable symptoms, we subject them to further tests at the isolation ward set up at Gundlupet general hospital and Chamarajnagar district hospital. So far, no suspected cases had been reported. We have continued the surveillance and continuous monitoring is being done,” he added.

The health authorities are also distributing pamphlets to educate the public on the disease as an awareness building exercise.

Chinese under surveillance

Three Chinese nationals had been under surveillance near Gundlupet.

The DHO said: “On knowing about the presence of the Chinese nationals who are currently running a flower extract unit near Gundlupet, we met them and screened them as a precautionary measure. They are in the town since many days and are not from Wuhan. They belong to a different region in China. However, they displayed no symptoms of the virus but they had been advised to remain under isolation as a preventive measure.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kerala-passengers-screened-at-checkposts-on-karnataka-border/article30733595.ece
134,2020/02/04,Curbs on private vehicles on Mysore varsity campus,"The University of Mysore has restricted entry of private vehicles, especially autorickshaws, taxis and goods vehicles, into the sprawling Manasagangotri campus here and vehicles of students and staff are being allowed upon showing their identity proof.

The authorities have proposed to fully curb private vehicle movement into the campus in the coming days and restrictions imposed from Monday had been done on an experimental basis.

The securitymen posted at the entry gates have placed movable barricades and are allowing the vehicles after checking the purpose of visit.

In order to turn the sprawling campus ‘green’, two zero emission buggies had been introduced recently for ferrying students, visitors and the public.The university hopes to add a few more buggies to implement the “no-private-vehicle-inside-Manasagangotri campus” idea.

“The campus was used as a transit route by the people to visit localities and connecting roads abutting the campus. Many universities in the country have banned private vehicles into their campuses. Firstly, we stopped movement of trucks and buses inside the campus and now it’s the turn of other private vehicles barring the students’ and staff vehicles,” said Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar.

He told The Hinduthat those having work on the campus can make use of the buggies for reaching their destination. “We wanted to introduce some user fee but the buggy ride has been made free for the time being.”

Vehicle passes

He said there are also plans to issue vehicle passes to the students and the staff while implementing “total ban” on private transport inside the campus.

Buggies are being currently operated from the main university gate on Bogadi Road and from the gate near Senate Bhavan off Hunsur Road.

Each buggy has cost the university ₹9 lakh and the cost for its operation was around ₹35,000 a year.

Prof. Kumar said the university has proposed to ban all private vehicles inside the campus in the night barring those belonging to the hostel inmates and research scholars, who work in the labs in the night, as an exceptional case.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ri7nfe/article30735865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MYSVEHICLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/curbs-on-private-vehicles-on-mysore-varsity-campus/article30733398.ece

139,2020/02/04,Questions over quality of breakfast for pourakarmikas,"Questions have been raised over the quality of breakfast served to pourakarmikas engaged in keeping Mysuru city clean. A recent meeting of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) saw councillorrs complaining against the quality of breakfast served to the estimated 2,500 pourakarmikas in Mysuru.

Ever since the MCC launched the breakfast scheme on November 15 last year, the pourakarmikas, who leave their homes as early as 5 a.m. to report for work at their designated work-spot at 6 a.m., were served breakfast every day during a 9 a.m. break. The breakfast used to vary from idli/chutney to uppitu and kesari bhaath to pongal every day.

But, the complaints of poor quality were raised in the MCC council meeting held last Thursday with a few even suggesting that the MCC provide the pourakarmikas with a daily breakfast allowance of ₹20 per day instead.

Mayor Tasneem decided to refer the matter to the MCC’s Standing Committee on Health. MCC’s Health Officer Nagaraju said the proposal to discontinue the breakfast scheme and replace it with a breakfast allowance was not a good idea. For, most of the pourakarmikas, if not all, leave their homes early in the morning and they will not have time to prepare breakfast and eat. They come on empty stomach.

Providing breakfast allowance does not guarantee that the pourakarmikas will have their breakfast, argued Dr. Nagaraju.

Instead, the MCC should consider changing the breakfast contractor or serving the contractor with a notice to improve the quality of breakfast, Dr. Nagaraju added.

The MCC has given a contract to supply breakfast to the estimated 2,500 pourakarmikas at a cost of ₹1.74 crore per annum.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/o2zquw/article30731985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MYSPOURO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/questions-over-quality-of-breakfast-for-pourakarmikas/article30731986.ece

Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the allocations and grants from the Union government to Karnataka were being reduced year after year and the Union government was not releasing full grants under the 15th Finance Commission.

He said that the Union government was meting out injustice to States, particularly in the South, while additional grants were being given to North-Eastern States. “The Chief Minister should disclose all these issues during the budget presentation. We will also raise the issue during the discussion on budget. The GST collection has gone down. Consequently, they are going to cut down allocations to the State,” he said.

Though she had submitted all the required documents with regard to cancellation of the bail to the district police, so far they had not arrested him, she said.

Ms. Parvathi said that she suspected that political leaders were pressurising the police department on this issue. “If the district police fail to arrest the accused in the next three days, I will sit on a fast unto death in front of the District Police Office on February 7,” she said. She had also decided to file a contempt of court petition before the Supreme Court if the police failed to arrest the accused, Ms. Parvathi said.

Hemanth, Bharath’s brother, said his mother had borrowed money to approach the SC and get bail cancelled. Despite this, the accused was absconding.

Meanwhile, Police Department sources said that two teams were trying to trace Mr. Kanchan, who was absconding.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kota-murder-family-accuses-police-of-inaction/article30730271.ece
142,2020/02/04,Wild tusker spotted in Dorasamudra,"A wild tusker was seen in Dorasamudra, a historical tank close to Hoysaleshwara temple, in Halebid on Monday. Morning walkers noticed the animal.

Soon, many had gathered on the bank. The residents took pictures and videos of the animal and within hours these went viral in the district. Forest Department officials rushed to the place as soon as they were informed about the elephant in the tank. The police also surrounded the tank to avoid any man-elephant conflict.

The officers felt it would be difficult to drive the animal back to the forest in the day time as it would be difficult to handle the crowd in the busy tourist place. They ensured that it remained in the water till evening.

Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that animal would be driven away to the nearest forest area in the evening. “We have staff at the spot and policemen are also with us. We will ensure the animal returns to the forest area safe without harming anybody”, he said.

The operation to drive the animal was going on till late in the evening.

143,2020/02/04,‘Malgudi Days’ set for release on Feb. 7,"The Kannada movie Malgudi Days, that dwells upon an aged person reminiscing about his childhood and related incidents will release on February 7.

Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Vijay Raghavendra, the actor who plays the lead role, and director Kishore Moodbidri said hopes were pinned on their film as a lot of effort had gone into making it.

This is the first Kannada film for the director, who has earlier directed Tulu film. Clarifying that the film had nothing to do with the tele-serial of the same name directed by Shankar Nag, Mr. Raghavendra said that the film was in no way related to the work of novelist R.K. Narayan. He said the make up for the older look took over three hours and he had to shed over 18 kg to play the teenager.

Mr. Kishore said they were preparing for the release in theatres and multiplexes across the State. “We hope that it will be well-received by movie goers,” he said.

As part of the film’s promotion, the film crew visited a few colleges including Samarth PU College.

It has been organised by the Karnataka State Spice Development Board (KSSBD), Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, and farmer’s clubs.

A release issued by the KSSDB MD Manjunath Narayanapur said this event has been organised to cater the needs of both chilli growers and customers and facilitate direct contact between them.

M.S. Archana, Deputy Commissioner, released the posters and instructed officials to initiate measures to distribute de-worming tablets to children from anganwadi centres to colleges, and even to school dropouts, across four taluks in the district.

147,2020/02/04,Survey of Sulekere lake begins,"The work of surveying Sulekere lake, the main water source for the frequently drought-affected Davangere and Chitradurga districts, has commenced to clear its encroachment and thereby enhance the storage capacity of the large waterbody.

This lake in Channagiri taluk of Davangere district is also called Shanti Sagar. The total water storage capacity of the lake is at 2.67 tmcft. Haridravathi and Mavinahole rivulets form its main water sources. It irrigates 7,250 acres of land and is a source of drinking water for 110 human habitats including Chitradurga city; Channagiri and Jagalur towns.

There are complaints that large tracts of land belonging to the lake have been encroached upon and converted into cultivable land. The encroachment has resulted in flooding of many villages in the vicinity when the water reaches the brim.

“According to functionaries of Khadga Samaja Samsthe, an organisation of local farmers that has conducted awareness programmes on development of the lake, the total area of the waterbody that was at 6,500 acres in the 1980s has reduced to 5,447 acres now owing to encroachment”. More than 400 families in Basavarajapura, Rudrapura and surrounding villages in the catchment area of the lake are dependent on fishing for their livelihood. The Department of Fisheries has also established a fish rearing centre in Sulekere.

Ganganna, a fisherman from Kabbala village, told The Hindu that owing to a decline in the water storage caused by encroachment and accumulation of silt, the fish catch has also come down. The decline in the water storage capacity is rendering fishermen jobless in April and May every year, pushing them to work as construction labourers in Davangere city. Even agricultural land on the tail-end region of the command area of the lake is facing shortage of water. Shivarajappa, a paddy grower from Basavapattana village, said that earlier they used to get water from Sulekere for two crops in a year. In recent times, there is shortage of water even for the kharif crop, he said.

Responding to the demand from farmers and fishermen for encroachment clearance and silt removal, the State government has released an amount of ₹11 lakh to survey the lake. During the survey, the boundaries of the lake would be marked and fixed. A proper map of the lake would be prepared after which the encroachment would be cleared. Thippaswamy H., Assistant Engineer with Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd., told The Hindu that the responsibility of survey work has been assigned to a private agency and the report is likely to be ready by the end of this month.

Raghu B.R., a resident of Honnemaradahalli, said it was necessary to enhance the storage capacity of Sulekere to mitigate the effects of drought in Davangere and Chitradurga districts.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x087v3/article30730031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGSHIVAMOGGASULEKERE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/survey-of-sulekere-lake-begins/article30730033.ece
148,2020/02/04,Narayana Gowda confident of place in Karnataka Cabinet,"Bharatiya Janata Party leader K.C. Narayana Gowda, who represents K.R. Pet constituency, on Monday announced that he would be sworn in as a Minister in the B.S. Yediyurappa Cabinet on Thursday.

Mr. Gowda, the first and lone BJP legislator from Mandya district, told presspersons that the Chief Minister had invited him to take oath at a function to be held at Raj Bhavan. He invited elders, leaders and party workers from across the district to attend the function and bless him. “I will follow the path set by the honourable Chief Minister Yediyurappa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to develop the constituency,” he said.

According to sources close to the leader, Mr. Yediyurappa had promised to make Mr. Gowda the Minister in charge of Mandya and Hassan districts.

Mr. Gowda, a businessman-turned-politician, won from the constituency as a Janata Dal (S) leader in 2013 and 2018. However, he quit the JD(S) and was re-elected on BJP ticket in the December 2019 byelections.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/narayana-gowda-confident-of-place-in-karnataka-cabinet/article30729899.ece
149,2020/02/04,Cabinet aspirants among BJP old-timers band together and hold meeting,"Bharatiya Janata Party MLAs aspiring to become Ministers seem to have banded together and are learnt to have held a meeting to lobby for their inclusion. According to sources in the party, the meeting saw the participation of around 10 MLAs. MLA for Surpur Raju Gowda told reporters that the legislators had indeed held a meeting and another one was planned.

Spooked by this, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa spoke to most of the MLAs who attended the meeting over phone in an attempt to placate them, sources said. He spoke to Mr. Raju Gowda, K. Shivanagouda Naik, G.H. Thippareddy, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Anand Mamani, S.A. Ramdas, and Murugesh Nirani, and promised to rehabilitate them and consider them during the next Cabinet expansion.

Major Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar told presspersons in New Delhi on Monday that such lobbying and dissatisfaction was common during any ministerial expansion and there was no crisis as such now. “The Chief Minister has spoken to most of the aspirants over phone. I also spoke to some of them and asked them to wait for their chance,” he said.

He is also learnt to have held a meeting of strategists close to him and discussed with the State intelligence to take stock of the situation. “The MLAs who have come together seem to be more interested in their individual interests. With no force outside the party actively trying to pull down the government, the dissidence is unlikely to precipitate a crisis and is likely to blow over,” one of the strategists said.

While most of these aspirants are opposed to the supposed induction of C.P. Yogeshwar, who was defeated in the 2018 Assembly elections, into the Cabinet, some are making a case for a spot based on caste and regional balance. Mr. Raju Gowda has pitched for a ministry for Kalyana Karnataka region and Kalaburagi district. Mr. Yatnal has said that, given the circumstances of newcomers having to be accommodated, a Cabinet rejig was the only way out. He has also launched an attack on the present Ministers, arguing that non-performers should be dropped. “There are many Ministers who are inaccessible even to MLAs... they don’t even come to the Vidhana Soudha. The performance of Ministers has to be evaluated and non-performers removed,” he said on Monday.

Disqualified MLAs

Meanwhile, A.H. Vishwanath and N. Nagaraj (MTB), disqualified MLAs who were defeated in the December 2019 bypolls, are still making their case to be made Ministers. Mr. Vishwanath, who met Mr. Yediyurappa at his residence in the city on Monday, said that he had not sought a ministry for himself and that it was left to the Chief Minister. However, elsewhere, he argued that Mr. Yediyurappa must consult legal experts and that though disqualified and defeated in bypolls, they could be made Ministers. “Once we filed nominations, the blot [of disqualification] went away,” he argued.

However, sources in the government said that Article 164 (1B) of the Constitution was clear in imposing a ban on legislators disqualified for defection from being appointed Ministers till they are elected to either House of legislature. Thus, these disqualified MLAs can be made Ministers only after they becoming members of the Legislative Council now, sources said. Mr. Nagaraj, who met the Chief Minister on Sunday, told presspersons on Monday that he was confident that Mr. Yediyurappa would stand by his words and fulfil all his promises. Mr. Yediyurappa is learnt to have assured the duo and another disqualified MLA, R. Shankar, that they would be considered for Council membership in June and to be made Ministers subsequently.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-aspirants-among-bjp-old-timers-band-together-and-hold-meeting/article30729872.ece
150,2020/02/04,Former Karnataka Minister D. Manjunath passes away,"Former Legislative Council Chairman D. Manjunath, 92, passed away here on Monday after a brief illness. He leaves behind his wife and two sons.

In recent years, Mr. Manjunath had withdrawn from active politics because of age and illness. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy were among those who offered condolences.

Mr. Manjunath was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1967 from Hiriyur and became Deputy Speaker. Mr. Manjunath had a long association with the Janata Parivar after his initial association with the Congress. His last stint as Minister came during the JD(S)-BJP coalition, when he became Minister for Forests and Higher Education in the Kumaraswamy Cabinet.

Between 1984 and 1987, he held the Labour, Education and Planning portfolios in the Ramakrishna Hegde Cabinet. He was Higher Education Minister in the JD (S)-Congress coalition government, headed by N. Dharam Singh, between 2004 and 2006. He also served as Revenue Minister in the J.H. Patel Cabinet.

151,2020/02/04,Karnataka Cabinet expansion: Yediyurappa’s Kumathalli conundrum,"The matter of inducting newly elected MLA Mahesh Kumathalli into the State Cabinet has become a bone of contention between Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and the BJP high command, according to sources.

The Chief Minister had repeatedly assured party-hopper MLAs that all of them would be made Ministers. He is keen on inducting Mr. Kumathalli as well. However, the party’s central leadership is said to have blocked his candidature, clearing the names of 10 other newly elected MLAs.

Mr. Kumathalli, a close associate of Ramesh Jarkiholi, who led the rebellion against the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, had defeated the BJP’s Laxman Savadi in Athani in the 2018 Assembly elections. He later joined the BJP. But as Mr. Yediyurappa formed the government, the party high command imposed on him three deputies, in an apparent attempt to groom the “next-generation leadership”. One of them — Mr. Savadi, who belongs to the Lingayat community that the Chief Minister also belongs to — is said to be a choice Mr. Yediyurappa is reportedly not happy with.

The high command has now reasoned that the party cannot give two ministerial berths to the same Assembly constituency. This apparent attempt to safeguard the turf of the Lingayat leader of their choice has reportedly upset the Chief Minister. Sources say he is keen to induct Mr. Kumathalli as he had publicly promised to do so twice.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kumathalli, who had said he was “deeply hurt” by the developments on Sunday, expressed confidence on Monday that the Chief Minister would not abandon him. “I have come out victorious in the chakravyuha of Belagavi politics. If Ramesh Jarkiholi stands first for making Yediyurappa Chief Minister, I will come only second in the order. Laxman Savadi was made a Deputy CM for party organisation purposes and I respect that. But that doesn’t mean I must pay the price. None of this mattered when I resigned and joined the BJP,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-cabinet-expansion-yediyurappas-kumathalli-conundrum/article30729767.ece
152,2020/02/04,"Seven months on, fresh seniority lists yet to be published by 22 departments","More than seven months after the Supreme Court upheld the Consequential Seniority Act that provides for reservation in promotions for employees from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities, 22 government departments are yet to publish their seniority lists. The departments have now been given a week’s time to complete the process.

Following the court order, the government twice issued orders to the department heads to initiate the process of drawing up seniority lists and publishing them, in line with the 2017 Act. However, during a recent meeting of the legislature committee on welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it was revealed that 22 departments had not published the seniority lists yet.

In a letter to the heads of these 22 departments on January 31, P. Hemalatha, Secretary of the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), has asked the departments to complete the process within a week. She has drawn their attention to the Supreme Court order as well as previous orders to finalise the seniority list, and said that the government was viewing this delay seriously. The letter also cites the meeting of the legislature committee, where its members expressed serious concern and displeasure over the delay in implementing the earlier orders.

“The seniority lists in 22 departments have not been drawn up as it is seen as against the interests of the General category employees. Departments have not adhered to the earlier direction of the Chief Secretary, who had asked that the list be finalised within a month,” said D. Chandrashekaraiah, legal advisor to the the Karnataka State Government SC/ST Employees Coordination Committee. He said that responsibility had to be fixed on the erring officials.

While 3,799 SC and ST officials were demoted after the court direction in the B.K. Pavithra case, 5,002 General category employees had been promoted. According to Mr. Chandrashekaraiah, barring 22 officials, all those who were demoted have been restored to their earlier cadre. He, however, said that barring a few General category officials, most officials remain in the promoted cadre, and a fresh seniority list was important to set right the imbalance.

Order on pension

In another circular, the government has said that the pension of those who retired after being demoted owing to an earlier Supreme Court order, had to be fixed for the cadre that the officials held before demotion. According to the committee, about 650 SC and ST officials and employees retired from service after they were demoted as per the court order. According to the earlier government order, the pension would be fixed according to the cadre in which the official retired.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/seven-months-on-fresh-seniority-lists-yet-to-be-published-by-22-departments/article30729726.ece
153,2020/02/04,Staff laxity sees PWD Secretary almost get arrested,"The callous response of the lower staff in the Public Works Department (PWD) towards a series of directions issued by the Kalaburagi Bench of the High Court almost put a PWD Secretary in trouble last week, with the court issuing a non-bailable arrest warrant against him. This led to PWD Secretary B. Guruprasad rushing to the High Court to tender an apology.

“Despite the court asking for a file at least three times, the lower staff ignored it. It was also not brought to the notice of the higher-ups, thus resulting in a serious situation against the Secretary,” a PWD source told The Hindu.

The matter pertained to the transfer of a junior engineer, who questioned it in the court. The High Court asked for original records of the transfer file from the department. When the file was not produced, the court issued summons. When the department did not respond to the summons, the court issued a bailable warrant. When this was also not taken seriously, it issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against the PWD Secretary and asked the Kalaburagi Police Commissioner to produce him in court.

According to sources, when the Kalaburagi police arrived at the Vidhana Soudha to take Mr. Guruprasad to court, the lower officials maintained that he was not available. Incidentally, Mr. Guruprasad was at a Kannada Development Authority meeting convened by the Chief Secretary at the Vidhana Soudha. “The court was upset at its orders not being followed,” the source said.

Mr. Guruprasad, while acknowledging the turn of events, refused to elaborate on the matter. It is now learnt that two officers, including one of Undersecretary rank, have been relieved and show-cause notices issued to four more for failing to bring the court matter to the notice of the higher-ups and for ignoring the HC orders. A report on the action taken has been submitted to the court, sources said.

Nodal officer to monitor court cases

On directions from the Kalaburagi Bench of the High Court, the State can have a nodal officer to monitor court cases various departments will be party to.

Based on directions from the court, Public Works Department Secretary B. Guruprasad has written a letter to the Law Secretary and the Advocate General to appoint a nodal officer to monitor cases in lower courts, administrative tribunal, and the High Court. “Many times, old cases come up or we are given only the petition number of the case. They require some study before we go to court. A nodal officer could help in monitoring the progress in the case and [can] also bring the developments to the notice of the officers concerned,” a source said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pwd-secretary-almost-gets-arrested-due-to-laxity-of-staff/article30729670.ece

155,2020/02/04,Syro-Malabar Church firm on its stance on ‘love jihad’,"The synod of the bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church says it has not approached the issue of ‘love jihad’ in a way that would affect the longstanding friendship with the Muslim community.

In a statement here on Tuesday, the Syro-Malabar Media Commission said the synod had only expressed its opinion that inter-religious love affairs caused family troubles and that such cases should be inquired into. And, the circumstances in which the bishops raised the demand continued to exist.

The statement comes in the wake of protests against the stance of the synod on ‘love jihad’ in the second week of January. The synod had then called for inquiries into instances of ‘love jihad’ in which Christian girls fell victims to inter-religious love affairs. In some cases, such girls also joined terrorist organisations such as the Islamic State, the bishops had said.

However, Tuesday’s statement from the Church said the Union Home Ministry had made clarifications on the issue in the Lok Sabha. It had said that there were no instances of ‘love jihad’ or ‘love affairs with malicious intentions’ reported in Kerala. There was no mention of ‘love jihad’ in the existing set of laws, the government said.

The Church statement, however, said the synod’s opinion on the issue was based on information received from its various dioceses.

156,2020/02/04,Opposition walks out over UAPA arrests,"The Opposition walked out of the Assembly on Wednesday after Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan disallowed their motion to adjourn the House to debate the “questionable” arrest and incarceration of two students, both CPI(M) activists at Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode on UAPA charges in November last.

Deputy Leader of the Opposition and IUML legislator M.K. Muneer, who sought the leave of the House for the adjournment debate, disputed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s claim that the National Investigation Agency had taken over the case against the youngsters, Alan Shuhaib, 19, and Taha Fasal, 21, on their own.

He said the State police steered by Mr. Vijayan had opened the door for the NIA to step in by branding the youth as Maoists and slapping the black law on them without an iota of evidence. The CM was cagey about the circumstances of their arrest. The police have no case they had participated in a terrorist action or plot, Dr. Muneer said.

The families of the youth were ardent communists. They felt betrayed by Mr. Vijayan. So did ordinary CPI(M) workers in Kozhikode. Dr. Muneer wondered whether Kerala had become a super police State under Mr. Vijayan where secret surveillance of students and thought policing was the order of the day.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Vijayan shared Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s views on UAPA and urban Maoists. He had made light of the plight of the youngsters and stigmatised them as terrorists.

Mr. Vijayan had cast down his party members into the purgatory of imprisonment without scope for bail, he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the Congress was shedding crocodile tears for the victims of the very black law they had authored in 2008. The party empowered the Centre to overrule the State and transfer “scheduled offences” under the Act to the NIA.

The Opposition sought to portray the accused as “innocent fawns”. The police had arrested them when they met Usman, an accused in several UAPA cases. However, Usman gave the police the slip and remained at large.

He said terrorists of varying ideologists often found common ground against the system they sought to topple. Maoists have links with other radical outfits, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opposition-walks-out-over-uapa-arrests/article30737296.ece

He was speaking after a meeting of health experts convened by the KUHS at Mulangunnathukavu on Tuesday.

The mission gains more importance as there were many instances in which people who returned from China have refused to report to the Health Department and people in home quarantine fail to follow the guidelines.

“Against the backdrop of the emergence of more and more infectious diseases, we need to build a better and broader public health system. Kerala could create a model for the world in public health system,’’ said Sunil Chacko, a former research faculty member at Harvard University and a public health expert.

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar made the observation while quashing a criminal case registered against a lawyer from Kalpetta for trying to converse with an imprisoned accused in a drug case after allegedly pushing down an escorting woman constable. The lawyer was charged under Sections 341(wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duties) of the Indian Penal Code.

159,2020/02/04,"nCoV: screening, contact tracing pose a challenging task","Even as the Health Department tights its surveillance strategies and revises the guidelines daily to suit new situations, strict filtering of those returning from China and other nCoV-affected countries has not been happening.

“International flights are being monitored, where travellers are asked to stop at the health desk and at the immigration desk and their travel details are collected. However, no such screening seems to be happening at domestic airports. The third patient in Kasaragod, who has been tested positive for nCoV, had flown from Wuhan to Kolkata. From there, he had taken a flight to Bengaluru and yet another flight to Kochi, where he came out through the domestic terminal, with no questions asked. We have no idea how to fill these gaps. We are appealing to all those who have travelled to China recently or are returning from other affected countries to voluntarily report because this is a public health emergency,” a senior Health official told The Hindu.

Contact tracing has become a nightmare in this particular case.

“It is a huge and painstaking task. In every flight, we have to trace the fellow passengers of the patient on the same row of seats, three rows in front and three rows behind. We have sought the help of the police, but this backtracking is sucking up all our resources and manpower,” he added.

Self-reporting

Self-reporting had been happening, but despite all efforts put in by the department, some were wilfully trying to beat the system, he said.

“Home quarantine for 28 days is indeed a difficult proposition. We are suggesting that the persons try to confine themselves to a room as far as possible and reduce interaction with the family,” he added.

Another gap in the system is that the Health Department still has no idea how it can monitor tourist arrivals and how they can be monitored as this is a moving population. As on Tuesday, 2,421 persons with recent travel links to China or other nCoV-affected countries are in surveillance in the State. While 100 people who displayed mild symptoms are in isolation facilities in hospitals, the rest (2,321) are on monitored self- quarantine at their own homes.

Counselling

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said considering the psycho-social aspects of persons under quarantine and isolation, the department had readied teams of mental health experts in all districts to visit those in homes and hospitals and to counsel them.

Three more persons were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of nCoV in Alappuzha district on Tuesday.

The condition of the student admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, with nCoV infection was satisfactory, the District Collector said.

The directive comes in the wake of a fine of ₹10,000 imposed on a homestay at Wagamon for serving meals on plastic-coated plates.

It had been found that the hotel staff forced the guests to have meals on plastic-quoted plates.

Officials of the Elappara grama panchayat found that the homestay had been functioning illegally.

A decision to this effect was arrived at a meeting convened by District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu here on Tuesday.

Joint team

A joint team of workers from four grama panchayats including Kumarakom and Aymanom, the Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR), operators of houseboats and shikara boats will be part of the initiative.

“The work will begin from next day using available machines while more machines will be brought in as and when available. The first phase of the drive will cover core areas including the Kumarakom jetty and Kavanattinkara,” said Arun Kumar, secretary, Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR).

Operation of boats

The explosion of hyacinths in the region has forced tourist boats including houseboats to cancel operations along several routes.

Besides the tourist operations, it also threatens to affect passenger boat services as well.

169,2020/02/04,Hygiene key to fighting nCoV,"As the 2019-nCoV sweeps across the globe, alarming scientists and the general public by the scale of its spread, a simple common sense measure — frequent handwashing — is what might save you, the ordinary citizen on the ground, more than any face mask donned 24x7.

It was in the late 1840s that Ingaz Semmelweis, a Hungary-born physician, tried to impress upon his colleagues and peers that they themselves could be making their patients sick, unless they washed and disinfected their hands properly before touching them.

Semmelweis was a very observant physician and in 1847, while he was serving as an assistant in obstetrics at a teaching hospital in Vienna, he noticed that women delivered by physicians and medical students had a much higher rate (13-18%) of post-delivery mortality (called puerperal fever or childbed fever) than women delivered by midwives (2%).

Semmelweis concluded that the women delivered by physicians and students died more because the latter were doing autopsies too and then handling pregnant women without washing hands properly.

He initiated a mandatory handwashing policy using a chloride of lime solution for medical students and physicians and saw the mortality rate of women falling to 2% and later to 1% when he began washing the medical instruments also. Yet, his theories were not accepted by his peers and he could not convince them because washing of hands before treating each patient was too much work. It was nearly two decades later and after his death that the value of handwashing was appreciated, when the germ theory was proposed (Adapted from Heroes and martyrs of quality and safety: Ignaz Semmelweis and the birth of infection control; M Best, D Neuhauser; BMJ, 2004).

Almost 150 years later, even though hand hygiene is considered to be the single-most crucial factor that can prevent cross-infection between people, the medical fraternity themselves admit that it is performed only half as much as it should be done.

Elisabeth Rosenthal, a journalist and physician, who covered the SARS outbreak for NewYork Times in 2002-03, recalled in a recent article that it was sheer common sense that kept her and her family from falling prey to SARS while in China.

Her lessons from her SARS experience to reduce the risk of catching the infection was, washing hands frequently with soap and water and keeping them clean. Secondly, stay at home / do not send children to school if there is any illness.

NcoV is a droplet infection and it is easy for viruses to get on common surfaces such as tables, door knobs, and washroom taps when a patient coughs or sneezes. If one were to touch these surfaces unknowingly and then touch one’s face or rub the nose or eyes, it is a sureshot way of getting a cross-infection.

Frequent handwashing reduces this risk of transferring germs straight on to one’s face because soap and water can wash away most of the germs.

How to wash

That said, it is equally important how one washes hands.

The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends scrubbing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cleaning the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.

After washing hands, air-dry your hands or use a tissue to wipe your hands and use the tissue to turn off the tap, because bathroom faucets and taps can harbour even faecal bacteria.

If you have no access to water, use a hand sanitiser with 60-90% alcohol, rub it in your hands for 20 seconds and allow to dry (there are superbugs like C. difficile which are immune to hand sanitisers). Wet wipes are ideally used for cleaning down surfaces.

170,2020/02/04,Two in quarantine for nCoV flee to Saudi,"Two persons who had returned from China recently and were under observation for novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection in Kozhikode in Kerala have left the country for Saudi Arabia, violating the State Health Department’s instructions to remain under home quarantine till the end of the 28-day incubation period of the virus.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said efforts were being made to trace the two persons.

Speaking at a special council meeting convened by the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation to discuss steps to be taken on the ground to contain the outbreak, Dr. Jayasree urged councillors to be alert and keep a watch on people in their respective wards who had returned from China and other nCoV-affected countries. The ward-level committees headed by the councillors would consist of health workers and anganwadi and ASHA workers, she said.

A source said the departure of the two potentially infectious persons had left the health administration, charged with ensuring that proper healthcare facilities are extended to all, red-faced.

The health authorities also face reluctance from air passengers returning from abroad to disclose their travel history for fear of being asked to go into quarantine at their homes.

The advisory from the health authorities says that all those in observation have to remain indoors for 28 days and this gives them “a feel of being ostracised”, sources said.

However, Additional District Medical Officer Asha Devi said, “We have to prioritise public health over one’s personal freedom in this case. Those who have come from Wuhan after January 15 should get their samples tested and stay in isolation even if they do not show any symptoms.” “It is best to stay in a bath-attached room with minimal close interaction with other members of the family,” she said.

Meanwhile, instances of families of those who came from China being ostracised and school authorities preventing children from such families attending classes have been reported. Corporation education standing committee chairman M. Radhakrishnan said the Deputy Director of Education had been asked to look into the matter. Sixty persons are under observation in Kozhikode, seven of whom have returned from China while the others are relatives or those who have been in close contact with them. “A classmate and co-traveller of the nCoV-affected student in Thrissur is among them,” the DMO said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ppjh4q/article30736735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THRDCORONA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-in-quarantine-for-ncov-flee-to-saudi/article30736736.ece

173,2020/02/04,Juvenile catch may prove catastrophic for fishers,"While natural fish stocks continue to fall due to various reasons, the fisheries sector in Kerala is facing another serious threat -- targeted juvenile catch to meet the growing demand for fish meal.

Unlike the surplus by-catch that went to the fish meal fish oil (FMFO) industries earlier, now shoals of edible juveniles are caught and dispatched to plants located outside Kerala. Huge volumes of edible varieties, including sardine and pink perch, are now found in the consignments -- a practice that can be catastrophic to the marine environment and livelihood of fishers.

Decline

“Many of the boats now supply fish below the minimum legal size to the FMFOs as they pay well. Compared to previous years there has been a noticeable decline in catch and now many boats come back with whatever they get. The factory agents take all varieties and many days that’s our only income,” says Salim, a fisher.

With the growth of aquafeed market, catering to FMFOs has become a more lucrative option and the consignments from Kerala mainly go to plants in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Goa.

“Currently a small crate to the factories will fetch you around ₹1,000, which is more profitable than selling it to small-scale vendors. Earlier their rates were not so high and suddenly everybody is doing business with them. Fishers who have been struggling with low catch and loss of working days are counting this as an opportunity. They say this will take care of their fuel expense at least,” says Mariam, a fish vendor.

Standard rate

Since the industry offers a standard rate for a crate irrespective of the kind of fish, the species will change according to availability from juvenile pelagics to many others.

“You don’t have to go in search of shoals or wait for long. You can come back with whatever you get and sell it to the agent,” says Jackson, a fisherman. Very often the juvenile catch is not brought to the harbour since the transaction takes place in the sea. “The crafts inform the agents and they go to the sea with carrier boats to offload the catch.

Several crates are taken to the waiting trucks and these agents arrange everything. Sometimes there will be hardly any fish left for auctioning,” he adds. According to experts and elderly fishermen, the dangerous practice will lead to extinction, not depletion. “If they are opting to supply varieties with low market value to the factories, it is their choice. But targeting juveniles will lead to a total collapse in the stock and affect the marine ecosystem.” They point out the huge inflow from other sectors and the consequent lack of awareness as main reasons for the practice.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/77tyyf/article30730065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvko-Juvenile-Fish-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/juvenile-catch-may-prove-catastrophic-for-fishers/article30730066.ece

The Amalolbhava Matha Church at Adimalathura has been accused of encroaching upon acres of puramboke land and selling it as smaller land parcels to fishworker families for construction of houses.

According to the Neyyattinkara tahasildar, the encroachment was first reported around a year ago. “A joint inspection of the various departments was conducted after that.

In a meeting convened to discuss the encroachment, the District Collector had taken a serious view of the encroachment. The Fisheries Joint Registrar had informed that around 167 houses were nearing completion on the plots. The church had divided the land into plots of 3 to 5 cents and sold to the fishermen families.

Adimalathura is an area which witnesses sea erosion annually, with the waves coming inside even the houses located away from the coast. The land on which houses are being constructed now is much nearer to the sea.

Project scuttled

According to T. Peter, president of the Kerala Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation (KSMTF), the local church had scuttled a housing project of the Fisheries Department.

“Areas like Adimalathura gained land at the coast years ago due to the construction of fishing harbour at Vizhinjam, while there was erosion on the other side. This is puramboke land which belongs to the government. Encroaching upon this land and then selling it to coastal families are illegal. The government should take stringent action against this,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-grab-by-church-report-submitted-to-government/article30730050.ece

177,2020/02/04,Murder suspected in man’s death; one held,"A 32-year-old man who was found dead inside an abandoned house near Maloor, here on Sunday, is suspected to have been murdered.

The victim, P. Dijeel, a resident of Kunderipoyyil, had gone out Saturday night from his house and had not returned. Following a search, his body was found inside an abandoned house, which is half a kilometre from where he lived.

Based on the primary investigation, the police suspect that the victim was murdered. They found blood marks on the face and neck. A rope was also found around his neck.

According to the police, the victim, who had returned from abroad, was planning to start a business and his friend, an auto driver, was aiding him in the work.

In the wake of the incident, the police took the auto driver into custody, based on the information that there was a confrontation between him and the victim. Later on Sunday evening, four others were also questioned but were later let off.

Forensic experts have collected evidence from the site.

178,2020/02/04,"False ceiling of paediatric ward collapses, none hurt","A few panels of the false ceiling along with bricks fixed on the roof of the paediatric ward of the General Hospital here collapsed on Monday morning.

The building was opened to the public two weeks ago after renovation.

No one was injured in the incident, though there were some patients inside the structure when it collapsed, District Medical Officer K. Renuka said.

Stray monkeys were a threat to the public in the area and a troupe of monkeys had sneaked onto the ceiling of the ward had created the mess, Dr. Renuka said. However occupants of the ward had been shifted to another building in the hospital premises, she added. The ward would be opened for the public after erecting iron grills on windows to keep the monkeys at bay, she added.

Eyewitnesses said children and their parents were present in the building when the accident occurred.

179,2020/02/04,"Shruti Haasan, Samantha Akkineni, Ramya Krishnan bring Raja Ravi Varma paintings to life","While shooting his latest calendar, G Venket Ram had a peculiar problem. He had to find a dog.

One that resembled the border collie in one of Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings. Titled There Comes Papa, the 1893 painting portrays a woman carrying a toddler, with a faithful dog sitting at her feet. The calendar is part of Naam Charitable Trust’s fund-raiser and 10th anniversary celebrations. The trust, started by actor and director Suhasini Maniratnam, empowers single women from underserved segments of society.

The calendar features women and is inspired by Raja Ravi Varma’s works. “We were trying to replicate the works. I had to see how to match them with the paintings and managed to a certain extent,” says G Venket Ram, who is shooting a calendar after a break of six years.

This one features 11 celebrities from Tamil and Telugu movies. There is Khushbu Sundar, Ramya Krishnan, Samantha Akkineni, Lissy Lakshmi, Nadiya Moidu, Lakshmi Manchu, Shruti Haasan, Aishwarya Rajessh, dancers Shobana and Priyadarshini Govind, and Chamundeshwari, one of the beneficiaries from Naam. “That was my condition, that one of them had to be from the foundation,” says Suhasini Maniratnam.

For Suhasini, Chamundeshwari is a winner. The 33-year-old single mother of two is single-handedly taking care of her family and herself with a zeal to live life to its fullest. In the calendar, Chamundeshwari dons the role of Rani Laxmi Bayi of the Tanjore and Travancore palaces.

All the jewellery had to be procured or specially created. Even the style in which the saris are draped by the women are different in each painting. So the styling and costume department had quite a task on their hands. One of the crochet chair covers had been created by the women from Naam and is exactly the same as the one in the painting. From accessories, furniture and props to even the bent of a hair strand, most of the elements have been kept intact.

One of the bigger challenges while shooting this project, was the lighting. “My inspiration for photography was painting. I used to study them to understand how the artist would analyse light. He is not photographing but he is taking an image in his mind and recreating on canvas. As an artist he improvises on it and can mix colours to get a certain shade,” explains Venket.

You can not match the painting in terms of colour and proportions. You can’t replicate the painting because artist improvisation is very different, he says pointing to a picture of Ramya Krishnan in a red sari, the colour of which is a little different from the original. “In terms of lighting he’s painted in ambient light. There is a verandah or outdoor setting and the artist has used natural light. To match it is tricky. Because I have shot everything using flash lights, diffusers and bouncers.”

There was a time constraint, considering Suhasini and Venket started work on this project in December last year. There was also a concern about the copyright issue. “We were wondering if it is ok to recreate an original work. Suhasini contacted the Ravi Varma Foundation in Bengaluru and they were cooperative. They helped by sending us the original painting and explaining what it was all about,” says Venket.

180,2020/02/04,Salman Khan unveils the first look of Sooraj Pancholi’s ‘Hawa Singh’ biopic,"Bollywood superstar Salman Khan unveiled the first look of the upcoming biopic of Hawa Singh, who is widely regarded the Father of Indian Boxing. The film will feature Sooraj Pancholi.

“@sooraj9pancholi aces the look of a boxer in the biopic of legendary Hawa Singh is also known as the Father of Indian Boxing. Directed by Prakash Nambiar, produced by Sam S. Fernandes and Kamlesh Singh Kushwaha, Hawa Singh will go on floor soon,” Salman tweeted.

Sooraj is all beefed up to look his character and the actor is excited to start shooting for the film, which goes on floors in February.

“The manner in which a young boy from a small village Umarvas transformed himself into a champion boxer is inspirational. Sooraj is young and fits like a glove into the character. His efforts, approach and honesty towards the role and this motivating story surprised me and made my belief in him stronger,” said director Nambiar.

Hawa Singh is a recipient of the Arjuna Award and the Dronacharya Award. He dominated the Indian and Asian amateur boxing scene in his weight class for a decade. Singh won the Asian Games gold medal in the heavyweight category in consecutive editions at the Games in 1966 and 1970, a feat unmatched by any Indian boxer to date.

The champion boxer also created a record of being the Indian heavyweight boxing champion for 11 consecutive years from 1961 to 1972.

181,2020/02/04,Anurag Kashyap refuses to fly IndiGo in support of Kunal Kamra,"Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has lent support to comedian Kunal Kamra by not flying in IndiGo Airlines. He chose Vistara instead.

“No @IndiGo6E.. on @airvistara .. in solidarity with @kunalkamra88,” Kashyap tweeted on Monday.

Kashyap came out in support of Kamra after the latter was banned from four airlines including IndiGo, Air India, GoAir and SpiceJet. Kamra was banned after his in-flight encounter with news anchor Arnab Goswami during an IndiGo flight a few dats ago.

During the flight, Kamra had approached Goswami and unleashed a barrage of questions on him, over the latter’s coverage of national affairs and the suicide of Rohith Vemula in particular, on his new channel. Vemula was a Dalit activist and scholar at the Hyderabad University.

After Kamra’s diatribe against Arnab, IndiGo banned the comedian from flying for six months.

In an interview, Kashyap, who was in Kolkata for an event on Monday, spoke about his decision to boycott IndiGo.

“I was booked on IndiGo by the organisers. After Kamra was banned, I told the organisers I will not fly IndiGo. I told them I will not fly this airline because I thought the ban was very unreasonable. My thing is: there is nothing I can do about it. It does not make much of a difference. But as I wanted to register my dissent, I thought that I would not fly IndiGo. I want to fly Vistara. The IndiGo flight was on Monday afternoon and the Vistara flight was in the morning. They (the organisers) informed (me) that to fly Vistara, you have to wake up at 4am. I said, ‘I will wake up at 4am, but I will not fly IndiGo’,” Kashyap explained.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qihd43/article30734708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILMTIFFHUSBANDMATERIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/anurag-kashyap-refuses-to-fly-indigo-in-support-of-kunal-kamra/article30734709.ece
182,2020/02/04,Raashi Khanna: Yamini in 'World Famous Lover' is the toughest character I’ve played so far,"Raashi Khanna laughs heartily when we broach the topic of her new film, World Famous Lover. “We (referring to the film’s team) are all having a good laugh; everyone has their own view, going by the teaser. Some think it’s Arjun Reddy 2, some people think it’s an anthology, a few others think it might be the journey of one character — like Care of Kancharapalem. It’s hilarious to see these reactions but we prefer to be tight-lipped about our film,” she says, when we get talking for an interview.

As expected, she doesn’t want to discuss her character Yamini and avers that anything she says will be a spoiler: “When people see the film, they’ll get to know it’s a beautiful story and screenplay; all the girls (she, Aishwarya Rajesh, Catherine Tresa and Izabelle) have great parts,” says Raashi.

The joy that Raashi exudes during the interview is more than just a reflection of her mood at the moment and the excitement about her forthcoming film. It’s also got to do with the kind of roles she’s been offered post Tholi Prema. Most recently, she brought the house down as TikTok star Angel Aarna in director Maruthi’s Prati Roju Pandage. Before she talks about that film, she goes back to Anil Ravipudi’s Supreme (2016), where she tried comedy for the first time: “I didn’t know I could do comedy. Anil [Ravipudi] told me that I had good comic timing. I am not a trained actor and in the beginning of my career, I was shy and not very free with how I emoted. Comedy requires you to shed your inhibitions.”

Three years later when Prati Roju Pandage was offered to her, she still wasn’t sure. She downloaded the TikTok app and enjoyed watching some of the fun videos. But she couldn’t imagine herself doing such videos. “I was scared,” says Raashi, “I told Maruthi I can’t be Aarna.” The director convinced her and she took it up as a challenge. She had some amount of comedy in Venky Mama as well, alongside Vidyu Raman. On set, director Bobby told her that her comic timing had improved and also commented that someday she could become a director: “I have no such plans now. But I understand a scene and improvise. I have a sense of what might work and when someone like Vidyu Raman is around, it’s easy to pull off comic scenes.”

World Famous Lover, scheduled to release on February 14, will see Raashi in a role that’s a contrast to these fun parts. Raashi says it was cathartic to act in WFL and go through Yamini’s emotional journey: “There are times I want to cry my heart out at night — over many things — but I hold back because the next morning I can’t go to shoot with swollen eyes. While enacting Yamini, I shed [copious] tears. Yamini is the toughest character I’ve played so far.”

Needed seclusion

Raashi mentions being blown away by the “sensible and emotional” story and characters that director Kranti Madhav had in store. After the characters of Prabhavathi (in her debut film Oohalu Gusagusalade directed by Srinivas Avasarala) and Varsha in Tholi Prema (by Venky Atluri), this is a part that got her both excited and nervous: “I secluded myself for 15 to 20 days before I began shooting. I needed to be alone. Yamini goes through a lot and I like how she stands up for herself with self respect. Had I been in her situation, maybe that’s how I would react. I felt I was showcasing my vulnerable side through Yamini. I became her. At this stage of my career, more than just the box office success, I want to add value to a film.”

She’s aware of the possessiveness with which some of her fans reacted to the WFL teaser and says, “Once they see the entire film, they will be proud of what I’ve done. From the teaser, they had issues with the dialogue Vijay [Deverakonda] says, my shower shot and the lovemaking. But those who notice my deadpan expression will know there’s a lot more to Yamini.”

After WFL, Raashi has signed Aranmanai 3 (Tamil), keen to explore the horror genre, and is in talks for two Telugu films. But she’s keen to wait for the reactions to WFL, which she is confident will show her in a new light. She talks in appreciation of how Samantha calls the shots with a tapestry of interesting roles and says, “It’s a boost to actors like me, making us believe leading women will get to do well-written characters.”

The conversation shifts to the time between Oohalu... and Tholi Prema when Raashi was saddled with several roles that required her to just be glamorous. “What can we do when we are restricted by the writing? People have to believe in you to offer good roles. I improvise with whatever material I am given. There are occasions when I’ve spoken up and said I can’t say lines that make a woman sound stupid. Some directors agree with my point of view and some don’t. It’s all part of the game,” she sums up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qzwavn/article30734309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rashi-Khanna-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/raashi-khanna-yamini-in-world-famous-lover-is-the-toughest-character-ive-played-so-far/article30734313.ece

Murugadoss is coming to Prime Video on February 23, even as Valentine’s Day will welcome the arrival of his son-in-law Dhanush’s Pattas to the streaming platform.

‘Avane Srimannarayana’

Rakshit Shetty’s Kannada hit Avane Srimannarayana has already launched and with the experimental cop thriller/ fantasy creating a lot of hype during its release, fans worldwide must be eager to finally watch it. Mammootty’s period epic Mamangam will also be available from February 7 onwards for watchers of Malayalam cinema.

‘Good Newwz’

However, the biggest Indian hit on Amazon Prime this month will be undoubtedly Akshay Kumar’s Good Newwz. With an excellent cast comprising Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh, Kiara Advani and Adil Hussain, the Bollywood flick was a smash hit. Two couples with the same surname — Batra — trying hard to have children through in-vitro fertilisation, find all hell breaking loose when the sperms get interchanged and there’s lot of good-natured humour and sentimentality to go around.

Al Pacino in ‘Hunters’

Even as Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood gears up for the Oscars where it’s expected to contend for top honours has been on platform since February 2, but another huge draw will be the release of international original Hunters, the first season of which drops on February 21. Set in the late 1970s, the series follows Pacino on a quest to find a team who will help him violently hunt down Nazis living in the city and planning to start the Fourth Reich in the US.

184,2020/02/04,‘Mafia is inspired from my favourite Netflix series Narcos’: Karthick Naren,"Sentimental is not the word you would use to describe Karthick Naren. He comes across as someone with conviction in his craft, which is evident in his short, precise answers.

Only once during a 30-minute-long press interaction to promote his upcoming film, Mafia: Chapter 1, does he break character — and it is for this joke: “You know how in [Tamil] cinema there are sentiments. In the last three years, I have grown a sentiment too. It is to not name my films starting with the letter N,” he says.

A taste of reality

The weight of these words is not lost on the floor, which, at the moment, laughs along with Karthick.

Having made his début in 2016 with the critically-well-received Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru, the 25-year-old filmmaker started work on two ambitious projects — Naragasooran and Naadaga Medai. One is completed and the other is halfway through, but neither film’s prospects of releasing looks bright.

The filmmaker’s Twitter outburst with director Gautham Menon some time ago was what that brought out the issue behind Naragasooran to the fore.

Karthick admits that the ordeal was “an experience” and adds that he bears no ill will or anger towards Gautham.

“We cannot keep hold of the emotions within us. I have evolved as a person. Whatever happened had to happen for a reason. It has made me a calmer person, and no matter how much we think and ponder about it, we cannot undo what happened,” he says.

Though he prefers a philosophical reply, Karthick reveals he found it difficult working on Mafia initially with the fate of Naragasooran still unknown.

“The main difficulty was in disconnecting from [Naragasooran]. As a filmmaker, the journey begins when we start writing on a paper, and ends only when the film releases. When I started writing Mafia, my mind was still stuck with the world and characters of Naragasooran. I had to get out of it and I had a good support system, be it my parents or my team,” he adds.

It is also a reason why Mafia is “a special film” for him.

Mafia, Karthick says, is a Westernised take on the gangster-drama genre. But the story unfolds in Chennai. The protagonist, Aryan, a narcotics officer, is played by Arun Vijay and the primary antagonist, whose name is touted as The Beast, is essayed by actor Prasanna.

“It will unfold like a cat-and-mouse game. It is a story of two people who are both moral and ideological opposites. It is a battle between the minds of these two characters. Mafia is more brains than brawns,” says Karthick.

Priya Bhavani Shankar and Thalaivasal Vijay among others are included in the supporting cast.

Into the mafia world

The director has never shied away from admitting to being influenced by the filmmaking styles of Christopher Nolan and Mani Ratnam.

Mafia, in particular, will also bear their influences in its narrative pattern. However, the script itself is an inspired take on something Karthick calls his “favourite series on Netflix”.

Arun Vijay in a still from ‘Mafia: Chapter 1’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

“Mafia is kind of inspired from Narcos. The common thread of the story is what that is similar between them, nothing more. The film will follow a non-linear screenplay,” he adds.

The filmmaker admits that Mafia will be attuned to the commercial demands of mainstream cinema. For this purpose, the film includes four songs — a factor that would seem at odds with the film’s overall style considering what we witnessed in its trailer. Karthick defers, though.

“I see songs as a narrative tool. There are four songs in the film, but it will be part of the screenplay. What would otherwise have required four additional scenes can be conveyed through a song. Only when a song does not set with the screenplay will it become a speed-breaker,” he says, adding, “Even the background music will have Western influences like EDM and trance music.”

Jakes Bejoy is the music composer for Mafia.

The film was entirely shot in Chennai save for three days, when the crew shifted to Thailand to film an action-sequence block.

While a few mainstream filmmakers bemoan the lack of adequate shooting spots in Chennai, Karthick offers a different take.

“Since my roots are from short films, I have this habit. Whatever space we get, we convert it into a location. We do not worry about whether we will get permission or not. In Mafia, I have shot many sequences in guerrilla style. People in the area should not know that we are shooting, only when they come to know will there be crowd and interference,” he says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xix6tw/article30733915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPMafia-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mafia-is-inspired-from-my-favourite-netflix-series-narcos-karthick-naren/article30733924.ece
185,2020/02/04,I accepted ‘83’ because I could speak in Tamil: Jiiva,"Third time is the charm, we say, as Jiiva smiles and clears his throat to answer a query on Seeru, the film by Vels Film International which releases this Friday.

The first two attempts are disrupted when an unmindful assistant sleepwalks into the middle of the frame with a water bottle before the video lighting equipment hits the ‘snooze’ mode.

The actor, though, prefers to see the lighter side of things, and begins: “Seeru is very important for me at this point of time. It has been long since I did an action film with a lot family values,” he says, adding that the story will be along the lines of his previous films like Thenavattu (2008) and Rowthiram (2011).

Lean patch

Jiiva did not have the best of years in 2019 as both his theatrical releases (Kee and Gorilla) bombed at the box office.

In the three previous years, the actor worked four films in total, which, in comparison to his 2016 returns when three of his films released, points to a trend where things may be slowing down for him.

It didn’t help that his films seem to be consistently running into financial disputes before release. Kee was a victim of that, and so is Gypsy — his film with the National Award winning filmmaker Raju Murugan — a project that he banked on to help him navigate out of this tricky career phase.

“I’m kind of used to these financial issues now,” he says, as we remark that Gypsy, whose audio launch was held in May 2019, missed its scheduled release date of January 24 (the production team has yet to confirm a rescheduled date).

“[Gypsy] also had some censor issues, but that was sorted. I did anticipate the [censor] trouble. I used to think that I should be in the USA or Australia, when the film releases,” his remark, punctuated with a smile, offering evidence of the volatile nature of political commentary in Gypsy.

“But I am an actor. I need to complete my films and move on. I guess we should have better infrastructure in place to not stop films [from being released],” he notes.

Bouncing back

Yet things are looking up for him.

The actor is set to make his Bollywood debut in April with the Kabir Khan film, 83. Ranveer Singh headlines a star-studded cast in this film, which documents the 1983 World Cup winning cricket team’s exploits in England.

Though Jiiva, son of producer RB Choudary, can claim a North Indian lineage, he acknowledges the limited grasp he has over the Hindi language. It is what that prevented him from exploring opportunities in other language industries, especially Bollywood.

“I speak accented Hindi. I’m more happy speaking Tamil. I’ve only done a Malayalam film (Keerthi Chakra in 2006) because my character spoke Tamil. Even 83 (where he plays cricketer Kris Srikkanth), I accepted because I had the liberty of speaking Tamil,” says Jiiva.

For 83, the actor and the rest of the cast had to undergo training sessions in Dharmashala in Himachal Pradesh, which, for someone like Jiiva who claims to have “no exposure” playing the sport other than its street cricket version, was deemed essential by Kabir Khan.

It was all fun and games when the crew practised using nets, but when the time came to face the cinematic equivalent of West Indian bowling legend Joel Garner on camera, the actor was perturbed.

“In the nets we were saved, but once we were outdoors, the ball started to dance,” he says Jiiva, in his inimical style, referring to swinging variations on the cricket ball.

Rigours of cinema

In his line of work, having to go to great lengths to achieve near perfection, solely for the pleasure of the audience, is regarded as a rule of thumb. It can also make the process of film-making cumbersome.

“Look, it is not easy. I don’t wake up in the morning to go make a dabba (colloquial term; meaning irrelevant) film. Try filming a scene and edit it. You will be so tired. For four months I was shooting in the UK (for 83), and when I returned, my son had grown two inches. I’m missing a lot,” he adds.

On the anvil In the works for Jiiva after 83 is Kalathil Santhipom, produced by his home banner Super Good Films, where his co-star is Arulnithi. The shoot for this film is complete. “It is a typical Super Good project; a fun film based on friendship. It is also based on the sport of Kabaddi. I play a laid back character while Arulnithi plays an action role. It will be different from the thriller genre films that Arulnithi is known to make.

Another film with Jiiva in the lead and produced by Super Good is also in the pre-production stage.

Having grown up in a household where discussion on films was the primary chatter, Jiiva has an excellent grasp of the inner workings of Tamil cinema including what ails it. He wants more Tamil filmmakers to work on improving sound technology (using sync sound) in their products.

He would also prefer if fresher content comes through (he makes a passing remark on how stories can be filtered out from books).

So why is there a dearth in Tamil filmmakers adapting books into films, as is the norm in Hollywood and, to some extent, in Bollywood?

“Here, producers don’t read books,” Jiiva laughs, adding, “If they had the practice of reading books, they would know the treasure trove of stories available. But there is only the desire to invest in a film after fixing on a favourite combination in their heads. They will say this hero seems lucky and will invest all their money on him, only to find that he has turned into an unlucky hero all of a sudden,” he laughs.

The ‘combination’ fetish stretches beyond the producer’s room.

“Even heroes. First of all actors should start believing in writers. They believe in directors now, and also in their preferred combination of a heroine,” he says.

Such a culture also, in turn, allows for poorer quality filmmakers to enter the system, which is something, as can be expected, Jiiva is not too kicked about.

“Initially, there was this job of an assistant director, where one would stick to a team for six or seven films. They would learn the work culture in the first film, then the craft of direction, various filmmaking techniques, interacting with the cameraman and then the producer in subsequent films before one becomes mature enough to handle the director’s mantle. It was this experience that made one a better director. It is not enough if you know how to place the camera for a shot. It is important to know how to handle people on the sets,” he adds.

Work-life balance

Jiiva likes to identify with his party animal spirit. “I quietly go and come off. I don’t like to gaze around and stuff. I also go for music festivals to listen to some good DJs like Solomon and Amen,” he says.

This interest in music has also manifested into a desire to learn playing the guitar. Jiiva started his classes while playing the nomad’s role in Gypsy, but has kept at it because he finds life when not shooting to be “pretty boring”, and also because playing a guitar is it a “very therapeutic” experience.

“The guitar was my best friend while shooting in the UK for 83. It felt nice. So I hired a music teacher upon returning. I can play three chords, and now I am learning all the symbols(music registers), and learning about the ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’ and ‘f’ families. Don’t ask me to play, though,” he smiles.

The actor has been making films for the last 17 years, and yet only turned 36 last month. He feels “pretty good” growing older. In his words: “When I was in my twenties, I felt like I was in my thirties. Right now, I feel like I am in my twenties.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ojrgwi/article30733708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPJIIVA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-accepted-83-because-i-could-speak-in-tamil-jiiva/article30733709.ece
186,2020/02/04,Disney announces new ‘Hamilton’ film with Broadway cast,"Disney is set to release the big-screen adaptation of award-winning stage musical Hamilton’s theatre performance with its original Broadway cast.

Based on a book by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical is inspired by the 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton by historian Ron Chernow.

Known for its colour-conscious casting, Hamilton follows the story of the titular American Founding Father, played by Miranda, through music that draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.

The film, to be released on October 15, 2021, is directed by Thomas Kail and produced by Jeffrey Seller.

“I fell in love with musical storytelling growing up with the legendary Howard Ashman-Alan Menken Disney collaborations: ‘The Little Mermaid’, ‘Beauty and The Beast’, ‘Aladdin’. I’m so proud of what Tommy Kail has been able to capture in this filmed version of ‘Hamilton’ — a live theatrical experience that feels just as immediate in your local movie theater. We’re excited to partner with Disney to bring the original Broadway company of ‘Hamilton’ to the largest audience possible,” Miranda said in a statement.

Kail revealed the show that was shot at The Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway in June 2016 will make it to the film version of the play.

“We are thrilled for fans of the show, and new audiences across the world, to experience what it was like on stage-and in the audience... We wanted to give everyone the same seat, which is what this film can provide,” the director said.

Robert A Iger, chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company, said the studio is thrilled to have the opportunity to share this same Broadway experience with millions of people around the world.

“Lin-Manuel Miranda created an unforgettable theater experience and a true cultural phenomenon, and it was for good reason that Hamilton was hailed as an astonishing work of art. All who saw it with the original cast will never forget that singular experience,” Iger added.

The upcoming Hamilton promises to combine the “best elements of live theater and film” and stars Miranda, Daveed Diggs, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Leslie Odom Jr, Christopher Jackson, Jonathan Groff, Phillipa Soo, Jasmine Cephas Jones, Okieriete Onaodowan, and Anthony Ramos.

The cast also includes Carleigh Bettiol, Ariana DeBose, Hope Easterbrook, Sydney James Harcourt, Sasha Hutchings, Thayne Jasperson, Elizabeth Judd, Jon Rua, Austin Smith, Seth Stewart, and Ephraim Sykes. Film producers also include Miranda and Kail.

The original musical has won 11 Tony awards, one Grammy, four Olivier awards and Pulitzer Prize.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/id98x5/article30733165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILM-HAMILTON,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/disney-announces-new-hamilton-film-with-broadway-cast/article30733166.ece

Bhatt’s Vishesh Films and Jio Studios have joined hands for the yet untitled project.

Talking about the project, Bhatt said: “A Fresh start. A new place. It’ s a new mindset. Trust the magic of a new beginning in the digital world and wanting to create something extraordinary, our first web show, a dramatic love story goes on floors with these wonderful actors Amala, Tahir and Amrita and our talented director Pushpdeep Bhardwaj along with our partner Jio Studios.”

This is not the first time Mahesh is making a film based on a Bollywood actress’ life. His 2006 film Woh Lamhe... starring Shiney Ahuja and Kangana Ranaut, was supposedly based on Parveen Babi’s life, her battle with schizophrenia and her relationship with Mahesh Bhatt to whom she was a lover, as well as a mentor.

The filmmaker also tweeted a photograph of himself along with the actors.

He captioned the image: “The magic of a new beginning! Our first web show, a dramatic love story goes on floors. Take a look at our wonderful cast @Amala_ams @TahirRajBhasin @_Amrita_Puri & Dir @PushpdeepBhardw @jiostudios @VisheshFilms.”

190,2020/02/04,Analysis: Minister Rajenthra Bhalaji’s ‘Hindu leanings’ put AIADMK in a spot,"The ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, which is battling the charge of functioning as the BJP’s B team, has been left politically red-faced by Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji’s extreme Hindu position in public. ​

​In an interview to a Tamil television channel, Mr. Bhalaji, also the party’s Virudhunagar district secretary, embarrassed the government by insisting that the recent murder of BJP functionary F. Vijay Raghu in Tiruchi has religious angle to it. This was in contrast to the stand of the law enforcing authorities. Tiruchi Police Commissioner V. Varadharaju, had emphatically ruled out the communal angle and attributed “personal enmity” for the crime. ​

​The Minister also said if the DMK “continues its support for Islamic terrorism and organisations that kill Hindus, nobody can stop Hindu terrorism”.​

​The DMK has since petitioned the Governor seeking his dismissal from the Cabinet, a stand endorsed by other parties including the Congress. ​

​Mr. Bhalaji is known to make audacious remarks. In the middle of last year, he called for cutting off the tongue of Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan for describing Nathuram Godse, assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, as “free India’s first extremist, who was a Hindu”. A few months earlier, much to the amusement of the AIADMK, he described the Prime Minister thus: “[Narendra] Modi is our daddy. India’s daddy.” He was once caught on camera confronting a disgruntled party worker who tore up a poster that had the image of V.K. Sasikala, jailed aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. ​

​Even on matters of governance, he has courted controversy. Mr. Bhalaji’s accusation that private dairies were indulging in adulteration had triggered litigation and the Madras High Court, in October 2017, had to restrain him from making any such statements further.​

​Expectedly, the AIADMK is seeking to distance itself from his radical position. “Our party is for all, regardless of religion, caste, creed or language. This has been the path shown by Anna [C.N. Annadurai], Puratchi Thalaivar [M.G. Ramachandran] and Amma [Jayalalithaa],” is how Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, considered the government’s spokesperson, reacted to Mr. Bhalaji’s comments. He said everyone should make statements “in line” with the party’s policies. ​

​An AIADMK veteran acknowledged, “We do not understand what he seeks to gain by courting one controversy after another. But the image of the government and that of the party suffers in the process.”

​Leaders are emphatic that the political reality in the State does not permit the party to be seen as one favouring extreme position on any issue. It was out of this realisation that Jayalalithaa, after suffering a drubbing in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls in the company of the BJP, did never align her party with the national party again. She did not change her position despite being wooed aggressively by the latter at different points of time. “She had a perfect working relationship with many leaders of the BJP. A classic example was her equation with Mr. Modi. Yet, at the time of elections, she had kept a respectable distance from the BJP,” pointed out a senior leader. ​

​Mr. Bhalaji’s remarks appear to have increased the woes of the ruling party, which is already feeling the political heat over its stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. What many senior leaders say is Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, at times, does deliver “strong messages” to his colleagues. A case in point is his sacking of Information Technology Minister Manikandan last year after the latter made certain observations on cable TV tariff. The leaders are watching what the Chief Minister is going to do in the latest episode.

191,2020/02/04,Ramadoss demands a caste-wise census in 2021,"PMK founder S. Ramadoss has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to carry out a population Census in 2021 on a caste-wise basis in India.

In the letter, Ramadoss quoted the Supreme Court's directive, when hearing the 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu case that reservation should be decided on a caste census.

“The Pattali Makkal Katchi demanded that the 2011 census should be conducted as a caste census in the year 2008 itself. During the 14th Lok Sabha, the Members of Parliament belonging to Pattali Makkal Katchi conducted a signature campaign among MPs, requesting caste details to be included in the questionnaire during the 2011 census. 140 MPs signed that memorandum,” said Ramadoss.

Ramadoss said the Union Cabinet decided in September 2010 that the 2011 census will be conducted separately and caste will be enumerated separately despite widespread support from MPs and important OBC leaders to conduct a caste census.

He further added, “Since caste-based discriminations and inequalities persist in our nation the need for caste-based reservation also remains. To make caste-based reservation scientific and precise, a caste-based census is essential.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8ykw16/article30734206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH--RAMADOSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ramadoss-demands-a-caste-wise-census-in-2021/article30734208.ece
192,2020/02/04,Thoothukudi firing: Commission summons actor Rajinikanth to depose on February 25,"The Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission probing the police firing during the anti-Sterlite protests, has summoned actor Rajinikanth to appear before it on February 25 for a deposition. The actor had asserted that anti-socials, who had intruded into the protest, had triggered violence during the agitation that ultimately culminated in police firing in which 13 persons were killed.​

The actor had addressed reporters at a private resort on the outskirts of Thoothukudi after visiting some of the injured in the violence at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital on May 30, 2018. At that time he had asserted that the anti-social elements who managed to “intrude” into the agitation, had unleashed violence that led to the police firing. Though his observations triggered a lot of criticism from various quarters, especially from the political parties and the anti-Sterlite protesters, the actor stood firm on his stance.​

When he appeared before the Commission on October 16 last, Naam Thamizhar Katchi coordinator Seeman had said Rajinikanth should be summoned to appear before the Commission for a deposition. As the “evidences” the actor had might have driven him to come to this conclusion, Rajinikanth should also be summoned to share with the Commission the proof he had, Mr. Seeman had said.​

During one of the interactions with the media, the Commission representative had said that Mr. Rajinikanth would also be summoned if it was needed.​

Against this backdrop, the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission has summoned the actor to appear before it on February 25 for a deposition.​

193,2020/02/04,"Gang hurls bombs, kills man, in a case of mistaken identity in Villupuram","A gang hurled country bombs inside a petrol pump in Thiru Nagar in Villupuram district, killing a 50-year-old man, in a case of mistaken identity, on Tuesday morning. ​

The police identified the deceased as S. Srinivasan, a resident of Panruti in Cuddalore, who was working as manager at the fuel station.​

According to police, a gang in a car reached the pump at around 11 a.m. and enquired whether the owner of the agency, Prakash, was available inside his cabin. ​After employees signalled the presence of the owner, the gang rushed into the office room and hurled three country bombs at Srinivasan, who happened to be the only person in the cabin. After he collapsed, the assailants attacked him with weapons killing him on the spot.​

According to police, a few minutes before the arrival of the gang, Prakash had left in the car belonging to Srinivasan. ​

Police believed the real target of the gang was Prakash. Last year, the police had registered two cases against a history-sheeter, Azhar, for trying to extort ₹25 lakh from the petrol pump owner. When he refused to heed to the demand, the gang had created a ruckus inside the pump and had attempted to hurl country bombs at his house. ​In that attempt too, the gang had hurled the bombs at a neighbour’s house in Anandam Nagar near Thiru Nagar presuming that Mr Prakash stayed there.

The history-sheeter and his associates had been arrested then in connection with the incidents, police said, adding that Tuesday’s attempt was to take revenge on Prakash​

Villupuram SP Jayakumar and forensic experts visited the spot.​

194,2020/02/04,Congress seeks dismissal of Minister Rajenthra Bhalaji,"A day after the DMK petitioned the Governor seeking the dismissal of Dairy Development Minister K. T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Tuesday endorsed the demand. He accused Mr. Bhalaji of making controversial, and hate -filled speeches aimed at destroying the peace and harmony of the State.​

​In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said, “He should be immediately removed from the Cabinet since his statements are an attempt to destroy communal harmony and to instigate violence. His statements go against the oath of office under the Indian Constitution.”​

​Mr. Alagiri said if the Chief Minister does not remove Mr. Bhalaji from his post, the Governor should intervene and take necessary action to get him removed from the State Cabinet. “His speech is absolutely unlawful and can create communal tension and violence in the State,” he said. The Congress leader warned that if the Minister’s idea was to create a bloodbath in the State, secular parties would come together and prevent this.​

​Mr. Alagiri said the Minister’s utterances over the killing of a BJP functionary in Tiruchi were an attempt to influence the investigation. ​

​“The police have made it clear that there is no communal or religious angle to the murder and that it was only due to personal motives. How can Mr. Bhalaji say that Islamic terrorism is the reason for the murder? What proof does he have? If he makes such statements being a Minister, will it not affect the police investigation? Why is Rajenthra Bhalaji becoming a mouthpiece for the BJP in the State in recent times,” Mr. Alagiri asked.​

​The Congress leader also charged that Mr. Bhalaji’s statements seemed to show that he was of unstable mind and questioned whether Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was so powerless to be unable to sack such a person.​

195,2020/02/04,"Govt. withdraws plan to hold public exams for Classes 5, 8","In a move that brought much cheer to teachers, students and parents, the Tamil Nadu State government withdrew its decision to hold public exams for Classes 5 and 8 in March and April.

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan said following an announcement in September last year to hold public exams for the classes, they received several representations and suggestions from the public.

“The government has taken all this into consideration and has cancelled the government order to conduct examinations for Classes 5 and 8. The existing system of exams will continue,” he said, in an official statement. There will be regular annual examination in schools at the end of the academic year, he said.

The Cabinet discussed the issue on Tuesday and the decision to cancel the exams was announced soon after.

The initial announcement in September to conduct exams evoked sharp criticism from several quarters. Teachers, academicians and activists opined that it would only increase the burden and stress of students. On Monday, the School Education Commissioner addressed these issues in a circular, asking people not to be worried about the exams.

The decision to have a public exam based on the portions of all three semesters instead of just the final one, as had been the practice for the last few years, raised concerns as well. In a few districts, Education Department officials encouraged government schools to conduct special classes and short tests for students, which also drew flak from several quarters.

T. Arulanandam, State body member of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association (TNHHSSGTS), said many students of classes 5 and 8 had been attending special classes since November 2019. “The teachers in government schools have been burdened with work. However, we now hope that our workload will reduce following the cancellation.” he said.

Across the State, activists, teachers and students welcomed the announcement to recall the decision to have public exams. Members of the Student Federation of India in Madurai visited different schools around closing time and distributed chocolates to students upon hearing the announcement. Thanking the Education Minister, the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association said the exams would have encroached upon the freedom of children and would have adversely affected students in rural areas. The School Teacher’s Federation of India too said that they were thankful that the welfare of students, teachers and parents had been considered.

Members of the Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch, who proposed a campaign against the conduct of the exams, welcomed the announcement to withdraw the exams and stressed on the need for the State government to oppose the RTE Amendment Act, which had proposed the withdrawal of the no-detention policy.

P.K. Ponnuswamy, former Vice Chancellor, University of Madras, had a word of caution. “While the standpoint of teachers might be correct in the context of how late into the year the public exams had been announced, maintaining status quo of following an all-pass system and exposing the students to a competitive environment all of a sudden after class VIII might affect their confidence,” he said.

Stating that public exams would not provide a sudden solution, Prof Ponnuswamy added that there must be another effective mechanism in place to determine the quality of teaching and learning levels.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z8bigm/article30733345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-SENGOTTAIYAN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-public-exams-for-classes-5-and-8-says-tn-school-education-minister/article30733346.ece

The protest was led by DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin and the students’ wing leader C.V.M.P. Ezhilarasan. MLAs Ma. Subramanian, Sekar Babu, Sudharsanam, also joined them.

Many party cadre including a large group of women, participated in the protest and shouted slogans against the AIADMK government and the TNPSC.

Speaking at the protest, Mr. Udhayanidhi said job aspirants had lost any hope they had in the TNPSC due to recent scams in examinations and recruitment. Ever since the AIADMK came to power, such examination malpractices had been occurring. The CB CID has arrested only 16 persons who are only low-level staff in connection with the fraud in the Group II A and Group IV examinations and has spared those who were in high posts, he charged.

Mr. Udhayanidhi said no truth has come out from Justice Arumughasamy Commission which enquired into the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalitha which was constituted by the present AIADMK Government. Under such circumstances, the CB CID Government which is under the control of the AIADMK, will not be able to independently probe the issue and bring out the truth in the TNPSC examination malpractices, he said.

197,2020/02/04,Activists launch social media campaign to release Perarivalan,"﻿A social media campaign seeking the release of one of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, A.G. Perarivalan, began on Tuesday morning with the hashtag #ReleasePerarivalan on Twitter and Facebook.

The campaign has sought the release of Perarivalan, who has been in prison for 29 years, on the grounds of the ill health of his parents who are now 78 and 72 years old, as well as his own health issues in prison. The campaign also points to the sworn statement before the Supreme Court by V. Thiagarajan, the then CBI SP who interrogated Perarivalan, where the CBI had omitted the part of his confession that he had “absolutely no idea” of the purpose for which the two nine-volt batteries he bought would be used.

“The laws of our land state that no innocent should be punished. Mr. Thiagarajan’s sworn statement in the Supreme Court is a clean chit to Perarivalan. Imagine if his death sentence had been fulfilled, what a grave injustice that would have been?” Kavin Malar, a human rights activist, who is coordinating the social media campaign told The Hindu.

Ms. Malar said Perarivalan’s father has health complications, and Perarivalan too is suffering from health-related issues in prison. “Mr. Thiagarajan’s statement presents enough grounds to release Perarivalan. People now know of Perarivalan’s story and how he has been denied justice. This social media campaign is to build some amount of pressure to get the government to take note and release him,” she said.

Perarivalan’s mother, Arputhammal said her son had been incarcerated for 29 years. “When former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was alive, she gave an assurance that Perarivalan would be released. She told me that I will get my son back. After she passed away, I approached this government with the promise she made to me. But these people say the Governor has to decide,” she said.

Mrs. Arputhammal said she wants the Governor to take a call on Perarivalan’s release and not club it with the cases of the other six convicts. “For how long will you keep saying all seven, all seven? Even the Supreme court has expressed its displeasure over the progress of the case. He has already spent 29 years in prison,” she sad.

She said her husband, who is now 78 had to be admitted to hospital recently for a week. “At least in our last days, we want our son to be with us. We don’t know what kind of support he will be able to give us. But at least release him so that we can spend our last years of our life with him,” she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/g72llu/article30732717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-PERARIVALAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/social-media-launched-campaign-to-release-perarivalan/article30732718.ece

In a letter to the Governor, Mr. Duraimurugan said the Minister should be dismissed if he does not resign.

Pointing to Mr. Bhalaji’s statement that if the DMK “continues its support for Islamic terrorism and organisations that kill Hindus, nobody can stop Hindu terrorism”, Mr. Duraimurugan said the Minister had made such comments with the intention of promoting disharmony, enmity, hatred and ill-will among different religious groups.

He said if such persons were allowed to continue as Ministers, the public will lose their faith in government, and will come to the conclusion that it is not being run in accordance with the Constitution or the laws.

The trio, identified as Karunakaran, 70, Paramanandham, 55, and Dakshinamurthy, 60, all from the city, were arrested on Monday as they tried to sell the well-known three-star Hotel Ambica Empire to a group from Kerala.

Three persons were impersonating the owners of the hotel and attempted to sell it to the prospective buyers at a cost of ₹165 crore. They had sent a letter to Palakkal Home Solutions in Thiruvananthapuram, offering to sell the property. They claimed it was a distress sale as the owner had a huge debt and was selling the hotel to pay off his debts. They claimed they had been officially authorised by the owner to execute the deal. One of the men claimed he was the general manager of the hotel, the other, auditor and the third introduced himself as a manager.

Lured by this, and convinced by the letter, their fake documentation and the assurances of the three persons, a team of representatives from the Kerala firm landed up in Chennai to finish negotiations and seal the deal. Two of the representatives from Kerala, booked rooms in the same hotel, as per the instructions of the ‘sellers’.

On Monday, hotel staff noticed five persons seated on a couch in the lobby engaged in negotiating what seemed a tough business deal. As the meeting went on, staff overheard stray phrases which set alarm bells ringing about the possible sale of the hotel.

As they reported this to the manager, he immediately informed the owner Sudharshan, who incidentally, was staying in the hotel at the time. The latter clarified that there was no such proposal. The manager then informed the Vadapalani police station leading to the arrest of the three ‘sellers’.

The fraudsters had demanded that the Kerala group pay 10% of the price as advance payment, police said. Several documents were seized from the men after the arrest.

Initial investigations revealed that the three were real estate brokers operating in the city. Deputy Commissioner of Police, T. Nagar, Ashok Kumar said, “We are investigating whether they were involved in any other similar offences.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/f7gk6z/article30728904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Honey-Hotel-Ambika,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/want-to-sell-a-3-star-hotel-dont-meet-up-in-the-lobby/article30728906.ece
200,2020/02/04,Leopard rescued after falling into 9-ft-deep tank in Pernambut,"A leopard which fell into a ground-level water tank inside a mangrove, was rescued by Forest department personnel with the help of fire and rescue services in Pernambut on Monday.

There was very little water in the tank by the time the animal fell, but hunger and exhaustion played into its failure to climb the tank on its own.

Villagers of Silambu Koil near Aravatla, a hilltop village in Pernambut woke up to a series of roars in the morning. When they found the leopard inside the water tank in the ‘Manthoppu’ of Govindaraj, they alerted Pernambut Forest officials.

District Fire Officer, Bhargava Theja and Assistant Conservator of Forests, Muralidharan, went to the spot and assessed the condition of the animal. Forest Ranger Sankaraiah and fire service personnel chalked out a plan to the rescue animal from the tank.

They used a bamboo ladder to coax the leopard to climb it. After many attempts, the animal jumped on the ladder to escape into a reserve forest area.

Forest officials said the animal, which seems to be 3-year old, probably trespassed into the mangrove in search of its prey.

Crowd control

As the word spread, hundreds of people arrived to see the leopard.

Forest Department personnel had a tough time controlling the crowd as many people started taking photographs.

Officials finally dispersed the crowd as they were worried that the noise would further agitate the leopard.

Luckily, exit points were cordoned off to pave way for the animal’s rescue and easy escape.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qc0a7c/article30730528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200203-WA0054,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/leopard-rescued-after-falling-into-9-ft-deep-tank-in-pernambut/article30730529.ece
201,2020/02/04,Government departments join forces to combat forest fires near Tiruvannamalai,"Fire and Rescue Services department and Forest department have decided to work in tandem to gain control over the forest lands and prevent forest fires this summer. Commando force personnel of Fire and Rescue Services Department, along with volunteers from villages in Jamuna Marathur in Tiruvannamalai district chalked out a plan and conducted a workshop for the volunteers to tackle forest fire.

The participants were taught about the different types of forest fire, causes, combat, rescue of victims etc.

Following the recent months long forest fire in Victoria, Australia, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services Department has embarked on a training programme for its commando force personnel to fight forest fire.

As part of the initiative, a team of commando personnel started their training at a School in Jamuna Marathur Hills. They gave a demonstration on combating fire and rescue operations. They explained to the participants, including schoolchildren, that unlike domestic fire, forest fires are more destructive and difficult to combat.

Addressing the participants, Director-in-charge, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services, C. Sylendra Babu, said volunteers from Non-Governmental Organisations and youth from villages on the fringes of forests should involve themselves in the efforts of the Fire Services department personnel in identifying and combating forest fires.

He said that fires not only destroy the green wealth of the country, but also causes extensive damage to animal population, that depend on forests. It is imperative to protect the forests for the cause of the humanity, he said.

“As per the directions of our Director, C. Sylendra Babu, we are training our commando force and creating awareness among the volunteers and schoolchildren so that they are adequately equipped,” said District Officer (Fire and Rescue Services) S. Kumar.

A 100-member team for fighting forest fire would be formed in the district.

202,2020/02/04,Villagers push for lake works in Vellore,"While the Water Resources Department has been taking credit for lake rejuvenation works under the kudimaramathu (revival of waterbodies) scheme, villagers and volunteer bodies seek more fund allocation for completion of works in Tiruvannamalai district.

The District Administration took up kudimaramathu works in 32 irrigation tanks and 5 anaicuts, spread across 12,213 acres for 2019-20 at an estimated cost of ₹16.07 crore. Accordingly, each irrigation tank or smaller lake (in terms of area) were allocated funds amounting to ₹5 lakh each. This money was barely spent for clearing weed and identifying and reconstruction of bunds, and as a result, the farmers of Cheyyar, Vandavasi and Vembakkam blocks have been facing problems.

Residents of Bokkasamudhiram in Natteri panchayat of Vembakkam block has partnered with Sabari Green Foundation, Chennai, to initiate a movement. The irrigation tank which measured around 13.40 acres of ‘Thangal Poromboke’ was teeming with encroachers, but thanks to the Madras High Court’s intervention it was restored to Natteri Panchayat once again, villagers said.

“The said area was under dispute and court cases have delayed the progress of the lake for over 40 years. The farm lands around the lake thrived on the irrigation source,” said Venkatesan, who leads the rejuvenation pack along with other villagers.

With the help from the officials at Block Development Office and the District Collector, we have made inroads into the development of this lake. But the funds allocation for the next year should be steered towards completion of restoration of bunds to the maximum height which would prevent further encroachments, he said.

“Major challenge that social groups like ours face is that the government does not support us, and wants to take up projects for their own benefit. Many-a-times, when the Tamil Nadu government does not support us, we have to regroup the stakeholders to take the case to the National Green Tribunal,” said Mr. V. Subramani Founder-Secretary of Sabari Green Foundation.

Sabari Green and the local residents’ struggles have finally paid off, with the rejuvenation of the ‘Thangal’ (irrigation tank) receiving government impetus too.

However, there are still many lakes such as this one, which are struggling and continue to suffer,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sspovh/article30730497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VELLORE-LAKEREJUVINATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/villagers-push-for-lake-works-in-vellore/article30730498.ece
203,2020/02/04,Ancient temple in village near Ranipet to get consecrated this Friday,"A temple believed to be in existence for over a few hundred years in a tiny village, a few kilometres from the busy Chennai-Bengaluru highway, is gaining attention through volunteer work.

The Sri Swathanthra Lakshmi Nayika Samedha Yuga Narayana Perumal temple, known among devotees as Lakshmi Narayana Perumal temple, in Melvenpakkam in Nemili taluk of Ranipet district, once had its own 11-tier rajagopuram, Mada streets and several acres of land. Villagers also recall that it used to be known as Mahalakshmi Kshetram, with individual sannadhis for all the ashta (eight) Lakshmis.

However, the structure has been reduced to a tiny shrine with passage of time and encroachments.

Consecration to be held

After years of neglect, the temple will now get a ‘Samprokshanam’ (consecration) on Friday (February 7). Along with reconstruction of the temple, separate sanctorums for Lord Seetha-Rama, Lord Sudharshana, Goddess Rukmini, Lord Pandurangan, Sri Dhanvanthri, Sri Ramanujar, Sri Nigamantha Maha Desikan, Yoga Anjaneyar, Sri Garudan, and a sannadhi for ‘12 Azhwars’, are being made.

“This most potent prarthana and parihaara kshethra is supposed to be over several hundred years old, as per the archaeological records,” claims trustee D. Manivannan, who said the temple is regularly visited by childless couples and those who seek marriage proposals.

According to villagers, the temple was worshipped for the presence of Kanchi Mahaperiya, who, in 1957, stayed for three days and offered his blessings.

Inside the temple are Lord Pillaikaaragan Swamy and Goddess Mahalakshmi.

“A great sight that Perumaal and Thaayar are blessing the devotees in unison. Usually one can see the Lakshmi seated on the left lap of the Lord either facing him or facing the devotees. Here both are found in an ‘Anyonya Bhavam’ (togetherness) with their faces close to one another and no gap in between.”

According to Mr. Manivannan, the temple consecration poojas will start on Tuesday evening and the samprokshanam would take place this Friday between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.

The temple thrives on the donations from philanthropists and anyone desirous in participating may contact Melvenpakkam SriLakshmi Narayana Perumal Charitable Trust by dialling 90031 77722 / 93831 45661.

204,2020/02/04,12 samples tested negative for coronavirus: Health Minister,"Blood samples and throat swabs from 12 persons, including eight Chinese nationals, who are under observation at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), have tested negative for the novel coronavirus (nCov), Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Monday.

The samples were tested at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, he added.

“These samples were taken from the Chinese nationals and four other patients, including a student, who had returned from Wuhan (A city in China where the outbreak began). The student had travelled with another from Kerala, who has tested positive for nCoV. We have also lifted a blood sample from another student from Tamil Nadu who had travelled with them and is under home quarantine,” the Minister said while addressing the media.

He added that the authorities were waiting for the test results of four samples sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “Today, as per the instruction of the advisory committee of the Centre, we lifted four more samples and sent them for testing to the King Institute. As per the guidelines, we should take samples even if the person does not have symptoms of fever, cough and breathlessness but has a travel history to the affected countries,” Dr. Vijayabaskar said.

The testing facility at King Institute can process 60 samples a day, he said.

As of date, the airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore had screened a total of 7,842 travellers. Of them, 1,150 passengers, including 878 who returned from China, had been under home quarantine for 28 days. In Chennai alone, 319 persons were under home quarantine. The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine had the phone numbers of these persons and was constantly monitoring them, the Minister said. While 10 persons, including Chinese nationals, who exhibited symptoms during screening at the airport, and seven contacts were admitted to the isolation ward of RGGGH for observation, three more were under observation at the government medical college hospitals in Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram and Villupuram, he added.

Mr. Vijayabaskar said the Chinese nationals, who continue to be under observation, may be advised to prepone their return trip.

Students from T.N.

Last week, India evacuated many students from China. “As many as 53 of them were from Tamil Nadu. They are in Delhi now, and are under quarantine. We are in regular contact with the officials in Delhi,” the Minister said.

He said isolation wards had been set up in all government medical colleges. The bed strength at the isolation ward of RGGGH had been increased from six to 12. “Today, we held meetings with all District Collectors on the preparedness measures. We also held meetings with secretaries of Higher Education and School Education, and asked them to spread awareness on hand-washing and personal hygiene in schools and colleges,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a1bfaw/article30730296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04HEALTHMINISTERVIJAYABASKARRELEASEDMBBSBDSLIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/12-samples-tested-negative-for-coronavirus-health-minister/article30730297.ece
205,2020/02/04,Additional protective gear to be procured for healthcare personnel,"With government hospitals across the State having admitted a few persons with travel history to China and symptoms of the coronavirus in the last few days, the Health department is all set to procure additional N95 masks, triple-layer masks and personal protective equipment kits for healthcare professionals and workers this week.

Last week, India banned the export of personal protective equipment like masks in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Chinese firms had earlier sought the supply of N95 masks from Indian manufacturers.

However, the export ban has brought down the demand for N95 masks, which are primarily meant for healthcare personnel, officials said.

Now, the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) is purchasing additional protective gear for government hospitals across the State. “TNMSC is purchasing 50,000 N95 masks. Orders were issued and the consignment is expected by Friday. Similarly, orders for purchase of five lakh triple-layer normal masks have been issued, and supply is expected by Wednesday,” an official of the Health department said.

In addition, the TNMSC is purchasing 20,000 pieces of personal protective equipment, which would be supplied by Thursday. “The safety gear will mostly be supplied to government medical college hospitals and district hospitals and, in small numbers, to other government hospitals,” he added.

Officials said N95 masks were primarily meant for healthcare workers in hospital settings. “In China, they have recommended the use of these masks by the public due to the spread of the infection at the community level. There is no need for the public to use N95 masks unless they are in an epidemic situation,” an official said.

J. Jayaseelan, chairman, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association, said there was currently not much demand for N95 masks, and this could be due to the ban on export of all kinds of masks and gloves.“Now, China is trying to get supply of antiviral tablets from India,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/additional-protective-gear-to-be-procured-for-healthcare-personnel/article30730279.ece
206,2020/02/04,Traffic police fret about infection risk posed by breathalysers,"The coronavirus threat has created tension in unexpected quarters — traffic policemen. Now, every time they stop a vehicle to check for drunk-driving, they are thinking twice before asking the driver to blow into the breathalyser.

The risk of infection is minimal for vehicle users as disposable straws are used for each motorist. A cross-section of traffic policemen said they were the ones at risk. They demanded that all traffic police personnel be given masks and gloves to prevent transmission of the infection.

“When a person breathes into the straw, droplets can fall on the breathalyser. The machine is not changed, and so, we run the risk of contracting the infection. We should be provided with masks and gloves,” a policeman said.

A senior police officer said 200 breathalysers were being used in the city to detect drunk motorists. “The straws we use are disposable. For every motorist, we use a different straw. So the question of hygiene does not arise for the motorist,” said a police officer.

Koushik Muthuraja, associate professor and consultant, Pulmonology, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, said, “The risk is mainly for the policemen. So, ideally, all policemen should wear masks while carrying out the breathalyser test.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/traffic-police-fret-about-infection-risk-posed-by-breathalysers/article30730274.ece
207,2020/02/04,"Ahead of organisational polls, DMK revamps Salem, Namakkal units","Ahead of its organisational polls, slated to begin on February 21, the DMK high-command has cracked the whip on non-performers while rewarding district secretaries who put on a good show during the recent elections to rural local bodies.

Following its exemplary performance in the Tiruchi region, the DMK has rewarded former Minister and Tiruchi South district unit secretary K.N. Nehru by making him the principal secretary of the party. It has also appointed office-bearers to the Tiruchi district unit.

On Monday, the high-command revamped the district units of Salem and Namakkal. “Though we won the Lok Sabha polls in these regions, we couldn’t match that performance during the local body polls. A revamp is necessary to get the organisation geared up ahead of the next Assembly polls,” a senior leader explained. The party has dropped Veerapandi A. Raja, son of former Salem strongman Veerapandi S. Arumugam, from his position as in-charge of the Salem East district unit. He has been replaced by N.R. Sivalingam, who had been in charge of Salem West district unit. Mr. Sivalingam had functioned effectively as a deputy to Veerapandi Arumugam in Salem.

Mr. Raja has been made the election committee secretary.

The DMK high-command has given prominence to former M.P. T.M. Selvaganapathy by making him the in-charge of the Salem West district unit. He was earlier the election committee secretary. “Mr. Selvaganapathy (a former AIADMK Minister) knows the turf well, and is an effective organiser. His areas include the Edappadi Assembly constituency, won by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami; Mettur, represented by senior AIADMK leader S. Semmalai; and Sankari, won by AIADMK candidate S. Raja. We need a strong candidate there,” the senior leader said.

208,2020/02/04,Tamil Thai statue project remains on paper,"It’s been well over six years since then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced in the Assembly in 2013 that the AIADMK government will install a statue of Tamil Thai (Mother Tamil) in Madurai at a cost of ₹100 crore. But despite having undergone several modifications over the years, the project essentially remains on paper.

The initiative was aimed at showcasing various aspects of Tamil civilisation and its rich culture to the world. However, following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, several modifications were made to the project.

The allocation of funds was reduced to ₹50 crore. Though the original idea was to install the statue in Vandiyur lake in Madurai, its location was subsequently shifted to the World Tamil Sangam.

Official sources said one of the reasons behind the delay in executing the project was the frequent transfers of senior officers in the Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited, popularly known as Poompuhar (a State government undertaking), which is the nodal agency for implementing the project. The government’s proposal to style the statue after the Trevi Fountain in Italy drew criticism.

Row over material

There was also opposition to the material to be used for building the structure. Several political parties opposed the idea of using marbles, contending that they were traditionally used in north India, and demanded that the Tamil Thai statue be made of rock, in line with tradition.

When contacted, Minister for Tamil Official Language and Culture K. Pandiarajan acknowledged that there had been a delay in implementing the project.

He said many modifications had to be made to the proposal, and clearances from the Finance Department often posed a problem. He gave an assurance that the government will actively pursue the project.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fqnpnn/article30732335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th14opedKarthTH14-OPED-ARTISTSIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-thai-statue-project-remains-on-paper/article30730240.ece

211,2020/02/04,Caught in the quagmire of debt,"The main doorframe of the house sits loosely on the wall, with no cement plaster to bond them together and adjacent to the dilapidated house is a half-complete room without a roof on top, summing up the pathetic condition of the family which resides in it.

The inhabitant Raju, is an auto driver. About a decade ago he was pursing Intermediate in Hyderabad and doing a part-time job to support himself, when all of a sudden his life turned upside down. On October 27, 2011 he had to rush back to his village as his brother Kanakaiah, then aged 33 years, committed suicide by hanging.

The incident was a blow to the family. The first casualty was Raju’s education. Then, his father Uppalaiah’s health started deteriorating as his elder son, who took upon the family responsibilities, ended his life. The family revenues started dwindling and the interest amount on the ₹ 3 lakh debts incurred by Kanakaiah started piling up. Distressed, Uppalaiah too ended his life by consuming pesticide on September 16, 2014, a few months after formation of separate Telangana State. He too left a burden of another ₹ 3 lakh and the total debt of the family stood at about ₹ 6 lakh against a land holding of 1.8 acres.

In the meantime, Kanakaiah’s widow Pushpa and Uppalaiah’s widow Pochavva had to undergo surgeries for removal of uterus, which put additional costs on the family. Every day is humiliating for the family who have to put up with the insults from debtors who repeatedly demand repayment of their money.

“It’s a torture every day. They ask us when will we repay the debts and we have no answer . We are plucking flowers and selling them for a living with the support of Raju,” says Pochavva, adding that though several mediapersons visited them, no help has reached them so far. Recently they took up construction of a room as their house at present is not sufficient to accommodate the eight-member family of four children and four elders. But they had to discontinue midway unable to meet the expenses.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/x761d2/article30736841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05RAJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/caught-in-the-quagmire-of-debt/article30736842.ece

Ajay mentioned the names of seven people responsible for his death in his diary.

Ajay got married to one K Swetha in 2007 and the couple have two sons. The family lives in BN Reddy Nagar. He set up the hospital four years ago at the rented building. LB Nagar police said the building owner Karunakar Reddy wanted Ajay to vacate the premises, but the doctor was reluctant to do so.

In her complaint, Swetha stated that building owner Karunakar Reddy has been harassing and pressuring Ajay to vacate the premises and made his henchmen Shiva Kumar, former sarpanch of Turkayamjal, Megha Reddy of Saraswathi Nagar, Kondal Reddy, Shiva Reddy, Dr Ramesh and Yadagiri Reddy to file a case against the doctor.

LB Nagar police inspector V Ashok Reddy said that the doctor was allegedly harassed for the past one month.

The police have registered a case under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC against the seven mentioned in the diary and launched an investigation. The police would send the diary to Forensic Science Laboratory to confirm whether it was Ajay who wrote the note.

218,2020/02/04,"Injustice to TS, AP, Kerala in Union Budget: Raghavulu","CPI (Marxist) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu has criticized the Central government for meting out injustice to three southern States — Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala — by making paltry allocations in the budget introduced in Parliament recently.

Mr. Raghavulu said the budget did not reflect the aspirations of the people and it in fact appeared to pose hardships to the common man. There was no mention of steps to overcome the economic slowdown gripping different sectors and the budget can be best summed up as “anti-people”.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Raghavulu said the chief ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should take the initiative and join forces to protect the rights of the two States.

On the other issues, he criticized the BJP leaders for their criticism of Mahatma Gandhi as also their assertion that those opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens should be shot. The BJP leadership should ensure that its representatives took back their comments which were not in the interest of democracy.

In this context, Mr. Raghavulu appreciated the Telangana government for announcing its resolve against the implementation of the CAA. At the same time, the government should ensure passage of a resolution through the Assembly that it would not implement the National Population Register.

CPI (M) State secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram wanted the government to announce that it would not spare its staff for the implementation of CAA/NPR. The CPI (M) had decided to launch a door-to-door campaign against the ill-effects of the CAA/NPR and the campaign would be held between March 16 and 23.

He said the budget presented by the Union government was against the interests of the State as it did not contain adequate allocations in line with the requirements and there was no mention of steps that would be taken to fulfil the promises made to Telangana at the time of reorganization in 2014. The State, he said, should launch a struggle against the Centre for securing its justified allocations.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/19pimt/article30736326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05BVRAGHAVULU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/injustice-to-ts-ap-kerala-in-union-budget-raghavulu/article30736229.ece

Niranjan Reddy has stated that increasing urbanisation has been seriously impacting food production and consumption across the world and there is an urgent need to focus both on production and productivity of the foodgrains keeping in mind the shrinking resources — land and water.

Speaking at Digital Ag India Conference held here on Tuesday, he said the world’s population was expected to cross 9.6 billion by 2050 and it would bring a huge demand for food. However, those practising farming were coming down, including in India, and only 28% of the world population, including 570 million of small and marginal farmers, were depending on agriculture and food production sectors for their livelihoods.

He underscored the need to bring in drastic reforms in agriculture sector for its sustainable development and also to meet the United Nations call for achieving sustainable and hunger-free society. The Minister suggested linking the agriculture sector with technology for its faster and sustainable growth by using mobile and remote sensing technologies, at a time when their use had become extensive.

Stating that the agriculture sector had reached the present stage overcoming several challenges, the Minister said there was greater need to bring in another green revolution by linking technology. Towards that there was a need to change the existing farming practices, rural economy and management of natural resources, he noted.

The plea was filed by Garla Mandal Praja Parishad president Malothu Venkatlal against M. Ramakrishna over a quarry he was operating in Maddivancha village of Garla in Mahboobabad district. Mr. Venkatlal maintained that Mining Department had given permission to Mr. Ramakrishna to mine land of two acres under survey no. 119P of Maddivancha village.

He alleged that the quarry operator was extracting black granite in nearly 20 acres of land. He was causing a dent on the State exchequer by doing so, the petitioner charged. The petition is likely to come up for hearing in a day or two.

State Security Commission

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy had directed the State government to formulate guidelines and rules relating to appointment of State Security Commission and Police Complaint Authority. The Bench was hearing a writ appeal filed by governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over a single judge order to appoint SSC and PCA in their respective States.

The Telangana government counsel told the Bench that government had already written to the HC Registrar to suggest names of eligible former HC judges for appointment of these posts. The Bench observed that it was not sufficient to write a letter but the government should first formulate guidelines for appointment of eligible persons for the bodies.

The matter was posted for hearing after four weeks.

According to the police, Vinod went to take a holy dip in Jampannavagu before offering prayers to the deities. Vinod entered the water for bathing and suffered convulsions and breathlessness and died on the spot. The youth reportedly had sudden seizures and fell unconscious, said the police. Another version is that Vinod suffered convulsions even before he entered the water at the bathing ghat.

223,2020/02/04,Regional centre of Spices Board at Nizamabad announced,"The long struggle of turmeric farmers for the establishment of Turmeric Board is partly successful with the announcement of a regional centre of the Spices Board by Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Tuesday. Notification for setting up the centre would be issued shortly, he said in the presence of Member of Parliament D. Arvind and BJP leaders from the district.

The announcement, however, did not satisfy the farming community as they said that nothing short of a full fledged board is acceptable to them. Therefore, they also declared that they would go for another bout of struggle till their twin demands of ₹15,000 per quintal of MSP and the board were met.

Member of Parliament D. Arvind, meanwhile, said that the regional centre would be headed by an IAS officer and would enable farmers to use modern methods in cultivation resulting in high yield of turmeric crop. It would ensure the provision of quality seed, necessary implements and technology for processing the crop.

He said that farmers would get help from the centre to directly export the crop which has good medicinal values and international demand.

It would be more than a board and farmers would get benefits with the implementation of cluster system and TIES scheme, he said and thanked Prime Minister Modi and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal for sanctioning the Spices Board regional centre.

Leaders celebrate

Meanwhile, BJP leaders did ‘palabhishekam’ to the portrait of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, here on Tuesday, for sanctioning the regional centre of Spices Board to be based in Nizamabad.

Speaking on the occasion, the party State executive committee member Dhanpal Suryanarayana said that the decades old dream of the turmeric farmers of the region comprising integrated old district, Jagtial and Nirmal districts where the crop is grown predominantly became a reality.

The farmers would get benefited with the board, he said.

Not adequate

Telangana Turmeric Farmers’ Association (TTFA) president Kotapati Narsimha Naidu said in a statement, here on Tuesday, that regional centre would be of no use. Farmers could get benefited only when a board is established with an annual allocation of ₹100 crore.

The turmeric growers must be paid a minimum support price of ₹15,000 per quintal of turmeric so that their all expenses for the cultivation of the crop are covered, he said.

Mr. Naidu said that the proposal for a regional centre in fact had been made by the Ministry way back in 2007, but farmers had rejected it then. Former member of Parliament K.

226,2020/02/04,"Food, fun, and frolic jataras also damage the environment in Telangana’s tribal belt","The jatara, or village fair season in the tribal belt of former composite Adilabad district between January and March every year brings entertainment and enjoyment closer to the rural folk living in far corners. But there’s also huge collateral damage - it spells doom for the local environment.

The makeshift hotels are the most important and popular part of any such fair as they dish out traditional sweetmeats like the mouth watering laddu, jalebi and balushahi besides the regular poori bhaji, bajji, chivda etc. So far so good. But these hotels also use tonnes of fuelwood extracted illegally from forests nearby and right under the nose of the foresters concerned.

Carnival season

The jatara season starts around end December or early January. The first of such fairs held on the bed of river Penganga on the inter-State border that Adilabad district shares with Maharashtra along the NH 44. It is followed by the Adivasi events at Sadalpur Bhairamdev jatara in Bela mandal, the Narnoor Khamdev jatara in Narnoor mandal, the Keslapur Nagoba jatara in Indervelli mandal, the Shampur Budumdev jatara (currently on) in Utnoor mandal, all in Adilabad district. Then the Sirpur jatara in the remote Lingapur mandal, and finally the Kerameri jatara in Kerameri mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district closer to Holi.

Tonnes of fuelwood and smoke

Each event roughly goes on for over 10 days, boasts of at least 25 joints, each hotel consuming around three bullock cart loads of firewood during the duration and each cart containing of 15 to 20 quintals of illegally felled fuelwood from the forests. A quick back of the envelope calculation is revealing. For instance, the recently concluded Keslapur Nagoba jatara had 28 temporary eateries, and used about 170 tonnes of firewood cumulatively.

“The burning of such enormous quantities of fuelwood also adds to pollution in the place. The Forest Department can actually help the government in making the hoteliers opt for LPG by controlling use of firewood,” suggested a bangle shop owner at Shampur jatara.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/food-fun-and-frolic-jataras-also-damage-the-environment-in-telanganas-tribal-belt/article30732916.ece
227,2020/02/04,Sense of pride and duty makes tribal constable an artefacts collector,"The small collection of about 500 old pieces of objects and artefacts used in day to day life by the aboriginal people, and a handful of antiquated weapons, reveals a much bigger sense of duty and pride towards his tribe in Durva Santhosh, the Raj Gond Adivasi youth from Muthnur in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district.

This 30-year-old police constable, posted at Gadiguda police station, began collecting ‘pedana veesora’ or old objects and books on tribal life and culture in 2012 while studying degree, inspired by Adilabad Kala Ashram founder, the late Guruji Ravinder Sharma.

In 2017, he donated all his collection, including books, to Marlavai village in Jainoor mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, where the legendary Austrian anthropologist Christop von Furer Haimendorf had stayed during his studies on Raj Gonds in the 1940s. The village now has a library and museum managed by Haimendorf Youth.

“The future generations must get to know the living style of our ancestors,” Mr. Santhosh observed as he talked to The Hindu at his exhibition in the just concluded Nagoba jatara at Keslapur in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district.

He displayed a couple of old rusty and out of use swords from his collection to reveal that the Raj Gonds once belonged to the warrior class and to buttress his point of view.

“The books here are chronicles of the life and times of Adivasis in these parts which will help youth to learn a lot,” the collector pointed out.

“Some of these pertain to current education which will help them prepare for competitive exams,” he disclosed of another aspect of his ‘library’.

The range of artefacts include jewellery, vessels to heat bathing water called gangar, now almost out of vogue, and cooking utensils, besides wooden objects like ‘chede’, the seed sower.

There is also the full range of grain measures which are completely out of use.

The exhibition, a big draw in the jatara, also had on display some vinyl posters which formed part of police awareness efforts.

228,2020/02/04,Unforgettable stint of a people’s leader,"There is no living person to recall the time spent by legendary Austrian anthropologist Christoph von Furer-Haimendorf in the midst of Adilabad’s Adivasis way back in the 1940s, but going by what has been passed down through oral tradition, he was the only one from the outside world to have established a proper connect with the aboriginal people in these parts — until, of course, D. Divya arrived on the scene.

Her arrival in December 2017 as Collector of the truncated residual Adilabad was itself remarkable as it was a tumultuous period in the history of the aboriginal people between Penganga in the north and Godavari in the south. She was, late on Sunday, transferred as Secretary of Department of Women and Child Welfare after a successful tenure of over two years as Collector. Her administration stands out in terms of reaching out to people, especially with regard to tribal development.

Ms. Divya took over as Collector just after a phase of violence had rocked the tribal belt, the government having mandated her to bring back peace to the area. The circumstances were similar to those when Prof. Haimendorf had arrived trailing the violent struggle of Adivasis against the Nizam of Hyderabad which eventually led to the martyrdom of Kumram Bheem at Jodeghat in present-day Kumram Bheem Asifabad district in 1940.

The comparison between the two personalities separated by three quarters of a century does not end there as the Collector also got down to learning Gondi dialect in order to establish the connect which is crucial to understanding the people and setting things back in order. Some research into tribal culture also took place during her incumbency.

Her numerous visits to habitations of ethnic tribes brought her closer to the people. She became accessible even to the poor from the remotest corner, by helping them in need.

Among things that endeared her to the common tribal folk is the support that she extended to those who suffered from various types of deadly ailments. She had Adivasi kids and youth access expensive healthcare in corporate hospitals in Hyderabad and elsewhere.

For her work, Ms. Divya was equated with Jangubai, the all powerful goddess of Adivasis who bestowed upon the devotees what they deserved. And being compared with the goddess is a rare honour in the world of ethnic tribes.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9r385d/article30729731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03-DIVYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/unforgettable-stint-of-a-peoples-leader/article30729723.ece

232,2020/02/04,Murder accused on the run for 22 years held,"The Kothagudem Two Town police on Monday arrested an accused in a murder case, who had been absconding for the past 22 years.

The police identified the arrested person as Prahlad Maurya, an accused in a murder case dating back to 1994 at Nine Incline Colony under Kothagudem Two Town police station limits. He allegedly went into hiding without attending trial after being arrested in the murder case since 1998, sources said.

He had lived in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh States in hiding all these years.

As part of renewed efforts to nab him, the local police tracked his movements based on credible inputs that he was staying in Manuguru mandal for the past six months.

233,2020/02/04,‘Take initiative for turmeric board’,"Vyavasaya Karmika Sangham (VKS) district committee general secretary Peddi Venkatramulu has appealed to the Central and State governments to take initiatives to establish turmeric board and ensure an MSP of ₹15,000 per quintal for the crop in view of the deteriorating economic conditions of turmeric farmers.

Wondering why the successive governments were reluctant to establish a turmeric board though the crop has very good medicinal properties and export potentiality, he questioned that when tobacco, which harms human health, had a separate board why shouldn’t turmeric have a board? If the crop continued to be neglected, turmeric growers would disappear in future, he said.

After interacting with turmeric farmers at agriculture marketyard here on Monday, he said that separate warehouses should be provided for turmeric to enable farmers to store the crop and clear the stocks when they get acceptable price in the market. He said the ruling party should understand the ire of turmeric farmers who showed their power in the Lok Sabha elections.

Mr. Venkatramulu said that of the total quantity of turmeric grown in the country 30 per cent comes from Nizamabad. Farmers incurred losses as they were spending over ₹1 lakh per acre for raising the crop, but they were not getting remunerative price, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4byc9t/article30729392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04PASUPU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/take-initiative-for-turmeric-board/article30729393.ece
234,2020/02/04,Kobe Bryant’s death put life in perspective for me: Virat Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday said the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash has impacted his outlook towards life, which he feels, is sometimes taken for granted in pursuit of control over the future.

Bryant, a two-time Olympic gold-medallist and one of the most decorated basketball players of all time, died in a helicopter crash last month along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who was also a budding hoopster.

“Firstly, it was a shock to everyone. I grew up watching those NBA games in the morning and watching what he did on court. But when someone that you have looked up to in some ways, passes away like that, it does put things in perspective,” Kohli said on the eve of the first ODI against New Zealand here.

”...at the end of the day, life can be so fickle. It’s so unpredictable. I think a lot of the times we get too caught up in the pressures of what we have to do tomorrow...we really forget living life and enjoying life and just appreciating and being grateful for the life we have,” he added.

Kohli said a tragedy like this makes one realise that nothing can be more important than enjoying every moment of existence.

”...it did put things in perspective for me massively. It just makes you feel like not wanting to have control of things in front of you all the time, and just embracing life and appreciating it.

“You start looking at things from a different point of view suddenly and you want to enjoy every moment you’re going through. You realise that what you’re doing at the end of the day is not the most important thing. The most important thing is life itself,” Kohli signed off.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/uhmhoi/article30681135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATKOHLINDIAAUSTRALIACRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/kobe-bryants-death-put-life-in-perspective-for-me-virat-kohli/article30732532.ece
235,2020/02/04,CM to dedicate UNESCO certificate for Jaipur,"Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will dedicate the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site certificate for Jaipur to the people at a function here on Wednesday. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay will be felicitated on the occasion.

Ms. Azoulay’s visit to Jaipur assumes significance after the UNESCO declared the Walled City, famous for its grid plan-based architecture and buildings constructed with the pink facade, as a world heritage site in July last year.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites had earlier inspected the city in 2018 after its nomination. The council took into account the architecture of streets with colonnades, which intersect the centre, creating large public squares called chaupars. The uniform facades of markets, residences and temples in the main streets had also impressed the council.

Director (Tourism) Bhanwar Lal said here on Tuesday that a brochure on “intangible heritage promotion project” would also be released at the function.

Cultural tourism

The project, signed between the Tourism Department and UNESCO, aims at developing 10 new cultural tourism destinations in the State, for which the tourists could extend their stay by at least one extra day.

Dr. Lal said the project would be implemented during the next three years at a cost of ₹7.50 crore. It will directly benefit about 1,500 artistes in the districts such as Jodhpur, Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner, known for folk music and traditional handicrafts.

The capital city of Jaipur, included in the list of world heritage sites, was founded in 1727 by the then Kachwaha Rajput ruler of Amber, Sawai Jai Singh II. The city was established on the plains and built according to a grid plan interpreted in the light of Vedic architecture.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cm-to-dedicate-unesco-certificate-for-jaipur/article30737121.ece
236,2020/02/04,"Three months after tragedy, M.P. Dalit family waits for jobs, houses","More than three months have passed yet the families of two Dalit children thrashed to death for defecating in the open by upper caste men in Shivpuri district in September last year have not been shifted into new houses or given jobs and land promised to them by Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia within a month.

“Nothing can cure the deep wounds the family has suffered,” he told reporters after meeting the family in Bhavkhedi village of the district on October 14. “But being people’s servants, the least we can do is bring them succour. The construction of permanent houses would at least take a month.”

Besides, Mr. Scindia, a former MP from Guna, stating it was unbelievable someone in “his region” could even think of committing such an act, had assured the Mehtar family’s adult members employment, children’s education and had requested Chief Minister Kamal Nath to allot 20 bigha of land on “humanitarian ground” to them.

‘Promise unfulfilled’

“The promises of Maharaj have come to naught,” Bablu Valmik*, whose son, 11, and sister, 12, were the victims, told The Hindu, referring to Mr. Scindia, who belongs to the royal family of Gwalior. “The wheat we got in assistance is over, we don’t have a ration card for the city yet and there is no work promised to us. I thought with a permanent job, I could help meet at least the daily expenses.”

Under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the family received ₹8,25,000 on top of ₹50,000 as compensation by the panchayat. While Mr. Valmik has set aside a lakh each as fixed deposit in a bank for his two daughters’ wedding, he had to shell out ₹2 lakh each for two new houses, with ₹4 lakh left in his bank account now. “Both the girls go to school in Shivpuri, and they don’t face caste discrimination like in the village school,” he said.

At present, the family — Mr. Valmik and four brothers, his wife, daughters and parents, sister-in-law and two nephews — is staying at two temporary houses having a room, a kitchen and a bathroom each in a colony for Public Health Engineering officials in the city. “There is no water connection, even in the toilet. We have to pay ₹350 for a tanker every three days,” he said. Back in the village, the family stayed in two ramshackle huts without toilets, which prompted the two victims to go out for defecation in the district, declared open defecation-free by the government.

On September 25, as the two victims defecated in the open along a village road, two men of the Yadav community, dominant locally, struck lathis on their heads, killing them. They were later arrested.

Daily wage work

An agricultural labourer back then, Mr. Valmik every morning now rushes to the city circle to seek daily wage work as a construction worker, making ₹150-200 a day, along with one of his brothers. “The two-and-a-half bigha land in my father’s name in the village is lying fallow. We get just one crop during the monsoon a year anyway,” he added. The family, now in a city, can’t even practice the traditional occupation of playing dhapli, a drum, during ceremonies for a fee.

‘Job order ready’

Stating that Mr. Valmik’s job order was ready, Deputy Collector Manoj Garwal said, “He can start working whenever he wants by collecting the order from the Municipal Council office. He’ll be employed as a watchman at a park, with the starting pay scale at ₹6,000 a month.”

Moreover the houses, built under the PM Affordable Housing Scheme, were almost ready, he said. “We’ve collected ₹4 lakh from them for two houses where they can shift once registration of the new colony is completed with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority. The colony will have regular water supply through pipelines,” he said, adding that in most parts of the city water was supplied through tankers.

“What Mr. Scindia and the State government has committed, they’ll surely fulfil it. The houses will be ready in a month and Mr. Valmik can start working from tomorrow, as the go-ahead has been given. As for land, we will allot it soon,” said Pankaj Chaturvedi, aide of Mr. Scindia, and State Congress spokesperson.

237,2020/02/04,SAD to stage protests against Punjab govt.,"The Shiromani Akali Dal has decided to stage protests against the ruling Congress government, which is about to complete three years in power, for its alleged anti-people policies.

In a statement, senior party leader Daljeet Singh Cheema said the decision regarding the schedule of the protests was taken at a meeting which was presided over by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal.

At the meeting, Mr. Badal said the manner in which government functioning had been paralysed, development stopped, power rates for domestic and industrial supply hiked besides deterioration in the law and order situation, it seemed that no government exists in Punjab.

“SAD through its series of ‘dharnas’ would galvanise people into action and force the government to fulfil the promises made to farmers, youth and weaker sections of society,” said Mr. Badal.

Protests intensified

Mr. Cheema said that it was decided that the party will intensify the protests against the Congress party and that the SAD had finalised the dates for the 15 district-level ‘dharnas’, which would start on February 13 from Amritsar and culminate on April 11 in Mohali.

238,2020/02/04,AMU Proctor resigns from post,"Afifulllah Khan, the Proctor of Aligarh Muslim University, has resigned from his post. An official release said Prof. Khan had tendered his resignation and that Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor has accepted it and appointed Mohd. Wasim Ali, a professor in the Department of Law, in his place.

AMU students have been demanding his resignation, along with that of the V-C and Registrar, for allowing the police to enter the campus on December 15, 2019. The demand grew louder when the proctorial team nabbed two students and a former student for heckling the V-C during his Republic Day speech and handed them over to the district administration.

The university's official spokesperson said Prof. Khan had cited personal reasons for his decision.

However, sources said his resignation had been sought in an attempt to defuse the situation and is a sort of 'reward' for the students who have returned to classes.

“It could embolden the students to continue with their other demands. The administration wanted to show that they were responding to students’ demands and Prof. Khan, who is not known to be part of the university’s power centre, was the easiest among the four whose resignation was being sought by students,” said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Faizul Hasan, former president of the Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union, described Prof. Khan’s resignation as a “victory in the fight for justice”. “We will continue to demand the resignation of the V-C, Registrar and Dean of Students’ Welfare even as our protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will continue,” he said.

In a related development, the protesting students held a condolence meeting for the infant who died because of winter chill at the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protest.

5 students booked

Meanwhile, five students of AMU have been booked for burning the effigies of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath during protests against the CAA. Circle Officer Anil Sharma said they had been booked for raising slogans against Mr. Shah and Mr. Adityanath and burning their effigies at Duck Point inside the AMU campus.

They were protesting against the recent law and order problems in the State during the ongoing anti-CAA demonstrations.

When contacted for details of the charges against the students, AMU officials said, “We are awaiting details”.

239,2020/02/04,First underwater metro to begin services in Kolkata from February 13,"The first underwater metro project in the country and the second metro project in Kolkata will begin truncated services from February 13. Services along the much-awaited mega infrastructure project called East West Metro will start along the 5-km route from Salt Lake Sector V to the Salt Lake Stadium.

“The inauguration will be on February 13 and the services will be opened for passengers from the next day. There are six stations along the route,” spokesperson of the Kolkata Metro Indrani Banerjee said. The six stations will be operational through an elevated corridor along the route. Railway Minister Piyush Goyal is expected to flag off the ₹8,575-crore project at an event where invitations are likely to be extended to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

The Commissioner of Railway Safety had given the go ahead to the truncated services in October 2019 but a few more months went by for signalling system and alignment of trains at the platform.

The 16.6-km East West Metro Project will connect the Howrah Maidan on the other side of river Hooghly with Rajarahat Newtown on the northeastern fringes of the city. The elevated corridor is 5.8 km long while the underground stretch measures 10.8 km. The tunnelling of about 13 metres under the Hooghly river bed was successfully completed in 2017.

The development marks an important chapter in the transport history of Kolkata as the city, with one of the least road space ratios among major metropolises, will get a metro service after three and half decades. The Kolkata Metro that connects Noapara in the northern parts of the city to Garia in the south along the 27.22 km, was started in 1984. On a week day, the Kolkata Metro (North-South) carries about six lakh passengers. The East West Metro, when it will be fully operational, is expected to ferry about 2 lakh people daily.

The foundation stone of the project was laid in February 2009 and the project was supposed to be completed by October 2014. The delay of more than five years can be attributed to change in the route of the metro. Earlier, the East West Metro Project was supposed to take a different route and the Central Metro Station was supposed to be the connecting station for both the metros but after protests and objections from the State government the route had to be realigned. It was changed and Esplanade will be the connecting station. The work was stalled from 2012 to 2015 due to realignment.

Questions about the fate of the project had surfaced again in September 2019 when several houses collapsed during underground tunnelling in the Bowbazar area. The tunnel-boring machine hit an aquifer resulting in ground subsidence. Hundreds of families were shifted to hotels by the Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Limited (KMRCL) after the houses collapsed. The last leg of tunnelling along the 2.45-km from Bowbazar to Sealdah still remains stalled. Once the tunnelling is over, the East West Metro will all be set to connect Howrah and Sealdah station that ferries lakhs of commuters every day.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/slkich/article30736184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EASTWESTMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/first-underwater-metro-to-begin-services-in-kolkata-from-feb-13/article30736185.ece
240,2020/02/04,Shahjahanpur case: HC says not sure who exploited whom,"The Allahabad High Court said it is difficult to determine who exploited whom in the case in which former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand is accused of sexually abusing a law student.

In fact, both of them used each other, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi said on February 4 while granting bail to the BJP leader, accused of sexual exploitation of the student for several months.

The judge also transferred the case to a trial court in Lucknow, noting the woman’s apprehension that the BJP leader could meddle with the law if the case is heard in his hometown Shahjahanpur.

Mr. Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman studied, was arrested on September 20 under section 376-C of the IPC, a charge short of rape. It is applied when someone in authority takes advantage of his official position to “induce or seduce” a woman to have sex with him.

In a parallel case, the woman was charged with trying to extort ₹5 crore from Mr. Chinmayanand, whom she had accused of rape. The High Court granted her bail on December 4.

In Monday’s order granting bail to Mr. Chinmayanand, Justice Chaturvedi took note of the allegations that the woman and her three friends tried to blackmail the politician with the videos she shot while giving massages to the politician.

The woman has, however, alleged that she went to Mr. Chinmayanand under threat from his goons. She had then started using a spy camera to make video clips.

The judge also noted material on record indicating that she and her family members enjoyed the patronage and benevolence of the politician.

‘Case of quid pro quo’

“In the present scenario, where this court finds that it might be a case of quid pro quo, the intriguing question arises whether the applicant be granted bail or not?” the judge noted.

“As pointed out earlier, both parties crossed their limits and at this stage it is very difficult to adjudicate as to who exploited whom. In fact, both of them used each other,” the bail order said.

It is also noticeable that there is also nothing on record to show that during the period of the alleged atrocities committed upon Miss A she made any complaint or even any whisper to her family members against the accused applicant, the order said.

The judge said at this juncture the court draws the conclusion that it was a complete matter of quid pro quo.

But over time there was greed to extract more and the woman tried to blackmail Mr. Chinmayanand through the obscene videos recorded by her, the court observed.

The judge, however, directed the trial court that no observation made while passing the bail order should affect it in its own proceedings.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/qqy38r/article30731433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NorthIndia1NoGHK72MCPE4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shahjahanpur-case-hc-says-not-sure-who-exploited-whom/article30734419.ece
241,2020/02/04,West Bengal government to provide a chopper to the Governor for his visit to Santiniketan,"In what can be seen as a sign of reconciliation between the State administration and the Raj Bhavan, the Mamata Banerjee government has decided to provide Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar with a helicopter for his travel to Santiniketan on Thursday.

The Governor’s Secretariat requested a chopper from the State for Mr. Dhankhar’s travel and, unlike previous occasions, it has been approved. “We sought a chopper for the Governor’s visit to Santiniketan to attend a programme. It was approved by the State government,” a Raj Bhavan official said on Tuesday.

Ministerial meeting

The development comes a day after Mr. Dhankhar held a meeting with State Finance Minister Amit Mitra and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee to discuss the State Budget session scheduled to start from February 7. Mr. Chatterjee, also secretary general of the ruling Trinamool Congress, had a meeting with the Governor for over an hour on Sunday too.

A senior TMC leader said the development is an indication of both the Raj Bhavan and the State government softening their stance. On several occasions last year, the State government had rejected Mr. Dhankhar’s requests for a chopper to travel to Santiniketan, Domkal and Farakka, which was around 300 km from Kolkata.

The Governor has been at loggerheads with the TMC government over a number of issues ranging from Mr. Dhankhar’s seating arrangement at the Durga Puja carnival to comments on his security since he rushed to Jadavpur University to “rescue” Union minister Babul Supriyo who was heckled there by a section of students.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qbuel1/article30734352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23JAGDEEPDHANKAR-4feb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-government-to-provide-a-chopper-to-the-governor-for-his-visit-to-santiniketan/article30734315.ece

The Speaker’s tribunal, which is hearing the disqualification petitions against the Minister and seven other Congress MLAs directed Mr. Shyamkumar to file all additional documents, if there were any, within February 12.

Congress members K. Meghachandra and Fazur Rahim had filed the petitions against Mr. Shyamkumar, who had contested the 2017 Assembly polls as a Congress candidate and defeated Nimaichand Luwang of the BJP by a margin of 7,086 votes.

However, Mr. Shyamkumar joined the BJP on March 11 even before being sworn in as an MLA. He was inducted on March 15 as a Cabinet Minister.

Seven other Congress MLAs had joined the ruling BJP in phases. However, the Speaker did not recognise them as BJP MLAs and did not allow them to sit in the ruling bench.

In the last election, the Congress which was in power for three successive terms bagged 28 seats while the BJP secured 21 seats. With the support of other parties N. Biren could form an alternative Ministry on March 15, 2017.

247,2020/02/04,SA vs ENG: De Kock helps South Africa ease to victory against England,"Captain Quinton de Kock smashed a sparkling century as South Africa eased to a seven-wicket victory against world champions England in the opening One-Day International at Newlands on Tuesday.

After being put into bat, England overcame a top-order wobble to post 258 for eight in their 50 overs, helped by a well-constructed 87 from Joe Denley in the side's first ODI outing since lifting the World Cup at Lord's last July.

But De Kock (107) and Temba Bavuma (98) put on 173 for the second wicket as South Africa reached 259 for three to secure victory with 14 balls to spare.

The second ODI will be played in Durban on Friday, with the three-match series ending in Johannesburg on Sunday.

England fielded just five players who featured in last year's World Cup final having rested Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for this series, with seamer Chris Woakes the only survivor from the bowling attack.

South Africa lost Reeza Hendricks for six early in their chase, caught by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Woakes.

But De Kock and Bavuma played risk-free cricket, rotating the strike superbly, while hitting boundaries when presented with the opportunity to do so.

De Kock reached his 15th ODI century in 106 balls before he was bowled by the part-time spin of Joe Root.

Bavuma, playing in only his third ODI, was trapped leg before wicket by Chris Jordan just two runs short of what would have been a deserved maiden ton, but played a crucial role in sealing the win.

England started their innings brightly, reaching 51 without loss in the 10th over, but lost five wickets for the addition of another 57 runs as their top-order crumbled.

Jason Roy (32) looked in good touch before he picked out to Hendricks at long-off from the bowling of spinner Jon-Jon Smuts, and Jonny Bairstow (19) fell to Andile Phehlukwayo.

Root (17) was brilliantly run-out by sharp work from Rassie van der Dussen at backward square-leg, and when captain Eoin Morgan (11) was caught by Bavuma at slip from leg-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3-38), the home side were on top.

Shamzi also picked up the wickets of debutant Tom Banton (18) and Sam Curran (7) to leave England reeling, but Denley and Woakes (40) put on 91 for the seventh wicket to help the visitors post a sizeable total for the home side to chase.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7i6o5e/article30737028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Quintondekock,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-tour-of-south-africa-south-africa-vs-england-first-odi-in-cape-town/article30736073.ece
248,2020/02/04,Under 19 World Cup | India enters final after beating Pakistan by 10 wickets,"Yashasvi Jaiswal batted like a man among boys while Kartik Tyagi reminded Pakistan of Waqar Younis’ toe-crushing yorkers as defending champions India walloped their arch-rivals by 10 wickets to enter their seventh ICC U-19 World Cup final in Potchefstroom on Tuesday.

The gulf in class between the two sides was evident as Indian bowlers collectively choked Pakistan to a paltry 172 in 43.1 overs. Left-handed opener Jaiswal then showed his class with an unbeaten knock of 105 off 113 balls, with an equally graceful Divyansh Saxena (59 not out off 99 balls) supporting him in an easy chase completed in only 35.2 overs.

“It’s a dream come true for me. To be able to do this for my country is a great feeling. To score a hundred against Pakistan in a World Cup semi-final is something I can’t put into words,” Jaiswal, who hit eight fours and four sixes, said after winning the ‘Player of the Match’ award.

India thus maintained their supremacy over Pakistan at the age-group and senior level in ICC tournaments -- both men and women.

The ‘Boys in Blue’ have earlier reached the summit clash in 2000 (winners), 2006 (runners-up), 2008 (winners), 2012 (winners), 2016 (runners-up) and 2018 (winners).

The current batch with key players, having already played senior representative cricket and five with IPL deals in their bag, showed the difference in skill level and application from their opponents, an aspect that could be attributed to the robust junior cricket structure put in place by none other than Rahul Dravid.

Jaiswal literally toyed with the bowling attack, hitting the Pakistani bowlers towards all parts of the ground. The youngest Indian double centurion in List A cricket finished the game with a six, which also completed his hundred.

En route his hundred, pacer Abbas Afridi was effortlessly hit over deep mid-wicket for a six and then pulled the next one behind square for another six.

The Pakistan bowling attack was pedestrian at best and didn’t have much answers to the drives that flowed from Yashasvi’s blade. Divyansh’s batting was also pleasing to the eye, playing the ball late.

“We were talking about how we needed to stick at the wicket. They bowled well initially and we wanted to ride that out and we knew we could dominate them after that,” Jaiswal added.

The match as a contest was over in the first half when Pakistani batsmen had no answer to Tyagi’s pace and Bishnoi’s variations.

Pacer Tyagi (2/32 in 8 overs) bowled yorkers at will while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/46 in 10 overs) was a difficult proposition to read for the Pakistani batsmen after opting to bat.

Pakistan skipper Rohail Nazir (62 off 102 balls) and opener Haider Ali (56 off 77 balls) were the only ones to make significant contributions as their innings lasted 43.1 overs.

While Tyagi’s scorching pace and Bishnoi’s googlies were eye-catching, left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar (1/29 in 7 overs), left-arm seamer Sushant Mishra (3/28 in 8.1 overs) and part-time leg-spinner Yashasvi Jaiswal (1/11 in 3 overs) also kept the rival batsmen under check.

Tyagi, probably one of the fastest bowlers in India in his age category, bowled an inswinging yorker wide off the crease to uproot Irfan Khan’s off-stump and then got his second wicket with an intimidating bouncer that removed tail-ender Tahir Hussain.

He literally aimed for the base of the stumps with deliveries beautifully tailing in, which must have pleased Pakistan coach Ijaz Ahmed, who has seen Waqar bowl a few during his hey days.

249,2020/02/04,"Not looking at New Zealand ODIs as preparation for T20 World Cup, IPL right platform for it: Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday said that his team is not looking to strengthen its T20 World Cup preparations in the ODI series against New Zealand as the upcoming IPL is the “right platform” for it.

However, head coach Ravi Shastri had last month said that the ODIs India play against New Zealand and South Africa (in March) could be a preparatory ground for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October-November.

“We have had five T20s already, it’s not that we don’t have a lot of T20 cricket. We have IPL as well which is going to be a month and a half of T20 cricket. So we will probably utilise that, I think, because last year (for ODI World Cup) you did not have much opportunity to prepare yourselves apart from the games that were in front of you,” said Kohli on the eve of the first ODI here on Wednesday.

“But T20s is very different, as I said. IPL is probably the most competitive tournament you can ask for as a collective and guys will look to get into that frame of mind in that tournament and not this early in a 50-over format because you don’t want to play in a different manner.”

The skipper feels it is important to give equal respect to each format.

“You have to respect the format, you have to play according to the pace of the 50-over game and as I spoke of the combination as well. It’s about guys getting settled in their roles and repeating that game after game so that they know I played this in this format, I have to play this in T20s or similarly in Test cricket.

“These things are all about creating good habits for different formats and then being able to switch between them. So no, we are not looking at this series as preparation for T20 World Cup. IPL is going to be the right platform for that.”

India go into the three-match series high on confidence, after a 5-0 whitewash against New Zealand in the T20 series. Kohli’s team had also beaten New Zealand 4-1 in ODIs last year before going down in T20s.

“The last time around, when we played here, we dominated the first three games. Lost the fourth and came back in the fifth one again. We felt we had more time to work out our plans in the ODIs actually. The T20 format was something that suited New Zealand more as they could play some explosive cricket and really did come after our side but in one-day cricket, we have played some really hard-fought series.”

He expects New Zealand to bounce back strongly following the drubbing in T20s.

“That’s something that we need to be wary of, that we keep believing in our own plans and ride those pockets of pressure and eventually turn the situation around for ourselves. That’s something that we’ve always known with the New Zealand side that they’ll not give up and keep finding a way to come back into the game,” he said.

India’s out-fielding has been quite poor of late and consistently low standards have become a concern despite flashes of brilliance. Kohli said the team management had taken note of this and there is focus on lifting the fielding aspect along with batting and bowling.

“If you look at the average age of this team, it’s 27 max. So we should be fielding way better than what we have. I think the standards of fielding overall were not that good from either side. T20 cricket it can happen because the game is so fast-paced.

“So once you get into a nervous zone, it’s very difficult to get out of it. It’s moving so quickly and the ball keeps coming to you. Even in one-day cricket, we have had performances that we are not proud of and there’s no hiding from it.”

Kohli said it is imperative that due attention is given to fielding.

“You certainly expect a young bunch of guys who are very fit and very, very good fielders to do the job for you in the field collectively and not just focus on batting or bowling.

It’s about taking all three skills seriously and committing to it like bowling or batting. Things can be taken for granted. That’s something that we want to stay away from,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dr5s40/article30732992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/not-looking-at-new-zealand-odis-as-preparation-for-t20-world-cup-ipl-right-platform-for-it-kohli/article30732994.ece
250,2020/02/04,Injury-hit India look for context in ODI battle against subdued New Zealand,"Injuries to key players has opened the door for exciting youngsters such as Prithvi Shaw to make an impression in the Indian line-up against a low-on-confidence and depleted New Zealand in the three-match ODI series starting here on Wednesday.

This is India’s third ODI assignment after the World Cup last year, having previously beaten West Indies (away) and Australia (at home).

New Zealand, on the other hand, play their first ODI since that controversial loss at Lord’s in the World Cup final against England.

The last time these two sides met in the 50-over format, New Zealand had knocked India out of the World Cup with an 18-run win over two days in the second semi-final at Manchester.

India extracted revenge with a 5-0 T20 whitewash that concluded on Sunday.

In the current context, stakes aren’t that high as both sides prepare for the T20 World Cup later in Australia this year. In fact, the upcoming two-Test series later this month bears more significance than this ODI clash.

In the ODI series, neither side will be at full strength as a string of first-team players will be missing due to injuries.

India were dealt a major blow when Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the remainder of this tour owing to the calf injury he picked up in the final T20I. India are already missing Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar.

For New Zealand, inspirational skipper Kane Williamson has joined the long list of injured along with the likes of Trent Boult.

Mayank Agarwal was named as Rohit’s replacement for the ODI series on Tuesday afternoon. And skipper Virat Kohli outlined that they will stick to the strategy adopted against Australia in Rajkot, where KL Rahul kept wickets and batted at number five.

Debutant openers

Kohli had more or less confirmed Shaw’s ODI debut in that scenario, and now India will probably have two openers debuting.

The last time such a situation arose was 2016, when Rahul and Karun Nair opened for India on their debuts in Zimbabwe.

Sunil Gavaskar and Sudhir Naik (1974) against England and Parthasarthy Sharma and Dilip Vengsarkar (1976) against New Zealand are the other previous instances.

Such a move would set up India’s batting line-up with Kohli at number three and Shreyas Iyer at number four.

In the nets on Tuesday, Manish Pandey batted along with Kohli and Iyer, ahead of Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant and Kedar Jadhav.

If Pandey plays, the lower order will be a curious mix with Dube, Jadhav and Ravindra Jadeja vying for the all-rounder’s spot.

In the bowling department, three pacers will probably be the norm once again.

Kuldeep Yadav, who sat out the entire T20I series, is slated for a comeback given his performance against Australia at home.

Latham to lead

New Zealand will have some re-think before finalising their playing eleven too.

Tom Latham will lead the side ahead of Tim Southee who was stand-in skipper during the last two T20Is. In Williamson’s absence, they will look towards Ross Taylor for batting leadership.

New Zealand will be rejuvenated though with the inclusion of all-rounder Jimmy Neesham while Colin de Grandhomme returns to the squad as well. Ish Sodhi is only there for the first ODI and the hosts could opt for a two-spinner attack given the slower surface at Seddon Park.

Keeper-batsman Tom Blundell and lanky pacer Kyle Jamieson are the only ones who don’t have an ODI cap to their name.

Teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini.

251,2020/02/04,Mitch Marsh and Glenn Maxwell back for Australia in ODI/T20 squads for South Africa,"Australia has recalled allrounder Mitch Marsh and Glenn Maxwell for the one-day international and Twenty20 tour of South Africa.

Marsh last featured in an Australian side in the Ashes series last September. He hasn’t played an ODI since January 2018 or a T20 international since October 2018.

Maxwell last played for Australia in October before taking a break from cricket, citing mental health issues. He returned to action in the BBL for the Melbourne Stars.

On Tuesday, Marcus Stonis was named the Big Bash League’s domestic player of the tournament, but he was left out of both squads.

“Marcus Stoinis is a stand-by player for each squad and was unlucky to miss out due to the make-up of the current top order,” selector Trevor Hohns said in a statement Tuesday.

“It is terrific to have a back-up player of his caliber in such good form.”

Pacemen Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson were named in the T20 squad and Matthew Wade was included in both.

Australia will play three T20s against South Africa — on Feb. 21, 23 and 26 — before three one-dayers on Feb. 29, March 4 and March 7.

“Vice-captain Rohit Sharma sustained a left calf muscle strain during the fifth T20I against New Zealand at Tauranga on Sunday.

“He underwent an MRI scan in Hamilton on Monday. The opening batsman has been ruled out of the upcoming ODI and the Test series and will be referred to the National Cricket Academy for further management of his injury,” said the BCCI in a statement.

Williamson ruled out of first two ODIs

Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson was on Tuesday ruled out of the first two ODIs against India owing to a left shoulder injury he sustained during the third T20I here at Seddon Park.

He hadn’t featured in the last two T20Is in Wellington and Mt. Maunganui afterwards. There is no official confirmation if Williamson will be available for the last ODI either, albeit he will start batting again later this week and is expected to fully recover ahead of the two-Test series beginning February 21.

Left-handed batsman Mark Chapman has been called up to the ODI squad. Tom Latham will lead the side in Williamson’s absence with the series starting here on Wednesday.

254,2020/02/04,Ranji Trophy | Tamil Nadu has to come out all guns blazing,"After a two-week break, a refreshed Tamil Nadu takes on Baroda here at the Motibaug cricket ground from Tuesday in the penultimate round of the Ranji Trophy group stages.

With just 12 points from six matches, TN has a very slim chance of qualifying and needs to win its upcoming matches with a bonus point (an innings victory or a 10-wicket win).

So far, Andhra leads the combine Elite Group A & B table with 27 points from six matches, followed by Gujarat, Saurashtra and Karnataka — each one point behind the other.

This means TN can, at best, reach 26 points — if it manages 14 from its next two games.

TN had a comprehensive innings victory over against Railways in its last match with the spinners delivering. But away from home, it doesn’t have the pace bowling fire-power to be a serious threat. The absence of left-arm pacer T. Natarajan is a big blow as well and it will be interesting to see if right-arm pacer R.S. Jaganath Sinivas makes his debut.

“We did well to get a big win in the last match and just want to build on it in the next two games by continuing to play the same positive cricket,” said TN coach D. Vasu.

Meanwhile, Baroda is slightly better placed with 14 points from six matches, thanks to two outright wins. The home team's form, though, has been inconsistent. It started the season with a defeat to Mumbai before two wins, but goes in to this game on the back of a defeat to Saurashtra here.

The team will, however, be bolstered by the return of skipper Krunal Pandya after his India-A commitments in New Zealand.

The wicket here in Motibaug is expected to favour the seamers at least on the first two days, and the early winter mornings could aid that. While both teams are equally matched, Baroda will feel it has an edge with a slightly better pace attack with the likes of Lukman Meriwala and Atit Seth, who can be a handful in helpful conditions at home.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g4nd1i/article30729207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04SAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-tamil-nadu-has-to-come-out-all-guns-blazing/article30729208.ece

Both the yards pose threat to the environment and frequent opposition from the local people had led to the corporation stop dumping the garbage in these yards.

Under the Smart City Mission, the corporation proposed to bio-mine the waste at both the yards at a total cost of ₹ 37.25 crore and work began at Vairapalayam. Zigma Global Environ Solutions Private Limited began works to bio-mine the waste from August 18 last year and so far over two-thirds of the waste was processed and bio-mined.

The entire dump is first bio-remediated by converting into equalised windrows and bio-culture and deodorizer is applied. The windrows are turned several times to ensure that the waste is stabilised, free from odour and also allow methane gas to escape. Later, the waste is transported to the machinery site and processing is done. About 250 to 400 tonnes of waste were processed per day and the dry waste is sent to cement factories to be used as fuel while fine earth is converted as bio-manure and used in agriculture.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that of the total 0.90 lakh cubic metre garbage, 76,563 cubic metre of garbage were processed and the remaining waste would be completed in one month. He said that installation of machineries at Vendipalayam compost yard is in progress after which bio-mining to process 4.45 lakh cubic metre waste will begin.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/822wbm/article30736881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA05WASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/landfill-bio-mining-at-vairapalayam-to-be-completed-in-one-month/article30736882.ece

271,2020/02/04,Women protesters at Hauz Rani ask leaders not to politicise stir,"Eleven days into a sit-in demonstration, on the lines of the protest at Shaheen Bagh, women protesters at Hauz Rani on Monday appealed to political leaders to not politicise the demonstrations ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi.

Demanding that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act be revoked, protesters asked why the right to free speech is reserved only for politicians and not for those seeking constitutional rights.

Zainab Mallick, a homemaker, said: “From [Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister] Yogi Adityanath to Delhi MPs, everyone seems to be making controversial statements pertaining to Shaheen Bagh and the Muslim community. The ones firing shots are hailed as ‘desh bhakts’ but we are raising the flag and are being called ‘anti-nationals’. What kind of logic is this?” Stating that the CAA is “clearly snatching rights from the Muslims”, the 25-year-old, added: “We are pained with the constant vilification of the Muslims. Why are we being treated like this? Instead of talking about the economy, women’s safety and education, all that is being talked about is Pakistan. Why should we go there? Jinko jaana tha wo chalein gaye [The ones who had to go are already gone].”

The protest at Gandhi Park saw a stream of visitors, with women taking turns to occupy a tent accompanied by their toddlers.

‘Real issues forgotten’

Samreen, (23), also a homemaker, said: “Stop playing politics in our name. If you [Centre] say that there are rumours about the CAA then why don’t you come and clear our doubts? We brought you to power and now just because we are questioning you, we are being called ‘anti-nationals’. If the police are with the Centre then where will we get the bullets from? What narrative are you trying to spread and why should we even support this law?”

With a toddler in tow, Ms. Samreen added: “Education and economy in the country is in a bad shape. Instead of talking about real issues why spew hate? Yahan pe kaam chalega jumla nahi [Work matters here and not gimmicks].”

Taira, (60), who is a regular at the demonstration, said: “We are here for our demands not for anything related to the elections. While some are dragging Arvind Kejriwal into the issue, others are talking about the BJP. All we want is our rights.”

Adding that the protesters are trying to “speak to the Centre and not the Delhi government”, Ms. Mallick added, “Our concern is with the ones who brought in this law in the first place. So it does not matter whether Mr. Kejriwal is supporting us or not. We want the Centre to hear us. It is high time that politics over the Hindu-Muslim dichotomy ends.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5gcnvc/article30730558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4DEHAUZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/women-protesters-at-hauz-rani-ask-leaders-not-to-politicise-stir/article30730559.ece
272,2020/02/04,Feb. 2 incident at Jamia: police analysing footage,"A day after an alleged incident of firing was reported outside Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) campus, the Delhi police have not been able to make any breakthrough in the case. In less than a week, there have been four firing incidents targeting anti-CAA protesters in Delhi.

Two unidentified persons had opened fire at JMI protest site late on Sunday. Though no one was injured in the incident, the people present at the spot were left panic-stricken.

“We have searched the place where the firing took place near Gate no. 7 [of the JMI campus]. We found no empty cartridge there. We are, therefore, probing further to identify the accused and verify the crime. An FIR has been lodged,” in-charge DCP, South East, Gyanesh Kumar said.

The police stated that a few persons had approached them during registration of the FIR, saying they had seen a red scooter that was allegedly used in the commission of the crime. The police has claimed that no one could note down or click a picture of the registration number of the two-wheeler.

“However, according to some persons the last digit is 2 while as per some it is 4. There are many vehicles with the same series [registration] number and we are now verifying information to see what was the actual number,” Jamia Nagar Inspector Upendra Singh said.

A group of students from the Department of Sociology said their families were scared to send them to take the semester examinations.

Shaheen, a student of Sociology, said it was difficult for her parents to allow her to come to college.

“I did not tell my parents that I came here today. It is traumatising and impossible to take examinations in such a situation,” she said.

Her friend Aamna, who lives in hostel, said: “To take examinations and to not recognise our trauma would mean accepting this [situation] as normal. Gun violence is not normal.”

Some boycott exams

While some students complained that “all protests are being linked with Jamia”, Ashutosh, a Sociology student, said: “When newspapers, especially local ones from Uttar Pradesh or Haryana, report stories about Jamia being under ‘attack’, families of the students will obviously panic. Examinations have been postponed twice already, and while the scheduled examinations were held on Monday, most students could not sit for the exams and some boycotted them en masse.”

Raghib Naushad, a third-year law student and a member of the Jamia Community Centre, said it was impossible to keep postponing exams. He said they have bar council-mandated attendance levels and careers to build. In the present situation, “where just protesting against one legislation has turned the campus so unsafe, and there is no police protection and with those in power calling for them to be shot”, we are forced to put our safety first.

Outside gate no. 7 of JMI, a a girl, aged seven years old, stood on a table and clinged on to a microphone in the semi-permanent dais.

She shouted: “Hum protest bhi karenge, aur 100 marks bhi layenge,” echoing sentiments that have been in the forefront of all top tier universities that have active cultures of dissent.

276,2020/02/04,Delhi police to soon get RFID-tagged weapons,"In a major step towards modernising its armory, the Delhi police will soon attach Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to its assault weapons to prevent misuse.

On February 1, the Delhi police issued tender for procurement of 6,000 RFID tags and readers, as well as fingerprint scanners and software for the system.

As per the tender document, the Delhi police are introducing a state-of-the-art weapons management system with web cameras to automate reporting and allotment of tagged weapons to police personnel after biometric (fingerprint) authentication.

A police officer said that the new system will help manage details of each weapon and ammunition. It will be able to identify the weapon through the tag. Biometric authentication will display details of the user, including a photograph, for the issuance of weapons and ammunition.

Greater accountability

“After identifying the allotted arms/ammunition, the system should also be able to biometrically identify the personnel when they return weapons/ammunition after duty,” read the tender document.

The system will track when a weapon was issued, returned and stored, the officer said, adding that it will also be easy to track the weapon’s history, recording the chain of custody. RFID tags will also help in weapons tracking, said the officer.

The police officer said that they have requested for suitable mini-tags that can be mounted on a wooden or metal surface. It should further be tamper proof and water proof.

“At present we have a manual system to maintain records. Audit of weapons is time consuming and requires a lot of personnel. The new technology will provide armories with a strong auditing and security system. In the first phase, 6,000 weapons will be tagged; after the trial, it will be implemented on other weapons,” the officer added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-police-to-soon-get-rfid-tagged-weapons/article30730441.ece
277,2020/02/04,‘AAP leader illegally leased out govt. land in Gurugram’,"Local BJP leader Raman Malik on Monday accused AAP leader and municipal councillor Ranbir Singh Rathee of illegally leasing out government land to Rapid Metrorail Gurgaon Limited for his unlawful personal gains running into several crores.

Holding a press conference, Mr. Malik alleged that Mr. Rathee entered into a lease deed with M/s Rapid Metrorail Gurgaon Limited through his company M/s Gurugaon 24X7 Parkers Private Limited in 2011 to lease out around 1.59 acre of land for a period of 99 years in return for monthly rent of ₹4.58 lakh.

The BJP leader claimed that the said land was acquired by the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran in 2009 and continued to be under its ownership. He also pointed out that the lease deed was signed on April 1, 2011, but the company was registered on April 6.

He alleged that RMGL had signed 16 lease agreements making monthly payments and 11 of these were with the company of Mr. Rathee. Mr. Malik said Mr. Rathee had conspired with many people to illegally benefit from the leasing of the land and the role of all those involved be investigated.

He also demanded an explanation from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making Mr. Rathee the party’s official candidate from Gurugram Assembly seat during the recently concluded Assembly polls in Haryana. He said AAP claimed to be an honest party, but gave tickets to people with dubious record.

Mr. Malik said a complaint in this connection was filed at the CM window, an online complaint redress system, and the Commissioner of Police seeking the registration of a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He said he had also met the Deputy Commissioner this past Friday.

Mr. Rathee said the matter was sub-judice and before the Punjab and Haryana HC. He said the allegations were baseless and politically motivated to target his party ahead of the Delhi polls. “It is an old matter, already before the court. It has now been raised to take political mileage. Why did he not raise it earlier?,” asked Mr. Rathee.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-leader-illegally-leased-out-govt-land-in-gurugram/article30730177.ece
278,2020/02/04,Former judge’s kin murder case: judgment on February 6,"The District and Sessions Court here has fixed February 6 for pronouncement of judgment in the murder case of the wife and son of a judicial officer following the conclusion of final arguments on Monday.

The then Gurugram’s Additional District and Sessions Judge Krishant Kant’s wife Ritu and son Dhruv were allegedly shot by their Personal Security Officer, Mahipal, in South City-II market on October 13, 2018 in full public view. The prosecution produced 64 witnesses, including Mr. Kant, to prove the case against Mahipal, who was arrested two hours after the incident.

Public Prosecutor Anurag Hooda said two eyewitnesses — Rishi Gupta and Hemant — who had also recorded the incident on their mobile phones, deposed before the court. The incident was also captured on two CCTV cameras.

“Gunshot residue and fingerprints also proved the prosecution’s case. Dhruv’s blood group matched with the bloodstains on Mahipal’s uniform. The call details of the accused proved his presence in the market at the time of the incident,” said Mr. Hooda, also the Deputy District Attorney. Complainant’s counsel Vishal Gupta said the accused had also called Mr. Kant and co-PSO Constable Vinay Kumar, admitting to his crime and both deposed before the court as prosecution witnesses.

“Mr. Kant deposed about dying declaration of his wife and the accused’s confession. Also, the accused can be heard in one of the CCTV footage saying that he had killed shaitaan and his mother. The accused also initially confessed to his crime but later said it was accidental,” said Mr. Gupta.

The defence took the plea that the revolver went off during a scuffle between Mahipal and Dhruv leading to the deaths. It claimed that Dhruv was enraged over Mahipal damaging a painting and abused him and tried to snatch his revolver. But Mahipal resisted the attempt and the weapon went off accidentally. Mr. Hooda said the victims had sustained two bullet injuries each and therefore it could not be an accident.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/former-judges-kin-murder-case-judgment-on-february-6/article30730173.ece

280,2020/02/04,Preventive action ahead of elections up by 311%,"The number of people against whom preventive action has been taken ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections has increased by around 311% compared to the 2015 State elections, revealed data shared by the Chief Electoral Officer.

During elections, various types of preventive actions under sections of the CrPc and State law are undertaken to ensure that there is a conducive environment for smooth conduct of elections, a senior official said.

Preventive action includes provisions to “bound down” individuals — wherein they are made to sign a bond that they will not engage in untoward activity — to other rules that allow police to detain individuals, said a policeman.

Under the CrPC and Delhi Police Act, action was taken against 33,150 persons during the 2015 elections; compared to 1,01,662 in the current elections.

Apart from this, the number of people against whom action was taken under the Excise Act increased from 1,065 in 2015 to 6,001 in 2020. Special Commissioner of Police Praveen Ranjan, who is the nodal election official, attributed the hike to better enforcement.

Less than in 2019

However, the number of people against whom action was taken during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was higher than the present elections by about 52%.

Seizure and depositing of arms has also increased; in 2015, 48 unlicensed arms were seized; in 2020, 384 have been seized so far.

The number of unlicensed arms seized in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was almost double at 801.

281,2020/02/04,"Amarinder Singh, Bhupinder Hooda hold rallies in Capital","The Delhi Congress on Monday held several rallies roping in Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda as star campaigners.

State unit chief Subhash Chopra said the Congress was contesting the polls on issues that affect the people and development of the city, but the BJP and AAP were trying to polarise Delhiites along communal lines.

Mr. Chopra said the people, especially women, have been sitting on a dharna at Shaheen Bagh to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, but the BJP has communised the issue. He also attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for not meeting Shaheen Bagh protesters for over a month.

“People of Delhi would seek answers for the dual actions of the BJP and AAP in the elections and they will be handed out unforgettable lessons,” he said.

AICC secretary Kuljit Singh Nagra said promises made in the manifesto would be fulfilled just like in other Congress-ruled States — Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.

He said that some parties wanted to make the Assembly polls a two-horse race “but Congress is still a formidable force”.

Addressing a rally at Harinagar constituency in support of Congress candidate Surender Setia, the Punjab CM said: “In Punjab, AAP tried its best to come to power but failed. Some people will be happy with these freebies but what has he really done for the development of Delhi? How many jobs has he created?”.

He also hit out at the BJP for polarising the elections.

In its manifesto, the Congress has promised unemployment allowance of ₹5,000 for graduates and ₹7,500 for postgraduates.

It has also announced schemes to help entrepreneurs and provide industrial power tariff at ₹6/unit.

Speaking at a rally in support of Mahender Chaudhary in Mehrauli, Mr. Hooda said the Congress had changed the face of Delhi during its 15-year rule.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mo1n7v/article30730156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03AMARINDERKALKAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/amarinder-singh-bhupinder-hooda-hold-rallies-in-capital/article30730157.ece
282,2020/02/04,AAP to release manifesto today,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday said it will release its manifesto for the Delhi Assembly elections on Tuesday.

At a press conference, party’s election incharge Sanjay Singh said that AAP would be conducting 15,000 meetings across the city in the last phase of the campaign in the next three days.

Mr. Singh said 5,000 volunteers from every constituency will convince BJP voters to vote for AAP.

“We had said no matter how much they provoke us, we will remain focused on the issues. In this last phase of the campaigning, through our frontal cells, which pertain to Purvanchali people, women, youth, SC/ST communities, minorities etc., 500 representatives from these cells will hold 10 meetings every day over the next three days and thus 15,000 meetings will be held across all 70 Assembly constituencies,” he said.

He added that the party will continue with its previous slogan — Acche Honge Paanch saal, Lagey Raho Kejriwal — along with a new one — Aache Honge Paanch Saal, Dilli Main To Kejriwal.

Mr. Singh also attacked Union Minister Prakash Javadekar for calling party chief Arvind Kejriwal a “terrorist”. “A BJP MP called Mr. Kejriwal a ‘terrorist’; a Harayan CM called him a ‘monkey’; U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath also made fun of Mr. Kejriwal’s health. On Monday, Mr. Javadekar again referred to Mr. Kejriwal as a ‘terrorist’. This is quite unbelievable that these kinds of remarks are being made in the Capital. Despite there being an entire constitutional setup in place, the Election Commission is here, how is a Union Minister even allowed to make such a statement? And if Mr. Kejriwal indeed is a terrorist, I challenge the BJP to arrest him. They have crossed all limits of decency.”

Mr. Singh added that they met the Chief Election Commissioner on Monday and demanded that an FIR be registered against the BJP leaders, including Mr. Adityanath. They also sought a ban on their campaigning.

“The CEC has ensured us that he will look into the matter,” Mr. Singh said.

Meanwhile, the AAP said that the State chief of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, trade union of the BJP, Devraj Bhadana, joined the party on Monday.

283,2020/02/04,"‘Forget affiliations, vote for work’","Around 5 p.m. on Monday, Aam Aadmi Party’s sitting MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bharadwaj arrived at Fashion Street in Shahpur Jat in an open jeep, followed by about half-a-dozen electric scooters and a dozen motorcycles.

As Mr. Bharadwaj took a chair for a public meeting, he was garlanded with currency notes. “Five years back, when we came to power, we wanted the name of our village to be known by everyone... Now, there will be no one in Delhi and nearby areas who has not heard about the Shahpur Jat Festival,” the AAP leader said.

“People say that leaders do not listen to us and are inaccessible... Today, Home Minister Amit Shah is coming to Chirag Delhi. I said, it is good that they remembered our village. The elections should be held more often so that such big leaders come here,” he added.

Towards the end of his five-minute speech, Mr. Bharadwaj asked the people to set aside their affiliation to political parties when they vote. “You should ponder about who is thinking about your house and the development of the village and about your children’s future. Elections will come and go and these leaders will come and go. Think, who has worked for you in the past five years? and who will work for you in the next five years?” he said.

After the speech, amid chants of “Hamara vidhayak kaisa ho... Saurabh Bharadwaj jaisa ho”, AAP volunteers distributed ladoos close to the weight of the AAP MLA as a symbolic “Tulabhara”.

“We are telling the people that if we have worked for you, then vote for us,” Mr. Bharadwaj told The Hindu.

As the AAP leader left for a padyatra in the area, some residents said that schools and hospitals have become better under the AAP government. Others said that though some work had been, it was not as much as had been promised.

“Barabar ka takkar hoga (There will be tight competition),” said Ram Charitr, 47, from Bihar, who had voted for AAP in the 2015 Assembly elections.

Inside his previous house in Shahpur Jat, Mr. Charitr said that he has now moved to Tughlaqabad. “In this area they [AAP] have done work, but in my area, they have not done anything. So I will not vote for AAP this time,” he said. When asked about the BJP’s focus on Shaheen Bagh, CAA, and NRC in the run-up to the polls, he said it would not affect his voting. “What difference will it make to poor people?”

Ashish Awasthi, 38, who runs a business in Shahpur Jat, said: “They [AAP] have not done too bad or too good. I have heard the labourers saying that schools have gotten better. Our family always votes for the BJP, but AAP has a chance.”

Rekha, 19, who studies in Gargi SKV, a government school, said: “The school has gotten better after Arvind Kejriwal came. There are new buildings and better facilities.” Her mother, Rajbala, 40, said that they have been getting “zero” electricity bills for the past four months. “There is a lot of support for Mr. Kejriwal and my vote is for jhaado [AAP’s poll symbol],” she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6ueb43/article30730137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03LEDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/forget-affiliations-vote-for-work/article30730138.ece
284,2020/02/04,Inseparable in separation,"While describing the scene where Hanuman sees Sita as the very embodiment of virtue in Asoka Vana, Valmiki says his heart immediately leaps back across the ocean to seek Rama’s feet in adoration. Sita’s life of penance in Asoka Vana makes him exclaim, “Surely He is in her heart and she in His; in truth they are not parted or they could not live.” In a discourse, Damal Sri Ramakrishnan and Srimati Perundevi drew attention to the fact that this shows the inseparable union of the Divine couple playing the roles of Rama and Sita, though they get separated by force of circumstances.

Being a brahmachari himself, Hanuman would wonder when seeing Rama give in to excessive outbursts of sorrow on account of being separated from His wife. But seeing the impeccable Sita observing the vow of chastity in the harsh atmosphere of captivity, Hanuman bows down in reverence to Rama, accepting that Rama’s grief is justified and His fortitude exceptional. “Who can bear this enormous sorrow, and it is indeed a great feat that Rama still holds on to His life. It will be no wonder if Rama should choose to destroy the universe or transform it for Sita’s sake for she is worth all this and more.”

Valmiki also shows that Hanuman’s veneration for Sita grows to such an extent to surpass his devotion to Rama. He is keen to dispel any doubts in Rama’s heart about Sita’s life of austere penance in Lanka. So, on his return, even before he alights in the presence of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva, he first pays obeisance to Sita in Lanka and then conveys the happy tidings of his successful mission. With the carefully chosen words, “Seen have I the goddess of chastity,” that spread auspiciousness and hope to all, he unites Sita with Rama when he hands over the Chudamani to the Lord.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/inseparable-in-separation/article30737038.ece

The Commissioner, Rail Safety, has recently given clearance for the line allowing the train movement to commence in this key stretch of Gudivada - Bhimavaram section in the coastal belt of Andhra Pradesh, often referred to as ‘Rice Bowl of India’.

South Central Railway (SCR) has taken up the doubling and electrification project between Vijayawada-Gudivada- Bhimavaram-Narsapur; Gudivada-Machilipatnam; Bhimavaram-Nidadavolu for a distance of 221 km in total and this was sanctioned in 2011-12 at a cost of ₹1,428.70 crore with 50% cost to be borne by the State government.

287,2020/02/04,"Focus will be on eco-tourism, says Minister","Blessed with dense forests and a picturesque landscape, Telangana has the potential of becoming tourism hub of the country, said Tourism and Cultural Minister V. Srinivas Goud.

“With temple and eco-tourism being top priority for the government, recreation spots in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district are being developed to facilitate more tourists, who are willing to have quality time in nature’s lap with their friends and family,” Mr. Goud said.

The Minister along with Achampet legislator Guvvala Balaraju and other local leaders inaugurated two Haritha Resorts, one each at Farahabad and Egalapenta at a cost of ₹ 40 crore. The resort at Egalapenta on the bank of River Krishna, about 230 km from the State capital, has 20 state-of-the-art cottages, with a spacious restaurant which offers local cuisine.

Despite being on the bank of River Krishna, the locals did not have access to drinking water. The dense forests were once a Naxal-dominated area, which did not allow the previous governments to development the district, Mr. Goud said. “But, now the State tourism department is developing it into an eco-tourism spot, which will not only attract tourists from Telangana, but from elsewhere in the country and the world,” he said.

Tourism, which was one of the forthcoming industries in the State, will provide employment to local youth. “Mahabubnagar, which was once known for migration of locals to other districts and States, is changing now. People are coming back to their native place and have started working here. Thanks to our visionary Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao,” the Minister said.

As part of their efforts to boost tourism, recently the department has inaugurated a two-storeyed AC ferry and three cottages at the backwaters of River Krishna in Somasila and Kollapur. The ferry service between Somasila and Srisailam, has an on-board AC restaurant and cafe on the upper deck.

HMR Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy informed on Tuesday that the Chief Minister will be flagging off the metro train service for commercial operations at the JBS. He also pointed out that once this ‘Green Line’, the second corridor of the metro project is commissioned, it will be the second largest in the country after Delhi, with 69 km across three corridors.

Corridor One or the Red Line - L.B. Nagar to Miyapur is 29 km and Corridor Three or the Blue Line from Nagole to Raidurg too is about 29 km. Both these stretches were opened in stages in the course of the last two years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially launched the inaugural route of Nagole-Ameerpet-Miyapur of 30 km in November 2017.

Mr. Reddy also stated that the Hyderabad project is the world’s largest metro project in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and the number of passengers using the facility daily has crossed the 4 lakh mark and with the second corridor opening for public, the number is sure to rise further. “We are expecting a good response for this route too,” he said.

The Chief Minister is expected to take the ride along the route on the inaugural run, but whether there will be a public meeting/reception at either of the end points is not yet finalised.

When he came into the mix, he already had a few ideas on where T-Hub’s future would be. “We have built an infrastructure for innovation like none other in not just India, but in any part of the world,” he says, “Because not only does the State have an infrastructure for T-Hub, but also for several other organisations such as Telangana State Innovation Cell, RICH (Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad), We-Hub (a women-exclusive innovation centre), T Works, TASK (Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge) and other entities with which we are affiliated. It was a huge impetus for us to come from 400 startups from the time that T-Hub started, to more than 2,000 startups today in a short time of just four years.”

Quality, not quantity

For Ravi, however, it is not just the number of startups that matters, but the quality. These ecosystems take a while to stabilise and then build on the sound foundation. At this time, the backers of T-Hub had to manifest a widespread feeling of inspiration across young people who did not know that such support was available. This is how T-Hub set itself apart from other such entities; some were engaging in incubation but T-Hub went beyond the code of corporate innovation.

Phase Two T-Hub Phase Two is underway in the Raidurg area near Ikea and Novartis. The upcoming centre will first house more than 1,000 startups and claims to be the world’s largest incubator at 3.5 lakh square-feet over three acres of land. According to the T-Hub team, the cost of this project is ₹276 crores.

Naturally, the needs of the startups and the ecosystem had evolved, says Ravi, who took over from former CEO Jay Krishnan in January 2019. “We had to change from incubation to acceleration, so we took larger startups which had already matured over the course of the last four years, either because of us or independent of us, and provided them with a path to stay involved in the Hyderabad ecosystem... so they didn’t have to go to Bengaluru or to Singapore or to the United States.” Ravi continues, “Next we also charted a path to involve other guys who raised money, and put our arms around them; that said, we also created a startup innovation department with the nuanced way of involving and working startups throughout their lifestyles.”

Corporate innovation is also important to Ravi’s roadmap for T-Hub’s future and with the technology landscape changing rapidly, he feels it is vital to wrap one’s head around these changes. This collaboration and innovation can take between 18 and 24 months. Then T-Hub started bringing in more senior folks to their circle to keep the change happening. “That way we aren’t just evangelists, we are actually delivering to the ecosystems very specific outcomes.” One of these outcomes is, obviously, scaling.

Beyond the IT

What about values? Given technology is rapidly evolving, should patience be taught to startups? “An entrepreneurial journey isn’t easily replicable. Startups take on new ways of solving the same problems so everything is different. We encourage a lot of entrepreneurs to continue to stay true to the fundamentals of business, in terms of addressing the needs of their customer or consumer. We also have an alumnus programme where people can come back and revisit newer principles too.”

Ask Ravi about the instance a startup is no longer sustainable and has to shut down and he quirks a smile. As a serial entrepreneur, he does understand, explaining that he has “more scar tissue on his back” from his past experiences which mould his current and future choices. “We pride in being an accelerator not only for generating success but also in generating failures. Because if people are on the wrong path and their business models are fundamentally flawed, they’re just getting by and doing okay. Also, many first-time entrepreneurs struggle with ‘what does the business wants versus what do we want?’ That said, many do not when to quit their full-time jobs and there is no formula that I can give them. It is a very personal decision at the end of the day.”

Ravi reflects it has been a fruitful journey working with T-Hub and its constituents who continue to make the State a strong symbol of progression, adding the resident startups teach him as much, if not more, than when he teaches them.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dtv5pr/article30734145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy04-ravi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/t-hub-ceo-ravi-narayan-we-had-to-change-from-incubation-to-acceleration-to-scaling/article30734146.ece
293,2020/02/04,Realty group to focus on affordable housing,"High land cost in the twin cities makes building ‘affordable housing’ project a tough proposition, yet the market demand is quite huge and builders can go for them by focusing on the suburbs as the Central government too has been giving subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme, said M. Obul Reddy, chairman and managing director of Honeyy Group.

Talking to presspersons on Monday, Mr. Reddy said the realty firm based in Visakhapatnam will be making its foray into the capital with its first project to kick off at Old Alwal. The next will be at Srinagar Colony and, soon, six other projects in and around the city will be taken up at a total investment of up to ₹20 crore in the next four years, with most of them being in the ‘affordable housing’ segment, he claimed.

Affordable range in the twin cities could start from ₹2,500-₹5,000 per sq.ft., but even that scale too is way beyond the reach of the middle and lower middle classes, he accepted, but builders could easily tap the demand by reducing the apartment sizes at about 1,000 sq.ft rather than building large sized ones, he observed.

“The Union Budget has given a 200% boost to builders like us looking at affordable housing sector. We are already building 1,000 flats project at Achyuthapuram in Visakhapatnam with 1,450-1,500 sq.ft. costing below ₹45 lakh,” he said. The firm is planning to deliver 250 flats across three lakh sq.ft. under 14 projects in the coastal city of Andhra Pradesh which has witnessed a “15-20%” price escalation with capital announcement.

295,2020/02/04,Budget allotment not to fill pockets: BJP,"BJP State president K. Laxman objected to Municipal Administration & IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s criticism of the Union Budget and caustically stated that the Centre “allocates funds ministry-wise and department-wise and on the basis of projects taken up for the welfare of people, but not to fill pockets in the name of major projects.”

“Mr. Rao is indulging in disseminating false information about the Central government and is levelling baseless allegations to cover up the TRS government’s inefficiency and failures,” he charged, and asked how many funds were brought Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao when he was minister in the UPA government at the Centre.

Once again, the BJP president challenged Mr. Rama Rao to an ‘open debate’ on Central funds released by the Modi Government to the State. He blamed the TRS government of depending only on excise revenue and not exploring other revenue resources. He also advised Majlis leader Asaduddin Owaisi “to watch the movie till the end to understand” rather than complaining about lengthy budget speech.

Mr. Laxman claimed the budget has been welcomed by people of all walks of life, including the poor and the middle class, and asserted that it would boost the economy. Top priority has been given to the education sector, skill development, infrastructure and promotion of industry. A 16-point action formula has also been mooted to double income of farmers, he explained.

Despite people giving a mandate for the TRS twice, the BJP did not discriminate and funds were disbursed for several welfare schemes. Few more could not be implemented because the government here had failed to allocate its share which deprived people getting benefit of Central government schemes, he said.

He also felicitated 12 corporators and councillors, including a Muslim woman corporator elected from Mahabubnagar. Vice president Malla Reddy, general secretary Chinta Sambamurthy, former MP Jitender Reddy, Sudhakar Sharma and others were present.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/budget-allotment-not-to-fill-pockets-bjp/article30729697.ece
296,2020/02/04,"Numaish, an annual cultural ritual","Numaish — a convenient contraction of All India Industrial Exhibition, but encompassing a slice of the city’s culture and heritage spanning over eight decades. It is this cultural connect which makes Numaish a sort of an annual ritual for Hyderabadis and others who have made the city their home. For visitors to the exhibition, there are predominantly two reasons — the first is shopping, of course, and the other is plain amusement.

Take the case of Swathi K., a private employee and resident of Masab Tank, who says that her family has been regular patrons for the past 20 years. Shopping, she says, is what drives her to visit Numaish. “I am here because I like to wear clothes which are neither too gaudy or very expensive. The best thing is that the exhibition is set up just before summer. That way, it is easy for me to visit a lot of stalls which sell cotton wear,” she says, adding that Numaish is an inalienable part of the city’s culture.

For others, such as Farha Syed, a businesswoman, who describes herself as a hard bargainer, Numaish offers an opportunity to stock unstitched clothes and sell them at her store on another day. She has been visiting Numaish every year for the past 40 years. “If you know how to bargain, then the exhibition is a good place to buy your goods from and make a small profit,” she says, adding that she has not missed visiting the exhibition for at least 35 years. Interestingly, in the early ’80s, Ms Syed was a student of Sarojini Naidu Vanita Mahavidyalaya, which is administered by the All India Industrial Exhibition Society (AIIES).

For many others, Numaish is pure amusement. Frequent visitors and AIIES members point out that while serious shoppers arrive during the day, evenings are primarily for ‘fun’. “We see that proper shopping activity is during the day. A lot of people from Banjara Hills and other uptown areas coming in their vehicles are busy shopping. The evenings are more relaxed and families from across the city come here to have a good time,” says AIIES member Ashwin Margam.

This year, there are more number of Kashmiri stalls at the exhibition. Says Dilshad Ahmad Khan, who runs a dry fruit stall in his own name, “Given the circumstances, trade in Kashmir has become very slow. We have seen a larger number of Kashmiri stalls here because people are trying to grab every opportunity to mitigate losses. It is heartening to see that we are being supported by those who have been buying goods from us for the past many years.”

However, Sailaja Ramshaw, who works in the infotech sector, says that she has been visiting Numaish ever since she moved to the city in 1990. But this year, she is going to give it a miss. Explaining the reason, she says, “It has become too crowded. What’s more, I feel the quality of some goods has come down.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/6v58no/article30729688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04NUMAISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/numaish-an-annual-cultural-ritual/article30729636.ece
297,2020/02/04,Numaish 2020 yet to touch 2017 footfall,"Numaish may be witnessing large crowds, but last year’s fire accident which gutted dozens of shops, continues to cast its shadow on revenues as well as footfall. The loss of a holiday, Republic Day, which leads to a rise in patrons, corresponding to a Sunday, a crowd booster, is another reason for the annual event failing to record a higher number of visitors.

According to sources from the All India Industrial Exhibition Society (AIIES), footfall in 2017 — a year before the fire accident – was approximately 23 lakh. In 2018, a devastating fire ravaged a part of Numaish and led to it being closed for a few days. The footfall then recorded was around 20 lakh. The AIIES is yet to reach the footfall as recorded in 2017.

The view resonates with a trader who sells both ready-made and unstitched clothes for women. The trader from Uttar Pradesh who did not wish to be identified said, “I have been coming here for many years. There is a fall in the number of visitors, but more importantly, not many are willing to spend,” he said.

An AIIES member pointed out, “Last year, we lost a few days since we were busy in dealing with the fire accident. You see, public holidays and weekends see larger crowds. This year, Republic Day and Sunday coincided. So, instead of seeing more visitors on two different days, we saw higher footfall on a single day.”

Members, however, remain optimistic that the footfall will surpass that of 2017’s. Speaking to The Hindu, Ashwin Margam, a member of AIIES, said, “There are still a few more days to go before curtains come down on Numaish. This year, we believe we can make up for the lesser crowds which we saw last year. We are also confident that the number of people who will come here for both shopping and amusement will touch 24 lakh this time.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8aq6dh/article30729614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03-NUMAISH-FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yet-to-touch-2017-footfall/article30729600.ece

A member of the Popalzai qabeela (tribe), he says his grandfather moved to India from Kabul in search of greener pastures and that his connection with Afghanistan remains strong as ever. “I keep going to Kabul as we have family and business interests there. While I am an Indian, the connection is inseverable,” he adds.

299,2020/02/04,More arrests likely in bio-gas plants fraud,"Arrest of at least 10 more persons, including a couple of district-level State government officers, is on the cards in the embezzlement of funds relating to bio-gas plant installations.

Already, the Telangana Crime Investigation Department (CID) officials had arrested four State government employees and seven others in the fraud case.

“Evidence has been gathered against 10 more persons. Arrests are likely to follow,” a CID official unwilling to be named told The Hindu.

The fraud involving misappropriation of funds released by the Central government for installation of bio-gas plants came to light when the audit reports found glaring mistakes.

The information was passed on to the Vigilance and Enforcement wing, which referred the matter to the CID.

After registering a criminal case in September last year, the CID sleuths began probe. Audit reports and preliminary inquiries conducted by different wings suggested that more than 50% of the bio-gas plants, for which funds were released, did not exist in the undivided districts of Adilabad and Karimnagar.

“Physical verification during field visits by us revealed that non-existing plants were not just 50% but more than 70%,” the CID sleuths said. The total amount misused was estimated to be around ₹ 11 crore for the period of 2014-15 and 2015-16 years.

The Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), to encourage bio-gas production, began a scheme of subsidies and grant-in-aid.

The Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation was the nodal agency for its implementation in the State.

Out of the cost of ₹20,000 to set up a bio-gas plant, persons of Scheduled Castes and Tribes were given ₹11,000 subsidy while those belonging to Backward Classes and others -- ₹9,000 subsidy.

“Evidence was found against TSREDCO district managers to field assistants. Even the then TSREDCO vice-chairman was summoned for questioning,” the CID officials said.

All norms and rules relating to release of money, online transfer of subsidy amount, physical verification and one plant for one family were violated, found the investigators.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/more-arrests-likely-in-bio-gas-plants-fraud/article30729572.ece

304,2020/02/04,Government sets focus on streamlining administration,"The massive transfer of bureaucrats effected by the State government has reflected its focus on streamlining the administration, especially focal departments like Finance and Education.

Coming soon after the completion of municipal elections, the transfer of over 50 IAS officers at one go is seen in official circles as an indication that the impetus will now be given to effective governance and delivery of services to the last mile.

In addition to reshuffling senior IAS officers who were holding charge of their respective portfolios for a few years now, the government had appointed new Collectors to 20 of the 31 districts

According to senior officials, the transfers definitely show a “KTR mark” as several IAS officers of 2014, 2016 batches were posted as municipal commissioners and additional commissioners in the GHMC.

And, this is in line with Mr. Rama Rao’s recent assertion on infusion of young blood for streamlining the municipal administration.

The transfers by and large reflected an equal mix of seniors and younger bureaucrats with proven track record getting important portfolios.

“More importantly, the postings show how the Chief Minister preferred to ensure a healthy mix of seniors and juniors so that the governance goes uninterrupted for the next four years,” a senior official said.

The Chief Minister is learnt to have spent over four hours last week for fine tuning the transfers list so that people with sufficient experience and service are accommodated in key posts so that delivery of services will continue uninterrupted. The transfer of Education Department Secretary B. Janardhan Reddy as Agriculture secretary for instance is being seen as the priority that has been accorded to the sector.

Mr. Janardhan Reddy had been with the department in the past when he was instrumental in putting in place several reforms for strengthening agriculture markets and introducing several farmer welfare measures.

Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar, who proved his capability of planning and execution through incident-free elections for Assembly and Lok Sabha, has been posted as Irrigation Secretary, another important area of focus of Mr. Chandrsekhar Rao government since the past more than five years.

“The effort appears to ensure a proper wavelength among the officers in key departments right from the Chief Secretary level,” a senior official said.

The transfer of Mahbubnagar district Collector Ronald Ross as Secretary in Finance Department, Hyderabad Collector Manicka Raj as Industries Commissioner and Bhadradri Collector Rajat Kumar Saini as director in the Office of Chief Commissioner of Land Administration are seen as the recognition of their efforts when they held similar posts in the past.

307,2020/02/04,SEC’s decision on electoral rolls upheld,"The State Election Commission’s (SEC) decision to prepare the electoral roll for the upcoming local body election using the 2014 electoral roll was upheld by the Kerala High Court.

The court passed the order on two writ petitions which challenged the decision of the SEC.

The SEC had submitted that it had adopted the 2014 electoral roll of Assembly constituencies as the base document after verifying the ward and house numbers through field verification. If the 2019 electoral roll of Assembly constituency was to be used as the draft roll for the 2020 civic polls, field verifications would have to be conducted to verify and update the ward and house numbers.

The elections to the local bodies will have to be completed before November 11, 2020, it submitted.

308,2020/02/04,"Civic body, PCB told to step up monitoring at demolition sites","The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management formed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Maradu municipality, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the district administration to step up monitoring of the four apartment demolition sites at Maradu and ensure strict compliance with its earlier directives to control the dust from the debris.

On Monday, SLMC chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai met the NGT-constituted sub-committee tasked with overseeing debris removal. The committee, comprising PCB officials, the Maradu municipality secretary, the District Collector and the Fort Kochi Revenue Divisional Officer, had been asked to submit a preliminary report on dust mitigation measures taken to the SLMC by February 6, a PCB official said.

Mr. Pillai inspected the sites on Monday and found that the committee’s directions from its meeting last month were still not being implemented. The SLMC had suggested higher curtains surrounding the sites, intensifying the sprinkling of water and strictly ensuring that debris is transported in covered vehicles. An action plan prepared by the agency removing the debris and approved by the municipality and PCB has also not been submitted to the SLMC yet.

‘No filtering mechanism’

“Authorities were also asked earlier to ensure that leachate, particularly from sprinkling of water near Golden Kayaloram which is closest to the waterbody, does not enter the water. But no filtering mechanism has been set up at the site yet to prevent the leachate from draining into the lake,” said Mr. Pillai.

He told the sub-committee that CCTVs should be set up for regular monitoring and uncovered vehicles found transporting debris must be seized. The committee was asked to ensure that the debris was not used for unauthorised landfilling.

Mr. Pillai pointed out that it was the responsibility of the municipality to implement the directions in a time-bound manner, while the PCB must closely monitor debris removal. “After the SLMC has received a report from the sub-committee, we will report to the tribunal, which will decide on the action to be taken,” he said.

PCB officials said plans were afoot to set up air quality monitoring systems at the four sites.

Meanwhile, Achyut Joseph of Prompt Enterprises, the agency handling debris removal, maintained that an action plan on the number of loads to be transported and the dumping sites had already been submitted to the municipality around three weeks ago.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bevk8d/article30730360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARADU-OFFICIALS-VISIT-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/civic-body-pcb-told-to-step-up-monitoring-at-demolition-sites/article30730361.ece
309,2020/02/04,Metro’s ‘minor cards’ offer 33% discount for children,"Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has introduced ‘minor cards’ to woo schoolchildren who ride the metro with up to 33% discount on travel fare.

The cards will be made available to children aged 10 years and above, so that they too can avail discounts up to 33% like adults with season tickets. Until now, minors could not avail discounts since they were not provided prepaid cards, according to KMRL sources.

Ever since the metro’s commissioning in 2017, there has been demand from different sections of society to provide discounted travel options to students. The metro agency is also encouraging group booking, if there are more than seven passengers in a group. The total number of Kochi-1 card users has increased over the months. There were 73,000 active Kochi-1 card users, and they formed a healthy 29% of total ridership, said the sources.

The metro agency is also planning to augment last-mile connectivity for its passengers. Discussions with educational institutions along the metro corridor, Infopark and corporates to provide last-mile connectivity from metro stations were in the final stages, said KMRL Managing Director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

Meanwhile, ridership in the metro doubled in the last five months of 2019, as compared to that of 2018, thanks to the opening of the Thykoodam extension. The ridership touched an all-time high of 21,08,108 in December 2019, as compared to 12,48,874 in December 2018. The trend continued in January 2020 with a footfall of 20,74,430 in the metro.

“The opening of the Thykoodam stretch has resulted in a steady increase in ridership. We are witnessing heavy rush during peak hours. The headway has been reduced to six minutes during peak hours to cater to the needs of commuters. The trend suggests that more people are happy to use the metro for their regular commute and the growth accelerated in the past year,” said Mr. Sharma.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kysih3/article30730350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KIKOCHIMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/metros-minor-cards-offer-33-discount-for-children/article30730351.ece
310,2020/02/04,Work on erecting seawall at Chellanam re-tendered,"Shore protection measures in Chellanam panchayat using geotextile tubes is set to resume with the Irrigation Department re-tendering the work. Fresh bid for the seawall erection work closes on February 7 after it was tendered on January 30.

Members of the Paschima Kochi Theera Samrakshana Samithi (a combine of people demanding implementation of shore protection measures in Chellanam and neighbouring coastal areas in West Kochi) said they met Water Resources Secretary Ashok Kumar in Thiruvananthapuram on January 22 to appraise him of the present situation and to request resumption of shore protection works.

T.A. Dalphine of the Samithi said a senior official of the Irrigation Department had visited Chellanam on December 27 to assess the situation and to speed up the geotube sea wall work. Negotiations had also been started with a Chennai-based company for a sub-contract for the work though it did not take off.

The work now tendered involves rebuilding the sunken seawall using geotextile tubes for a length of 160 metres north of the Velankanni church on an experimental basis. The work cost is over ₹84 lakh, the tender notice said.

Jinson Veluthamannunal of the Samithi said geotextile tubes had been suggested for seawall building at highly vulnerable coastal stretches such as Bazaar, Velankanni North, Cheriyakadavu, Companippady and Vachakkal. The stretches of the coast had borne the brunt of the Ockhi storms in December 2017. The demand for erection of seawalls and the repair of damaged seawalls had been raised since the Ockhi storms hit Chellanam.

However, the building of the conventional seawall using granite boulders came to a standstill with the non-availability of the material, and geotubes filled with sand mined from the shore or near the shore area have been suggested as a substitute.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/work-on-erecting-seawall-at-chellanam-re-tendered/article30730299.ece
311,2020/02/04,Presidency University VC leaves campus after 16 hours,"Presidency University Vice Chancellor Anuradha Lohia left the campus on the morning of February 4 after being confined in her chamber for over 16 hours due to a demonstration by students.

Ms. Lohia left her office through a side exit door at 6 a.m., though a section of students continued their sit-in in front of her office on the first floor, a university official said.

The VC did not take calls after leaving for home.

The official said, she was okay, but showed signs of stress due to prolonged confinement.

Students had launched their protest in front of the VC’s office since 2 p.m. on February 3, demanding that repair works in three of the five wards of the 130-year-old Hindu Hostel be completed without delay and eight sacked hostel employees be reinstated immediately.

“We had demanded a categorical reply from the VC about our demands — a written note listing all the issues — before allowing her to leave but she escaped through a side door even as we were sitting outside the main door.”

“We will not allow her to get away like this when she visits the campus again,” Subho Biswas, an IC member, and one of the agitators said.

The protesting students also demanded that the VC express regret in writing, over female students allegedly being prevented from taking part in a convention on the day of Saraswati Puja, due to the hostel renovation issue.

Mr. Biswas alleged that despite repeated reminders, the authorities did not expedite repair work in the Hindu Hostel and took “vindictive” action against those demanding its quick completion.

He alleged that female students demanding quick completion of renovation were viciously prevented from entering the campus on January 29 to attend the convention.

The secretary of girls’ common room, Shruti Roy Muhuri, alleged university authorities were dilly-dallying over timely completion of the work in wards 3, 4 and 5 of the Hindu Hostel since last year.

Over 30 students are put up in a very limited space of the two renovated wards, she claimed.

Dean of Students Arun Maity said, “I am in an urgent meeting, please call me later.”

Two wards of the Hindu Hostel, under repair for three years, were opened for students in November, 2018, after agitation by students.

The Hindu Hostel building, located adjacent to the university, was shut down for repairs in July, 2015 and the boarders were shifted to a rented accommodation at New Town as a makeshift arrangement.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/iv3ddo/article30734653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRESIDENCYUNIVERSITYVICECHANCELLOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/presidency-university-vc-leaves-campus-after-16-hours/article30734654.ece

The chargesheet, running into 2016 pages, was the fourth of the six sensational cases registered by the police in which the prime accused Jolly Joseph allegedly killed her six family members, including her first husband and his parents, after giving them cyanide-laced food or drink over a period of 14 years.

District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) K.G. Simon, who headed the SIT, said Jolly was suspected of killing Mathew by serving him liquor and water mixed with cyanide. “The incident took place on February 24, 2014. Mathew Manchadiyil was targeted as he had expressed doubt over the murder of Jolly’s first husband Roy Thomas and sought a post-mortem examination,” said Mr. Simon.

After the murder, the prime accused had circulated that the cause of death was cardiac arrest. Mathew Manchadiyil was the uncle of Jolly’s first husband. The chargesheet was submitted carrying the account of 178 witnesses. The Mathew Manchadiyil murder case was investigated by Koyilandy Circle Inspector K.

313,2020/02/04,Panchayat member quits over alleged caste slur,"A grama panchayat member who won with CPI(M) support in Kozhikode district has resigned from his post reportedly unable to withstand caste-based humiliation from another member in the Left Democratic Front.

K.S. Arun Kumar, a member of the Koodaranhi grama panchayat, announced this through a Facebook post on Monday. “I apologise to the voters… I have submitted my resignation letter to the panchayat secretary as I could not stand the caste-based humiliation from a colleague member. My party’s leader disowned me on the issue. I cannot go forward like this. I should not have taken birth at all…,” the post said. Mr. Arun Kumar was unavailable for comments.

Jaleel Koodaranhi, CPI(M) local functionary, however, said there had been no direct caste-based remarks against Mr. Kumar as being alleged. It was only a casual statement made in his absence. “We have asked Mr. Kumar to take back his resignation and sort out the issue amicably,” Mr. Jaleel added.

However, he told a section of the media earlier that Jessy Jose Pandampadathil of the Janata Dal (United) had made a casteist remark on him during a panchayat meeting on January 27. “I heard her making that remark. Jiji Kattakkayam, my party’s parliamentary party leader, heard it too.

315,2020/02/04,Unexplored tourism spots of Kozhikode to be mapped soon,"In an attempt to develop small tourism destinations and promote such spots under various responsible tourism projects, the Kozhikode District Panchayat is planning to map and video-document details of unexplored locations in all the 70 grama panchayats in the district.

To begin with, a meeting of all grama panchayat representatives will be held at Nalanda Auditorium here on February 5. Officials of the Tourism Department also will attend the meeting.

Five members from each of the 70 grama panchayats will present details of attractive and less explored tourism spots in their respective areas. The present condition of such spots as well as feasible development projects for such regions will also be presented to Department, besides including them in the proposed video-documentation project.

As of now, there is no such comprehensive video record or destination map available featuring the unexplored or hidden tourism destinations in the district. The plan of the district panchayat is to fast-track the mapping and video-documentation work and present it before the authorities concerned. If the grama panchayats themselves are able to do it, the district panchayat will extend all possible financial and technical support.

According to District Panchayat President Babu Parassery, there are several such hidden locations in the district which can emerge as popular destinations with plenty of self-employment opportunities for local residents. “Oloppara was one such location earlier identified by local bodies and was later promoted to the status of a quickly growing destination for eco-tourism lovers. The change is visible right in front of our eyes now,” he pointed out.

“For the growth of local tourism destinations, we are also ready to explore public-private partnership in possible areas. The district panchayat authorities will visit the locations to study the scope of development and adopt appropriate measures for their development,” said Mr. Parassery. According to him, the possible village tourism destinations can be even linked in the future to offer attractive sightseeing packages to tourists.

The district panchayat has a list of the yet-to-be explored eco-tourism spots, which will be covered first by the video-documentation and mapping project. The list includes locations suitable for introducing boating facility, handicrafts demonstration, and farm stay. Conducting tourism festivals in such locations to attract sightseers is also part of the new initiative to be implemented under the Responsible Tourism concept.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/iytinb/article30730127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-TOURISMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/unexplored-tourism-spots-of-kozhikode-to-be-mapped-soon/article30730128.ece
316,2020/02/04,Frequent power outages upset consumers in Koyilandy,"Power supply interruptions due to frequent damage to electric poles in freak accidents and delay in executing various pending restoration projects have left local traders and residents of Koyilandy in a difficult situation.

The absence of a sub-station or feeder for the Koyilandy municipal area has reportedly worsened the crisis.

On the Kozhikode-Kannur National Highway, the number of electric poles being damaged by heavy vehicles is steadily on the rise. It ends up in unexpected transmission issues during peak working hours. In several cases, quick restoration of snapped supply lines or damaged transformers remains an impossible task for the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) crew thanks to the heavy damage.

“From Pookkad to Koyilandy, there are several such vulnerable areas on the National Highway where frequent destruction of electric poles causes huge trouble to the transmission network. The KSEB should take proactive steps to address the issue either by changing the location of such lamp posts to safer zones or by introducing underground cabling system,” said M. Johny, a native of Koyilandy.

“Even for small repair work, the KSEB has to shut power completely in the Koyilandy area, which affects several institutions and industrial units,” he added.

A merchant from Koyilandy said people’s representatives or municipal authorities were yet to address the demand for a suitable land for the construction of a new sub-station in Koyilandy. “For more than 10 years, the demand has been alive as Koyilandy is heavily dependent on the Ulliyeri sub-station for its needs,” he said.

Meanwhile, a KSEB assistant engineer said power transmission issues could be resolved on completion of the ongoing cabling work. “The situation is such that we are forced to switch off power in the Koyilandy area for the safety of our workers and passers-by. Within a month, we hope to address the issue,” he said.

The official also said that the damage caused to lampposts or transmission lines by accidents did not result in much loss to the KSEB as those responsible for such incidents were legally bound to bear the cost. “Either the police or the person who caused the damage usually alerts us for spot-repairing support. We have not come across any strange situation where those who caused the damage escape without paying compensation,” he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/8qvnn7/article30730121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KSEB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/frequent-power-outages-upset-consumers-in-koyilandy/article30730122.ece

Mr. Chatterjee said the proposal to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in the education sector did not worry premier institutes as the IIMs had always benchmarked themselves against global standards of teaching and learning. “However, we need to wait for the full details of this policy to see whether it would mean global schools and colleges opening campuses in India or simply foreign capital getting invested in Indian private institutions.

326,2020/02/04,New train service to Bengaluru from Kozhikode likely,"The Southern Railway is likely to introduce a new train service to Bengaluru from Kozhikode shortly.

Modalities, including the timings of the new service, are being worked out. Besides, approval of the South Western Railway is also required for the purpose, officials said. The proposal to introduce the service comes close on the heels of the Railway Board approving the extension of the Kannur-Kozhikode passenger to Shoranur from February 1. This was after M.K.

The midnight train from Yeshwanthpur on Sunday and the return train on Monday to Yeshwanthpur have generally not been beneficial to passengers. Hundreds of passengers commute to Bengaluru from the Kozhikode station. The rush goes up during festival seasons. The people of Malabar have to rely on the eight weekly services to Yeshwanthpur. At the same time, as many as 21 weekly services are operated in the Kochi-Thiruvananthapuram sector.

The introduction of the proposed daily train service, especially at night, between Kozhikode and Bengaluru will benefit thousands of students, employees, and the trading community from Malabar. Besides, there was also a suggestion to extend the existing Kannur-Mangaluru-Bengaluru train to Kozhikode. The proposal has already been approved, Mr. Raghavan said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/new-train-service-to-bengaluru-from-kozhikode-likely/article30729864.ece
327,2020/02/04,How to accessorise this Chinese Year of the Rat,"Every year, like clockwork, brands launch clothing and accessories pinned on the Chinese zodiac animal of that year. 2020, however, is the year of the rat – the bringer of diseases and dirt, and plain ol’ shivers. A hard sell for luxury, you’d think, but then that’s where you get creative. Some have gone the cutesy way — Burberry launched an online game, Ratberry, as part of its Lunar New Year campaign — while others have kept it life-like and long tailed. Marc Jacobs’ collab with Miami-based skate brand, Stray Rats, even had rats in the photoshoot! Here are a few ways to do beady eyes and whiskers.

Chloé Printed Rat T-shirt These whimsical illustrations are disconcertingly lifelike, unkempt fur and all. But the pastel shade — the colour blue (and the number three) is believed to bring good fortune — and the rendition of the rodents clutching the French label’s ‘C’ bags, give it a winsome charm. Approximately ₹34,160, on net-a-porter.com.

Gucci Cruise 2020 The Chinese word for ‘rat’ can also be translated as ‘mouse’. So, the Italian luxury brand collaborated with Disney and plastered Mickey Mouse across its 2020 line of luggage and bags (and its ready-to-wear). We pick the playful mouse on this GG canvas globe trotter suitcase, trimmed with light brown leather detailing. Approximately ₹2,77,320, on gucci.com.

Rag & Bone Pizza Rat Crew It came, it saw, and it (almost) carried a slice of pizza home. But now the pepperoni-loving rat that went viral in 2015 is making a re-entry with this Lunar capsule collection. The American fashion label claims that the different types of soft yarn give the line “textural interest that fits the Pizza Rat graphic”. But we just like the black tee and that silly grin. ₹30,368, on rag-bone.com.

Chota péro Wool Sweater The Delhi brand launched its fall winter 2020 line for children a few days ago at Pitti Bimbo in Italy. And we spotted snouts. This hand-knitted merino wool sweater sports an embroidered mouse illustrated by Parisian artist Nathalie Lété. Layer it over péro’s handwoven silk striped dress or team it with their merino chequered wool trousers for some frosty-day chic. Details: pero.co.in.

328,2020/02/04,Mixed reaction to cancellation of public exams for Class 5 and 8 students,"Although students say that they are overjoyed over the cancellation of the board exams for students from classes 5 and 8, reactions from other stakeholders, including parents, teachers and headmasters, have been varied.

The State Government on Tuesday announced withdrawal of its earlier announcement of holding public examinations for the two lower classes. He added that they will ‘revert to the regular existing system of exams’.

M. Zulfa, a student of Class 8, says that she was ardently preparing for the board exams at her school where dedicated teachers began revisions for students from different classes.

“But when I heard the news, I was relieved. When I was preparing, there was a lot of pressure to do well. Now, I can study with relative ease and write the final exam that the school will conduct. Not that I will do any less hard work. The stress levels will certainly be less though,” she said.

A teacher of Class 8 students from E. V. R.Nagamayar Corporation Girls High School said that the cancellation of the exams came at a good time. Although the students were preparing vigorously, she felt that the amount of training required for them to score good marks was still far away. “I am scared that some young students who have passed without much knowledge of basic alphabets will fail,” she said.

Headmasters from two different corporation schools said that an aggressive education system with exams for Classes 5 and 8 will ensure that both students and teachers hold a mirror up to themselves and measure their performance.

Headmaster, Elango Corporation Higher Secondary School, N. Rajendran, said that many young students who end up passing until Class 8, do not have enough knowledge to pay attention in Class 9 and end up dropping out.

“Since passing is compulsory until Class 8, it becomes the norm to take it easy. Students do not take their final exams seriously,” he said.

Headmistress, Avvai Girls Higher Secondary School, V. Poongavanam, said that teachers too end up taking lessons lightly without exams in place.

“When the preparations for the exams began, we could see that they began fervently contributing to the child’s growth. At the end of the day, the child’s success matters,” she said.

SFI’s Madurai district (Urban) Secretary, S. Veldeva, who distributed chocolates to students of Classes 5 and 8, said that the cancellation of exams will reduce the dropout rate and provide a chance for students from underprivileged backgrounds, a chance to compete with meritorious students.

He said that in foreign countries like Sweden, schools abolished the exam system as they believed that marks did not determine a person’s strength and welcomed the news.

District Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said that no official statement had been received from the State Government yet regarding the issue.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/quzdig/article30736594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA05CITY-STUDENTSEXAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mixed-reaction-to-cancellation-of-public-exams-for-class-5-and-8-students/article30736595.ece
329,2020/02/04,Plus Two student slashes neck of classmate,"TENKASI

A Plus Two student has been nabbed for allegedly slashing the neck of his classmate on Tuesday following a clash on Monday evening.

Police said an altercation and scuffle broke out between the two students of Anna Government Higher Secondary School at Veerakeralampudhur in Tenkasi district on the school premises on Monday evening. After the teachers intervened, the students, belonging to different communities, dispersed.

When one of them was walking towards the school on Tuesday morning, the other student attacked him with a sharp object. The victim sustained a deep cut injury on the neck and injuries on the hands. He was rushed to Tenkasi GH after first-aid at Veerakeralampudhur. The boy is said to be out of danger.

“Since the attacker tried to just scratch the boy on his hand using a blade, no FIR was registered. A Supreme Court directive says the case could be registered against a minor if he has committed a crime that could attract punishment of seven years’ imprisonment. Hence, only community service register was registered,” said the police.

The attacker will be produced before Juvenile Justice Board, Tirunelveli.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/plus-two-student-slashes-neck-of-classmate-tenkasi/article30736586.ece
330,2020/02/04,Action sought in sexual assault and murder of girl,"Members of the All India Democratic Women’s Association led by former MLA K. Balabarathi, submitted a complaint to the judge of the district Mahila Court here demanding action against the culprits who sexually assaulted and murdered a six-year-old girl at Vedasandur on Sunday.

They alleged that the police were trying to protect real culprits in connivance with ruling party functionaries.

“The police have arrested three persons including a tractor driver and two boys, who were playing with the victim. However, owner of the private farm where the body of the girl was found, has not been booked. We learn that the farm owner is a close aide of a ruling party functionary and we strongly suspect that the police have made minor boys as scapegoats,” said Ms. Balabarathi.

The girl, daughter of cotton mill labourer, was allegedly abducted from a place near her house at Ranganathapuram when she was playing with a few friends on Sunday. Subsequently, she was found dead with injuries all over her body inside a private farm. Though her parents and relatives alleged sexual assault, the police initially maintained that the girl had suffered a fatal fall from the tractor.

But post mortem report confirmed sexual assault and the Koombur police arrested three persons.

On Monday, relatives and parents of the child staged a road roko outside the Government Hospital refusing to accept the body of the girl. They demanded that the farm owner be arrested.

Echoing sentiments of relatives and demanding justice, Balabarathi and members of the AIDWA met the Mahila Court judge on Tuesday.

“We will meet the Superintendent of Police R. Sakthivel and demand the arrest of real culprits. Over 15 girl children have been sexually abused in Dindigul district so far. It has become an unsafe situation for women and children,” alleged Balabarathi.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/action-sought-in-sexual-assault-and-murder-of-girl/article30736381.ece
331,2020/02/04,Quality seeds indispensable for farm production: Collector,"The Department of Agriculture has targeted to procure 600 tonnes of seeds from farmers of Ramanathapuram district.

Inspecting seed processing unit and direct paddy purchase centre at Thiru Uthirakosamangai here on Tuesday, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said quality seeds were indispensable for farm production. He said paddy has been cultivated on 1.27 lakh hecatres in the district. The Agriculture department has distributed quality seeds and set up seed farms through farmers and has been adopting seed certification process. Leading and interested farmers have been selected for seed production and they were given training in this aspect.

Seed farms have been set up on 475 hecatres. Farmers have been given certified seeds of different varieties of paddy including Aduthurai 45, Anna 4, Coimbatore 51, TKM 13, IR 64, RNR 15048 and 18. The seed processing units are functioning at Thiru Uthirakosamangai, Tiruvadanai and Paramakudi. The seeds produced by farmers are sent to seed processing units. After various tests, including moisture content, the seeds are certified by qualified officers. Farmers are given drought-resistant seeds that could grow with less water and provide higher yield. The seeds are given at a lower cost to farmers.

With a target of producing 600 tonnes of seeds, the district has so far procured 185 tonnes of seeds and sent to seed processing units. So far 87 tonnes of seeds have been processed. The Collector inspected seed segregation process at a processing unit. He urged officials to create awareness among the farmers of registration of seed farms and certified seeds. He also inspected direct paddy purchase centre where paddy from farmers were being segregated.

Earlier, he instructed officials to evict encroachments at the new bus stand at Ramanathapuram.

332,2020/02/04,Four held for cheating youth in a subsidised loan scam in Kanniyakumari,"The police have arrested four persons for allegedly cheating a youth to the tune of ₹12.3 lakh in the guise of getting him ₹1 crore as subsidised loans.

They said T. Wilprin, 35, of Vandikkavilai under Kaliyakkavilai police station limits in Kanniyakumari district, reportedly gave ₹12.3 lakh as commission to S. Dhayalan Prabhu, 40, S. Muneeswaran, 32, D. Sankareswaran, 32, and V. Manikandan, 42, and Karuppasamy, all from Thiruthangal near Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district as they promised him to get “heavily subsidised loans” from financial institutions under the State and the Central Government schemes.

When the gang gave bundles of “currency” packed in a bag to Wilprin at a place close to Vaeinthaankulam new bus-stand in Palayamkottai on Monday and asked him to open the bag only on reaching home as counting “huge sum of money” in a public place would invite unwanted problem, he grew suspicious and opened the bag. As the bag contained only several packs of white papers cut in the size of ₹ 500 currency note and genuine notes on the top of every pack, Wilprin started shouting at them and asked them to return his money.

Sensing that they would be caught by the people, they escaped in a car. As Wilprin rushed to nearby Perumalpuram police station and alerted the police, a team, led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Tirunelveli City, S. Saravanan, swung into action.

Closely following mobile phone signals of members of the gang, the police nabbed Dhayalan Prabhu, Muneeswaran, Sankarareswaran and Manikandan while Karuppasamy managed to escape.

The police suspect that Wilprin, who might have been lured by the gang involved in counterfeit currency notes doubling racket, could have lost his money. Though investigation continued beyond Monday midnight, Wilprin reportedly reiterated that he had given the money only to get subsidised loan.

333,2020/02/04,Active lifestyle and healthy diet help reduce risk of cancer: doctors,"Doctors at the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre said people who lead an active lifestyle and ensure that they are not obese are likely to not get cancer, at a press meet here on Tuesday on World Cancer Day.

Medical Director of the hospital Ramesh Ardhanari said the older one grows, the more likely is wear and tear.

“We may have heard older people saying that there was no cancer 70 years ago. That is because life expectancy was only 28. With time, we have begun the process of developing resistance to communicable diseases. Now, however, we see high incidence of cancer,” he said.

He added that in India, the top five types of cancer are the cancers of lip/oral cavity, lung, stomach, colorectal, and esophagus for men, and the cancers of breast, lip/oral, cervix, lung, and gastric for women.

Head of the Department, Oncology, K. S. Kirushnakumar said the change of lifestyle and the inclusion of fatty foods in our diet, is another major cause of cancer.

Both doctors said that tobacco consumption in all forms was bad for the body and would likely cause cancer if consumed for a prolonged duration.

Senior Consultant, Surgical Oncology, R Vijaya Bhaskar, said that women must examine their breast for lumps and men must ensure that ulcers that remain for a long time in the mouth must be checked out.

334,2020/02/04,Release grant to Harijan Sevak Sangh schools: PIL plea,"MADURAI

A law student moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday seeking a direction to the Centre to release grant-in-aid to two Harijan Sevak Sangh schools functioning in Madurai and Kallakurichi districts. If the Centre did not release the funds, the schools might be closed down, the petitioner said.

In his public interest litigation petition, M. Muthuselvam of Madurai said Harijan Sevak Sangh was founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 with the main objectives of eradicating untouchability and working for the upliftment of the Scheduled Caste people and the downtrodden.

The petitioner said no funds had been released to N.M.R. Subbaraman Memorial Residential Primary School in Madurai and a similar residential middle school in Kallakurichi district.

Right to Education was a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment was duty bound to release the funds for effective functioning of the schools, he said.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran ordered notice to the Centre and the State and adjourned the hearing in the case.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/release-grant-to-harijan-sevak-sangh-schools-pil-plea-madurai/article30735809.ece
335,2020/02/04,Bridge to connect Thuvariman with Paravai in progress,"Madurai

Construction of a high-level bridge across the Vaigai connecting Thuvariman with Paravai – a long-pending demand of the people of several villages – will help in reducing travel time and congestion on Madurai-Dindigul Highway.

The construction, taken up at an estimated cost of ₹13 cr, is likely to be completed by May, according to officials of the State Highways Department. In 2013, the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced the construction of the bridge in the Assembly, and the project commenced in 2018.

This bridge, which is 180 metres long, connects Melakkal Main Road on Thuvariman side with Dindigul-Madurai Road on Paravai side. The bridge will be 12 metres wide with 7.5-metre-wide carriageway and 2.25-metre-wide pavements on either side.

According to a senior official from the State Highways Department, a major portion of work on the bridge is over. The official says that work on seven of the nine spans of the bridge has been completed. Water flow in the river has delayed the completion of work. “There are also few issues regarding land acquisition for laying the approach road on Paravai side. Petitions regarding the issue have been submitted to the Collector. This is also causing a delay in completion of the project,” the official adds.

Shrinking distance

D. Prabhu, a resident of Thuvariman, said, “People from the southern side of the river, who want to reach Paravai on the northern side, usually take the four-lane highway towards Dindigul and travel through Samayanallur. But, now they can reach Paravai by covering just over half a km. This saves them a distance of at least eight km.”

This bridge will be a boon for people of Thuvariman, Melamathur, Keezhamathur and Kodiamangalam on the southern bank of the river, and Paravai, Samayanallur, Kallukudi, Adhalai and Pothumbu on the northern bank.

With the presence of a large number of educational institutions on both sides of the river and the wholesale vegetable market at Paravai, there is usually heavy traffic flow across the river.

The bridge comes as a safe alternative as accidents are often reported on Dindigul four-lane highway, says Principal of Mangayarkarasi College of Arts and Science for Women S. Rajeswari. “The road connecting Samayanallur with the highway is narrow and congested. So, travelling through this bridge will be a safer option and parents of students can also heave a great sigh of relief,” she says.

Small farmers from the southern bank, who travel regularly to the wholesale market at Paravai, will benefit a lot from the bridge, says Thuvariman panchayat president P. Kandasamy.

“A large number of farmers from Thuvariman and Kochadai sell banana leaves, green banana and banana blossoms at Paravai market. When the river runs dry, farmers walk across the riverbed carrying their produce. Whenever there is water flow in the river, a group of six people hire an autorickshaw and each one has to shell out ₹50 for travel. Once the bridge work is completed, the farmers can just walk on it and reach the other side,” he says.

Similarly, daily wage workers who work in farms of Kallukudi and Sathyamoorthy Nagar on the northern side will also benefit from the bridge, he adds.

Due to the functioning of the wholesale market at Paravai, a large number of lorries ply on Madurai-Dindigul Road, leading to traffic congestion during peak hours.

“Two-wheelers and four-wheelers proceeding towards the southern bank can cross the new bridge. This will help in reducing congestion and accidents on this road,” says M. Karuppasamy, an autorickshaw driver from Paravai. “Currently, few lorries choose the tattered Vaigai Nagar Road to reach the four-lane highway. This bridge will be a great alternative for them,” he says. “Another advantage is that they are laying new roads along the banks of the river,” he adds.

Though the bridge will be highly beneficial, the residents of Thuvariman are concerned over felling of trees for the completion of the bridge, says P. Rajendran, a farmer from Thuvariman. “Due to exponential urbanisation, the city’s tree cover has come down drastically. Thuvariman is one of the last few pockets in the city where large old trees are found. Hence, it is essential that these trees are protected,” he says.

The State Highways official says that according to the proposal 13 trees have to be felled on Thuvariman side. “We have submitted a proposal to the Forest Department. After the approval, we will take steps,” says the official.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ucl6hu/article30735724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA05CITY-THUVARIMANPARAVIBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bridge-to-connect-thuvariman-with-paravai-in-progress/article30735725.ece

339,2020/02/04,Proposal submitted for indoor stadium,"The Tirunelveli Smart City Limited, which is executing development projects worth over ₹ 900 crore in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai under the Smart City programme, has submitted six new proposals, totally costing about ₹ 67.11 crore for clearance from the Smart City Board which will meet in Chennai on February 13.

Of this, the most important proposal is a multi-purpose indoor stadium with 6,504 square metre area at a cost of ₹14.95 crore inside the VOC Stadium at Palayamkottai.

Built in 1965, the VOC Stadium, an open ground with six galleries on the eastern and western sides of the 3.10 acre sports arena, is being used for conducting volleyball, football, hockey or kabaddi matches and Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations also. Moreover, the stadium attracts a good number of walkers in the morning and in the evening.

Being an educational hub that has produced a good number of State, national and international sportsmen, the city should have an indoor stadium, which will fulfil players’ ambitions and fine-tune their skills. Accordingly, proposals have been sent for creating modern indoor courts for badminton (2), basketball (1), volleyball (1), tennis (1), table tennis (3), billiards (2) and chess and carrom (5) with necessary flooring facility apart from other allied requirements like dressing and rest rooms.

It has been proposed to spend ₹ 90.80 lakh to provide modern flooring which would save sportsmen from career-threatening injuries. Moreover, kids play area, walking track, administrative office, reverse osmosis drinking water, temporary seating, refreshment kiosks, material gallery-cum-storeroom, CCTV facilities, landscaping and parking facilities will be created in the sports arena.

Chief Executive Officer, Tirunelveli Smart City Limited, V. Narayanan Nair and Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan said the remaining five proposals pertain to creation of science park near Vaeinthaankulam new bus stand, widening of road with median from Sudalai Kovil to STC College Road, improvement of driveway and bus bay in new bus stand, reclamation of garbage yard at Ramaiyanpatti through bio-mining process, procurement of vehicles for solid and liquid waste management.

340,2020/02/04,Give work for more days: workers,"A group of women submitted a petition to Collector Sandeep Nanduri on Monday seeking job under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP) for at least 100 days in a year.

A group of workers from Kamanayakanpatti under Kayathar Union, said they were not getting work throughout the year due to scanty rainfall. When the MGNREGP was introduced, it ensured regular income for 280 families as they were hired. But the number of days of work had come down as they were hired for a maximum of 20 days in 2019.

“We’re struggling to pay school fees for our children. We cannot meet medical expenditure. The Collector should ensure at least 100 days of work every year,” they said.

Representatives of various organisations submitted separate petitions to the Collector seeking nod to conduct ‘jallikattu’ by involving all people without any political or caste affiliation. But a group was sending petitions to the district administration and the State Government to thwart conduct of ‘jallikattu’ in Thoothukudi district. The Collector should do the needful for conduct of the event.

A group of farmers from Thennampatti and Ilavelankaal under Kadambur revenue village, led by O.A. Narayanasamy of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam, said they were given only ₹ 4,000 an acre for corn crop loss. More relief should be given to them, they said.

Members of Thamizhaga Vaazhvurimai Katchi submitted a petition seeking the Collector’s intervention to ensure relaying of all roads in Thoothukudi, which were “unmotorable” to road users. Drainage channels dug to drain sewage and stagnant rainwater were yet to be completed.

342,2020/02/04,Red Bus Services to take to Tirunelveli roads on February 5,"The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation is all set to introduce Red Bus service in Tirunelveli from February 5 onwards.

First, five Red Buses, which will have better space, music players, LED lights similar to lights in long-route buses, will be operated in Tirunelveli as a circular service between the Exhibition Ground temporary bus stand and Vaeinthaankulam new bus stand. ‘Deluxe fare’ will be collected in these buses.

When Red Buses were introduced in Chennai along the IT corridor, it received good response from commuters and the Metropolitan Transport Corporation expanded this service to other busy routes. So, the Tirunelveli Division of TNSTC is introducing the service here on Wednesday.

The TNSTC’s Tirunelveli Division, which is going to add 115 new buses shortly, will get 10 air-conditioned buses before the end of March following good response to these luxury coaches being operated from Tirunelveli to Thoothukudi, Nagercoil, Tenkasi and Madurai.

Though air-conditioned buses were introduced in the relatively pleasant season of November last year, patronage for these buses was good as all buses enjoyed 100 % occupancy during the day and 90% occupancy after 9 p.m.

“As these buses will attract more passengers in view of summer-like climate prevailing now, we expect 100% occupancy throughout the day till October,” said sources in the division.

A government official who commutes between Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar prefers this service and has asked conductors of buses leaving Tirunelveli for Madurai to reserve a seat for him everyday in the morning.

“It offers passengers good legroom and pleasant ambience with good air-conditioning system. Even as evergreen numbers are cascading from relatively quality music system, the enjoyable ambience provides a lot of relief even as they travel for about three hours from Tirunelveli to Madurai,” says Jude, a former foremen with the TNSTC.

When asked about the routes in which the new A/C buses will be operated, sources said all long-routes including Tirunelveli – Kumuli would get these luxury buses.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/red-bus-service-to-be-introduced/article30735231.ece

344,2020/02/04,New building of nursing school in Madurai to be used from Monday​,"Trainees enrolled in the diploma course at the School of Nursing at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) are expected to shift to a newly-opened building on Monday. ​

​Dean, GRH, J. Sangumani said that the building which was inaugurated by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday, was constructed at a cost of ₹7.5 crore. He said that the delay in the shift to the new building is because they are yet to finish the process of shifting teaching material there.​

​A student there who did not wish to be named said that the construction was completed around two months ago but the delay was unwarranted and that it was time that they shifted as their current classrooms were in a dilapidated state. ​“We have a total of 285 students currently enrolled in the three-year programme. The new building is well-equipped to train a number of future nurses,” he said. He added that the new building has been built according to the Indian Nursing Council norms.​

​The residential programme helps young students fresh out of schools to learn about patient care, said school Principal A. Sennanmal. Apart from theory classes, students also get to go to rural and urban areas to educate residents about communicable diseases, she added. She also said that they screen patients in these areas and teach them first aid. ​

​Vice Principal M. Chellapandi said that the students also regularly practice day and night shifts at the GRH. “The new building will help students study in a better environment. The current building is old and dilapidated,” he said. ​

​The Dean said that the building in use will be renovated and later used as an administrative office. ​

Members of the Madurai District Ape Autos Association said that the driver, L. Arichandran, was slapped a fine of ₹ 2,500 over a permit issue and he entered into an altercation with the police personnel. “He allegedly committed suicide on January 28 and in his dying declaration, he had said that he was sacrificing his life so that the police may stop ill-treating auto drivers,” said advocate S. Vanchinathan, the association’s legal advisor.

The auto drivers demanded compensation for the family and a government job for his wife A. Chandra Jothi.

‘No police excesses’

Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham denied any police excesses or wrong penalising in the auto driver issue. “His was one of the about 200 share-autos brought to the Armed Reserve ground for traffic rules and permit regulation violations. After counselling by traffic police personnel and fine imposed on violators, the drivers were allowed to take their vehicles,” he said.

He added that the action was taken based on complaints about rampant violation of traffic rules and rash driving by share-auto drivers.

Meanwhile, the Commissioner also issued a warning to the share auto-drivers of stringent action if they violated road rules.

He appealed to the drivers not to indulge in rash driving and not to carry people over and above the permitted number of passengers.

He also pointed out that the share-auto rickshaws were involved in haphazard halting at bus stops and on middle of the road and advised them to halt their vehicles on the roadside for the passengers to board and alight from vehicles. It was mandatory that the drivers should signal to fellow road users through indicators before taking right or left turns.

The drivers should also desist from using high-decibel horns. They should compulsorily wear uniform and carry all necessary documents with them. They should not drive the vehicles under the influence of alcohol, he said.

The Commissioner cautioned that the vehicles of those drivers who violate road rules would be impounded.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/jaenv1/article30730585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MACITY-AUTODRIVERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/plea-to-give-compensation-to-family-of-share-auto-driver/article30730586.ece

The petitioner also sought a direction to the Centre and State to set up a branch of State Information Commission in Madurai for the convenience of the public.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran ordered notice to Centre and State in the PIL petition filed by M. Selvakumar of Kadambur in Thoothukudi district. In his petition, he said that there must be quick disposal of applications seeking information under the RTI Act.

When the information was refused from the authorities concerned, applications to the Central or State level commissions can be made.

A person seeking information from the government have to wait for 30 days for a reply. If he does not get one, he goes for first appeal before a first appellate officer. This application should be disposed of within 90 days. If even at this stage there was no success in getting information, the applicant may approach the Central and State level Information Commissions, he said.

When no remedy was available even after approaching the Commissions, the public or common man had no option but to approach the court for grievance redressal. In order to avoid this, the existing mechanism available under the RTI Act must be revamped, he said.

348,2020/02/04,"BJP, Congress equally responsible for CAA mess: Meshram","Waman Meshram, national convener of Bahujan Kranti Morcha, said on Tuesday that both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress were equally responsible for the problems being faced by minorities, Dalits and Adivasis over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR).

He was speaking at the Kashmir to Kanyakumari nationwide Parivartan Yatra public meeting organised by the morcha at Town Hall here.

Mr. Meshram said that as far as their policies were concerned, both the BJP and Congress were like brothers. It was during the period of Congress rule that the NPR process had begun. The BJP was only carrying forward what the Congress started. But the CAA, NPR, and NCR were all targeted at the depressed classes and minorities.

It was impossible for the weaker sections of the society, especially the poor, to keep documents such as birth certificates ready with them. After all, the registration of births was made mandatory in the country only in 1969. “What should people in rural areas who were born before 1969 do? Many of them did not even know the dates that they were born on,” he said.

The CAA, NPR, and NRC were discriminatory. Outwardly, the Muslim community appeared to be targeted. “The BJP government at the Centre has actually trained its guns on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by placing it on the shoulders of the Muslims. The real target of the CAA, NPR, and NRC is the ‘mool nivasi’ (original inhabitants) of this country,” he said.

“Again, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah outwardly appear to be implementing the CAA, NPR and NRC, the real mover behind these ‘black laws’ is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is pulling the strings from behind the curtain,” he said.

The way the Electronic Voting Machines were functioning gave a lot of room for suspicion. But there was not enough debate on this subject, Mr. Meshram said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/1h0qmj/article30737406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MNUDUPIMESHRAMCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bjp-congress-equally-responsible-for-caa-mess-meshram/article30737407.ece

358,2020/02/04,Concept paper on standalone micro-insurance companies soon,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has constituted a committee to develop a concept paper on standalone micro-insurance companies.

Micro-insurance products offer coverage to low-income groups who have little savings and is tailored specifically for lower valued assets.

In doing so, the 10-member panel is required to assess the desirability and feasibility of formation of standalone micro-insurance companies; review the legal and regulatory framework to enable such an entity; and recommend the maximum sum insured per person that may be accepted by the proposed firm.

Considering the aspect of ease of doing business, the panel has also been tasked to suggest the applicability and/or relaxation of existing provisions for micro-insurance companies.

Stating this, an order constituting the committee of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India said capital and solvency; underwriting, product and claims; finance and accounting; investments; operations; and corporate governance are the indicative regulatory aspects to be studied. On reasons behind its decision to form the panel, the regulator said India is seen as a pioneer in the micro-insurance sector globally and has set an example with its micro-insurance regulations. “IRDAI has received suggestions on allowing standalone insurers for transaction of exclusive micro-insurance business, as it may boost the micro-insurance penetration in India with geographical spread,” the order said.

The committee has been given three months to submit its recommendations. Mirai Chatterjee, director of SEWA, Ahmedabad, will be the chairperson of the Committee, whose members include consultants and representatives from the banking and financial sector, both from insurance sector as well as officials of IRDAI.

The formation of the panel comes close on the heels of the recommendations made by another panel the regulator had set up on micro-insurance. Noting that micro-insurance is intended for protection of low income people, the panel in its report recommended that micro-insurance product benefits should be simple such that they could be easily conveyed by the distributor and understood by the customer. The ‘Gives & Gets’ for the customer should be clearly spelt out. It also recommended an option to permit payment of single premium in daily, fortnightly, monthly and quarterly instalments.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/concept-paper-on-standalone-micro-insurance-companies-soon/article30736829.ece
359,2020/02/04,"Surat’s diamond trade hit by coronavirus, holiday in Hong Kong","The outbreak of the coronavirus in China has adversely affected Surat’s diamond industry, which was expecting a spike in volumes following the China-U.S. trade treaty.

But, with the sudden outbreak and rapid spread of the pandemic exports are unlikely to go up in the fourth quarter, as per the assessment of industry players in the diamond city.

Now, with Hong Kong declaring a holiday till March 3, the Surat diamond industry would suffer a further blow, as the city imports rough gems from Hong Kong and exports polished diamonds to Hong Kong and thereon to China.

Industry insiders estimate that as much as 37-38% of the diamonds exported to Hong Kong from India are from Surat, and the jewellery made from polished diamonds is also exported to Hong Kong from Surat.

According to the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), a majority of exports of polished and cut diamonds to China is done via Hong Kong and now, the prevalence of coronavirus may dent consumer demand, resulting in a dip in exports. Diamond companies having offices in Hong Kong and China have asked their staff to return in view of the vacation.

With Hong Kong reportedly witnessing one casualty from the virus, diamond and jewellery exporters and traders here presume that the international jewellery exhibition scheduled to be held in Hong Kong in March would be postponed.

“What is bothering the trade is the outbreak of coronavirus in China, as it will affect sales of cut and polished diamonds,” Colin Shah of GJEPC said. He added that if the scenario did not change in 2-3 weeks, prices of polished diamonds would not rise and margins could face a squeeze.

Regional chairman of GJEPC and former chief of the Surat Diamond Association Dinesh Navadiya said that earlier, pro-democracy agitation in Hong Kong had hit the diamond industry and now with the coronavirus scare, losses could run into several hundred crores of rupees.

The overall export of cut and polished diamonds in the first 9 months of the current fiscal was already down 17.14% from a year earlier.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/5qyenp/article30736800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBUSURAT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/surats-diamond-trade-hit-by-coronavirus-holiday-in-hong-kong/article30736801.ece
360,2020/02/04,"Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor shares plunge following ban on motorcycles in Lagos","A ban on commercial motorcycles and three wheelers in Lagos, the commercial hub of Nigeria, to prevent accidents in the city, is likely to have minimal impact on Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Company Ltd., unless the ban is prolonged and its scope is expanded to many other cities, said analysts.

Bajaj and TVS export a significant volume of their motorcycles to Nigeria, among other African countries, they added. Company officials declined comment on the likely impact on their exports.

However, the stock market reacted to the news of the ban and Bajaj Auto shares slumped 3.86% to ₹3,162.50 while TVS Motor declined 3.54% to ₹454.55 on the BSE on Tuesday.

Independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga said, “The ban will have more of sentimental impact than any direct impact on sales. The sentiment will be negative if the ban expands to more cities.”

He said because both Bajaj Auto and TVS export to many countries, the impact will be limited.

6% of country volume

It is believed that Bajaj Auto exports about 40,000 to 45,000 motorcycles to Nigeria every month and Logas takes in about 6% of this volume. Nigeria itself is an import export market for Bajaj Auto and accounts for 25% of the total overseas sales. In January, Bajaj Auto reported total motorcycle exports of 174,546 units.

Though the ban in Lagos has been there for several months now, it was confined to several hundred lanes and by-lanes.

As the ban has now been enforced strictly in most parts of city, it has led to protests, thus attracting global attention.

In Lagos, commercial motorcycles have become popular as they help commuters to easily beat the traffic.

Excess speeding has led to fatal road accidents forcing the city authorities to clamp the ban. Recently, motorcycle ride-hailing apps have become popular in the city and the commercial motorcycle fleet have increased in number.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bivaf/article30736790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBUNIGERIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bajaj-auto-tvs-motor-shares-plunge-following-ban-on-motorcycles-in-lagos/article30736791.ece
361,2020/02/04,Paytm may take two years to come out of red: founder-CEO,"Online payments major Paytm said it was working in the ‘right direction’ to come out of the red in the next two years.

Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma told The Hindu: “All energies are now being mobilised towards turning the company profitable and predictable in terms of profit.”

As per Mr. Sharma, signs of recovery are already evident. “Year-on-year, ie January 2019 to January 2020, since the monetisation of the platform kicked in, our revenue grew 30% and Ebitda loss dropped by 50%.”

India recorded 15 billion merchant payments against total online money transactions of 26 billion in 2019, of which 9 billion were mobile payments, of which Paytm had the largest share with over 50%, he said.

“Now, Paytm is the most comprehensive payment app with all funding sources. Our focus is to reduce our Ebitda losses quarter-on- quarter. Going forward, our key growth areas will be banking, lending, insurance and wealth,” he said.

On the company’s gold savings and gold gifting services, he said, “We are overwhelmed to see that over 50 million people have used our platform to buy gold in the last two years.”

Calling 2020 ‘a year of lending,’ Mr. Sharma said, credit was critical for small and medium merchants and traders. “In our early, small trials, we will offer up to ₹2 crore to merchants. But once we obtain NDFC licence, we will get into credit business more seriously.”

Paytm, that claims over 300 million wallets, 100 mn UPI handles, 220 million saved cards, 55 million bank accounts and 16 million merchants, is also planning to get into stock trading services from April this year. It has already received approval from market regulator SEBI for the purpose.

363,2020/02/04,‘10% TDS only on MF dividends’,"The government has clarified that mutual fund houses must deduct 10% tax at source (TDS) on dividends.

On Tuesday, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) issued a clarification, after the Budget proposal led to concerns whether the 10% TDS would be applicable only on the dividend or whether any capital gains arising at the time of redemption would be taxed.

“Queries have been received to the effect that whether under the proposed section 194K, the Mutual Fund would be required to deduct TDS also on the capital gains arising on redemption of units,” a statement from Surabhi Ahluwalia, spokesperson, CBDT, said.

“It is hereby clarified that under the proposed section, a mutual fund shall be required to deduct TDS @ 10% only on dividend payment and no tax shall be required to be deducted by the mutual fund on income which is in the nature of capital gains,” the statement added.

“The proposal needed a serious rethink else it could have ended up complicating the investment process for the investor and increase the costs for the asset management company,” said Vivek Damani, a SEBI registered investment adviser, adding that the proposal, in the form presented in the Union Budget, seemed clouded with ambiguity.

Meanwhile, following the clarification from the CBDT, it is clear that the 10% TDS would only be levied when dividend income exceeded ₹5,000 in a financial year.

The two-and-three wheeler manufacturer had, in the previous quarter, reversed the provision of ₹76 crore towards National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) based on a favourable ruling by the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal in a case concerning the company’s case.

Following the ruling given in the current quarter by the Supreme Court that NCCD is leviable, the company, as a prudent measure, has reinstated the provision of ₹76 crore as an exceptional item.

366,2020/02/04,AirAsia’s Tony Fernandes steps aside as CEO pending probe,"AirAsia Group Bhd's Tony Fernandes on Tuesday denied a now-defunct Formula 1 racing team, formerly co-owned by him, had any links to a bribery scandal involving the Malaysian airline's only plane supplier, Airbus SE.

Mr. Fernandes, one of the aviation industry's best-known faces, on Monday stepped aside as chief executive of Asia's biggest budget airline for at least two months, as authorities investigate allegations that Airbus paid a bribe of $50 million through sponsorship of the Caterham F1 team to win orders from AirAsia.

AirAsia Chairman Kamarudin Meranun also stepped down along with Mr. Fernandes, though both will remain advisers. The AirAsia co-founders, who bought Caterham in 2011, issued a joint statement on Tuesday reiterating that they did nothing wrong.

“Caterham F1, the company alleged to have been sponsored improperly by Airbus, was at the relevant time a Formula 1 racing team that had gone round the globe promoting amongst others AirAsia, AirAsia X, GE and Airbus,” Mr. Fernandes and Mr. Kamarudin said in the statement.

“Throughout the period we were shareholders in Caterham, the company made no profit and was eventually disposed of for 1 pound sterling in 2014. From start to finish, this was a branding exercise and not a venture to make profit.”

The allegations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office on Friday concerned a 2012 sponsorship agreement between the now-defunct racing team and Airbus' then-parent, EADS.

AirAsia runs an all-Airbus fleet of 274 planes. It is the world's largest customer of the A321neo single-aisle aircraft.

Shares of AirAsia fell 5% as the stock market opened in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Those of long-haul subsidiary AirAsia X Bhd lost 8%.

Malaysia's MIDF Research downgraded its recommendation on AirAsia stock to “neutral” from “buy” on Tuesday whereas AmInvestment Bank maintained its “sell” rating.

“We find it difficult to argue for a case that 'business as usual' will prevail in the absence of the direct involvement of Fernandes and Kamarudin in the management and decision-making process of the company,” AmInvestment Bank said in a client note.

“The duo are the founding members, visionaries and key strategists for the group. This could not have happened at a worse time, amidst the Wuhan conoravirus epidemic that is severely hurting the demand for air travel (which is partially offset by plunging prices of crude oil, and hence jet fuel).”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bu7cxv/article30648140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THTONYFERNANDES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/airasias-tony-fernandes-steps-aside-as-ceo-pending-probe/article30732769.ece
367,2020/02/04,Alphabet posts mixed 4Q results; profit soars,"Google’s revenue didn’t grow as much as what Wall Street expected, sending parent company Alphabet’s stock down more than 4%, even as profits beat expectations.

Alphabet said Monday it earned $10.7 billion, or $15.35 per share, in the final three months of 2019. That’s up 19% from $8.9 billion, or $12.77 per share, a year earlier and more than the $12.49 a share analysts polled by FactSet were expecting.

Net revenue, after subtracting advertising costs, was $37.6 billion, up 18% from $31.8 billion a year earlier. But analysts were looking for $38.4 billion.

Competition from Facebook, Amazon

While Google is still the clear leader in the digital advertising market, it is seeing growing competition from the likes of Facebook and Amazon.

Google — and with it, Alphabet— makes the majority of its money from selling targeted advertising across the web, apps and Google products including its search engine and video streaming site YouTube. Investors are now also closely watching the growth of Google’s cloud business and its aspirations in the health care industry. Google agreed to buy the fitness tracker company Fitbit in November.

Alphabet disclosed revenue for YouTube and its cloud business for the first time, something analysts have been seeking for years. It said YouTube’s advertising revenue was $4.72 billion, up 31% from $3.61 billion a year earlier. Google Cloud revenue grew 53% to $2.61 billion from $1.71 billion a year earlier.

This was Alphabet’s first earnings report with Sundar Pichai at the company’s helm, following the depature of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, in December. Pichai was head of Google before.

368,2020/02/04,Manufacturing activity reaches a near 8-year high in January,"The country’s manufacturing sector activity climbed to a near eight-year high in January, driven by a sharp rise in new business orders amid a rebound in demand conditions that led to a rise in production and hiring activity, a monthly survey said on Monday.

Following a sharp improvement in demand, January saw growth of new business, output, exports, input buying and employment. At the same time, business sentiment strengthened and there were softer rises in both input costs and output charges. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing Puchasing Managers’ Index rose from 52.7 in December to 55.3 in January, its highest level in just under eight years.

“Manufacturing sector growth in India continued to strengthen in January, with operating conditions improving at a pace not seen in close to eight years,” said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

This is the 30th consecutive month the index has remained above the 50-point mark. A print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction. Companies noted the strongest upturn in new business intakes for over five years, which they attributed to better underlying demand and greater client requirements.

The rise in total sales was supported by strengthening demand from external markets, evident from the fastest increase in new export orders since November 2018.

Hiring activity also rose, with firms increasing employment at the quickest rate in close to seven-and-a-half years.

Provisions for bad loans increased 73.25% year-on-year to ₹4,445.36 crore in the third quarter from the ₹2,565.77 crore reported in the year-earlier period.

“Provisioning requirement of ₹2,091 crore indicated in the RBI RAR report has been fully provided for,” the bank said, indicating divergence of NPA classification that the Reserve Bank of India’s annual inspection report highlighted.

The operating profit grew 21.4% year-on-year to ₹ 3,763 crore while non-interest income grew 32.2% to ₹2,405 crore.

370,2020/02/04,Stocks on a roll as crude slides,"A firm trend in the global equity markets on the back of lower crude prices propelled the Indian benchmarks on Tuesday to clock their best-ever single day gain in over four months.

The 30-share Sensex gained 917.07 points, or 2.3%, to close at 40,789.38 as 28 of its constituents ended the day in positive territory. Stocks such as HDFC Bank, M&M, Hero Motocorp, Tara Steel, Power Grid Corporation, Bajaj Finance, HDFC and ITC all gained over 3% each.

The broader Nifty ended the day at 11,979.65, up 271.75 points or 2.32%.

Market participants attributed the rally to the recent drop in crude prices that fell below $50 per barrel during intraday trades which, in turn, pushed up equities globally. The fall was on account of concerns related to decreasing demand following coronavirus outbreak.

Incidentally, crude prices last touched these levels almost 13 months ago and are currently 20% lower than the highs witnessed in January, thereby entering a bear market, by definition.

According to Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president, equity technical research, Kotak Securities, a combination of factors, including a significant fall in crude prices, a rise in the Indian rupee and positive Asian markets, along with encouraging data points fuelled the rally on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data released on Monday showed that the country's manufacturing activity expanded in January at its quickest pace in nearly eight years.

Meanwhile, leading indices such as the Hang Seng and Kospi both gained over 1% on Tuesday even as all other Asian markets ended with gains. Chinese benchmarks also ended up over 2%. In India, equities saw broad-based buying as gainers outpaced declines by nearly 2:1. On the BSE, more than 1,600 stocks gained ground as against 892 declines.

Rising for the second straight session, the BSE benchmark closed at 40,789.38, up 2.30% or 917.07 points. This was the biggest single-day rise for the Sensex since September 23, 2019. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty settled at 11,979.65, surging 2.32% or 271.75 points — gaining the most in a single day in over four months.

Giving a thumbs down to the much-awaited Union Budget, the Sensex took a massive plunge on last Saturday to mark its worst session in over a decade as the government failed to meet market expectations. But the benchmark indices gaining for the last two sessions shows investors have shrugged off Budget disappointment and focusing now on other market moving factors like corporate earnings and macroeconomic data.

Investors cheered the country’s manufacturing sector activity climbing to a near eight-year high in January, helping domestic stocks end higher on Monday -- the very first session after Budget. On Tuesday, Titan was the biggest gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying 7.97%, followed by ITC, HDFC, Bajaj Finance, and Tata Steel. On the other hand, Bajaj Auto and HUL were on the losing side.

All sectoral indices ended with gains with BSE consumer durables, metal, oil and gas, energy realty and finance indices rallying up to 3.52%. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices advanced up to 1.37%. “Indian markets witnessed a strong rally on the back of rally in global markets.

The Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy outcome could be the next trigger for the domestic unit, as its commentary on inflation and growth forecast will be followed closely by the investors, they added.

376,2020/02/04,Delhi 2020 | Will it be another term for Kejriwal?,"With less than a week to go before the Assembly election in Delhi, campaigning has reached a fever pitch. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s speeches, pegged to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), have gotten shriller. While the party is busy painting the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as ‘anti-Hindu’, and the protesters at Shaheen Bagh as ‘anti-national’, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal continues to focus on civic issues in his campaign speeches. The Congress, which failed to win a single seat in the 2015 Assembly election, barely seems to be in the picture. Mr. Kejriwal insists these elections are being fought on the “work done by the Delhi government”. When asked about the relevance of the CAA and NRC in the campaign, he said, “Electricity, water, education, schools, hospitals are the issues.”

Surplus of capital

This emphasis is important. Indian cities, especially large metros, are becoming more and more exclusionary towards the marginalised. Delhi has always been a city of the poor, displaced and dispossessed. Over the years, large development projects and master plans have pushed the poor further to the peripheries, depriving them of access to good healthcare facilities, education and infrastructure. Oxfam reports that while India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, it is also one of the most unequal. But Mr. Kejriwal’s five years of rule have provided poor citizens a glimmer of hope.

Listen | The Hindu In Focus podcast: is it Kejriwal vs Amit Shah in the national capital?

Cities are the greatest generators of wealth and innovation. In India, they contribute about 60% of the GDP. A huge surplus is generated through the expropriation of some of the basic utilities and services in cities. Professor Ursula Hews wrote in the Socialist Register how ‘use value items’ have been commoditised. This, she said, has led to pauperisation of the people and the creation of a huge surplus for large transnational corporations. It’s not a surprise then that some of the large transnational corporations shifted their portfolio from finance to service utilities. In fact, the largest appropriation of capital is taking place through either direct privatisation or backdoor privatisation of utilities such as health, education, water, and even sanitation. The Smart Cities project further facilitated this growth of surplus by allowing the Internet of Things to govern cities and charging residents for the services being offered.

Electricity and health

It is against this backdrop that the Kejriwal government has tried to democratise this surplus and distribute it among the citizens. This has happened in various ways. Take, for example, water distribution and billing in Delhi. Every family in Delhi that consumes less than 20 KL (kilolitres, or 1,000 litres) is not charged for water. Similarly, for electricity consumption of up to 200 units, there is no charge. For those consuming 201-400 units a month, approximately 50% subsidy is provided. Whereas a family in Mumbai, Noida or any other megacity in India has to pay more than ₹2,000 for both water and electricity, families in Delhi save this money and use it for other purposes.

The Delhi government has also established mohalla clinics, or neighbourhood health clinics, in Delhi. The government has created a four-tier healthcare delivery system comprising clinics for primary health care, clinics for secondary health care, multi-speciality hospitals, and super-speciality hospitals. According to National Health Accounts estimates, patients in India bear a big chunk of health expenses — as high as 61% of the total health expenditure — by themselves. Therefore, free health clinics help reduce the financial burden on poor and marginalised groups. As of now, 300 mohalla clinics are functional and the AAP government proposes to open 500 more. This will also shift the health paradigm from curative to preventive care and ease the health expenditure for citizens significantly.

The Kejriwal government has also provided free bus rides for women. It promises to make bus rides free for all students, if elected to power. This will not only help people save more, but also reduce the burden on private mobility. Given that Delhi sees spells of very high pollution, encouraging public transport is important.

Nearly 49% of the population in Delhi lives in either slums or clusters. These are the people who have got enormous respite due to the redistributive policy implemented by the Kejriwal government in the last few years.

Mr. Kejriwal may have flip-flopped on issues such as Article 370, but at least he has proved that alternatives meaningful to a majority of citizens can be developed.

377,2020/02/04,Non-violence as an art of resistance,"As I write this piece, I know that my longing for non-violence would be regarded as ridiculous or an impossible proposition by many. It is not surprising. Living in contemporary India — a society characterised by toxic nationalism, triumphant majoritarianism, heightened socioeconomic inequality, and simultaneous ethical-political impoverishment — is like breathing violence everywhere. From brute/physical violence to psychic/symbolic aggression, the psychology of sadomasochism seems to have invaded our consciousness. What is really frightening is that we have almost normalised the everydayness of violence — the recurrence of rape and absolute objectification of women; the celebration of police encounters and the militarisation of the consciousness; the toxic/inflammatory speeches by Ministers and the invasion of university spaces by sponsored goons; and above all, the castigation of all dissenters and its vulgar celebration by noisy television channels.

Yet, at the finest moment of contemplation, some of us realise that our sociopolitical and psychic salvation lies in non-violence. However, in this dystopian age, a cynic might say that it is not possible to be convinced of non-violence and activate its therapeutic power.

The appeal of violence

Before we find an authentic answer to this question, it is important to acknowledge that despite the illuminating presence of the likes of Buddha and Mahavira, Nanak and Kabir, or Gandhi and Tagore in the civilisational landscape, the instinct of violence continues to have tremendous appeal to the average person’s consciousness. First, it tempts us because it activates and nurtures our egos; in fact, the devastating wars that have taken place in the name of the ‘glory’ of the nation reveal our collective and cumulative egos. Moreover, this egotistic pride is often celebrated as a hyper-masculine attribute of bravery. From militarism to aggressive/hyper-competitive sports carnivals, we see the sanctification of this sort of violence.

Second, it excites the surface personality; it stimulates brute instincts, and leads to some sort of catharsis or immediate instinctual gratification. In recent times, we are seeing this sort of violence in the form of mob lynching or communal frenzy.

Third, it is appealing because it does not demand the honest labour of self-reflection. Instead, we are led to believe that the problem lies necessarily always outside, and hence the annihilation of the ‘enemy’ out there is seen to be the only way to our redemption. In fact, the prevalent majoritarian nationalism sustains itself through this negative logic of the ‘enemy’, be it Pakistan or a bunch of ‘urban Naxals’. The stimulation of war is what explains its mass appeal. Fourth, it satisfies the urge to find quick ‘solutions’. This sort of ‘surgical’ orientation is seen in the nihilistic play of ‘suicide bombers’, or even in the supposedly ‘revolutionary’ guerilla warfare. And fifth, it encourages one’s sadistic thrill of being seen as ‘superior’ to others. This violence in the name of hierarchy or asymmetrical distribution of cultural/economic capital is seen in the cycle of caste war, racial discrimination and class conflict.

Yes, violence surrounds us, and we do not seem to be very kind to those who plead for non-violence. Jesus was crucified; Gandhi was assassinated; and John Lennon was killed. Moreover, we should not forget that the discourse of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ modern societies cherish is inherently violent. While techno-science, with its reckless urge to manipulate and conquer nature, causes environmental violence and promotes instrumental reasoning, the self-seeking consumer striving for a mythical notion of ‘good living’ is reducing life into a war zone — a site of neurotic social Darwinism. In other words, we are caught into the very logic of structural violence.

Hearing the existential call

However, there are moments when we hear the existential call: to live is to rebel; and to rebel is to love and heal the wound. The fate of non-violence as an art of resistance, a mode of living, or a politico-spiritual pursuit would depend on our willingness to understand the meaning of this existential quest. Yes, even amid the all-pervading darkness, we see the traces of light. For instance, when the violence of ‘development’ is seen as ‘desirable’, Medha Patkar’s jal satyagraha appears as the light of illumination. Or when the ruling regime remains intoxicated with power, Shaheen Bagh begins to look like a zone of possibilities — women filled with qualities like endurance, moral strength and non-violence, are revealing the immorality of the mighty state. And even when young students evolve the new aesthetics of resistance, and reveal the elasticity of consciousness by engaging with Marx as well as Gandhi, or Ambedkar as well as Bhagat Singh, we see the spark of non-violence.

The question is whether this potential can be unfolded further, and we can move towards non-violence as a mode of living, politics, culture, economy and education. To begin with, it has to be realised that to move towards non-violence is to move towards the spirit of non-possessiveness. Because it is the urge to accumulate wealth and power that intensifies one’s ego, and causes a broken relationship with others. Likewise, to practice non-violence is to sharpen the power of empathy, and cultivate the art of listening. The spirit of dialogue or the ethics of care emanates from non-violence; it is the only answer to a totalitarian/fascist mindset. Moreover, non-violence demands the fundamental faith in the potential of what Gandhi would have regarded as ‘soul force’, even though we are more used to ‘brute force’. In other words, non-violence is a quest, a journey, a process of awakening.

In fact, non-violence as a state of being, and a non-violent society as a structure of relationships, reinforce each other. A non-violent society, needless to add, cannot be based on the logic of techno-capitalism, its exploitative urge, or the violence it inflicts on nature through the logic of ceaseless ‘development’ and consumerism. Gandhiji was absolutely clear about it. A non-violent societal imagination ought to inherit the spirit of universalism; it has to see beyond militaristic nationalism, parochialism and religious fundamentalism. Rabindranath Tagore, I believe, captured this spirit quite well. Furthermore, a non-violent society has to be a casteless society; possibly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s inclination to the Buddhist ethics indicated this quest. Finally, a non-violent society seeks to overcome the Cartesian fragmentation and division; instead, it unites science and ethics, politics and spirituality, education and meditation, economy and ecology, and masculine and feminine.

We are passing through terribly difficult times. With the rise of right wing nationalism in different parts of the world, the culture of violence has acquired a new dimension. And in our own country, the non-dialogic ruling regime with its propaganda machinery is turning everything into its opposite: vice into virtue, hatred into patriotism, and hyper-masculine aggression into religion. Yet, as I see the pockets of resistance, I begin to believe that the quest for non-violence cannot be finished. Possibly, at this crucial juncture, we are passing through some sort of inner churning.

378,2020/02/04,The broken myth of ‘sushasan’,"Notwithstanding its success in the general election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has of late been busy reassuring its Bihar ally, the Janata Dal (United), amidst growing differences on several matters. While some of the BJP leaders might have ambitions to take on the JD(U), particularly Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the BJP leadership is mindful of its limitations in the State.

The BJP has no leader who can even come close to Mr. Kumar’s popularity in Bihar. Therefore, parting ways with him could be a blunder. Recent setbacks to the BJP in Assembly elections have further alerted its leadership. It is not surprising, therefore, that Home Minister Amit Shah stated categorically that his party will contest Bihar Assembly elections, scheduled later this year, under the leadership of Mr. Kumar. This unequivocal endorsement of Mr. Kumar’s leadership by Mr. Shah, and earlier by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is likely to end the wrangling among some BJP leaders in Bihar.

Recently, Bihar has been in the news for the wrong reasons — the reassurance of support from the BJP has apparently distracted Mr. Kumar further from his commitment to sushasan (good governance) and real issues concerning the masses. Whether it is pollution, floods, encephalitis deaths, shelter home abuse cases, rape incidents, neglect of teachers, piling up of prohibition-related cases in courts, or dismal performance in achieving Sustainable Development Goals, each of these has undermined his governance record.

Ineffective third term

Mr. Kumar, also known as ‘Sushasan babu’ due to his delivery on law and order, infrastructure and education for girls in his first two terms, is now widely seen as having presided over an ineffective government in the third term. In the last few years, education has suffered immensely due to neglect; prohibition has bred corruption and a parallel economy enmeshed in criminal networks; and there is hardly any reform to improve education, healthcare, infrastructure, investment, local industrial base, and employment prospects. Contractual recruitment in schools and government departments have deepened the gloom.

Today, the ground reality is that Mr. Kumar’s focus in Bihar appears to have shifted from good governance to election engineering. More than his governance record, what has acted in his favour is a weak Opposition and lack of alternative leadership within the BJP-JD(U) alliance.

Alliance with BJP

Mr. Kumar has also faced an acute challenge in getting more out of his ally, the BJP. Bihar’s demand for ‘special status’ based on its history of socioeconomic backwardness found no takers in the Modi government. Neither was the JD(U) offered any good ministerial post at the Centre, which meant the party did not join the government.

As the political trajectory gets broadly redefined for the ruling alliance in Bihar, policy and practice are not in sync with the need and aspirations of Biharis. Migration is still the only route to employment as the government has an indifferent attitude towards bringing the production base to the State and aligning the workforce locally. Sadly, the lack of vision for reform and persisting apathy regarding industry have made things worse.

Mr. Kumar is an engineer by training and ‘electoral engineer’ by choice, and this has imbued him with deftness in handling issues concerning Extremely Backward Classes, Mahadalits and women, for political gain. However, with a growing number of questions being raised on his governance record, the 2020 Assembly elections in Bihar will not be an easy one.

379,2020/02/04,What Brexit means for the EU and its partners,"On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union. We lost a member of our family. It was a sad moment for us, for European citizens — and, indeed, for many British citizens.

Nevertheless, we have always respected the sovereign decision of 52% of the British electorate, and we now look forward to starting a new chapter in our relations.

A structured exit

Emotions aside, February 1 turned out to be historic but also undramatic. This is largely thanks to the Withdrawal Agreement that we negotiated with the U.K., which enabled us to secure “an orderly Brexit”. One that, at least for now, minimises disruption for our citizens, businesses, public administrations, as well as for our international partners.

Under this agreement, the EU and the U.K. agreed on a transition period, until the end of 2020 at least, during which the U.K. will continue to participate in the EU’s Customs Union and in the Single Market, and to apply EU law, even if it is no longer a Member State. During this period, the U.K. will also continue to abide by the international agreements of the EU, as we made clear in a note verbale to our international partners.

Element of continuity

So, with the transition period in place, there is a degree of continuity. This was not easy given the magnitude of the task. By leaving the Union, the U.K. automatically, mechanically, legally, leaves hundreds of international agreements concluded by or on behalf of the Union, to the benefit of its Member States, on topics as different as trade, aviation, fisheries or civil nuclear cooperation.

We now have to build a new partnership between the EU and the U.K. That work will start in a few weeks as soon as the EU 27 Member States have approved the negotiating mandate proposed by the European Commission, setting out our terms and ambitions for achieving the closest possible partnership with a country which will remain our ally, our partner and our friend.

Shared and deep links

The EU and the U.K. are bound by history, by geography, culture, shared values and principles and a strong belief in rules-based multilateralism. Our future partnership will reflect these links and shared beliefs. We want to go well beyond trade and keep working together on security and defence, areas where the U.K. has experiences and assets that are best used as part of a common effort. In a world of big challenges and change, of turmoil and transition, we must consult each other and cooperate, bilaterally and in key regional and global fora, such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the G20.

It is perhaps a cliché but the basic truth is that today’s global challenges — from climate change, to cybercrime, terrorism or inequality — require collective responses. The more the U.K. is able to work in lockstep with the EU and together with partners around the world, the greater our chances of addressing these challenges effectively.

At the very core of the EU project is the idea that we are stronger together; that pooling our resources and initiatives is the best way of achieving common goals. Brexit does not change this, and we will continue to take this project forward as 27.

Together, the 27 Member States will continue to form a single market of 450 million citizens and more than 20 million businesses. Together, we remain the largest trading bloc in the world. Together, at 27, we are still the world’s largest development aid donor.

Our partners can be sure that we will stay true to an ambitious, outward-looking agenda — be it on trade and investment, on climate action and digital, on connectivity, on security and counter-terrorism, on human rights and democracy, or on defence and foreign policy.

We will continue to live up to our commitments. We will continue to stand by the agreements that link us to our international partners and we will continue to develop multilateral cooperation frameworks around the world.

The European Union will continue to be a partner you can trust. A steadfast defender of rules-based multilateralism, working with our partners to make the world more secure and fair.

380,2020/02/04,Camel in the tent: On shortage of doctors,"As the Centre pushes to attach medical colleges to existing district hospitals in the public-private partnership (PPP) mode, to ostensibly address the shortage of doctors in the country, the question is: does it understand the nature of the camel that it is planning to allow into the tent? Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Union Budget speech, introduced the proposal and stated that those States that fully allow the facilities of the hospital to the medical college and wish to provide land at a concession would be eligible for viability gap funding. Several details are already available in the public domain, as part of the plan, first proposed by NITI Aayog. It argues that it is practically not possible for Central and State governments to bridge the gaps in medical education with their limited resources and finances, necessitating the formation of a PPP model, “combining the strengths of both sectors”. This would augment the number of medical seats available and moderate the costs of medical education. Experts have argued that the NITI Aayog has not given sufficient play to the role of the district hospital as the pivot of primary health care in every State. Allowing private parties to “operate and maintain the district hospital and provide healthcare services” could seriously dent public health services. It is problematic that the NITI Aayog envisages the creation of “free” patients versus others, because this will create a new category of have-nots. A working draft of the concessionaire agreement indicates that the private firm “can demand, collect and appropriate hospital charges from patients”. There is understandable opposition to the scheme in States such as Tamil Nadu that have a robust public health-care system, and a medical college in nearly every district. These States are naturally loath to turning over a key unit in their health-care network, which is running reasonably efficiently, to the private sector motivated by profit rather than public interest.

Ultimately, eternal vigil will be the price of going for this new mode. While creating quality medical professionals for the country should definitely be on any government’s to-do list, destabilising people’s access to affordable public health services, will be disastrous. Viability gap funding is provided for projects that the government does not find commercially viable because of long gestation periods, and relatively minor revenue flows, and involves PPP, but this instant situation calls for pause: health fits square in the State’s welfare role. The government must consider raising health-care spending beyond the usual under 2% of GDP, and ensure more resources are available to provide free, quality health care to all. If it does stay on its path of giving the private sector some control over district hospitals, it will do well to be wary of the camel in the tent.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/camel-in-the-tent-on-shortage-of-doctors/article30729068.ece
381,2020/02/04,More of the same: On Australian Open 2020 winners,"No player and tournament have been synonymous with each other quite like Rafael Nadal and Roland Garros. Novak Djokovic winning the Australian Open now seems equally ironclad. The Serb, on Sunday, captured his eighth title in Melbourne and 17th Grand Slam overall following a nearly four-hour, five-set duel with an inspired Dominic Thiem. The 32-year-old is just three Majors shy of Roger Federer in the all-time count. The victory did not come easy; in the 26-year-old Austrian, who had earlier beaten Nadal in the quarter-final, Djokovic had the most formidable of challengers from the sport’s next generation. When Djokovic plays his two biggest rivals, Nadal and Federer, he gives the impression of a man who knows their games like the back of his hand. No wonder the two have not managed to beat Djokovic at a Major since 2014. But against players from a rung below, Djokovic has increasingly looked shaky. In fact, coming into Sunday’s final, he had lost four of his last five matches with Thiem, including the last two meetings at Slams. During the contest, there were lapses galore, both physical and mental, as he struggled to apply his customary stranglehold. Yet, such was his resilience that despite the post-match admission of him being a nervous wreck through the tussle, Djokovic rose from the dead the same way he had in the 2019 Wimbledon final against Federer.

Even as the triumph leaves the state of men’s tennis unaltered — Djokovic, Nadal and Federer have swept the last 13 Majors and currently occupy the top three ranking positions — it is clear that the Thiem-led mid-card, which includes Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, is snapping at the heels of the leaders with ever more vigour. Thiem, fourth in the world, appears best-placed to succeed, having held his own against both Nadal and Djokovic, and beaten Federer all three times they met last year. Clay is a surface on which Thiem is a natural and the upcoming season on the red dirt is sure to provide sufficient cues. The churn in the women’s section, however, is in an accentuated state with American Sofia Kenin, a counter-puncher blessed with magical hands, becoming the eighth first-time champion from the last 12 Grand Slam events. Once the semi-final line-up was completed, it appeared that the often capricious ladies’ game had finally settled with three former Major winners in the fray. But space was carved out for yet another new champion, as the tenacious Kenin, 21, felled in succession, Ashleigh Barty, the reigning French Open champion, and Garbiñe Muguruza, a two-time Major winner, to become the youngest Australian Open champion since Maria Sharapova in 2008.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-of-the-same-on-australian-open-2020-winners/article30729071.ece
382,2020/02/04,Jana Sevak services extended to three more constituencies,"The State government on Tuesday scaled up its Jana Sevak services, a programme of delivering government services at the doorstep of citizens, after piloting it successfully in Bengaluru’s Dasarahalli Assembly constituency last year.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa launched the Jana Sevak programme in Bommanahalli, Mahadevapura and Rajajinagar Assembly constituencies. With this, the programme is now being implemented in four constituencies in the city.

Citizens can avail 53 services at their doorstep by paying ₹115 per application. Jana Sevaks would come to the residence of the citizen and provide the service. The services have been outsourced.

Citizens can place a call to the Jana Sevak toll-free number and request a slot for documents for scanning or applications to be taken from their house. The Jana Sevak service number is 080-44554455. Jana Sevak will function from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

With the expansion, the government will also put in place women Jana Sevaks, considering the comfort and safety of home-alone women, he said.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who is also in-charge of Sakala Mission, said over the past nine months, as many as 30,274 citizens had 44 government services (health cards, senior citizen cards, caste/income certificates, among others) delivered to their doorsteps. The intention is to ensure that citizens, particularly elderly people, do not have to run from one office to another to get their work done.

He said the programme would be extended to Mangaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi-Dharwad, and Belagavi based on the success in the city.

Mr. Yediyurappa also launched Mahiti Khajane to provide data on government schemes and programmes. He also launched the facility of submission of Right to Information (RTI) application online as per a Supreme Court order.

The Chief Minister launched a helpline (155214) of the Labour Department to provide information to labourers and construction workers.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jana-sevak-services-extended-to-three-more-constituencies/article30737280.ece
383,2020/02/04,Transit hubs for outstation buses take shape; but will they work?,"The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) has identified points in the city to develop intermodal transit hubs with the aim of decongesting Bengaluru’s roads and restricting the entry of long-distance buses into the core city area.

The proposed hubs will have terminal points for long-distance buses, which will be integrated with the metro, BMTC and rail network so that passengers can reach their destinations within the city easily.

Six intermodal transit hubs will come up at Challaghatta, Baiyappanahalli, K.R. Puram, Peenya, Bommasandra, and Kadugodi while the others will come up on Ballari Road and on the Peripheral Ring Road. A majority of the hubs are proposed in the eastern part of the city.

More than 6,000 long distance buses operate from the city, and this, say traffic experts, is the reason for heavy congestion, especially on Fridays.

Ahead of long weekends, motorists often spend more than an hour stuck in traffic jams at Majestic, Hebbal, Madiwala, and Govardhana theatre to Jalahalli on Tumakuru Road, on account of inter-city buses that often stop on the way to pick up passengers.

The hubs, say DULT officials, will solve the problem. The agency has already floated a tender to select consultancy firms to design the transit hubs.

While the proposal looks good on paper, past attempts to prevent outstation buses from entering the core city area have not met with much success. For the past several years, the Transport Department and the traffic police have been proposing to restrict the entry of long-distance buses into the core areas, but in vain.

Past attempts

KSRTC has maintained that it is open to the idea of a new system, though private operators are vehemently opposing it.

Shivayogi C. Kalasad, Managing Director of KSRTC, said, “Years ago, even before the commissioning of the metro, the Corporation had taken a decision to shift services operated from Majestic to Mysuru Satellite bus stand, Shantinagar and other areas. We will be holding more deliberations on operating bus services from the proposed hubs.”

The KSRTC had made several attempts to shift some of its schedules from Majestic to Basaveshwara Bus Terminal at Peenya to de-congest the Majestic area. However, it did not take off, and after suffering huge revenue losses, the Corporation decided to reintroduce services from Majestic.

On developing Basaveshwara Bus Terminal which has been a dead investment for the Corporation, Mr. Kalasad said, “We are in discussions with BMRCL on providing travelators from the metro station, which is 800 metres away from the terminal. We are also requesting BMTC to operate more services from the point.”

The Corporation had invested close to ₹40 crore on the terminal.

K.T. Rajashekar, chairman, Bus Operators’ Confederation of India, cited the failed attempts to restrict long-distance buses from entering the city, as reasons for why the intermodal transit hubs are “ill-conceived”.

“Bus operators pick up and drop passengers from various points in the city, such as Whitefield, Electronics City, and Jayanagar. But the city does not have a robust mass transit system on the outskirts that people can use to reach the core areas,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4f2ok1/article30737205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTRANSPORTHUB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/transit-hubs-for-outstation-buses-takes-shape-but-will-they-work/article30737207.ece
384,2020/02/04,Students of Alliance University allege harassment and maladministration,"Students of Alliance University have written to both the Prime Minister and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa claiming that administration of the varsity has been affected and that they are being harassed by people close to the management.

The private varsity has been embroiled in multiple controversies, the most recent being its co-founder Sudhir Angur accused of having a hand in murder of a former vice-chancellor and allegedly plotting to murder his brother, Madhukar Angur, who is also vying for control.

In a letter sent in January, female students claimed that they are being subjected to sexual harassment. Others alleged that they have been asked to pay fees in advance and that a section of the administration is offering a discount of 20-30%.

No police complaint has been lodged so far.

Highlighting another troubling issue, the students have stated: “The girl students are afraid to even talk to these people for fear of being targeted for sexual favours or else they will fail in the exams. Such is the climate at the university. There is extensive drug use and abuse among some students.”

The letter has been sent anonymously as students fear that the management will fail them in their examinations or foist false cases against them if they reveal their identities.

The management of Alliance University was not available for comment despite repeated calls.

Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said that the State government would intervene and investigate the complaint in the interest of students.

The tussle for ownership of Alliance University between its co-founders — brothers Madhukar and Sudhir Angur — has been going on for over four years. In the past, a one-man committee appointed by the government had unearthed an alleged scam to the tune of ₹96 crore. In October last year, former vice-chancellor Ayyappa Dore was hacked to death while taking a walk in the HMT playground near his house in R.T. Nagar. The university’s chancellor Sudhir Angur was arrested in connection with the crime.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/students-of-alliance-university-allege-harassment-and-maladministration/article30737098.ece
385,2020/02/04,Techie attacks kin: Biker under scanner,"The K.R. Puram police are searching for an unidentified man on a scooter who software engineer Amrutha Chandrashekhar, 33, left with after allegedly stabbing her mother to death and attacking her brother with a knife. The alleged incident took place early Sunday morning at the family’s residence in K.R. Puram.

The police, after scanning CCTV footage from neighbouring houses, saw a man wearing a helmet and carrying a bag-pack waiting on his scooter near the house. “Footage shows Amrutha walking out of the house and riding pillion on the scooter,” said a senior police officer.

Amrutha’s brother Harish, 31, who sustained neck and hand injuries, had told the police that his sister mentioned financial troubles while attacking him. She had reportedly taken a loan of ₹15 lakh that she was unable to repay.

However, given the new developments, the police said, “We suspect that the man abetted her, and efforts are on track him down.”

386,2020/02/04,"Why action for contempt of court should not be initiated, HC asks BBMP Commissioner","The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar to show cause why contempt of court proceedings should not be initiated against him for disobeying its directions on enforcing the apex court’s September 9, 2009 order to act against illegal religious structures in public places.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the High Court on the actions of the State government and its authorities for removing illegal religious structures as per the apex court’s orders.

During the hearing, the bench noticed that the BBMP Commissioner had not only failed to comply with the directions issued by the High Court to properly enforce the apex court’s directions but had also failed to provide the details sought by the High Court on illegal religious structures.

Though the apex court had said that no illegal structure should be allowed in public places after September 29, 2009, the status report filed by the Commissioner was vague as the charts about illegal religious structures did not specify whether they were built prior to or after September 29, 2009.

At one point, the bench even asked the government counsel what action the government would take against the Commissioner as “he is unable to understand the court’s orders”.

Later, the court directed the government to issue specific directions to the BBMP Commissioner on the matter of the apex court’s 2009 directions.

While making it clear that the Commissioner need not personally appear in cCourt on March 4, the next date of hearing, the bench said that the Commissioner should specifically state that what is the role assigned to members of the legal cell of the BBMP and to state whether any member of the legal cell was specifically assigned to the issue about illegal religious structures.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/24qi52/article30739904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/why-action-for-contempt-of-court-should-not-be-initiated-hc-asks-bbmp-commissioner/article30737039.ece
387,2020/02/04,BBMP Commissioner apologises,"Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar on Tuesday submitted an ‘unconditional and remorseful apology’ to the Karnataka High Court for stating that he had not held a meeting with the Mayor and others but had only ‘consulted’ on framing rules for giving compensation to public for damage or loss caused due to bad roads and footpaths as per the court’s orders.

“What I actually meant was that, I had consulted the aforesaid persons [Mayor and others] with regard to the need to frame rules in that matter. The mistake is unintentional, and I hereby express my regret for the same, ” he said in his affidavit while clarifying that he had ‘inadvertently’ used certain words in his earlier affidavit filed in November last year.

While providing the names of Mayor and others as sought by the court, the Commissioner has briefly narrated the steps taken by the BBMP for enforcing various directions issued by the court for maintenance of roads.

“I respectfully submit that sincere efforts are being made to comply with the order of this court. I submit my unconditional and remorseful apology for any lapses in this regard. I further state that all efforts will be made to further implement the direction of the court,” he stated in the affidavit.

The affidavit was filed after the court had on Friday castigated him for continuously defying a series of its orders passed in connection with a PIL petition related to city’s poor road conditions.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, while expressing dissatisfaction over the language adopted by the Commissioner in his affidavit, adjourned further hearing to February 6 for considering the Commissioner’s affidavit.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/45l636/article30739899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGBHANILKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-commissioner-apologises/article30736836.ece

391,2020/02/04,How Chennai’s Samarpana helps the underprivileged through Classical dance,"It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that talent aside, being a professional artiste is easier when you come from an economically well-off background. “To perform at big sabhas, it costs ₹20,000 just to book an orchestra, then there are the costs of costumes, lighting and video,” says Gayathri S, a digital marketer, and dancer. “I can afford to be a dancer because I am earning through another full-time job,” she says.

To help recognise economically underprivileged talent and bring them to the mainstream, Gayathri set up Samarpana six months ago. Ahead of a fund-raising performance at The Music Academy, she says, “It is tough for people coming from lesser privileged backgrounds to sustain their life just through dancing, even to get the stage to perform. But as artistes, it is important for them to showcase their talent, so Samarpana is an initiative to reach out to them, give remunerations and encourage them to perform.”

At the fundraiser, Art for a Cause, this weekend, she has invited duo Renjith and Vijna, child prodigy Soorya Gayathri — the 14-year-old Carnatic YouTube sensation, and performers from Sridevi Nrithyalaya. The proceeds from this performance will go to RASA. The NGO that helps children and adults with special needs is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year.

“We chose to partner with RASA for this because for 30 years, they have been helping people with special needs through natyashastra,” she says, adding, “The students from RASA will also be performing this weekend.” Elders from old age homes and kids from orphanages have been invited to watch the event, free of cost. Each audience member gets to take home a sapling to plant.

Apart from fundraising events like these, Samarpana also picks families in remote districts of Tamil Nadu and helps them with financial, educational and medical needs. “So far we have adopted 10 families, and we help them with English, maths and computer classes,” she says.

Though the organisation has not had dance classes for the underprivileged as of yet, they plan to do so in the future. “Right now, we have collaborated with an NGO to rent out the mini hall space at Narada Gana Sabha for deserving artistes that we have identified, conduct programmes for them and offer remuneration.”

Through Samarpana, Gayathri not only hopes to give them a platform, but also promote the Classical dance form among mainstream audiences. “We curate a chamber concert series, in which a dancer performs to an intimate gathering. The dancer doesn’t follow conventional format, instead she performs on themes that are close to her heart, in a way that can be easily understood by the layman,” she says.

In the previous chamber concert, dancer Karuna Sagari had performed to Tamil Sangam poetry. “The ultimate aim of the event, along with fundraising, is nudging the public a little bit towards offering themselves to society and Nature,” says Gayathri.

Art for a Cause will be held at The Music Academy, TTK Road, on February 9, from 5 pm to 9 pm. Tickets on bookmyshow.com.

The vacant property, filled with rain water from the last rains, had become a small pond, and is being used by cattle as a watering hole. Residents have complained that with the open stormwater drain also running along the perimeter of the vacant plot, it had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Adding to the problem is the dumping of garbage by residents in front of the open land causing an unbearable stench.

T. Anand, who resides near the vacant plot, said the residents in the locality are facing a mosquito problem because plot is being misused for dumping garbage and also, a large number buffaloes are wallowing in the small pond.

Residents have been requesting the local authorities of the Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat to take steps to drain out the stagnant water from the vacant plot and stop dumping of garbage in front of it.

Residents have also complained about the panchayat authorities not taking any steps to prevent the misuse of letting sewage into the stormwater drain and the panchayat authority’s failure to take regular vector control measures to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6i6pph/article30732976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-Chitlapakkamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-in-chitlapakkam-battle-mosquito-menace/article30732977.ece
393,2020/02/04,Govt. may fix ticket prices for special shows of mega releases,"In a decision that could bring cheer to the Tamil film industry, Information and Broadcasting Minister Kadambur Raju on Monday said that the State government was thinking of fixing rates for special shows of big budget movies releasing during the festive season.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Raju said that the decision would likely clamp down on tickets being sold at exorbitant prices for such films.

“Theatre owners requested the government to fix the rates for special shows to eliminate the possibility of tickets being sold exhorbitantly. Revenue to the government will also go up,” he said.

Tiruppur Subramanian, a well-known distributor and exhibitor, welcomed the Minister’s comment. “It will be great if the State government comes up with the rates. In any case, the special shows are only screened for two or three actors and exorbitant rates are being charged (by some theatres) for one show,” he said.

Mr. Raju also said that the State government might look into the possibility of creating infrastructure for ticket sales as producers had earlier taken objection to the ‘convenience/internet charges’ charged by ticketing websites for every ticket.

Distributors upset

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the foot overbridge, which is linked to the Alandur Metro station, will be equipped with lifts and escalators on both sides of the road. It was built for an estimated ₹6 crore, officials said. “Only recently, we got the licence for lifts and then the signages were installed as well. After this is opened, hundreds of commuters will find it convenient to cross the road,” an official said.

Nearly 6,000 people use the Alandur Metro station on a daily basis and many need to cross the road. Right now, commuters must walk a fair distance till they find a crossing or use a subway, which is far from the station.

The station was opened in 2015 but the construction of the facility was delayed because CMRL’s call for tenders initially evoked no response. The contract was given to a firm only in January 2018. It has taken almost two years to finish the construction of this bridge.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9p147t/article30730536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THALANDUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/alandur-overbridge-to-open-finally/article30730537.ece

396,2020/02/04,Centre defends new procedure for appointment of Puducherry SEC,"Additional Solicitor-General G. Rajagopalan on Monday told the Madras High Court that the Centre had decided to follow a fair and transparent procedure for appointment of State Election Commissioner (SEC) in Puducherry only because it did not want the SEC to act as a “stooge” of the State government in the Union Territory and instead discharge his or her Constitutional functions without fear or favour.

Appearing before Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, who were seized of a writ plea filed by Local Administration Minister A. Namassivayam, Mr. Rajagopalan clarified that it was not Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi but the Centre which had constituted a committee headed by the Chief Secretary of the union territory to select the SEC after calling for applications from candidates across the country.

“First of all, whether he (the Minister) can file a writ petition is questionable. How is he aggrieved by the decision? The impugned order is a directive by the Centre to the State government to follow a transparent procedure. The Chief Secretary is not aggrieved by this order. Why has the Minister come to court? It shows he only wants to scuttle the appointment in a transparent manner,” the ASG said.

Apart from questioning the locus standi of the Minister, the ASG wondered, how anyone could have a grievance on the insistence by the Centre to follow a transparent procedure in appointment to a Constitutional office. When the senior judge in the Bench wanted to know whether the appointment to be made through all-India selection would have to go through the Council of Ministers, he replied in the affirmative.

Laid down procedures

Mr. Rajagopalan stated that as per procedures, the Council of Ministers would forward the final name to the L-G who, in turn, would issue the appointment order.

Though the judges insisted that the submission should be put in writing before the court, the ASG said it was not necessary for it since it goes without saying that any selection would pass through the Council of Ministers and finally reach the L-G.

Further, referring to the provisions of the General Clauses Act, the law officer said, it was the Centre which must be construed as the State government in so far as a Union Territory was concerned and therefore the Centre’s decision was binding upon the Council of Ministers. “Otherwise, they will only select their own person and appoint him as the State Election Commissioner without following a transparent process,” he added.

Later, observing that Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad had reserved their verdict on a much larger issue relating to the powers of the L-G compared to that of the elected government in Puducherry, the judges said only that judgment would give a clarity on issues in which the L-G could act independently and matters in which she could act only with aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

In the present case, though the petitioner had claimed that the Council of Ministers had reportedly appointed a retired Indian Administrative Service officer T.M. Balakrishnan as the SEC that executive order had not been issued by the L-G as required under the law and it had been succeeded by the Centre’s decision to bring in a new procedure for appointment of SEC, the judges pointed out.

“It (executive order) only says By Order. It does not state that it has been issued by the order of the Administrator (a term used in the Constitution to refer to the Lieutenant Governor),” Justice Sathyanarayanan said and adjourned the case to February 10.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/centre-defends-new-procedure-for-appointment-of-puducherry-sec/article30730492.ece
397,2020/02/04,BPCL ties up with Kinetic for an e-Drive,"The Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) on Monday launched e-Drive technology to power electric autorickshaws in Lucknow and Kochi. Soon, seven more cities will be covered.

Introducing the technology through video conferencing in Chennai, BPCL chairman and managing director D. Rajkumar said the technology, launched in association with Kinetic Green Energy and Power Solutions Limited and IIT Madras, would make electric vehicles affordable for the common man.

“Initially, the e-Drive project is based on the capex model where the vehicle would be owned by Kinetic Green Energy with the lithium ion battery supplied by BPCL. The battery technology support is being provided by IIT Madras,” he said.

Sulajja Firodia Motwani, Founder and CEO, Kinetic Green Energy, said that the e-Drive technology is a concept project for operating electric autorickshaws to provide last mile connectivity in the Metro stations in the two cities by charging as low as ₹10.

Ms. Motwani said normally an electric auto would be costing ₹2.80 lakh because of the high cost of the battery and if the battery cost is not included the cost would come to around ₹1.40 lakh. So by partnering with the BPCL, which has more than 12,000 petrol bunks, the electric autos would be able to swap the batteries at the petrol outlets within a few minutes by paying a “nominal” amount for charging the batteries. The electric autos would have a range of 50-60 km per charge of two lithium ion batteries.

The BPCL plans to roll out the e-Drive technology in seven more cities in the coming months. IIT-M Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala participated.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2st1f4/article30730476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THE-DRIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bpcl-ties-up-with-kinetic-for-an-e-drive/article30730477.ece
398,2020/02/04,Parts of south T.N. may receive light rain,"Some places in south coastal Tamil Nadu may get a break from dry weather conditions and receive light rain over the next two days. In other parts of the State, nights are likely to be warm and the day temperature may be slightly above normal for February, according to meteorological department.

The presence of an easterly trough is likely to bring light rain in south coastal parts of the State, including Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Kanyakumari, officials added.

Though it is winter officially till the month-end, nights are warm in places such as Chennai and days are slightly hotter than usual. On Monday, weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded a day temperature of 30.6 degree Celsius and 31 degree Celsius, one degree Celsius above normal.

N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said normally, a northeasterly wind prevails during this season. This year, however, strong easterly winds are blowing even in interior areas. There is a greater south easterly component in the winds this time.

This is expected to keep the night temperature slightly warmer than usual for some days. “We consider it as above average only if the minimum temperature goes up by three degree Celsius than the normal for the month. Chennai continues to experience normal temperature at night,” he said.

Residents may feel the impact of warm weather, particularly when they are outdoors, as there is direct sunlight and a lack of cloud cover, he added.

The Meteorological department has forecast that the maximum and minimum temperatures in Chennai will be around 32 and 23 degree Celsius respectively till Wednesday.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/parts-of-south-tn-may-receive-light-rain/article30730470.ece
399,2020/02/04,Chidambaram likens Budget to box office flop,"Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said the Union Budget was like a movie which bombed after the first show, as it did not address the key challenges faced by the economy and did not take steps to stimulate demand by putting more money in the hands of poor people.

Speaking at a session organised by Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he hoped that the government would make some adjustment in the Budget after a debate in Parliament.

“After 160 minutes of Finance Minister’s Budget speech, there was no narrative in the Budget. The government is still in the denial mode about the challenges faced by the economy,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

The former Union Minister began by saying that he would speak for 160 minutes taking cues from the Finance Minister, much to the delight of the audience.

He said the two key challenges for the economy was people were not buying (demand constrained) and both domestic and foreign investors were not making investments. The obvious solution to address the challenges were to increase government spending on schemes which would have directly put money in the hands of the poor who would have started spending on goods and services.

Mr. Chidambaram said the government could have deferred or slashed expenditure that had a long gestation period like the river cleaning project or building 100 more airports under Udan scheme and instead increased allocations for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme and PM Kisan scheme.

“The FM could have allocated ₹1 lakh crore to MGNREGA and told the States to pay the arrears. Instead the allocation has been ₹71,000 crore for 2019-2020 in the revised Budget estimate and cut to ₹61,500 crore for 2020-21,” he said.

Mr. Chidambaram said similarly PM Kisan was a reasonably good scheme where ₹6,000 was given to farmers every year.

“Either the amount given should have been increased to ₹12,000 or its scope should have been extended to cover tenant farmers. Out of the earlier budgeted amount of ₹75,000 crore under PM Kisan, the government would spend ₹54,000 crore in 2019-2020. The next year allocation was again ₹75,000 crore,” he said.

On the domestic and foreign investments not taking place, Mr. Chidambaram said one of the steps was tax incentives. The other one was through trust and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used to say that investment was an act of faith, he added. Mr. Chidambaram pointed out that there was a breakdown of trust between the government and the investor as the government had empowered enforcement agencies with all powers, including attaching and selling property even before the trial was over.

“The government now talks about the charter of rights for taxpayers. First, it should take back the rights given to the officers,” he added.Mr. Chidambaram said he was okay with the government selling stakes in public sector firms.

However, on the announcement on plans to sell partial stake in LIC, he said his party was yet to take a stand. “We will ask them the reasons for selling stake in LIC. If there are no good reasons and just to raise money, we will oppose it,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/itamyq/article30730464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THTNCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chidambaram-likens-budget-to-box-office-flop/article30730465.ece

401,2020/02/04,TNPSC scam: Group-IIA Services scripts too were tampered with in moving vehicles,"The answer scripts of at least 42 candidates, who cleared Group-IIA Services examination conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) in 2017 and got into government service, were tampered with in moving vehicles.

Crime Branch CID sources on Monday told The Hindu that S. Jayakumar of Chennai, the prime suspect in the Group-IV Services scam, played a key role in the Group-IIA Services examination 2017 scam too.

Unlike the evaporative ink used in Group IV exam, the racketeers back then wrote the answers for the candidates. “The answer scripts were tampered with in moving vehicles when they were transported from Sivaganga to Chennai. The candidates who paid huge money to Jayakumar were told to opt for the Rameswaram centre where they were told to attempt questions only if they knew the answer. Answers for questions not attempted were marked by the suspects later,” a CB-CID officer said.

“In one case, a woman candidate marked two answers in blue ink, while Jayakumar marked dozens of other questions in black ink. The woman who got into government service was arrested a couple of days ago,” the officer said.

Tracking the suspect

Special teams were following certain clues to locate Jayakumar. Besides alerting domestic airports and major railway stations, police were tracking his digital footprints. He also had close links with some Education Department officials.

“Analysis of storage devices and mobile phones seized from middlemen associated with him will provide more information on his activities in the recent past. We have asked bank officials to freeze his account,” the officer said. The possibility of Jayakumar leaving the country was ruled out since there was no record of him possessing a passport.

402,2020/02/04,"Finance Commission throws T.N. a ₹4,025-crore lifeline","The State government’s sustained campaign for higher-than-normal allocation of funds from the Centre appears to have met with moderate success, as the 15th Finance Commission has recommended a post-devolution revenue deficit grant of ₹4,025 crore for Tamil Nadu.

This amount has been worked out by the panel for the the year 2020-21 after taking the Central devolution of funds into account.

Another positive feature of the Finance Commission’s recommendations is that the State’s inter-se share in the divisible pool of Central taxes has gone up from 4.023% (allotted by the 14th Finance Commission) to 4.189%. Tamil Nadu is the only southern State that has not suffered adversely in devolution. However, this figure is still less than what the State got from the 13th Finance Commission - 4.969%. Though the Centre has accepted the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendations “in substantial measure”, it is not clear whether all the States that have been recommended for the grant will receive their respective allotment during 2020-21, as the Budget Estimates of the Union government have provided only ₹30,000 crore against the required amount of ₹74,340 crore, as worked out by the Commission. This is why Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who is also Finance Minister, in a statement issued on Sunday, said the State might get ₹1,600 crore (initially).

At the same time, the State government is not oblivious to the weak spots that have been pointed out by the Finance Commission. For instance, in respect of the per capita average Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), the State is ahead of Andhra Pradesh in ranking. The average figures have been calculated after considering the performance of States during 2015-16 to 2017-18. But, eventually, while arriving at inter-se shares of the States for the parameter of income distance, Tamil Nadu’s figure - 2.07% - is lower than that of the neighbouring State (3.203%). This only means that during the given years, Andhra Pradesh’s growth rate of GSDP was better than Tamil Nadu’s.

The findings of the Finance Commission may form part of the deliberations of the State Cabinet during the scheduled meeting at the Secretariat on Tuesday. The meeting is expected to provide its formal approval for the preparation of the State Budget, which may be presented in a month.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tpuyp0/article30522607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/finance-commission-throws-tn-a-4025-crore-lifeline/article30730448.ece
403,2020/02/04,Perarivalan seeks action against Raj Bhavan PIO for delaying info,"A.G. Perarivalan, a life convict in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has moved the Tamil Nadu Information Commission seeking disciplinary action against the Public Information Officer (PIO) of Raj Bhavan and imposition of penalty for “deliberately” not furnishing information sought under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

In December 2015, he wrote to the Governor appealing for remission of sentence under Article 161 of the Constitution. Since there was no response, he filed a petition under the RTI Act seeking to know the action taken on his application.

He sought copies of the day-to-day progress, the complete file along with the noting, correspondence with other departments, officials who handled the file, etc in a flow chart format. In the meantime, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet passed a resolution recommending the release of all seven convicts in the case.

On December 12, 2019, Perarivalan received a reply from the Under Secretary/PIO, Raj Bhavan, stating: “I am to inform that the matter is under process.” Pointing out that the reply was “vague, ambiguous, incomplete and misleading”, he said the information should have been disclosed proactively under Section 4(1)(b)(v) of the RTI Act. But the PIO’s reply was “evasive”.

Perarivalan said: “The reply merely states that my application is under process, which even I know very well…the whole purpose of making a RTI request is because my application is pending for about four years, while other similar applications for remission are processed and decided.”

In his appeal to the Commission, he said it was the duty of the CPIO to provide clear, cogent and precise response to information seekers. The CPIO should communicate the reasons for the rejection of information sought, he said.

While the President’s Secretariat and Governors’ Secretariat of various States were displaying information on RTI Act petitions on their respective websites, he was “forced” to seek information by way of a petition, since there was no such display of information on the official website of the Tamil Nadu Governor.

He appealed to the Commission to direct the public authority to pay a compensation of ₹ 1 lakh under Section 18(b) of the Act for the “loss and mental agony” suffered by him and his aged parents. He also demanded disciplinary action against the PIO and levy of ₹ 250 per day (from the date of RTI petition) as penalty. Acting on an earlier similar appeal, the Central Information Commission in February forwarded his petition to the TNIC for “necessary action”.

Last week, the Supreme Court directed the State government to file a report on the status of his mercy petition after expressing displeasure over the lack of progress made by the CBI on the aspect of whether Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination was the culmination of a “larger conspiracy”.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cjeli9/article30730438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04PERARIVALAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/perarivalan-seeks-action-against-raj-bhavan-pio-for-delaying-info/article30730439.ece
404,2020/02/04,Corpn. begins screening staff for communicable diseases,"The Chennai Corporation has started screening 28,932 employees for communicable diseases and mental illness.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash launched the medical camp on Driver Street, Ward no. 61, in Egmore on Monday.

Medical camps will be organised across the city for the civic employees from February 3 to 28. “The camps will be organised from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. This is a measure to prevent communicable diseases in the city. The Corporation employees have been interacting with the residents in all the 200 wards. Screening the Corporation employees is crucial to prevention of communicable diseases in the city,” said an official.

The employees to be screened by the medical teams include conservancy workers, malaria control workers, road workers, electrical workers and Amma Canteen staff.

Former Chennai Corporation Council floor leader V. Sukumar Babu said most of the conservancy workers and malaria control workers were prone to communicable diseases as they had to clean polluted stormwater drains and garbage bins without proper equipment, leading to a number of ailments within a few years of joining duty.

Most of them are unable to work after 50 years of age. All the conservancy workers need medical assistance and counselling. “Malaria control workers who clean stormwater drains are affected because of illegal sewage connections. Communicable diseases are high among the workers. The Corporation should treat them in a good hospital. Many employees are very weak, unable to even move a tricycle,” said Mr. Babu.

Alcoholism rampant

Alcholism is another challenge among more than 50% of the conservancy and sanitary workers. According to estimates in the past few years, more than 20% of the conservancy workers have also have reported mental illness. The Corporation is studying the reasons. It has set up rehabilitation centres in the past few years to help employees affected by alcoholism. But the centres have not been maintained properly, sources said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mq6ouj/article30730402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THWORKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-begins-screening-staff-for-communicable-diseases/article30730404.ece

The security personnel in small parks would have to carry out other works relating to the maintenance of the parks, using equipment provided for the purpose.

Larger parks such as Anna Nagar Tower Park, Thiru-Vi-Ka Park, Panagal Park and Murasoli Maran Park will have additional personnel to maintain the facility. The contractors will provide the workers with all equipment for park maintenance.

Residents have been requested to complain about maintenance of the parks to the Corporation helpline 1913, to the zonal officials or the park supervisors concerned.

All parks should have a shed for a watchman. The employees should install a signboard showing the park’s timings. “White mealy bugs are a major problem in parks in the city. The personnel should also monitor such problems,” said an official.

“Plants in parks should be trimmed reqularly. Dry plants should be replaced immmediately. Residents are requested to report such issues to Corporation officials.

408,2020/02/04,Towards cooperative federalism,"As of January 28, the Chief Ministers of at least 11 States have expressed their unwillingness to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Two of these States, West Bengal and Kerala, have stayed all work on the National Population Register (NPR), which is the foundational register from which the NRC will be built. Furthermore, the Punjab Legislative Assembly passed a resolution seeking amendments to the NPR form to ensure that it does not seek data that may be used for verification of citizenship.

The NRC’s human cost

The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, provide for the process by which taluk level officers will prepare a National Register of Indian Citizens after filtering Indian citizens from the NPR — a register enumerating all residents in the country, by family. The process is arduous and ridden with wide discretion. It involves, after the enumeration, procedures for citizenship verification and scrutiny, objections and appeals. Officers may identify citizens and even whole families as “doubtful” without any just cause and demand evidence of their citizenship. The rules also permit any person to object to the inclusion of a name in the draft register. This is not a case of weaponising citizenship; it is weaponising citizens against one another. The human cost of such an exercise will be immeasurable.

Constitutional governance

State governments have sufficient grounds to be concerned about the validity of the NPR. However, they are not empowered to hold the Union down to its obligations under the Constitution. The drafters of the Constitution were more anxious to give the Union Government the power to bring errant States in line with the Constitution. For example, Article 355 enjoins the Union to “... ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution”. Acting under its fiduciary duty towards the Constitution and the people of the State, the Union may also temporarily, and for restoring constitutional governance in a State, declare President’s rule in the State under Article 356.

No equivalent power rests in the hands of States to hold the Union Government to the Constitution. When State governments raised concerns about the NPR, the Union insisted that States are under a constitutional duty to implement laws passed by Parliament — a position that a superficial reading of the Constitution may support. A duty to obey all laws passed by Parliament is premised on an unbridled deference to the Union Government to correctly understand and implement the Constitution while passing laws. However, nowhere in the Constitution is there any suggestion that the Union has the final say as to what is “constitutional”.

Government is a human enterprise. It is wholly possible that a government may work the Constitution impermissibly, which Dr. B.R. Ambedkar reckoned with in saying “however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it happen to be a bad lot”. One safeguard against bad actors lies in the oath. All constitutional actors — State and Union legislators, State and Union governments and judges in the higher judiciary — are duty-bound to “bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India” by way of their oath.

The oath of constitutional functionaries of States is to be understood in light of Article 1 of the Constitution, which locates India’s identity as a “Union of States”. Therefore, States, and by extension their legislatures and governments, are indispensable to working the Constitution of India. As the Supreme Court of India recognised in the landmark S.R. Bommai judgment, States are not mere “appendages” of the Centre. After all, what sets Union Territories apart from States is the exclusive and distinct legislative and administrative competences of the States, to be acted on through their three organs of government. Thus, they cannot be reduced to mere administrative agencies entrusted with enforcing Parliament’s laws without any application of mind.

Among the exclusively delineated areas of legislative and executive competence of States is the power and responsibility of public order and police. The NPR-NRC exercise is likely to place an undue burden on every single citizen of India. Compelling the most marginalised Indians to prove their citizenship under an arbitrary and obscure process is likely to cause widespread challenges to law and order. The Union, in compelling States to implement the NPR by ignoring the widespread dissent against it will be interfering with these exclusive powers of States. States, therefore, are entitled to more deference than mere reminders of their duty to obey Central laws.

Restricting cooperation

This is not to say that States have a “right to defy” the Union. The Constitution bars States from “impeding” the Union’s work and rightly requires them to comply with central laws. However, constitutional functionaries in States cannot be compelled to defy their oaths and enforce laws that are contrary to their good faith interpretation of the Constitution.

In abiding by their oaths, States may require the Union to find a constitutional way to fulfil its purported objective, by withholding cooperation in a federal scheme. New institutional norms can play an important role on this front. India is not the first democracy that has seen States restrict cooperation to the federal government on contentious issues.

In the United States, States and cities have limited their cooperation on federal anti-immigration policies and anti-gun ownership legislation. In contrast, there are also examples of countries that have strengthened federalism by actively including the provinces or states in national policy. For example, immigration laws in Australia and Canada empower provinces to nominate immigrants seeking to settle within their territory.

In these examples, there is a lesson for India. The Union government can include States in how decisions are made and enforced, or it can depend on archaic emergency provisions to enforce its will. Not every disagreement between States and the Union is the same, and the Union must develop newer conventions to foster cooperation.

409,2020/02/04,No Budget boost,"Indian masses, facing high inflation as well as alarming unemployment rates, had pinned high hopes on the Budget, but the annual exercise has let them down. Going through the Budget, one would not get the slightest sense of what the government plans to do to control unemployment. The Finance Minister also did not announce any rise in allocation to the two big flagship schemes — the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and PM-KISAN — that have the potential to boost rural incomes. The MGNREGS, in fact, saw a 13% drop in allocation when compared to the Revised Estimates. The impact of personal tax rate revision may be limited, given the withdrawal of exemptions. Besides, a small percentage of the taxpaying population is unlikely to make a serious enough dent on the fortunes of the entire economy. Revised fiscal deficit in the current year is 3.8% of GDP and the Budget estimate for 2020-21 is 3.5%. If a fiscal deficit of 3.8% could not prevent the economy from slowing down, reducing it will only aggravate the slowdown. To sum up, there was no measure to create wealth in the Budget, nor was there anything to generate an atmosphere of trust.

410,2020/02/04,Drones to tackle locusts,"Prescribing a thumb rule to delegitimise the use of drones for spraying chemicals could be counterproductive (“Crop dusting with drones is illegal, says Centre,” Feb. 1). Instead, decisions should be taken on a case-to-case basis, depending on factors like the scale and magnitude of the menace and the lack of availability of effective alternative solutions. Very recently, to combat the invasion of locusts, ultra high-tech drones were used over large tracts in Sri Ganganagar District of Rajasthan, which wiped out about six lakh insects at one go. Every other measure had fallen flat and failed to put a check on their rapidly expanding geographical coverage.

411,2020/02/04,Saving the Constitution,"It was heart-warming to hear Parliament reverberate with chants of “Save India, Save the Constitution” when ‘star speakers’ Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma spoke. Courtesy the BJP, the phrase goli maaro has made it to the Indian political lexicon, though what is patriotic or valorous about ‘shooting down’ compatriots in the name of religion defies understanding. It is gladdening that the tenacious anti-CAA protesters have elicited a response from Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad that the government is ready for talks with the protesters. Still, noises made by desperate hardliners in the Sangh Parivar illuminate their hostility towards the protesters. Prakash Javadekar has called Arvind Kejriwal a ‘terrorist’, just like Parvesh Verma did earlier. The use of symbols like the national flag, photos of Mahatma Gandhi and the recitation of the Preamble to the Constitution by the protesters have thwarted the BJP’s attempts to brand them as ‘anti-nationals’. The BJP is showing a pusillanimous reluctance to fight the Delhi election on real issues. Hate speeches by its members are also exposing the true face of Hindutva.

412,2020/02/04,Spirit of Shaheen Bagh,"What started off as peaceful protests at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, mostly by women, are now being used as a tool by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to consolidate the majority community’s vote. Moreover, children are needlessly getting dragged into the issue. Hence, it could be in the protesters’ interests to halt the demonstrations for now (Op-Ed page, “It’s time for the Shaheen Bagh protests to end,” Feb. 3). It is to be noted that had the Supreme Court ordered a stay on the CAA, the protests would have ended by now.

N. Nagarajan,

Secunderabad

It is the right time for the organisers of Shaheen Bagh protests to call them off forthwith as the time factor is defeating its very purpose. The prolonged blocking of roads, instead of gaining more sympathisers, could be infusing more hostility among the local population. Any protest movement should be a time-bound one and it loses its appeal if it gets stretched beyond a limited time. The historic movement has served its purpose by drawing attention at national as well as international levels. But it is unfortunately now also serving the cause of the BJP.

A.G. Rajmohan,

Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh

It would be a mistake to conflate Shaheen Bagh protests with the Delhi election. The valiant women at Shaheen Bagh never picketed with any election in their mind. Their sole objective was to display a rejection of the discriminatory CAA-NRC mechanism. They left their homes in national interest to defend India’s cherished Constitution, with bare and limited resources. Wrapping up the protests at this juncture would only serve the goals of communal elements and show that their threats and intimidation tactics have been successful. It would also create an adverse ripple effect as more than 75 sit-ins across the country have taken inspiration from the movement. True, the protests have caused some inconvenience to the common public. But when democracy is under maintenance, temporary discomfort is not just acceptable, it could also be desirable.

Mohammad Shah Fahad,

Patna

Union Minister Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad struck the right note when he declared that the government is ready to talk to protesters at Shaheen Bagh. Vitriolic rhetoric from BJP leaders has directly incited violence as lone-wolf attackers are now targeting peaceful protesters. The Centre’s very despicable tendency to label anti-CAA protesters as ‘anti-nationals’ and crushing dissent through force does not augur well for a country like us which stands proud among the comity of nations owing to its vibrant democratic framework. It is time the BJP government acknowledges and respects peaceful protests against CAA as an expression of dissent and initiates dialogue with protesters to address their legitimate apprehensions without any delay.

413,2020/02/04,Selling stakes in LIC,"The Budget had but one item of note, the government’s intention to sell its stakes in LIC. This is a step that marks in purple the complete surrender of this government to the challenges of reviving a neglected economy. The tax revisions were as bad. They would encourage the newly employed youth to spend more while dismaying the middle-aged, whose thrift is not only getting ignored but now being frowned upon. The handsome household savings that wrote the growth story in the 1990s will no longer play an active role in an already moribund economy.

414,2020/02/04,Neglect of social sector,"With the social sector being neglected in this year’s Budget as well, a revival of the economy is a far cry. The core sectors of education, healthcare, nutrition and rural employment are being ignored in Budgets year after year to such an extent that it can now be said beyond a reasonable doubt the government functions not for the vast majority of the population but for a select few in the corporate sector. The emptiness of the marathon Budget speech was tangible. The people of the great country are suffering due to lack of sufficient economic vision and, in the meantime, the ruling party is subjecting them to worthless exercises like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

G.B. Sivanandam,

Coimbatore

The Budget allocations for MGNREGA and other social sector schemes indicate that the government is still in denial about the fact that the falling consumption demand in rural areas is one of the serious problems facing the economy. While demonetisation had almost crippled the rural economy, the inadequate or meagre budgetary allocations for the social sector schemes that directly impact the lives of the rural masses in the subsequent years have made things worse. The Finance Minister’s claim that the Budget is for “building a caring society” is not borne out by the budgetary allocations. There has been a clamour from many economists of repute to implement measures to improve the incomes of the rural masses to boost the consumption demand. But, inexplicably, the Finance Minister has ignored this sagacious advice. Further, the increase in allocations for the crucial sectors such as health and education would be inadequate to bring about even marginal improvements in the healthcare and educational facilities, the shortage of which has been the bane of rural India.

415,2020/02/04,Actor Anu Hasan forays into digital streaming with a cookery show,"When she was barely nine years old, Anu Hasan’s first culinary triumph was a vegetable pulao, made from scratch, in her beloved “Rukmini” cooker. She still fosters the vivid image of the coconut tree in her backyard, under the shade of which her experiments took form on a brick stove. Her relationship with food goes a long way. And, it is not surprising that the actor’s penchant for cooking still holds strong and can now be streamed digitally. Her long time collaboration with the publication JFW (Just For Women) is now seeping into the digital milieu, with a cookery series titled Get Set Cook by Anu Hasan, that can be streamed online from today.

“Cooking, for some people is an art and for others, is a science. Whatever it may be, for everyone, it should be a joy. There is no point in fussing about perfection. It’s all about instincts. In that sense, there are life lessons hidden in the act of cooking,” says Anu adding that the parallel cooking draws with life is something that she will discuss in the show.

The 12-episodes-long Tamil series takes on a light-hearted approach to food, peppered with funny anecdotes and memories from Anu’s life. Her signature style of introducing subtle humour stands as the highlight.

The recipes, curated by the JFW team, scream simple and relatable. “Chef Ram Kumar and JFW decided on the recipes. Since it’s digital streaming, we had to keep the processes crisp and fast. The USP is the fact that we make it a joyous process for the audiences,” continues Anu. After having filmed, she feels that there are two types of distinct audiences who might find the show interesting — those who think that cooking is difficult and end up realising it is not; and those who like her style of presentation.

Mutton chukka, prawn Malabar curry and different kinds of milkshakes are some of the dishes Anu takes the audience through. “I believe that we don’t have the patience or the time to do complex recipes anymore. Which is why, they also appeal to younger audiences, who want an easy fix,” Anu says. The fact that it is available in a digital platform also gives the audience the leeway to take the recipes at their own time and pace.

Get Set Cook by Anu Hasan will be launched on February 5, on JFW’s YouTube Channel.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/g9gz6r/article30733737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05mpanuhasanJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/actor-anu-hasan-forays-into-digital-streaming-with-a-cookery-show/article30733738.ece
416,2020/02/04,Save those cake crumbs,"The fragrance of vanilla envelopes the kitchen at Sudhaa Iyengaar Bakery in Ramanathapuram. “It’s the cakes in the oven,” laughs Nagaraj R, the proprietor.

After 10 minutes, the cakes are brought out, warm with a brown crust, and cut into the desired shapes. This leaves behind a bunch of crumbs when the crust is removed. While the cakes are frosted, the trimmings are collected in a basket. Nagaraj says these are then packed and sold. “It is popularly known as cake thool or podi,” he says.

Nagaraj has been selling cake crumbs for the last 20 years. “We received requests from parents of young children,” he says. “They found that their children could not manage the full pieces and this was an easy and cheap treat.” Now he sells a 150gm packet for ₹10. “It has assorted flavours including vanilla, chocolate, pineapple and orange,” he says. The number of packets depends on the number of cakes made that day, though “we even get pre-orders for the packets. The demand is high and we sell only a maximum of two packets to one customer. If you want to buy it, you have to come here by 4:00 pm. It vanishes off the shelf in two hours,” he says.

The crumbs taste like the original cake, but the texture is coarser. Sophy Mathew, a home maker from Saibaba Colony has been buying cake thool from Kovai KRS Bakery, RS Puram for 25 years. “My kids loved snacking on them when they were young. I also add it in my puddings,” she says. Kovai KRS Bakery has been selling these crumbs from 1960 and the propreitor Naresh Kumar says, “Back then, cakes were considered a delicacy that only the rich could afford. My grandfather, K Rangasamy, wanted to give everyone a taste of it and started to sell crumbs.” Kovai KRS Bakery sells crumbs in two flavours: vanilla and chocolate and a packet of 300 gm costs ₹20. Naresh also uses the crumbs to make cake pops and puddings according to order.

Why they do it Selling crumbs prevents wastage

Many bakers repurpose the crumbs by using them in cake pops and puddings

At JM Bakery, Avinashi Road, salesperson Mahalincam says that people “love to add it to icecream and fruit salad.” The bakery does not have crumbs of individual flavours. “It is a packet of assorted crumbs, which will have bits from different flavoured cakes baked on that day. Usually, it has pista, pineapple, strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. We stock up as we get cake orders and are sold out by the end of the day,” he says. A 500 gm packet costs ₹35. “My kids love it.

417,2020/02/04,Thackeray calls bullet train project a white elephant,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on February 4 likened the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project to a “white elephant”, saying a decision on it would be taken after he was convinced it would boost industrial development in the State.

In the second part of his interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Mr. Thackeray said the State, currently ruled by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance comprising the Sena, NCP and Congress, was not getting its “rightful share” of central funds which could be utilised for helping farmers.

The Sena president also said the farm loan waiver scheme announced by his government will be rolled out from next month, and assured readers that not a single industry will be allowed to move out of the State.

Bullet train project

Referring to the Centre’s ambitious bullet train project, which has faced stiff opposition from farmers and tribals whose lands were to be acquired, Mr. Thackeray said there should be a comprehensive discussion on its viability.

“Who will benefit from the bullet train? How will trade and industry in Maharashtra get a boost because of it? If it is useful? Convince me and then let’s go before people and decide what to do,” the Chief Minister said.

“The bullet train may be a dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but when you wake up, it is not a dream, you have to face the reality,” he said.

Developmental projects need to be prioritised considering the State’s financial situation, Mr. Thackeray said in the interview to Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut.

“We have to see what is urgent and not take up something because we are getting loan at zero interest or less interest. We acquire farmers’ land for no reason and then look after these white elephants. This is not right,” he said.

Notably, the Narendra Modi government has set the deadline of completing the bullet train project by August 15, 2022, when India marks 75 years of Independence.

The introduction of the first bullet train, which is known as the Shinkansen in Japan, is expected to mark India’s shift to an era of high-speed trains capable of hitting speeds of up to 350 km per hour.

Of the 508.17-km-long bullet train corridor, 155.76 km will be in Maharashtra, 348.04 km in Gujarat and 4.3 km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Mr. Thackeray said his government was in the process of reviewing the economic situation of Maharashtra.

“The work is almost complete. Once it is over, we will place it before people. Let them know how the State functioned earlier,” he said.

Meeting with ‘industry captains’

To a question, the Chief Minister said he recently met industry captains in Mumbai and assured them that their grievances would be addressed.

“I will not allow a single industry to move out of the State. Maximum locals should benefit in terms of employment from these industries,” he added.

The Chief Minister further said the State was not getting its “rightful share” of central funds.

“In December last year, I wrote to the Centre that ₹15,000 crore was pending, including the GST refund. Last month, we got around ₹4,500 crore. Now, again the pending amount will increase. Will the Opposition take out a morcha for this?” he asked.

Delay in getting central funds

“I will not say whether the central funds are deliberately delayed or not. But there is a delay due to which State schemes are delayed,” he said.

If the central funds are received on time, the State government can utilise them for farmers, Mr. Thackeray said.

He also said the farm loan waiver scheme announced by his government in December last year will be launched next month and debts up to ₹2 lakh will be waived.

“A separate scheme for loans of more than ₹2 lakh and for those who regularly repay their loan will be announced soon,” he said.

Loan waiver is a primary step to ease hardships of farmers, he said, adding that priority was to ensure cultivators are economically empowered.

“Efforts will be made to work on maximum crop (cultivation) in less space, adequate price for the crops and good marketing,” he added.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/egpfhk/article30734583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UDDHAVTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/thackeray-calls-bullet-train-project-a-white-elephant/article30734584.ece
418,2020/02/04,Coronavirus testing facility likely at Mumbai hospital,"The Maharashtra government is mulling to set up a coronavirus testing facility at Kasturba Hospital here to reduce the burden on Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) which is currently handling such samples from across the country, an official said on Tuesday.

An additional testing facility at the civic-run hospital here will help in getting faster results, the senior State health official said.

“The plan is being discussed to share some load of NIV. The institute is getting swab samples from across the country for testing of novel coronavirus infection. If a similar testing facility is set up in Mumbai, it will minimise the waiting period,” she said.

More and more samples are being received for testing at NIV, hence it is better to set up an additional examination facility in Mumbai at the earliest, the official said.

“Health officials have communicated their views to higher authorities about setting up a coronavirus testing facility in Mumbai. We will come to know about it in the coming days,” she added.

As of now, six patients have been kept in observation wards at various hospitals in the State. Of these, four are in Pune, and one each in Mumbai and Sangli district, another official said on Monday.

Since January 18, State health officials have screened 8,878 passengers at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport for the coronavirus infection, he said.

No confirmed case of the deadly virus, which has killed 425 people in China till now, has been detected yet in Maharashtra.

The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory problems like cough, shortness of breath and fever, according to the World Health Organisation.

The WHO has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a global health emergency.

The virus — which first emerged in Wuhan city in China’s central Hubei province — has spread to 25 countries, including India (three confirmed cases have been reported from Kerala), the U.S. and the U.K.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-testing-facility-likely-at-mumbai-hospital/article30734356.ece
419,2020/02/04,"Never dreamt of becoming CM, says Uddhav Thackeray","Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said assuming the top post in the State was never his dream or ambition, but when he realised that the promise made to his father could not be fulfilled by staying with the BJP, he decided to accept the responsibility.

In an interview to Sanjay Raut, the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Mr. Thackeray said Hindutva to him means honouring his word. Asked if he was an ‘accidental Chief Minister’, the Sena president said, “Maybe.”

On aligning with ideologically different parties like the NCP and Congress, Mr. Thackeray said such tie-ups were made earlier also, and asserted that the interest of the State and country was bigger than any ideology. “I was not new to political power as I have seen my father wield it since my childhood. What came unexpected was the chair of power (CM’s post),” he said.

The Sena snapped ties with BJP last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.

In the interview on Monday, Mr. Thackeray said the Sena chief never accepted the post of power and he also never wished for it. Asked if he had shocked people by accepting the post of Chief Minister of an unlikely coalition, Mr. Thackeray said, “political shocks are of many kinds”. “Promises made are supposed to be fulfilled. There is sadness and anger of breaking a promise and then I had no option. I don’t know if the BJP has recovered from the shock. What did I ask for … moon or stars? I just reminded them about what was agreed upon,” he said.

Asked about him contesting elections, Mr. Thackeray, who is not a member of either the Legislative Assembly or Council, said, “In the next two-three months, I will take a decision on contesting polls. I will never run away from my responsibilities.” Hinting that he may take the Council route, the CM said, “For (getting elected to) Assembly, somebody will have to resign. I will take the decision without hurting anyone.” He also said his government would work towards resolving the dispute of “Karnataka occupied Maharashtra”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4a7v5n/article30732124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/never-dreamt-of-becoming-cm-says-uddhav-thackeray/article30732125.ece
420,2020/02/04,HC dismisses sacked judge’s plea against State government order,"The Bombay High Court has dismissed the petition of a temporary judge, who was assigned cases pertaining to the multi-crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) scam, seeking that a Maharashtra government order terminating his services be quashed.

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.B. Suryawanshi dismissed the petition filed by judge Ajay Dinode challenging the order dated June 23, 2017, discharging him from service and “creating disqualification from future employment”. The Bench said the order was passed by the government after taking into consideration the overall performance, conduct and suitability of the petitioner for the job.

Mr. Dinode was appointed as a district judge on August 26, 2014, and was posted in Akola. He was transferred time and again before being conferred with the powers of an additional sessions judge in 2015. He was then appointed as special judge for speedy trial for the matters relating to the NSEL scam.

In his plea, Mr. Dinode said the appointing authority — the government — had mechanically followed the recommendations of the HC while discharging him from service. He claimed that since the termination order was stigmatic, it could not be sustained in absence of any inquiry conducted by the HC.

In its order passed on January 30, the Bench noted that Mr. Dinode’s appointment letter clearly said it was a temporary appointment that could be terminated without assigning any reason. It said Mr. Dinode was terminated from service when he was on probation.

The court also said that the government’s order was of simply terminating the petitioner’s services, and could not be termed as stigmatic or punitive. “We are of the view that the impugned order was passed taking into consideration the overall performance, conduct and the suitability of the petitioner for the job,” the Bench said.

While taking such a decision, neither notice is required to be given to the petitioner nor opportunity of being heard is required to be given, it said. “The termination cannot be termed as removal for any misconduct or on the ground of indiscipline,” the court said.

It said the government passed the order after the administrative committee of the HC had considered all relevant material and formed an opinion that Mr. Dinode was not suitable for the post.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/72danm/article30732111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BMHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-dismisses-sacked-judges-plea-against-state-government-order/article30732112.ece

Mr. Wadhawan, who was arrested in a money laundering case involving gangster Iqbal Mirchi, was produced before court after being discharged from hospital, where he was admitted following a fever.

Advocate Sunil Gonsalves, appearing for the ED, pleaded for an extension of custody by five days.

They said the DHFL promoter needed to be questioned in connection with several fictitious transactions.

The ED alleged that they found false entries in the book of accounts and the balance sheet also seemed manipulated. The court also asked the ED to reply to Mr. Wadhawan’s bail plea, which he had moved on Thursday before being taken to the hospital.

422,2020/02/04,CAA protests: women allege assault by police in Govandi,"A group of women who had gathered at Govandi to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) alleged that they were assaulted and illegally detained on Sunday night.

According to local residents, around 70 women gathered at a corner of the service road near the Shivaji Nagar signal around 8.30 p.m. to protest. Shortly thereafter, personnel from Shivaji Nagar and Deonar police stations reached the spot and allegedly surrounded them with their vehicles.

Dr. Pooja Chinchole, a protester, said they started shining their torches and speaking rudely to the women before female police personnel reached the scene. When the protesters started raising slogans, the police allegedly started roughing them up.

“Eight to nine policewomen caught hold of me and dragged me by my hair and hands into the police vehicle. When I tried raising slogans through the windows, they clamped a hand over my mouth and slapped me. Six of us, five women and a 12-year-old boy, were taken to the police station. One of the women is 65 years old,” she told The Hindu.

Dr. Chinchole said the police kept saying that the 12-year-old boy had come with them on his own even after the child, in front of everyone, said he had been brought by force. “We insisted that they call the boy’s guardians and the police said they would drop him home. While the boy was insisting they call his parents, they took him away. They then put us in a vehicle and started driving towards Vikhroli but they were blocked by around 1,500 people, after which they turned back. Senior officers had reached the scene by then,” she said.

‘False claims’

She said the five detainees were released soon after and the protesters decided to continue their agitation at Ambedkar Garden, as they had earlier got permission to do so. However, the police started telling everyone to leave, claiming permission had been granted for a protest on Tuesday.

“There is a separate rally by the Samajwadi Party and Hum Bharat Ke Log on Tuesday. Since we knew the police were lying, 15 of us stayed back. We were detained again and released a short while later. I have injured my kneecap. Another one of us, Ulfat Chaudhari, who only has one kidney, has a swollen leg and high fever,” Dr. Chinchole said, adding that all of the injured had undergone medical check-ups.

Additional Commissioner of Police (East) Lakhmi Gautam said there was no use of excessive force by the police. “Some people were trying to sit in at a public place on a busy road. They were not listening to us, and hence they were brought to the police station and released after a warning,” he said.

Mr. Gautam also denied claims of the 12-year-old boy being taken to the police station. “I have seen the pictures that were circulating and this is not true. There was no lathi charge and no arrests have been made. We also do not have any information about anyone being injured,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8l2ur1/article30730338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMMUMBRAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/caa-protests-women-allege-assault-by-police-in-govandi/article30730339.ece

The initiative, called ‘Bridge’, has started on a pilot basis and seeks to reduce the increasing student aid deficits of the institute through an established network with its alumni, and by bringing in more alumni not yet part of the network.

The institute has a student aid scheme, which provides financial assistance to ensure that lack of funds does not hamper the academic future of students. Professor Asha Banu, dean of student affairs at TISS, said Bridge was a students’ initiative under the office of student affairs. Prof. Banu and four TISS faculty members are part of the administrative team for Bridge, along with a group of students who will be appointed every year.

The initiative was first thought of in October 2017, when the issue surrounding the Central government post-matriculate scholarship (GoI-PMS) began hitting the students hard, triggering protests on campus.

Sayyed Manzar, one of the founding members of the project, said the delay in disbursal of scholarship led to a few of his friends skipping meals. “When we first thought about the idea, we initially spoke to a few alumni, who cited transparency as a major issue. So our main focus was that the process needs to be transparent and accountable,” Mr. Manzar said.

Alumni can contribute to the fund through an online gateway, which went live a few days ago. The proceeds will be collected and added to the student aid scheme of the institute. “We will be allotting 60% of the amount collected for immediate disbursal and 40% for a corpus, which will be disbursed in future. Everyone would be given a receipt for their contribution,” Mr. Manzar said.

He said they planned to provide quarterly reports to all alumni who have contributed to the initiative, with details of the amount collected, the percentage it formed of that year’s student aid, and the number of students who benefited from it.

Prof. P.K. Shajahan, who is a part of the faculty team and was the dean of student affairs at the time the protests broke out, said that during the discussions at the time, it was felt that students and the institute need to work together to bring the alumni into the picture.

Mr. Manzar said the team fully supported the protests and that Bridge could not be a replacement for GoI-PMS. “We are trying to ensure that current and future students who come from economically weaker sections can continue to study at TISS and the institute doesn’t turn into a space only for students from privileged backgrounds,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kjs5pl/article30730336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BMTISS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tiss-students-initiative-to-tap-into-alumni-network-for-aid/article30730337.ece
424,2020/02/04,"Coronavirus: 2 quarantined in Pune, Miraj","Two patients suspected to have been exposed to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) were quarantined in Pune and Miraj on Monday. In Mumbai, a 26-year-old woman with a travel history to Singapore, was placed under isolation but was later moved out after she tested positive for H1N1.

According to health officials, the Pune and Miraj patients, both with travel history to China, had developed fever and cold. Their samples have been sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology Pune.

On Monday, staff from the State Health Department was appointed to help Mumbai airport authorities as now travellers arriving from Thailand and Malaysia will also have to be screened, besides China and Hong Kong. People with travel history to Wuhan, the epicentre of the nCoV outbreak, will be quarantined for 14 days and their samples will be sent for testing, irrespective of them having any classic symptoms like fever, cold and nasal congestion.

425,2020/02/04,Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas train may get video coach,"The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) is planning to add a video coach on its Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas Express, which will screen movies during the train’s run. IRCTC is in talks with PVR Cinemas and is still exploring the feasibility of the initiative, sources said.

Senior railway officials said they were proposing a separate coach with a different pricing scheme, which will have collapsible screens on which the movies will be shown. “The modalities of this have to be worked out. We are proposing that we add an additional coach with fewer seats with more comfort and space. The coach could also be booked by one client,” a railway official said.

At present, the train runs with at least 10 air-conditioned coaches, which include chair cars and an executive class. “We have the flexibility to increase or decrease coaches as per the requirement. Last week, for instance, we had 11 coaches to meet the additional need. Depending on the bookings we can add the video coach,” the official said. The movie to be screened will be jointly decided by the cinema chain and IRCTC, and they will screen a maximum of two films.

The country’s second private passenger train had its first commercial run on January 17. According to officials from IRCTC, the train has had an occupancy rate of nearly 85% over the last 15 days.

Apart from this, IRCTC is looking at introducing automatic foot massaging facility for executive class passengers. The services can be availed for ₹100 or ₹50. “We are looking at providing additional services and newer areas to generate revenue, which will distinguish this train from the rest,” an IRCTC official said.

426,2020/02/04,CR sells less than 200 AC local tickets in two days,"The Central Railway (CR) continued to have teething issues with its Thane-Panvel AC local as it sold less than 200 tickets in the first two days. During the eight services on Monday morning, CR sold 62 tickets.

However, officials said it will take some time for the service to stabilise.

“Many passengers boarded the train and asked us to give them a ticket. However, there is no provision to do so,” an official said. Eleven commuters were caught and penalised for travelling without a ticket. However, officials said many more had travelled without tickets. “The focus at present is not to penalise but to counsel and make people aware,” a senior official said. CR had 12 ticket checkers on board the train and nearly 100 personnel of the Railway Protection Force to control the crowd at stations.

Sources said the CR also continued to have a few operational issues with the AC local leading to minor delays on trains that followed it. “The major issue is at Thane and Vashi. At Thane, there aren’t enough platforms so trains wait one behind the other. Any hold-up of the AC local has a cascading impact. In Vashi, the line merges with the Harbour Line and hence there is a capacity issue,” an official said. On its first commercial run on Friday, the services hit suburban operation as all passengers got on to the train and door closure became an issue.

A senior Western Railway official who oversaw the roll-out of the AC local said teething issues would continue for a couple of weeks if not more. “It took several months for our service to stabilise. However, it should be a little easier for CR since we also had several technical issues to deal with.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/45d5n3/article30730219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMCRACLOCAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cr-sells-less-than-200-ac-local-tickets-in-two-days/article30730220.ece
427,2020/02/04,State to look into phone tapping claims,"State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh has announced a two-member committee to look into complaints of alleged phone tapping in the run-up to the Assembly elections by the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.

The team will comprise additional chief secretary (Home Department) Shrikant Singh and Joint Commissioner in the State Intelligence Department Amitesh Kumar. The team will be given six weeks to complete its inquiry and submit a report. It may induct officers and technical specialists.

“The BJP-led government is accused of indulging in illegal phone tapping by my colleagues from the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena by misuse of the government machinery,” Mr. Deshmukh said. Keeping particular telephones under surveillance and using their authority to procure records like call data was “grossly misused”, especially over the past one year, “with the vested interest of making political gains,” he said. “This abuse of power has serious implications in respect of national security and the right to freedom and individual privacy as enshrined in the Constitution.”

Technical help

Mr. Deshmukh said, “The inquiry will not only cover the legal documentation, but also take support from technical experts to unravel the [digital] footprints [left behind] on servers of telecom companies through verification, and physical visits to decipher whether such unofficial surveillance was launched against leaders of the three political parties by the previous government.”

Asked if the inquiry would also include non-political players, such as bureaucrats and journalists, Mr. Deshmukh said, “This is phase one of the process that has been initiated. There is a lot more to follow.”

He said the inquiry seeks to establish the identity of officials who purportedly visited Israel at the instance of the government. “Who were these officials who went to Israel to procure software needed to carry out this specialised surveillance for securing political profits for the erstwhile government?”

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had last month rejected all allegations of such surveillance.

Meanwhile, Mr. Deshmukh said protesters who had gathered in Nagpada against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register had been asked to disband as they did not have police permission. “Home Department officials today met a 25-member delegation from the Mumbai agitation site. We informed them to wind up their protests. Their delegation promised to get back after deliberations with the organisers.”

FIR against protester

On alleged anti-national statements raised at a rally at Azad Maidan on Sunday by members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, the minister said an FIR had been lodged against a woman called Urvashi Chudawala and her associates. “Ms. Chudawala had entered the site of the rally with three to four associates and allegedly raised anti-India slogans. She was in no way connected to the LGBT community as per the organisers,” Mr. Deshmukh said.

Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said Ms. Chudawala had been charged with sedition, imputations or assertions prejudicial to national integration and statement conducing public mischief, under the Indian Penal Code.

428,2020/02/04,Ganesh Acharya files complaint against accuser,"Bollywood choreographer Ganesh Acharya has filed a complaint against the assistant choreographer who had accused him of harassment. The woman had filed a complaint with the Amboli police last month. She said she was assaulted by two women at Mr. Acharya’s behest at a club in Andheri. Ravi Suryawanshi, Mr. Acharya’s lawyer, said a written complaint seeking action for defamation has been submitted to the Oshiwara police, while a separate complaint against false allegations has been given to the Amboli police.

In a statement issued on Monday, Mr. Acharya said, “She was part of a group of dancers I worked with in 2007. Apart from that, I don’t know her at all. The accusations of assault in my presence and on my instructions are false, as I had left for a shoot before the altercation between her and the two others took place. In her alleged complaint, there was no mention of her cooked-up story of porn videos being shown to her. Her accusations are false and baseless.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ganesh-acharya-files-complaint-against-accuser/article30730056.ece
429,2020/02/04,Tata Memorial Hospital to use technology to reduce hair fall in chemo patients,"Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Parel will soon offer a technology to patients to reduce hair fall during treatment, a common yet distressing side effect of chemotherapy. Known as scalp cooling, it reduces the amount of chemotherapy medication reaching the scalp, thus reducing hair fall.

A team of doctors conducted a trial and have published the results in a scientific journal in December. According to Dr. Jyoti Bajpai, associate professor, Department of Medical Oncology, which headed the trial, the hospital is in the process of developing a procedure so the technique can be offered to patients at a nominal charge. He said, “We plan to offer it to all patients. It will be at a little additional cost. But right now, we may start it for young women who are taking cancer treatment.”

The hospital has a scalp cooling machine attached with two scalp coolers or specialised inner silicon caps containing coolants. The machine circulates the coolant in the caps, reducing its temperature up to -4 degrees Celsius. This helps in reduced blood supply to the scalp. Since chemotherapy medication is given intravenously and circulated through the blood, the scalp gets less blood and thus little medication as well. The most common side effect of scalp cooling is headache and cold. Those opting for the technique will have to spend more time at TMH.

The study said, “Day care beds are limited and with a large volume of patients, it will be logistically difficult to provide scalp cooling to all female patients who are on chemotherapy. The treatment time will also be considerably longer, consisting of precooling for 30 minutes, followed by administration of chemotherapy and 90 minutes post chemotherapy cooling period.”

A longer time period, it said, would result in fewer patients being administered treatment in a day, and could lead to delays in starting treatment in subsequent patients. The study concluded that women with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy with taxane, anthracycline, or both, who underwent scalp cooling were significantly more likely to have less than 50% hair loss after the fourth chemotherapy cycle. The study also said more as well as larger long-term studies are needed in patients with advanced breast cancer to comment on safety in these patients.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/5tzfew/article29225872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-PINK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tmh-to-use-tech-to-reduce-hair-fall-in-chemo-patients/article30729982.ece
430,2020/02/04,Exploring new options in cancer care,"Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Parel has begun exploring the efficacy of ayurveda and yoga for better cancer care.

The premier cancer institute that sees the highest patient load in the country has started studies to understand the benefits of two ayurveda medicines in ovarian cancer patients and yoga in breast cancer patients. While the studies are yet to be published, this is the first attempt by the hospital to look beyond modern medicine. The hospital is working in collaboration with the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH).

In one study, the doctors are looking at reducing the nerve damage caused by a chemotherapy drug by supplementing the treatment of ovarian cancer with an ayurveda medicine. In the second study, doctors are looking at preventing the relapse of ovarian cancers.

‘70%-80% relapse’

“Ovarian cancers respond well to treatment but they keep coming back. For example, in 100 ovarian cancer patients, about 70 to 80 have a relapse. We are exploring if ayurveda can help prevent it,” said Dr. Shripad Banavali, director of academics and professor of paediatric and medical oncology at TMH. According to Dr. Banavali, the idea is to conduct the studies through rigorous scientific work, phase-wise trials and development of protocol. “It is not just about cure, we also want to look at supportive treatment,” he said.

In an ongoing study on the benefits of yoga, researchers are studying the data of 800 breast cancer patients. While half of them carry out routine exercises, the other half performs yoga along with the routine exercises. “First-hand information shows that their chemotherapy tolerance is better compared with those who did just routine exercises. We are now planning a long-term study to see if there will be any improvement in survival,” said Dr. Rajendra Badwe, director of Tata Memorial Centre.

The longitudinal study involved introducing yoga asanas and breathing exercises to patients in phases. The patients were asked to maintain their own logs and were evaluated every six months. The researchers looked at aspects like sleeplessness, depression, fear of treatment, and fear of outcome to assess the results.

The hospital is also in talks with the State government for a piece of land near the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Kharghar to explore the possibility of growing medicinal herbs and plants, and conducting research.

Hub-and-spoke model

TMH has expanded rapidly to decentralise cancer treatment by opening centres in Visakhapatnam, Guwahati and Varanasi. The centre will work on a hub-and-spoke model to expand and take cancer care closer to patients. While the hubs will cater to a population of four to five crore and deal largely with complicated cases, spokes will be set up to deal with common cancers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3vqpkw/article30729910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMCancercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece
431,2020/02/04,Two men picked up from Mumbai Bagh,"Two men were picked up on Monday from Mumbai Bagh, the site of a sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Mumbai Central, and released after being issued notices.

Advocate Trisha Shetty, who reached Nagpada police station to represent the duo, said the police tried to make them sign documents claiming responsibility for organising the protest, but they refused to do so. Mumbai Bagh, which began as an impromptu peaceful agitation against the CAA on the night of January 26 on Morland Road near Arabia Hotel, has endured rumour-mongering and political interference to enter its ninth day on Monday.

Ms. Shetty said she rushed to Nagpada police station after receiving distress messages on social media and from one of the men that the police were detaining protesters. She said, “On reaching the police station, I was told that no one was being detained. But when I called one of the detainees, he told me where to find them in the station. I saw that their phones were about to be confiscated and I kept them with myself.”

Ms. Shetty said she then sought permission to speak with Shalini Sharma, the senior police inspector in charge of the station. She said, “I had heard her speak at the protest site a few days ago, where she called Mumbai Bagh a third-class protest which will affect the city’s reputation and referred to the protesters as ignorant.”

Ms. Shetty said the police sought a photocopy of her legal licence and said they would be filing a notice against her. Ms. Sharma then asked her subordinate officer to list Ms. Shetty as an organiser of the protest. Ms. Shetty said, “They were forcing us to sign papers taking full responsibility of organising the protests, but we refused to do so. Even though I was there as a legal representative, I wasn’t allowed to leave the room. I was being charged with fabricated offences. A woman constable blocked the way as I tried to leave the room and we were only released when the media started gathering and asking questions.”

One of the detainees said when he reached the protest site at 11 a.m., a policeman approached him and took him to the police station. He said, “It’s a women’s protest, but some men like us come here each day to volunteer. The police have been constantly trying to place the responsibility of organising the protest on a man.”

While Ms. Sharma could not be reached for comment, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone III) Abhinash Kumar said he was not aware of the incident. He said, “I will have to check what happened and will only be able to comment after that.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6q5bg9/article30730316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMTRISHASHETTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-men-picked-up-from-mumbai-bagh/article30729847.ece
432,2020/02/04,War Hammer’s unbeaten run leaves equestrian enthusiasts breathless,"Over 10,000 equestrian enthusiasts turned the stiles at Mahalaxmi Racecourse on Sunday to witness the 5th Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby, which occupies the pride of place as the blue riband of the Indian racing calendar.

The highly anticipated race — synonymous with glamour, style and fashion — hosted the best thoroughbreds from across the country.

The city’s crème de la crème was in attendance to witness this year’s edition, which marked the 78th successive running of the prestigious event. The 2,400-metre race got off to a rousing start as the gates opened in front of the spectators. Up against a large field of 19 rivals, War Hammer, piloted by ace jockey Suraj Narredu, galloped to victory in spectacular fashion.

The Bengaluru-based colt, trained by Prasanna Kumar, romped home by a comfortable margin and added another feather to its cap — maintaining an unbeaten record of eight wins out of eight starts. War Hammer’s last two triumphs were at the Bangalore Derby and the Indian Derby. Owned by C.A. Prashanth, Gautam Basapa, Manjunath B.S. and Apana Subaiya, War Hammer took home the prize money of ₹1.09 crore.

2,000 career wins

Narredu, the champion rider who guided the fortunes of War Hammer, had recently achieved the feat of 2,000 career wins. He had conquered three regional derbies at Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai this year, and won the Indian Derby last year by guiding Star Superior to victory.

Shekhar Ramamurthy, managing director, United Breweries Limited, said, “We are extremely proud to present the Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby, which each year sets a new benchmark of excellence within the horse racing community.”

Zavaray Poonawalla, chairman, Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC), said, “The RWITC is proud to continue its annual tradition of hosting the most-coveted Indian derby.

434,2020/02/04,Tatenda Taibu and the horrors of a life outside the charmed circle,"First they tried to bribe him with money and promises of prime farmland. When that failed, the Deputy Information Minister called him to his office and casually threw an envelope across to him. It wasn’t more money. It contained pictures of those presumably killed by the regime. Tatenda Taibu knew something like this would happen when he stood up to the corrupt cricket board run by President Robert Mugabe’s men. He was just 22, had been leading the national team for nearly two years, and realized that he had to leave the country.

His son was just a few months old, his wife had nearly been kidnapped, and they were followed by what looked like official vehicles everywhere they went. Threatening telephone calls were made, false stories spread.

All skipper Taibu had done was ask for better conditions and financial deals for his players. Cricketers in Zimbabwe missed out on much of the money provided by the International Cricket Council (ICC) thanks to high-level corruption in the administration. The captain himself was paid in US dollars while the rest had to make do in the local currency as inflation galloped.

Exile and the ICC ban on Zimbabwe cost Taibu many years of international cricket. Despite all that he has been through — delineated without sentimentality or self-pity in his autobiography, Keeper of Faith — he looks fit enough to play for his country. He is just 36, younger than current international Jimmy Anderson of England.

But, like Henry Olonga, who too raised his voice (along with Andy Flower) at the 2003 World Cup, Taibu had to retire in his 20s. He was good enough to be in the national squad at 16 (when still in school), play for his country at 17, be named vice-captain to Flower at 18 and become the youngest Test captain at 20, younger than Tiger Pataudi was when he led (Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan broke that record by a few days recently). He was the poster boy of Zimbabwe’s development programme, emerging from the township of Highfield in Harare.

To have the strength of character to walk away from a comfortable life as a national hero and take on the authorities is as rare as it is commendable; it is rarer among sportsmen. Taibu’s book should be recommended reading for Indian players — not so much to inspire protests as to give them a more balanced perspective on the cricketing world.

These have been Zimbabwe cricket’s heroes — players whose impact has gone beyond the game. In 2003, there was the black armband protest by Olonga and Flower “mourning the death of democracy in Zimbabwe”. They had to flee the country for focusing the attention on the corrupt and murderous ways of President Robert Mugabe and his government.

Here in India, with the national team leading the rankings and with the top players earning in millions of dollars, it might be difficult to understand what teams with less money, less exposure, fewer players to choose from go through. Taibu has written about the galloping rate of inflation in the country. “A friend told me the story of how he walked 15km to the bank to pick up his wages, and walked back 15km to save money. He arrived home that night with his money but when he woke up the next day inflation had risen so much that his monthly wage was enough to buy three oranges.”

When Taibu first led a protest, his teammates stood behind him, but very soon they turned and signed separate contracts with the cricket board. It was a betrayal, but one that Taibu empathises with now, although he felt differently at the time. “I realized that I had been swimming across an ocean for players who wouldn’t jump a puddle for me,” he wrote.

Taibu who lives and coaches in England has the makings of a top international coach (he was briefly in the KKR squad at the IPL). Here’s an insight into how he played the two great spinners of his time: “For Muthiah Muralitharan, if you saw the back of his hand with the thumb sticking out, that was the doosra. If you didn’t see the thumb but saw the ball coming out of the back of the hand, that was the ball that went straight on…”

For Anil Kumble, he focused on the little finger of the bowling hand which conveyed the messages to him.

Taibu returned to Zimbabwe following exile in Bangladesh, South Africa and England, and later became a selector. “Tatenda” in shona language means “Thank you, we are grateful”, and there is much in his story, including his spiritual journey, that is moving. Taibu’s gratitude for everything shines through too.

435,2020/02/04,Beauties in the snow,"Brrrr…for the past month, there’s a cold wave in the Western Himalayas. I live in Dehradun and from my home I can see the snow-clad mountains of Mussoorie. My birding friends often ask, “What is it like to go birding in the snow?”

Birding in the snow is challenging but fun. Last year, during a visit to Munsiari, in the northeastern part of Uttarakhand, it snowed heavily during my three-day visit. We had two to three feet of snow around us. Walking in the snow was tough, as I was not prepared and did not have adequate footwear. Another challenge was cold hands. That makes it difficult to use binoculars or a camera. Gloves help, but I had not carried any. Nonetheless, I had fun, and managed to get some amazing photographs. Even common birds such as Himalayan bulbuls, or the common myna, look different and pretty with snow around them.

Raincoats

Humans are warm-blooded and maintain their body temperatures at approximately 37°C. Birds too, are warm-blooded, and they maintain their body temperature at approximately 40°C. Birds have a few tricks up their sleeves. Their feathers help keep them warm. The only thing worse than being cold, is being cold and wet! Birds manage this, too. They have waterproof oil coating their feathers, preventing them from getting wet — their version of a raincoat.

Meal time

Surprise, surprise…when you watch birds in the snow, they always seem to be able to find food to eat. Birds are especially fond of melting snow patches, where they probe for seeds and grains, fallen fruit and kernels. Most insects, food for many birds, have short life cycles and are active in the warm months of summer and monsoon. However, birds seem to know the nooks and corners in which insects, in various life stages, lie dormant in winter months.

Many birds, of course, prefer not to live in the cold regions of the Himalayas and are altitudinal migrants. This means that they descend to the foothills or even the plains during winter. Often, a bout of snowfall in the hills will lead to interesting bird sightings in Dehradun. The other day, when it snowed in Mussoorie, I spotted a marvellous European goldfinch in my backyard. Despite the cold and the snow, winter is a great time for birds and birdwatching.

436,2020/02/04,Watch out for that poop!,"Pooping is part and parcel of the lives of all creatures in the animal kingdom.

On several of my sojourns into the wilderness, I have come across the poop of wild animals — the bullet-like pellets of deer which have an indentation on one end and a point at the other; the whitish scat of their predators, the leopards, which often have monkey fur in them; and a voluminous mound of poo that has to belong to an elephant.

You might be amazed to learn that there are people who study the faeces or poop of animals to find out about their diet, whether they have any diseases, more about their habitat and to identify them. And this study is called scatology.

Weird wild

The instincts of rhinos lead them all to poo in the same spot. This habit of theirs has unfortunately made it easy for poachers to hunt them.

The hippopotamuses first swish and swing their tails in a circle as if it were some kind of fan and then shower the poo in all directions, probably to mark their territory.

Amongst mammals, baby koalas take the cake. The little joey simply relishes his mother’s poop or pap which contains certain microbes that help counteract the toxins in the eucalyptus leaves that he also fills himself with.

Owls have this disgusting habit of ejecting some of their unwanted food from their mouths. They spit out pellets of undigestible fur and claws that belong to their prey.

Vultures, who are scavengers that eat the flesh of dead animals, take in so much protein that their poo is concentrated with acid and it can actually burn up the leaves of the trees they roost on.

The dung roller beetles deserve a special award for cleaning the environment and recycling. They live in balls of animal dung, feed on the dung and even lay their eggs and make their homes in the dung.

For people living on the islands off the coast of Peru, the guano or poop of the Peruvian guanay cormorant is as valuable as gold. Since these birds feed on anchovies that contain a kind of oil, their guano makes for very rich fertilizer which is exported to other countries.

437,2020/02/04,On the move,"Do you ever wish you could have an entire day of doing nothing? No school, no homework, no weekend classes, no going to see this aunty and that uncle — nothing. A day of complete and utter nothing.

Okay. Forget an entire day of nothing, even I know that’s not practical. How about an hour? Or half an hour? Five minutes?

I said this out loud recently — okay, I yelled it out loud, in the middle of a big fight at home. I don’t know about your parents, but the minute mine see me sitting around not ‘doing something’, they find me something to do.

“Have you finished the physics homework?”

“Don’t you have to draw a hydrophyte and list its adaptations for biology?”

“Quand est-ce que tes devoirs en français sont dus?”

And, if I’ve finished all my homework (which I will be the first to admit is once in a blue moon), I’ll be asked to practise my piano or walk the dog or read a ‘good’ book.

Best thing, huh?

Why? What is wrong with just sitting around and doing nothing?

Sometimes, I think that grownups are so ‘busy’ all the time ‘doing stuff’ they think that being busy is the best thing in the world. Teachers are always running from one class to another or yelling at us while they hand out test papers or drinking tea in the staffroom and correcting homework. Parents are always telling you to get ready and get dressed and finish this and do that while they cook or do laundry or pay bills. Forget doing nothing, actually, I don’t think grownups are capable of doing just one thing at a time. (Aside: But if we try to listen to music and solve quadratic equations, we’re told to focus on one task at a time! Hah!)

Were they like this when they were kids? Always doing stuff? Did they never just sit around and be? What happened to them between being kids and growing up?

“Responsibility!” Appa says.

“Work ethic!” Amma says.

“Well, we grew up!” My friend A’s grandfather says before pulling me aside and telling me that when I become his age I’ll be able to sit down and do nothing. No disrespect grandpa, but I don’t want to wait till I’m a 100 for that!

If you’re a grown up and reading this, I know what you’re thinking! Kids! So lazy these days. So spoilt! They don’t want to work hard.

Actually, no! It’s because we work so hard and do a lot already (school, sports, extra-curricular stuff, social outreach stuff, dog walking) that once in a while, we’d just like to take a break and not do anything.

Grownups, the next time you see a kid doing nothing, why not join them and do nothing with them?",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/y2y45i/article30732932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07YTBUGBOYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/on-the-move/article30732933.ece

It is an ideal that elevates a society to higher levels of social welfare,” Mr. Khan said in his inaugural address at the valedictory function of the year-long centenary celebrations of SMSS Hindu Mahila Mandiram, one of the State’s pioneering women’s welfare and empowerment institutions, here on Monday.

Vision

“What we see in the work of Mahila Mandiram is the divine shade of human kindness. Inspired by the vision that emancipation of women was essential to human progress and transformation of society, Mahila Mandiram has always envisaged the ‘complete woman’ as an integral part of a developing society,” the Governor said.

Mr. Khan also lauded Kerala society for the extreme care given to the uncared for people.

“The success of Mahila Mandiram and its institutions is certainly an inspiring story of women, who decided to step out of their homes to provide relief to society. It is also a fine example in nation building and an inspiration for women to contribute to society,” he said.

The Governor presented the centenary award to K. Selvi, a differently abled person, who was a resident of the institution for 18 years. During her stay at Mahila Mandiram, she pursued her studies and also picked up various skills such as stitching, embroidery and book binding.

Mr. Khan also released a souvenir and launched the Mahima Unit of the institution at the function.

449,2020/02/04,Land taken for bypass: arbitration from Feb. 6,"Arbitration proceedings on the complaints filed by landowners in Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam, Thirupuram, Chenkal and Karode villages along the Kazhakuttam-Karode National Highway 66 bypass demanding enhanced compensation for the land surrendered will resume on February 6, after a gap of one year.

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan will have to take a call on 1,500 complaints filed by the landowners.

The decision comes in the wake of an agitation by the Vengapotta-based Kazhakuttam-Karode Bypass Action Council that is spearheading the demand for enhanced compensation.

Intimation received

Former legislator and patron of the action council Jameela Prakasam has received intimation on resumption of the arbitration process.

As many as 1,769 persons had surrendered land for the Reach II of the NH-66 bypass from Mukkola to Karode. Since taking over the land in 2014, only 350 complaints have been settled through arbitration by successive District Collectors.

A 15% hike in the compensation and 9% interest were announced by the then Arbitrator and District Collector N. Venkatesapathy for 165 persons.

Mr. Venkatesapathy’s successor K. Vasuki gave 50% more compensation and 9% interest from the date of notification of land acquisition to 185 persons.

NHAI appeals decision

But, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) went in appeal against the decision of the Arbitrator to enhance compensation for those who had surrendered land and buildings on the Kottukal-Karode stretch.

The NHAI is of the view that the June 30, 2018 order by Dr. Vasuki is in violation of the National Highways Act 1956 and Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.

Order delayed

Council chairman V. Sudhakaran said the office of the District Collector took nine months to issue a formal order thereby enabling the NHAI to file the appeal in the court.

The NHAI had not opposed the 15% hike in the compensation and 9% interest announced by the earlier arbitrator.

The arbitration was later stopped at the intervention of the office of the District Collector.

The action council had submitted several petitions to resume the proceedings and had announced an indefinite stir from March 15.

The council chairman has demanded steps to dispose of the remaining complaints for enhanced compensation in the next six months.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/land-taken-for-bypass-arbitration-from-feb-6/article30730028.ece
450,2020/02/04,Chennai City faces the Arrows challenge,"Defending champion Chennai City FC will want nothing but a win against Indian Arrows when the two face-off in the Hero I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.

Arrows’ young bunch is known for its speed and agility, and Chennai City for its tactical ability. The former is all fired up after stunning Kolkata giant East Bengal by a solitary goal the other day.

Are the Chennai City players ready for Arrows? “Indian Arrows is a difficult team to beat because they run the whole day. They are young and hungry, and have got nothing to lose. They also do not fear where they would end up on the table,” said Akbar Nawas, Chennai City’s head coach.

Nawas, however, knows that his boys are the reigning champions and Arrows’ players the challengers. “Obviously, we will have to be careful and play a perfect game to win. We are well prepared for it, and it is time for our boys to go out there and deliver. I want nothing but a win,” he said.

“They might have speed on their side but it is speed of thought which is important. It can help them take strong decisions when upfront and I have told them that,” added Nawas.

The CCFC coach was pleased with the show against Mohun Bagan here last week, but felt that the team needed to get the set-pieces right. “I feel it is due to lack in concentration. We have been working on it day in and day out, and how I wish lady luck also smiles on us!”

More than good fortune, it’s about balance in both attack and defence. “You will see that happening tomorrow [Wednesday]. The players are raring to go. We have been training hard and I must tell you that I have not seen a more motivated bunch. They really want to do something special,” said Nawas.

Indian Arrows’ coach Venkatesh Shanmugam, too, sounded positive. “Chennai City is a strong side with a good set of foreigners and Indian players. So, it’s going to be one more challenge for us but I expect the boys to play some good football.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/chennai-city-faces-the-arrows-challenge/article30735320.ece
451,2020/02/04,Sampdoria fightback in vain as Napoli snatch late goals,"Napoli grabbed two late goals to win 4-2 at Sampdoria on Monday in a Serie A match featuring two controversial VAR decisions and a spectacular effort by veteran Fabio Quagliarella for the hosts.

Diego Demme and Dries Mertens struck in the final 10 minutes as Napoli continued their mini-revival under fiery coach Gennaro Gattuso with a third successive win in all competitions.

Napoli had plummeted down the table after a dreadful run of results but are now back up to 10th with 30 points, nine off the Champions League spots.

“We're back, we giving continuity to the work we do during the week with the boss,” said team captain Lorenzo Insigne. “The Champions League is feasible but we have to think match by match.”

Napoli raced to a 2-0 lead after 16 minutes as Arkadiusz Milik headed in to finish off a slick passing move and Eljif Elmas turned the ball home at the far post from a corner for his first Serie A goal, the North Macedonian crying with emotion as he celebrated.

Quagliarella pulled one back in style in the 26th minute as the ball was chipped forward to the edge of the area where the 37-year-old met it with a volley on the turn which flew into the bottom corner.

Sampdoria thought they had levelled 10 minutes after halftime with an overhead kick by Gaston Ramirez but, after a long VAR review, the goal was controversially chalked off for handball by Manolo Gabbiadini at the start of the move.

VAR, however, went in Sampdoria's favour when Kostas Manolas clipped Quagliarella's ankle and, after another review with the pitchside monitor, the referee gave a penalty and Gabbiadini converted in the 73rd minute.

Demme put Napoli back in front after 82 minutes and Mertens curled the fourth into an empty net from midfield after Sampdoria goalkeeper Emil Audero charged out of his area and headed the ball straight to the Belgian.

“It was a really good Napoli team, they surprised us,” said Sampdoria coach Claudio Ranieri, whose side are 16th and only four points clear of the drop zone. “We did more and they did less in the second half but we made some mistakes at the end and they made us pay.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/a401ln/article30731947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THNAPOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sampdoria-fightback-in-vain-as-napoli-snatch-late-goals/article30731948.ece
452,2020/02/04,Marine Enforcement Wing to get manpower before long,"Deployment of personnel to the new Marine Enforcement Wing in Nagapattinam district is expected over the next few weeks in the wake of posting of senior-level officials at the State level, according to officials.

Though the specially created uniformed force will be mainly involved in conserving and managing fishery resources and handle illegal fishing and threats from miscreants, their presence will also check smuggling activities in mid-sea.

The unit will have its own patrolling boats for surveillance to an extent of 12 nautical miles from the seashore, Amal Raj Xavier, Joint Director of Fisheries Department, said.

The patrol boats to be provided or hired by the Marine Enforcement Wing can attain a top speed of 70 km to conduct surprise checks on fishing boats in the sea.

While technology-assisted system of enumerating mechanised boats has helped in checking smuggling of diesel, the problem of drug smuggling from Vedaranyam in the district to Sri Lanka persists.

Last December, an attempt by a three-member gang to smuggle 700 kg of ganja worth ₹1.5 crore into Sri Lanka was thwarted by Q Branch Police. The suspects, who were in the garb of tourists, were handed over to the Narcotics Control Bureau.

The presence of the Wing will be a deterrent to drug smugglers in Vedaranyam, official sources said.

Meanwhile, the Nagapattinam district administration on Tuesday formed a committee comprising officials of Fisheries, Police, Revenue and Transport departments for effective enforcement of the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act.

As per the Act, mechanised vessels can carry out fishing only beyond three nautical miles from the coastline.

The committee has been empowered to seize banned nets and vehicles used for transport; take action against traders purchasing fish caught with banned nets; confiscate boats and nets that contravene provisions of the Act in mid-sea operations; and seize fish from mechanised boats that flout the norms and auction the catch.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/marine-enforcement-wing-to-get-manpower-before-long/article30737343.ece
453,2020/02/04,Steady income lures farmers towards viruchi flower cultivation,"Thanks to the prospect of steady income, more and more farmers of non-delta region in Tiruchi district have turned their attention to cultivating viruchi poo.

The multi-branched plants, an evergreen shrub, are common on the dry fields in various villages on the outskirts of Tiruchi towards Thogamalai.

Farmers in rainfed areas have raised the plants in more than 500 acres in K. Pudur, Kalladai, Idyapatti, Koppu, Ettarai, Kuzhumani, Keezha Veliyur, Mela Veliyur, Vengadathanpatti, Varunthipatti, Azhaganampatti and several other villages.

While a few farmers have brought their fields under the drip irrigation system, others irrigate their fields by buying water from the farmers, who own pump set.

The plant grows 4 to 6 feet. It is capable of reaching up to 12 feet if it is properly maintained beyond five years.

Farmers say that many of their counterparts in the region have switched to viruchi flower cultivation due to steady income that they get by marketing the flowers for at least five years.

Though the prices of flower fluctuate very often, it fetches remunerative prices during festive seasons and auspicious days. There are days when farmers get ₹400 -500 a kg.

“It is a safe floriculture crop for farmers. We can get income even up to 10 years if proper care is maintained,” says P. Maruthai of K. Pudur.

454,2020/02/04,Chathram bus stand redevelopment on course to be completed ahead of schedule: Collector,"The redevelopment of Chathram Bus Stand in the city, taken up under the Smart City Mission, would be completed by February 2021, about four months ahead of the contracted period, Collector S.Sivarasu said here on Tuesday.

The Corporation went in for the redevelopment of the bus stand, located in the Smart City Development Mission development area around the Rockfort, as the old bus stand was found inadequate to handle the increasing traffic of buses. The old high-roofed bus stand, which has since been dismantled, could handle only about 20 buses at a time.

The bus stand, spread over an area of about 2.93 acres, would now have 30 bus bays in two terminals – one to accommodate buses heading towards Central Bus Stand and other destinations and the other for buses operating to Jeeyapuram, Lalgudi and other suburbs.

The redeveloped bus stand would also have a parking lot for two wheelers on the basement with a capacity to accommodate 350 vehicles and 33 shops on the ground and first floors. It would have amenities such as a passenger waiting hall, pedestrian pathways, ticketing rooms, potable water supply, a cloak room, feeding room for lactating mothers and a food court besides toilets for men and women.

Civil works on the project, taken up at an estimate of ₹17.34 crore, is currently underway and so far about 15% of the works have been completed. Presently, work on laying a raft foundation is on. Of the 248 piles to be erected, 218 have been completed.

Speaking to reporters after inspecting the progress of works along with S.Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner and other officials, Mr.Sivarasu said civil works on the basement and ground floors were expected to be completed by March this year.

Answering a query, Mr.Sivaraj said steps would be taken to remove the encroachments and erect passenger shelters for mofussil buses currently operating from the road side near the Chathram Bus Stand.

He also affirmed that measures to establish an integrated bus stand, a long pending proposal, would be set in motion soon once an elected local body was in place in the city. “Sites are available; we plan to hold a stakeholders meeting and the process will begin the process after getting the approval of the elected body,” he said responding to a query on whether a site has been finalized. The establishment of an integrated bus stand has been stalled as the authorities are unable to narrow down on a suitable site for about two decades.

As to the other works taken up under the Smart City Mission in the city,Mr.Sivarasu said that 26 works have been taken up under the programme in the city at a total cost of ₹922.17 crore and two of them have been completed so far.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rqp4rl/article30737301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-BUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/smart-chathram-bus-stand-to-beat-deadline/article30737302.ece

456,2020/02/04,"Soon, trains will chug into platform no. 8 at Tiruchi Jn.","With a slew of works taken up under the station redevelopment project at Tiruchi junction having been completed, construction of a new platform on Kallukuzhi second entry side is under way.

Civil works connected with construction of platform no. 8 on the second entry side is targeted for completion by March. The signalling and overhead electrification works at the new platform is expected to take another three to four months. The new platform is being laid to a length of about 600 metres to accommodate more than 24 broad gauge coaches.

Upon completion of all works — civil, signalling and electrical — the new platform will thereafter be subjected to mandatory inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru, to obtain statutory clearance prior to opening the platform to receiving trains, a senior railway officer here said.

Southern Railway has apportioned ₹3.72 crore for construction of the new platform as part of a total allocation of ₹23 crore for redevelopment works at the junction, a major halting point in the zone.

The eighth platform is being constructed essentially to reduce congestion at the main entrance and enable passengers to board trains through the second entry, the officer said.

In view of construction of the platform and a larger plan to de-congest the main entrance, divisional railway authorities have planned to construct a new station building at the second entry side and make improvements to the existing booking office.

Provisions for car parking, bus shelter, improvements to circulating area and landscaping on the side are works proposed to be executed in the near future, said the official.

Works such as improvement of the subway and the additional entry road, paver for walk way, resurfacing of main entry road, construction of main entry arch and improvements to station master room, booking office and reservation counter have been completed.

An artificial fountain, improvements to the floor at the main entrance, construction of a compound wall, storm water drain work and developments in car parking area are nearing completion.

As part of the redevelopment works, the railway authorities will establish a booking office at the additional entry side of the station near the parcel office. The facility will be created for the convenience of passengers alighting on the side and for those using the foot overbridge.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/89ak69/article30737252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-PLATFORM8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/soon-trains-will-chug-into-platform-no-8-in-tiruchi/article30737253.ece
457,2020/02/04,Thanjavur Brahadeeswarar temple consecration: Trees pruned to facilitate better view,"A few trees near the Big Temple complex have been pruned by officials presumably to help people witness the consecration of the shrine without any obstruction.

While inspecting areas identified as possible locations near the Big Temple from where the public could witness the consecration without entering the main courtyard, the officials felt that the public could have a better view if the trees in the Corporation-maintained park near Raja Raja Cholan statue and along the outer corridor on the eastern and south-eastern side of the temple were pruned.

In no time, the decision was executed by the event managers and branches of the trees were pruned and left devoid of leaves.

Condemning the act, founder of Green Needa, an organisation engaged in promoting greenery in the State, G. Rajavelu of Needamangalam, pointed out that the leaves were a vital part that helped photosynthesis. The officials might have opted for the unwarranted activity fearing backlash from environmentalists if they decided to cut down the fully grown trees.

Special enclosures

Special enclosures had been set up on the northern side of the main tower of the temple complex to accommodate VVIPs and on the southern side for VIPs and the general public. Separate entry and exit points had been provided for VVIPs and others so that the entry of kalasams from the yaga salai into the temple complex would not get affected, sources said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/czvcbb/article30738366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-TREES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/consecration-trees-pruned-to-facilitate-better-view/article30735067.ece

Presiding over a review meeting on the progress of the programme, she said agriculture and horticulture officials should expedite action to achieve the target. The State government allotted ₹3.10 crore for the initiative for 2019-20, with agriculture and horticulture departments sanctioned ₹2 crore and ₹1.10 crore respectively.

Under the initiative, five farmer interest groups should be formed in each village by organising small and marginal ryots. They would subsequently be incorporated into a farmer producer group. It would enable credit mobilisation, better adoption of technology and facilitate effective forward and backward linkages.

Out of 62 farmer producer groups, the Agriculture Department would form 40. The responsibility of forming the remaining would be vested on the Horticulture Department. Upon formation, each group would be given ₹5 lakh, which could be used to buy machinery. The machines would be collectively used for cultivation.

The producer groups could enter into memorandum of understanding with other groups to buy machinery and equipment exceeding ₹5 lakh, but not for marketing and sale.

Vijaya Sai Reddy that the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) prepared a draft Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the transfer of the water from the Godavari River to the Krishna, the Krishna to the Pennar and the Pennar to the Cauvery and circulated it to all the States concerned in March 2019 for eliciting their views.

The Godavari - Cauvery link comprises three components namely the Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) - Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), the Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila) and the Pennar (Somasila)–Cauvery.

It envisaged the diversion of 247 tmcft of unutilised water in the Indravati sub-basin of the Godavari basin to meet the requirements between the Godavari and the Cauvery rivers.

The link project provides irrigation facility to 3.45 to 5.04 lakh hectares in Prakasam, Nellore, Krishna, Guntur, and Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) besides stabilising the existing command areas under the Nagarjunasagar left and right bank canals.

The implementation stage would be reached after the DPR was prepared with the consensus of the States concerned and the requisite statutory clearances were obtained, Mr. Shekhawat said.

465,2020/02/04,MSTC to e-auction DCIL building in Vizag on February 14,"The MSTC Limited (formerly Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited) will conduct e-auction of the Dredging Corporation of India Limited (DCIL)’s prime property on February 14.

The new building in the Seethammadhara Housing Board Colony is now at an advanced stage of construction. Earlier, the building was scheduled to be sold on January 30. “The auction has been put off due to strategic reasons,” an official of MSTC told The Hindu on Monday.

Bid price

Interested parties need to submit an EMD amount of ₹2 crore. Those submitting pre-bid EMD are being asked to submit their bids of at least ₹10 lakh above the reserve price of ₹78 crore. The new building has five floors and two basements.

DCIL, the Visakhapatnam-headquartered PSU specialising in dredging and maritime development, is now under the strategic control of a consortium formed by four major ports after it was put up for strategic sale. Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) picked up majority stake by acquiring 73.47% of government share along with JNPT, Deendayal (Kandla) and Paradeep ports.

Capital crunch

The disinvestment idea was mooted as the DCIL, a profit making company since its inception in 1976, had faced working capital crunch for investment in fleet augmentation and expansion due to its eroding capital base and competition thrown up by private players.

The DCIL wanted to relocate its head office to the new building constructed at a cost of around ₹45 crore.

However, with the Visakhapatnam Port Trust turning a major stakeholder, plans have changed and the building is no longer needed. The amount mopped up from selling the property might be used partly for capacity augmentation/expansion, the officials said.

According to DCIL sources, they are expecting nearly ₹100 crore from the sale of the building. The MSTC is also hoping that the thrust laid on infrastructure sector post-Union Budget and the decision of the State government to set up the Executive capital in Visakhapatnma will be their plus points in the e-auction of the new building.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/9bsr5d/article30729700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VZ3DREDGINGCORPORATIONOFINDIABUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/mstc-to-e-auction-dcil-building-in-vizag-on-february-14/article30729701.ece

Training his guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), he said both had an aim to spread hatred in the society, something the Congress could never do.

“They [BJP] talk about the Hindu dharm, they talk about Islam, they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hiduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism — where is it written that attack other people, suppress them?” he asked the crowd.

What kind of “Hindu dharm” is this of Mr. Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as Hinduism talked about taking everyone along, Mr. Gandhi said at the rally organised in favour of the Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Singh Marwah.

470,2020/02/04,United in green at Dysco,"At the recently-concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, one of the major themes of discussion was ‘How to Save the Planet’. From fashion to food, sustainability has found its way into the social consciousness. We carry reusable grocery bags, use stainless steel straws and look for brands that take a mindful approach to their products. What can we do better? At Dysco’s Y3K: Planet Lost & Found, a day-long offline event in Mumbai, the aim is to create a proposition for a sustainable future where technology, humans and nature live in harmony.

Khrisha Shah, founder of the web-based platform that helps people connect for collaborations and more, says, “We saw so many from our community working on initiatives within sustainability. So we wanted to bring together those who are working on renewable energy, with the people who are working in sustainable fashion.” This is familiar territory, as their Bread & Butter event, held last June, similarly brought together people from the food industry.

Across the board

This time around, the curated programme of talks, workshops, pop-ups and music performances has a lineup of over 50 experts from various fields. Like Avijit Michael of Jhatkaa.org, who will talk on the influence citizens can have on the government’s implementation of environment policies. Pratap Raju of Climate Launchpad will share insights on new tech innovations for the planet, while Rushikesh Chavan of the Wildlife Conservation Trust will speak on eco-anxiety. Sara Mahdi, creative conservationist, will focus on raising role models, thought leaders and eco-warriors of the future.

One of the highlights of the day will be the Pitch-a Pecha Kucha session, powered by venture capital firm, Lightbox, says Shah. “The session will open up the floor to seven entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas in a 20 seconds and 20 slides format. The winning pitch will be accelerated by the India chapter of Climate Launchpad, an international green business idea competition,” she explains. This includes plant-based food brand, Better, and sustainable waste management initiative, Skrap — the latter has tied up with Dysco for waste segregation at the venue. Pretty Things will be using scrap cloth and glass bottles to create decor for the event, while Cityflo, an urban transportation app, will offer free routes to the venue for participants, to encourage them to use public transport.

471,2020/02/04,Paper claiming novel coronavirus can be transmitted during incubation period ‘flawed’,"A Correspondence published on January 30 in the The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) about an asymptomatic Chinese woman infecting a German during the incubation period of the novel coronavirus turns out to be wrong as it was based on inaccurate information, the journal Science reported on Monday.

As per Science, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is the German government’s public health agency, and the Health and Food Safety Authority of the State of Bavaria spoke to the Chinese woman after NEJM published the finding. And it turns out that the Chinese woman did indeed have symptoms during her stay in Germany, when she came in contact with the German who fell sick. But no tests were carried out in Germany to confirm if she was infected with the novel virus. She underwent testing for the novel coronavirus after her return to China and tested positive for the virus.

The development is significant given that China’s National Health Commission Minister had first warned that the novel virus might be spreading even during the incubation period when symptoms do not show up. The NEJM paper confirming it meant that the novel virus indeed has the capability to infect people even before symptoms show up overtly. If it were true, it would mean that there is a possibility that people could spread the virus long before they know they have been infected.

The Science article in fact cited Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, having told journalists: “There’s no doubt after reading [the NEJM] paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurring. This study lays the question to rest.”

The RKI’s finding establishes that the virus was not transmitted by the Chinese woman during the incubation period and that the German man was not infected as a result of such transmission. The transmission had happened after the incubation period and when she was exhibiting symptoms.

“I feel bad about how this went, but I don’t think anybody is at fault here,” virologist Christian Drosten of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, who did the lab work for the correspondence published in the NEJM told Science. “Apparently the woman could not be reached at first and people felt this had to be communicated quickly.”

According to NEJM, the German had attended meetings with a Chinese woman, a business partner of the company, near Munich on January 20 and 21. The Chinese woman, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between January 19 and 22. During her stay in Germany, she did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her journey back to China, where she tested positive for coronavirus on January 26.

In a Situation Report posted on February 1, the World Health Organization said: “WHO is aware of possible transmission of the novel coronavirus from infected people before they developed symptoms. Detailed exposure histories are being taken to better understand the pre-clinical phase of infection and how transmission may have occurred in these few instances.” It then stresses that “asymptomatic infection may be rare, and transmission from an asymptomatic person is very rare with other coronaviruses, as we have seen with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission.”

The main driver of novel coronavirus transmission is people who exhibit overt symptoms. Such people will spread the virus more readily through coughing and sneezing.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden has now posted this information in the frequently asked questions section as to whether the virus infects during the incubation period. “Data has circulated that the new coronavirus would be [transmitted] throughout the incubation period… It has emerged that the data is unfortunately based on misconceptions. We believe that it is impossible for the new coronavirus to infect throughout the incubation period.”

And about the NEJM article it says: “The sources that claimed that the coronavirus would infect during the incubation period lack scientific support for that analysis in their articles. This applies, among other things, to an article in NEJM that has subsequently proven to contain major flaws and errors. Statements by the Chinese authorities on infectiousness during the incubation period lack sources or other data to support it.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/6bff0j/article30735015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NovelCoronavirus-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/paper-claiming-novel-coronavirus-can-be-transmitted-during-incubation-period-flawed/article30735017.ece
472,2020/02/04,One in 10 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime: WHO report,"India had an estimated 1.16 million new cancer cases in 2018, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), which said that one in 10 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime and one in 15 will die of the disease.

WHO and its specialized International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have released two reports to mark World Cancer Day: one aimed at setting the global agenda on the disease; the other focused on research and prevention. The World Cancer Report said according to the estimated cancer burden in India in 2018, there are about 1.16 million new cancer cases, 784,800 cancer deaths, and 2.26 million 5-year prevalent cases in India’s population of 1.35 billion.

In India, the six most common cancer types were breast cancer (162,500 cases), oral cancer (120,000 cases), cervical cancer (97,000 cases), lung cancer (68,000 cases), stomach cancer (57,000 cases), and colorectal cancer (57,000). Together, these account for 49% of all-new cancer cases. Of the 570,000 new cancer cases in men, oral cancer (92,000), lung cancer (49,000), stomach cancer (39,000), colorectal cancer (37,000), and oesophageal cancer (34,000) account for 45% of cases. The report added that of the 587,000 new cancer cases in women, breast cancer (162,500), cervical cancer (97,000), ovarian cancer (36,000), oral cancer (28,000), and colorectal cancer (20,000) account for 60% of cases.

Socio-economic status

Cancer patterns in India are dominated by a high burden of tobacco-related head and neck cancers, particularly oral cancer, in men and of cervical cancer in women; both of these cancer types are associated with lower socio-economic status, the report said. The burden of cancer types, such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer, associated with overweight and obesity, lower levels of physical activity, and sedentary lifestyles is increasing and these cancer types are associated with higher socio-economic status.

“During the past two decades, India has had one of the world’s best performing and most stable economies, which has grown by more than 7% annually in most years. This economic development has given rise to vast socio-economic changes, with an increasing risk of non-communicable diseases, including cancer, ad significant disparities in access to cancer prevention and control services,” the report said.

WHO warned that global cancer rates could rise by 60% over the next 20 years unless cancer care is ramped up in low and middle-income countries. Less than 15% of these nations offer comprehensive cancer treatment services through their public health systems, according to the U.N. agency. At least 7 million lives could be saved over the next decade, by identifying the most appropriate science for each country situation, by basing strong cancer responses on universal health coverage, and by mobilizing different stakeholders to work together, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

The report said about 80% of the world’s smokers live in low and middle-income countries. In addition, 64% of the world’s daily smokers live in only 10 countries and more than 50 per cent of the world’s male smokers live in three countries: China, India, and Indonesia. There are currently 164 million users of smokeless tobacco, 69 million smokers, and 42 million smokers and chewers in India. More than 90% of patients with oral cancer have low or lower-middle socio-economic status. Tobacco-related cancers account for 34-69% of all cancers in men, they constitute 10-27% of all cancers in women in most regions in India. The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing in the most developed States in India and in urban populations.

Increasing trend

“There is a clear increasing trend in the incidence rates of breast cancer across the country, with an annual percentage increase that ranges from 1.4% to 2.8% and is more pronounced in urban areas than in rural areas. Incidence rates are also increasing for cancer types associated with overweight and obesity and lower levels of physical activity, such as colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer,” the report said

The report noted that there is a clear decreasing trend in the incidence rates of cervical cancer in most regions in India (annual percentage change, -2.0% to -3.5%), with age-standardized incidence rates as low as 6 per 1,00,000 in women in Kerala. India accounts for about one fifth of the global burden of cervical cancer, despite decreasing incidence rates in several regions of the country. Thus, elimination of cervical cancer in India will have a major impact on global elimination of the disease as a public health problem. Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women with lower socio-economic status, who are at a considerable disadvantage in the availability of and access to public health services for prevention and early detection, and therefore this is an equity issue.

IARC Director Elisabete Weiderpass observed that high-income countries have adopted prevention, early diagnosis and screening programmes, which together with better treatment, have contributed to an estimated 20% reduction in the probability of premature mortality between 2000 and 2015, but low-income countries only saw a reduction of 5%.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/m4vjsc/article30734511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WHO-4feb,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/one-in-10-indians-will-develop-cancer-during-their-lifetime-who-report/article30734480.ece
