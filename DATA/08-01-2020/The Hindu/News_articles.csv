0,2020/01/08,Delhi International Open Grandmasters | Tough prospects for Indian title-contenders,"The country’s richest prize-money chess tournament is back with bigger prize-money on offer.

The 18th edition of the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament has attracted more Grandmasters than before and promises a thrilling fare over 10 rounds, beginning at the Indira Gandhi Stadium here on Thursday.

The event, divided into three categories, offers a prize-money of ₹1.11 crore — an increase of ₹10 lakh from last year.

The magnitude and the stature of the event could be gauged from the fact that the two preceding International Opens — in Bhopal and Mumbai — offered prize-funds of ₹14.14 lakh and ₹17 lakh respectively. The one to follow in Chennai from January 18 offers ₹15 lakh.

A record 38 GMs will be seen in action in Category ‘A’ that alone offers ₹39 lakh. Categories ‘B’ and ‘C’, meant for those rated below 1899 and 1499, respectively, has a prize-fund of ₹36 lakh each.

Amanatov leads field

Like last year, 2017 champion Tajikistan’s Farrukh Amanatov heads the elite field. Presence of 25 players, with rating of over 2500, reflects the strength of the field.

Among the Indian title-contenders, twice National champion Murali Karthikeyan and former champion Abhijeet Gupta, seeded three and five, can be expected to give the large presence of overseas GMs a tough fight.

In fact, only four Indians — R.B. Ramesh (2003), K. Sasikiran (2005), Abhijeet Gupta (2008 and 2014) and Surya Shekhar Ganguly (2009) — have won the title here. It remains to be seen whether the five-year title-drought of Indian contenders ends this time.

Going by the form of the leading Indians in the fray, it looks difficult. On Tuesday, Abhijeet finished seventh after being the top seed of the Mumbai International Open. Karthikeyan, too, is looking to regain his form.

Good news

With the rules of accelerated pairings for the first two rounds in force, it is good news for those seeking various norms.

In another welcome move, the tournament rules stipulate that players cannot agree for a draw before black’s 30th move.

So far, the entries in the two lower categories are less than last year’s tally owing to intense cold wave conditions and the sporadic anti-CAA protests in the Capital.

In Category ‘A’, as compared to last year’s figures of 322, the figure has touched 347. In ‘B’, which also starts on Thursday, the figure stands at 722. For ‘C’, scheduled to begin on January 13th, 1008 entries have already been received.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/9sh92g/article30516933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09MURALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/delhi-international-open-grandmasters-tough-prospects-for-indian-title-contenders/article30516937.ece
1,2020/01/08,PBL season five set to kick off on January 20,"The fifth edition of the Premier Badminton League (PBL) will start on January 20 with P.V. Sindhu’s team Hyderabad Hunters taking on Chennai Superstarz in Chennai.

The 2020 edition will have 24 ties to be played in 21 days in four different cities. The tournament will return to Chennai after two years.

After the first leg in Chennai, the league will move to Lucknow on Jan. 25, followed by Hyderabad, with Bengaluru being the host for the semifinals and the finals on Feb. 9.

Marquee clash

The tournament will have its marquee clash in the third leg when Hunters lock horns with Tai Tzu Ying’s Bengaluru Raptors on Jan. 31.

“I had a great time playing in PBL last time. The format of the league is very exciting, and that is why I like to play in the league. I am very excited to join Bengaluru Raptors for Season 5.

“I hope a lot of fans will come to the stadiums to watch the matches and my fans around the world will follow it on TV and online. I look forward to playing against all teams, especially against Sindhu.” Tai Tzu said.

The league will see five Olympic medallists and 15 World champions in action.

2,2020/01/08,Chess queens battle for king’s ransom,"Two of the sharpest minds in women’s chess are involved in a battle here this week with a World champion title on the line and a record prize fund as the game seeks to close the gender gap.

The €500,000 on the table in the showdown between holder Ju Wenjun and challenger Aleksandra Goryachkina is the largest prize fund in the nearly 100-year history of the Women’s World Championship.

Significant moment

The International Chess Federation (FIDE) says it is a significant moment for women’s chess, which has long lagged behind the publicity, pay packets and participation of men.

The winner between the GMs from China and Russia — which will be determined over 12 game days in Shanghai and Vladivostok — takes home €300,000.

The total purse is a 150% hike on the previous women’s championship match, according to FIDE, and the format of the competition has been changed to mirror the World Chess Championship, which is theoretically open to all but has been dominated by men.

“We are trying to increase the prestige of the women’s game and also close the pay gap with the men,” said Nigel Short, once one of the top-ranked players in the world and now FIDE vice-president.

“It’s something that we are concerned about and we are trying to do our best to improve the conditions in particular for women’s chess,” the 54-year-old Briton said.

Moves to boost women’s chess came with the election of Arkady Dvorkovich as FIDE president in October 2018. He is a former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia.

Speaking on the eve of Sunday’s opening game, rising star Goryachkina, 21, called the changes “very positive” but said she was motivated by winning the title, not the cash.

Shohreh Bayat, chief arbiter for the match between Goryachkina and the 28-year-old Ju, laughed off the notion that this is chess’s #MeToo moment.

But the Iranian said: “There were many complaints from women players about the format of tournaments, such as this one, and the prize money.”

Bayat hopes that one day women will earn the same as the likes of Magnus Carlsen, the world champion and best-known name in chess.

“In chess right now, if you compare their ratings, men are better players than women, there’s a big difference,” said Bayat.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/42jh4c/article30516525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09CHESS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/chess-queens-battle-for-kings-ransom/article30516526.ece
3,2020/01/08,Retired chief justice to probe Bengal chess mess,"The All India Chess Federation (AICF) has appointed former Calcutta High Court chief justice (retd.) Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya to look into the Bengal Chess Association (BCA) issues.

In a press release issued on Wednesday, AICF joint secretary Naresh Sharma said the body took the decision “acting upon the decisions taken at the General Body meeting in Bhopal on December 28.”

“It may be recalled that Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua had filed a complaint against Bengal secretary Atanu Lahiri and later Sports Authority of India had found that the utilisation certificate furnished by Bengal chess for the National sub-junior chess championship 2018 was forged.

“The AICF general body had taken a strong note of especially the second finding and a motion for a thorough probe in the matter was passed,” said the release.

FIR filed

Sharma further said, “The AICF has now filed an FIR in the case as per the decision taken in the GB meeting and has also requested SAI to do a forensic check by a Govt. agency on the alleged utilisation certificate.

“Barua had accused Lahiri of engaging in corruption and diverting state fund for chess promotion to his (Lahiri’s) company Global Chess (Foundation). Barua had also accused Lahiri of banning several top players for criticising his handling of the chess affairs.”

Lahiri has rejected all the allegations made by Barua.

Following the December 28 meeting, AICF treasurer Kishor Bandekar had issued a press release claiming that president P.R.V. Raja directed him to do so.

False stories

In the release, dated December 30, Bandekar had said AICF secretary “Bharat Singh (Chauhan) is feeding false stories to the media without taking views of the president.”

The release alleged that Chauhan behaved badly and tried to discuss matters other than Bengal chess. The president “did not allow any other discussion than BCA and charges on Atanu Lahiri,” it claimed.

It said Lahiri accused Chauhan and Barua of defaming him and “has filed a criminal case against both of them.”

Documentary evidence

Chauhan said there was video recording of the proceedings and “documentary evidence of the majority supporting the matters on the agenda.”

Chauhan questioned why the president did not sign the press release and asked the treasurer, instead of a joint secretary, to do it.

In an earlier statement, Sharma had rejected the claims made by Bandekar, saying all matters on the agenda were discussed smoothly in the presence of president Raja and Union Sports Ministry observer Satyajit Sankrit.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/aicf-turns-to-jyotirmoy-bhattacharya/article30515770.ece
4,2020/01/08,A bastion of badminton goes to seed,"Is Fateh Maidan Indoor Stadium fast becoming a forgotten venue for Indian badminton? A visibly disgusted S.M. Arif, Dronacharya and former chief national coach, seems to think so.

“Mostly this venue hosts non-sporting events, which is deplorable. After training for the first time this week, we are told now it is let out for another event for the next five days,” said Arif in a chat with The Hindu after another of his daily training stints.

“Effectively all the 50-odd trainees in different age groups would be idling their time away doing nothing, which they cannot afford if they are to become big in the sport. With the adjacent Lal Bahadur Stadium too dug up for one non-sporting event or the other, they can’t even afford physical conditioning exercises for fear of injuries,” he said.

At 76, Arif just cannot think of being away from the venue where he started coaching under Sports Authority of India in 1978 after being transferred from Jammu & Kashmir. He oversaw the first batch of players Praveen Kumar and Manoj Kumar win international laurels.

In a way, these two were an inspiration to P. Gopi Chand, the former All England champion and now chief national coach.

“I pity these young players who show commitment and dedication, braving all odds to be here daily with the hope of getting some training,” said Arif, who retired in 2004 but continues to offer free coaching.

All that the Sports Authority of Telangana State does is give the venue at its convenience and the services of former international Ch. Deepthi — a dedicated and knowledgeable coach according to Arif — who is on its roll as a consolidated coach.

The trainees have to shell out about ₹700 per head every month and also have to buy their own shuttles.

“This is certainly not the way to treat a venue, which not long ago was the hub of Indian badminton as most of the national camps were held here,” he said.

“I wish better sense prevails and ushers in a change in attitude towards us,” said Arif, clearly worried about the big question — what next after him?",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/maet1h/article30515109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th09bad,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/a-bastion-of-badminton-goes-to-seed/article30515110.ece

Reigning world champion Sindhu, seeded sixth, took just 35 minutes to beat Evgeniya Kosetskaya of Russia 21-15 21-13 in the first round.

The other Indian in the fray, London Olympics bronze medallist Saina needed just 36 minutes to get the better of Belgium’s Lianne Tan.

The unseeded Saina brushed aside Tan 21-15 21-17 in just 36 minutes of action. This was the first time the two were facing each other.

Both Sindhu and Saina have struggled recently making a series of early exits with the former failing to defend the World Tour Finals crown last month.

9,2020/01/08,ASB Classic | Serena-Wozniacki pair dazzles,"Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki prolonged their one-time-only doubles partnership on Wednesday when they reached the semifinals of the ASB Classic.

Playing together for the first time in their careers, Serena and Wozniacki defeated top-seeded Johanna Larsson of Sweden and Caroline Dolehide of the United States 6-2, 6-1 after beating Nao Hibino and Makoto Ninomiya of Japan in their opening match.

The pair will not play together at the Australian Open, which will be Wozniacki’s final Grand Slam tournament before retirement, but for an exhibition against Serena in Copenhagen in May. For that reason, the Auckland tournament offers the only chance for fans to savour the sight of two former world singles No. 1s playing as a partnership.

The match against Larsson and Dolehide, both accomplished doubles partnerships, was the toughest test for Serena and Wozniacki. Larsson has 13 doubles titles and Dolehide has been a U.S. Open doubles semifinalist.

Serena was a driving force in their win on Wednesday, dominating the court, though she paid tribute to Wozniacki who, she said, “never missed.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/d1h70o/article30516362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09WOZNIACKI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/asb-classic-serena-wozniacki-pair-dazzles/article30516363.ece
10,2020/01/08,Sharapova slams 'second-hand' Brisbane event as men take over,"Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova said the Brisbane International felt like “a second-hand event” with women relegated to outside courts to make way for men playing the inaugural ATP Cup.

The WTA tournament is being run alongside the Brisbane leg of the men's new team tournament, which has taken over centre court at the Queensland Tennis Centre.

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens blasted organisers on Tuesday, accusing them of favouring the male players and not respecting women, with Sharapova also weighing in.

“You definitely recognise it and notice it,” she said, with even Australian world number one Ashleigh Barty, who is his hugely popular in Brisbane, relegated to an outside court.

“It feels like a little bit of a second-hand event.”

The ATP Cup's last round-robin matches in Brisbane are on Wednesday, meaning the women can only play on centre court from Thursday.

Under the ATP Cup's innovative tournament rules, on-court coaching is allowed and team zones are in the corners of the court, rather than on the sidelines by the umpire.

Sharapova, who crashed in the first round to American Jennifer Brady on Tuesday evening, suggested this could be a reason why women were not allowed to share centre court.

“It's definitely a bit of a strange strategic move,” she said of favouring the men.

“I'm not sure (but) I heard that because the way that the court is constructed, that it's not regulation for us to be playing on centre court with the benches on the side.

“I don't know what else it might be that's preventing (us playing there), because I think there's a lot of girls that are deserving of that centre court spot in this draw.

“Everyone should have a conversation about it, that's just my outside view,” she added.

Barty heads a high-quality field in Brisbane, which includes four of the women's top five.

Stephens, who is on the WTA players' council, said it was clear women had been sidelined.

“We just weren't in the conversation to even be considered,” she said.

“It was what the ATP wanted they got what they wanted, girls to the side, that's kind of how it always is.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/b5xyv4/article30509940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSHARAPOVA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/sharapova-slams-second-hand-brisbane-event-as-men-take-over/article30509941.ece

“An important incident has happened. The question of revenge is another issue,” Mr. Khamenei said in a speech. “Military actions in this form are not sufficient for that issue. What is important is that America’s corrupt presence must come to an end in this region.”

Iran launched over a dozen missiles at al-Asad and Erbil military bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani by the U.S.

President Hassan Rouhani also said that Iran would not “retreat in the face of America”. “If America has committed a crime... it should know that it will receive a decisive response... If they are wise, they won’t take any other action at this juncture.”

“They cut off the hand of our dear Soleimani. The revenge for him is to cut off America’s feet from this region,” Mr. Rouhani added.

The attack emboldened Iran’s allies in Iraq, who ramped up threats to avenge top Iraqi paramilitary commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was killed with Soleimani.

Paramilitary chief Qais al-Khazali, who has been blacklisted as a “terrorist” by the U.S., said Iraq was preparing its response for Muhandis’s death. “That response will be no less than the size of the Iranian response. That’s a promise,” he threatened.

The brazenness of the strike was highly unusual for Iran, which has tended to disguise attacks through its use of proxy Shia forces.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/we-will-end-us-presence-in-west-asia-iran/article30516812.ece
14,2020/01/08,"Trump avoids escalating crisis, says Iran is 'standing down'","U.S. President Donald Trump on January 8 backed away from days of angry rhetoric against Iran as the two countries tried to defuse a crisis over the American killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.

In an address from the White House, Mr. Trump said the United States did not necessarily have to respond militarily to Iranian missile attacks on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq overnight.

He said no Americans were harmed in the strikes.

“The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it,” the U.S. President said in an address, flanked by Vice-President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and military officers.

He urged world powers to quit a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that Washington withdrew from in 2018 and work for a new deal, an issue that has been at the heart of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran has rejected new talks.

“Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” he said.

Mr. Trump stopped short of making any direct threat of military action against Iran but said the United States “will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime” in response to what he called “Iranian aggression”.

He offered no specific measures.

Iranian forces fired missiles at military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq on January 8 in retaliation for the killing last week in Iraq of Iranian general Soleimani, raising the stakes in its conflict with Washington amid concern about a wider war in the Middle East.

Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressing a gathering of Iranians chanting “Death to America,” said the missile attacks were a “slap on the face” of the United States and said U.S. troops should leave the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said the strikes “concluded” Tehran's response to the killing of Soleimani, who had been responsible for building up Iran's network of proxy armies across the Middle East. He was buried in his hometown Kerman on Monday after days of national mourning.

“We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” he wrote on Twitter.

Nuclear deal

Mr. Trump's address was in contrast to his harsh rhetoric on Iran in recent days. The Republican President had vowed to strike back disproportionately if Iran retaliated strongly against Soleimanis killing.

Mr. Trump on Saturday said the United States had targeted 52 Iranian sites, including ones that are important to the country's culture. He was criticised for that remark even by U.S. political allies and later backtracked, saying the United States would obey international law on the issue.

On January 8, Mr. Trump again vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and urged world powers to quit a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that Washington abandoned in 2018 and work for a new deal, an issue that has been at the heart of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran has rejected new talks.

There was no immediate reaction from Iranian officials to Mr. Trump's comments. The semi-official Fars news agency described the U.S. President's remarks as a “big retreat from threats.”

Mr. Trump's reaction in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's attacks had been to say on Twitter that “All is well!” and that Washington was assessing damage.

That tweet and the comment by Iran's foreign minister had acted to soothe some initial concerns about a wider war and calmed jittery financial markets. Oil prices slipped back after an early spike.

U.S. and European government sources said they believed Iran had deliberately sought to avoid U.S. military casualties in its missile strikes to prevent an escalation.

But an Iranian Army spokesman had denied “foreign media reports” suggesting there had been some kind of coordination between Iran and the United States before the attack to allow bases to be evacuated, Fars news agency said.

The U.S. President was impeached last month and faces an election in November.

Iranian state television said Iran had fired 15 ballistic missiles from its territory at U.S. targets in its neighbour Iraq early on January 8. The Pentagon said al-Asad air base and another facility in Erbil in Iraq were struck.

Iranian television reported an official in the supreme leader's office as saying the missile attacks were the “weakest” of several retaliation scenarios. It quoted another source saying Iran had lined up 100 other potential targets.

Avoiding conflict

But analysts said Iran wanted to avoid any conventional military conflict with superior U.S. forces.

U.S. officials said Soleimani was killed because forces under his command planned attacks on U.S. targets, although they did not provide evidence.

After the Iranian missile attack, state television showed footage of the burial, with hundreds of people chanting “God is greatest” when the strikes were announced over loudspeakers. “His revenge was taken and now he can rest in peace,” Iranian television said.

Friction between Iran and the United States rose after Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, approved by his predecessor Barack Obama, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran slashing its vital oil exports.

In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Khamenei ruled out any resumption of talks with Washington on the 2015 nuclear pact.

Before Soleimani was buried, his body was taken on a tour of cities in Iraq and Iran, drawing huge crowds. A stampede at his funeral on Tuesday killed at least 56 people.

Hours after Iran fired the missiles at the bases in Iraq, a Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, bursting into flames and killing all 176 people on board. Officials said speculation about what happened was premature.

16,2020/01/08,Won’t give black boxes to U.S.: Iran,"Iran’s aviation authority said it would not hand over to Americans the recovered black boxes of a Boeing 737 that crashed on Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers and crew.

“We will not give the black boxes to the manufacturer (Boeing) and the Americans,” Iran Civil Aviation Organisation head Ali Abedzadeh said, quoted by Mehr news agency.

“It’s not yet clear which country the black box will go to for the investigation,” he added.

Following the crash of Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight PS752 shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, Iran said it had recovered the Boeing 737’s two black boxes.

Mr. Abedzadeh said that based on global aviation rules, it was the right of the country where air crashes occur to carry out the investigation. “This accident will be investigated by Iran’s aviation organisation but the Ukrainians can also be present during the incident’s investigation,” he added.

Under the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization, of which Iran, Ukraine and the U.S. are all members, air crash investigations are led by the country where the accident occurred.

However, according to aviation experts, the countries that are capable of analysing black boxes are few — notably Britain, France, Germany and the U.S. France’s Accident Investigation Bureau, which handles air crash investigations, said it has not received any request from Iran.

The airline said the Boeing 737 had been built in 2016 and checked only two days before the accident. It was UIA’s first fatal crash.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2pe23v/article30516074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-plance-crash,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wont-give-black-boxes-to-us-iran/article30516075.ece
17,2020/01/08,Carlos Ghosn hits out at Nissan and Japan,"Carlos Ghosn, speaking publicly for the first since his dramatic escape from Japanese justice, told reporters in Beirut he had been treated “brutally” by Tokyo prosecutors and was the victim of a conspiracy to oust him from the helm of automaker Nissan.

Wearing a blue suit and red tie and speaking defiantly, the one-time titan of the car industry told a packed news conference on Wednesday he would not have faced a fair trial in Japan and would have been tied up in appeals there for five years.

The 65-year-old fled Japan last month where he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.

Mr. Ghosn said he had escaped to his childhood home of Lebanon to clear his name. He declined to say how he fled, noting there were conflicting stories about his departure.

“You are going to die in Japan or you are going to have to get out,” he said, describing his feelings. “I felt like the hostage of a country I served for 17 years,” he told reporters crowded into Lebanon’s seaside Beirut press syndicate.

Others waited outside in heavy rain, including some Japanese media who had been excluded from the briefing.

“The charges against me are baseless,” Mr. Ghosn added, repeating his allegation that Nissan and Japanese authorities colluded to oust him following a downturn in Nissan’s fortunes and in revenge for French government interference in the carmaker’s alliance with Renault.

Mr. Ghosn’s news conference marks the latest twist in a 14-month saga that has shaken the global auto industry, jeopardised the Renault-Nissan alliance of which Mr. Ghosn was the mastermind and increased scrutiny of Japan’s judicial system.

“Defendant Mr. Ghosn’s allegations completely ignore his own conduct and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable,” the Tokyo prosecutor’s office said after Mr. Ghosn spoke.

Mr. Ghosn said he had no intention of merging Renault with Nissan as some in Japan feared, but wanted to put the firms under a holding company that would have maintained a balance between the French carmaker’s push for a union and the Japanese company’s desire to remain autonomous.

Mr. Ghosn named Masakazu Toyoda, an independent director at Nissan and a special adviser to the Japanese Cabinet; Nissan’s ex-auditor Hidetoshi Imazu; and the car company’s former executive vice-president Hitoshi Kawaguchi as the main architects of his downfall.

Mr. Imazu, Mr. Kawaguchi and officials at Nissan could not immediately be reached for comment.

“First, if he (Mr. Ghosn) has anything to say, he should do that openly in court before he leaves Japan illegally. A conspiracy story without any evidence sounds like a joke,” one person referred to by Mr. Ghosn told Reuters.

18,2020/01/08,EU chief warns U.K. must compromise to get Brexit trade deal,"The European Commission’s President warned Britain on Wednesday that it won’t get the “highest quality access” to the European Union’s market after Brexit unless it makes major compromises.

Ursula von der Leyen said negotiating a new U.K.-EU trade deal will be tough, and that “with every choice comes a consequence.”

Britain is due to leave the EU on January 31 and begin an 11-month transition period while the two sides negotiate a new economic relationship. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the U.K. is seeking a free trade deal, but doesn’t want to agree to keep EU rules and standards.

Britain wants to be free to diverge from EU rules and standards in order to strike new trade deals around the world. Downing Street said that when Mr. Johnson meets Ms. von der Leyen later on Wednesday, he “will likely underline that the upcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious FTA [free trade agreement], not on alignment.”

That could cause problems. Speaking in London before her meeting with Mr. Johnson, Ms. von der Leyen warned that “without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world’s largest single market.”

Ms. von der Leyen is due to visit Mr. Johnson at 10 Downing Street later on Wednesday for the first time since the British leader’s election victory last month.

Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a substantial parliamentary majority, giving him the power to end more than three years of wrangling and take the U.K. out of the EU on January 31.

Britain’s departure will be followed by a transition period in which the U.K.-EU relationship will remain largely unchanged while the two sides negotiate a new trade arrangement.

EU officials say it will be hard to strike a new deal in just 11 months. But Mr. Johnson’s office said on Wednesday that “both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement to conclude on time.”

The European Commission president cautioned that “you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership” by the end of 2020. Mr. Johnson insists he will not extend the transition period beyond December 31.

But, Ms. von der Leyen said, “we are ready to work day and night to get as much of this done within the time frame we have.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c8buq7/article28494260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKEU-JOBSVONDERLEYEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-chief-warns-uk-must-compromise-to-get-brexit-trade-deal/article30513902.ece
19,2020/01/08,Netanyahu warns of ‘resounding blow’ if Iran attacks Israel,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Wednesday that Israel would strike a “resounding blow” if attacked by arch foe Iran, as regional tensions soar after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general.

“Anyone who attacks us will receive a resounding blow,” the premier told a Jerusalem conference after Iran launched a salvo of retaliatory missile strikes on bases used by U.S. troops in Iraq.

Mr. Netanyahu has described the target of last week’s U.S. drone strike — Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards foreign operations arm — as a “terrorist-in-chief”.

“Qasem Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people, he destabilised many countries for decades, he sowed fear and misery and anguish and he was planning much worse,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

“He was the architect and driver of Iran’s campaign of terror throughout the Middle East and the world.”

The Israeli premier praised U.S. President Donald Trump for “acting swiftly, boldly, and resolutely” in killing Soleimani in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.

The drone strike has put the United States and key allies on alert for Tehran’s response to the killing.

20,2020/01/08,2019 second hottest year on record: EU,"2019 was the second hottest year on record and ended the hottest decade in history, the European Union’s climate monitoring service said on Wednesday.

Data released by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) showed that worldwide temperatures last year were second only to 2016, in which temperatures were boosted by an exceptionally strong El Nino weather event.

Average temperature in 2019 was only a few hundredths of a degree below the 2016 level.

The five warmest years in record have all occurred in the last five years and the period of 2010-2019 was the hottest decade since records began, C3S said.

Globally temperatures in 2019 were 0.6 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average. Earth’s temperature over the last five years was 1.1C-1.2C hotter than pre-industrial times.

Last year was Europe's hottest ever.

“2019 has been another exceptionally warm year, in fact the second warmest globally in our dataset, with many of the individual months breaking records,” said Carlo Buontempo, head of C3S.

C3S also said that atmospheric carbon concentrations continued to rise in 2019.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jq79d7/article30513630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCEEUROPEHEATWAVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2019-second-hottest-year-on-record-eu/article30513631.ece

22,2020/01/08,Australia orders evacuation as new bushfire threat emerges,"Australian officials issued fresh evacuation warnings on Wednesday ahead of a forecast spike in the intensity of uncontrollable bushfires that have devastated vast swathes of countryside and sent smoke clouds as far away as Brazil.

Residents of Victoria state’s fire-ravaged east were urged to leave before another heatwave raises the bushfire danger, while in South Australia state authorities began relocating people from a small community on Kangaroo Island.

“Leave, and leave early,” Victoria police minister Lisa Neville urged those in the danger zone.

“Everything we’ve done in terms of issuing warnings has been about saving lives, and today I’m asking people to continue to heed the messages that we are giving,” added Ms. Neville.

The catastrophic bushfires have been fuelled by a crippling drought that has turned forests to tinder and exacerbated by climate change, which scientists say is increasing the length and intensity of Australia’s fire season.

Authorities on Wednesday confirmed that a fourth firefighter had died while battling the blazes, bringing the overall death toll to 26 people.

More than 2,000 homes have been destroyed since the crisis began in September and approximately eight million hectares (80,000 square kilometres) has been burned.

University of Sydney scientists estimate that one billion animals have been killed in the fires. The figure includes mammals, birds and reptiles, but not frogs, insects or invertebrates.

Smoke from the fire has been spotted more than 12,000 kilometres away in Brazil and Argentina, weather authorities in the South American countries said.

Despite days of cooler weather and rainfall in parts of the country’s east, dozens of areas continue to burn out of control, and Australians are bracing for yet another heatwave that could spark fresh fires.

The country experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius which was recorded in mid-December.

Each time the mercury has risen in recent months, the risk of deadly blazes has also soared.

Unprecedented in scale even in bushfire-prone Australia, the fires have shocked the world and prompted an outpouring of support from celebrities, athletes and leaders around the globe.

Authorities warn that the disaster still has weeks or months to run. Residents have begun returning to fire-raved towns to assess damage, but the cost of the disaster was still unclear.

The Insurance Council of Australia says claims worth Australian $700 million had already been filed and the figure was expected to climb significantly.

23,2020/01/08,"Magnitude 4.5 earthquake hits near Iran nuclear plant, injuring seven","A magnitude 4.5 earthquake on Wednesday rattled an area less than 50 kilometres from Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant near the country’s Gulf coast, a US monitor said.

The quake, which had a depth of 10 kilometres, struck 17 kilometres south-southeast of Borazjan city at 6:49 am (local time), the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website.

State news agency IRNA said the earthquake was felt in Bushehr.

There were no reports of any damage to the nuclear facility.

But seven people were injured, including four who were hospitalised, IRNA reported, citing the head of Bushehr’s crisis management centre, Jahangir Dehghani.

“The crisis management team is in the region and assessing the damage” to buildings, he said in the report published hours after the earthquake struck.

The latest quake comes exactly a fortnight after a magnitude 5.1 earthquake hit the same area, without causing any casualties or major damage.

The Bushehr plant, which produces 1,000 megawatts of power, was completed by Russia after years of delay and officially handed over in September 2013.

In 2016, Russian and Iranian firms began building two additional 1,000-megawatt reactors at Bushehr. Their construction was expected to take 10 years.

Iran’s Gulf Arab neighbours have often raised concerns about the reliability of the Bushehr facility and the risk of radioactive leaks in case of a major earthquake.

The Islamic republic is seeking to reduce its reliance on oil and gas with 20 nuclear power plants planned over the coming years.

Its nuclear programme is at the centre of a dispute with the United States, which suspects Iran is trying to obtain a weapons capability, something Tehran vehemently denies.

US-Iran tensions have risen sharply since May 2018 when President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 accord that gave Tehran relief from sanctions in exchange for limits on the programme.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yzqhpd/article30511412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08Bushehr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-magnitude-45-earthquake-hits-near-irans-nuclear-power-plant/article30511403.ece
24,2020/01/08,"Car bomb kills 3, wounds 6 at checkpoint in Somali capital","A car bomb exploded at a checkpoint in Somalia’s capital on Wednesday morning, killing three people and wounding six others, a local official said. The al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group quickly claimed responsibility.

Salah Omar, a spokesman for Mogadishu’s Mayor, told the blast occurred as soldiers conducted searches at a checkpoint. He said the bomb attached to the vehicle was remotely detonated.

Al-Shabab often targets checkpoints, hotels and government offices in Somalia’s capital despite being pushed out of Mogadishu years ago.

Wednesday’s attack follows a devastating truck bombing in Mogadishu on December 28 that killed at least 78 people, including many university students. It was the worst attack in Mogadishu since the devastating 2017 truck bombing that killed hundreds.

On Sunday, al-Shabab fighters overran a key military base used by U.S. counter-terror forces in neighbouring Kenya, killing three American Department of Defense personnel and destroying several U.S. aircraft and vehicles. The U.S. later sent in additional troops to increase security at the base and adjacent Manda Bay airfield.

It was the first attack by al-Shabab against U.S. forces in Kenya, a country long targeted by the extremist group for sending troops to Somalia to fight it.

The latest attack in Mogadishu again raises concerns about the readiness of Somali forces to take over responsibility for the Horn of Africa country’s security in the coming months from an African Union force.

26,2020/01/08,"Snipers to cull up to 10,000 camels in drought-stricken Australia","Snipers took to helicopters in Australia on Wednesday to begin a mass cull of up to 10,000 camels as drought drives big herds of the feral animals to search for water closer to remote towns, endangering indigenous communities.

Local officials in South Australia state said ""extremely large"" herds have been encroaching on rural communities — threatening scarce food and drinking water, damaging infrastructure, and creating a dangerous hazard for drivers.

It comes after Australia experienced its hottest and driest year on record in 2019, with the severe drought causing some towns to run out of water and fuelling deadly bushfires that have devastated the country's southeast.

The five-day cull in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands — home to about 2,300 indigenous people in the north-west of South Australia — is the first in the state, local media reported.

""These (camel) groups are putting pressure on the remote Aboriginal communities in the APY Lands and the pastoral operations as the camels search for water,"" the APY Lands executive committee said in a statement.

South Australia's environment department, which is supporting the aerial cull, said the drought had also created ""critical animal welfare issues"" as some camels have died of thirst or trampled each other as they rush to find water. ""In some cases dead animals have contaminated important water sources and cultural sites,"" a spokesperson added.

Camels were first introduced to Australia in the 1840s to aid in the exploration of the continent's vast interior, with up to 20,000 imported from India in the six decades that followed. Australia is now thought to have the largest wild camel population in the world, with official estimates suggesting more than one million are roaming the country's inland deserts. The animals are considered a pest, as they foul water sources and trample native flora while foraging for food over vast distances each day.

Traditional owners in the APY Lands have for years mustered and sold off feral camels but more recently they have ""been unable to manage the scale and number of camels that congregate in dry conditions"", according to the environment department.

As a result, ""up to 10,000 camels will be destroyed in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare"", it added. Public broadcaster ABC reported the animals would be killed away from communities and the carcasses burned.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v09rdk/article30511018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUSHKARFAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/snipers-to-cull-up-to-10000-camels-in-drought-stricken-australia/article30511019.ece
27,2020/01/08,Analysis: What is next in Iran-U.S. conflict?,"Five days after Major General Qassem Soleimani, the Quds Force chief, was killed in a U.S. air strike outside Baghdad airport, Iran on Wednesday launched ballistic missile attacks at American troops in two military bases in Iraq.

Also read: Analysis | The importance of Qassem Soleimani

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has said that the attacks on the Erbil and Al-Asad bases were a retaliation for the killing of the General, who was one of the top military leaders of the country and the main architect of Iran’s foreign security and intelligence operations. Initial reports suggest that there are no American casualties, though damage and military assessments are still under way. Whether there were American casualties or not, this is a pivotal moment in the U.S.-Iran tensions as this is the first time Iran is launching a direct attack at the U.S. troops and owning it up.

Practically, these are acts of war, though there’s no formal war declaration. First, the U.S. took out an Iranian military leader in a third country and now Iran has struck U.S. troops. Javad Zariff, the Iranian Foreign Minister, said, “Iran took and concluded proportionate measures in self defence under Article 51 of [the] UN Charter targeting base from which [the] cowardly armed attack against our citizens and senior officials were launched.”

The Article allows states take action in self-defence when they are under attack. Mr. Zariff has added that Iran doesn’t seek “escalation or war, but will defend ourself against any aggression”.

Limited attack

The Iranian response was expected. The call for revenge was reverberating throughout the procession rallies of Soleimani. A mosque in the Shia holy city of Qom in Iran had unfurled a red flag indicating that war was coming. Kataib Hezbollah, a unit in the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), the umbrella organisation of Iraqi Shia militias that Soleimani helped build, had asked Iraqi forces to stay away from the bases that house American soldiers, indicating that U.S. troops in Iraq could be targeted. Iran has launched a calculated, limited strike that doesn’t cause much damage to the Americans but yet makes good on its pledge for revenge. It is an escalating step, but not yet an all-out war.

By hitting the U.S. base in Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran may also be sending a message to Washington. Erbil houses not just American soldiers but also a large American consulate. The U.S. has deep ties with the Iraqi Kurdistan and it would like to keep some U.S. troops in the autonomous region even if its forces are forced to pull back from the rest of Iraq. It’s to be noted that most Kurdish lawmakers had boycotted Sunday’s Iraqi Parliament session in which lawmakers passed a resolution to expel American troops from the country. For the U.S., some troops in Iraq are necessary to retain its presence in Syria. So Iran’s message was that, ‘you’re not safe in Erbil’.

Possible scenarios

So what’s next? If there are no American casualties, a red line drawn by President Trump — the latest spell of crisis was triggered by the death of an American civilian contractor in a rocket attack by a pro-Iran militia in Iraq — he could shrug the Iranian response off and choose not to retaliate, which could be a de-escalating step. But there are several scenarios that could lead the conflict to an all-out war. First, if Mr. Trump orders air strikes inside Iran, it would trigger further military response from Iran and the conflict will immediately spiral out of control.

Second, even if Mr. Trump steps back from further retaliation, Iran could target U.S. troops inside Iraq through its proxies such as the Badr Brigade and Kataib Hezbollah. That will drag the U.S. into a deeper conflict. Third, the Shia militias operate with relative autonomy. Tehran may not be micromanaging them. Infuriated by the loss of their commander, they could act without authorisation from Tehran against U.S. troops in Iraq, which could trigger a harsher response from the U.S. against Iran, dragging both countries into war.

In the event of a war, the U.S. can carry out devastating air strikes inside Iran, while Iran could trigger multiple conflicts in the region through its proxies such as Hezbollah, the PMF and al-Houthis, besides launching ballistic missile attacks at the U.S. interests and allies. The Revolutionary Guard commander threatened on Wednesday before a mourning crowd in Kerman, Solaimani’s hometown, that Iran would set ablaze “the place the U.S. loves”, in a reference to Israel.

28,2020/01/08,"’All is well,’ says Trump after Iran missile attack","U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first reaction after Iran’s missile attack on two American bases in Iraq, insisted that “all is well” and promised to make a statement to the nation on Wednesday morning.

On Tuesday night, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces’ are stationed in Iraq, the Pentagon said.

According to Iranian state TV, the attacks were in revenge for the killing of the commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards, General Qasem Soleimani, in a U.S. drone strike on Friday, which was ordered by President Donald Mr. Trump .

Shortly after the missile attacks, Mr. Trump tweeted, “All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!”

He also promised to make a statement to the nation on Wednesday morning (local time).

“We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

Mr. Trump ’s tweet came after his reported meeting with his national security team, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper.

Trump meets national security team

Though there was no official confirmation of the meeting, Pompeo and Esper were seen entering the White House on late Tuesday night.

According to the White House, President Mr. Trump spoke with Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and thanked him for his country’s strong partnership with the US. The two leaders discussed the situation in Iraq and Iran, as well as other critical bilateral and regional issues.

Mr. Trump also telephoned Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel and the two leaders discussed the security situation in the Middle East and Libya and agreed to continue close coordination moving forward, the White House said.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Mr. Pompeo telephoned Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and updated him on the Iranian missile attacks on Iraqi air bases, including in Erbil.

Meanwhile the Democratic party leadership continued to blame Mr. Trump for the escalating tensions in the Middle East.

“What’s happening in Iraq and Iran today was predictable. Not exactly what’s happening but the chaos that’s ensuing,” former US vice president Joe Biden said, blaming the situation on Mr. Trump ’s decisions of withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and ordering the missile strike in which Iranian general Soleimani was killed.

“Some of the things he’s (Mr. Trump ) done and said in the meantime have been close to ludicrous, including threatening to bomb holy sites...I just pray to God as he goes through what’s happening, as we speak, that he’s listening to his military commanders for the first time because so far that has not been the case,” the Democratic presidential contender said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is closely monitoring the situation following the bombings targeting US troops in Iraq.

“We must ensure the safety of our service members, including ending needless provocations from the Administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence. America & world cannot afford war,” she tweeted.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened Iran of dangerous consequences in the event of an attack from them.

“If Iran does anything that they shouldn’t be doing, they are going to be suffering the consequences, and very strongly,” he told reporters at the White House.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/acz2ce/article30321604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DONALDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/all-is-well-says-trump-after-iran-missile-attack/article30510779.ece

In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) assured the Indian missions in Iraq will function normally to help Indians as the Ambassador of Iran here assured de-escalation and urged for mediation by India.

“In view of the prevailing situation in Iraq, Indian nationals are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to Iraq until further notification. Our Embassy in Baghdad and Consulate in Erbil will continue to function normally to provide all services to Indians residing in Iraq,” stated the travel advisory issued by the MEA.

The Ministry urged Indians in Iraq to remain vigilant of the evolving situation especially after Iran fired missiles at Al Asad airbase and at a U.S. base in Erbil in retaliation for the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3.

The Embassy of Iran here opened a book of condolence for the assassinated general who is credited with defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Inaugurating the book, Iran’s Ambassador Ali Chegeni said, “Iran does not want escalation of tension and hostilities with the United States and is willing to consider if India wishes to mediate. We will welcome such initiatives.” The Ambassador met 1971 war veteran Major Chandrakant Singh who was among the first to sign the book of condolence for Soleimani.

Paying tribute to Soleimani, Major Chandrakant Singh described him as a strong friend of India in West Asia. “General Soleimani helped us when our citizens were abducted in Yemen. It was he who had negotiated with the Houthis to free our citizens. That apart, he was instrumental in ensuring the safety of Chabahar port.”

30,2020/01/08,Japan seeks arrest of Carlos Ghosn's wife Carole amid efforts to snare him,"Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Carlos Ghosn's wife for alleged perjury, as officials stepped up efforts to bring the fugitive car industry boss back to face trial on financial misconduct charges.

The former Nissan Motor, and Renault chairman fled to Lebanon last month from Japan, where he has alleged there was a government-backed coup to oust him.

A senior Japanese Ministry of Justice official said staff were poring over Lebanese laws to find a way to bring back Ghosn and that Japan “will do whatever it can” to put him on trial.

Also read: How Ex-Nissan chief jumped $14 million bail to escape to Lebanon

In Beirut, the justice minister confirmed that prosecutors had received a “red notice” arrest warrant from Interpol in respect of Ghosn and would take the necessary action.

The ministry said nothing had been received from Japanese prosecutors relating to an arrest warrant for his wife, Carole, who is in the Lebanese capital.

The Japanese warrant accuses her of falsely claiming not to know, or to have met, people connected to a company that received payments from Nissan Motor, part of which it subsequently transferred to a firm owned by Ghosn.

Japan's ambassador to Lebanon, Takeshi Okubo, met President Michel Aoun on Tuesday to request “greater co-operation on this in order to avoid negative repercussions for our friendly relations”, according to Aoun's office.

Ghosn is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first such appearance since his arrest in November 2018 and his dramatic flight to Lebanon, his childhood home. .

‘Speak freely’

“Last time Carlos Ghosn announced a press conference and got re-arrested. This time, the day before he is announced to speak out freely for the first time, they issued an arrest warrant for his wife Carole Ghosn,” a spokeswoman for Ghosn told Reuters in Beirut. “The issuance of this warrant is pathetic.”

Ghosn is expected to detail some of the claims he has made against Nissan since his arrest.

Citing an interview with Ghosn, Fox Business reported that he said he has “actual evidence” and documents to show there was a Japanese government-backed coup to “take him out”. He plans to identify those he believes responsible, the broadcaster said.

In earlier court filings seen by Reuters and statements released by his lawyers, Ghosn says he was unseated to destroy any possibility of a merger between Nissan and Renault, accusing Nissan executives of colluding with prosecutors and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry officials.

Ghosn's legal team also said prosecutors withheld evidence, citing concerns voiced by Nissan that it included sensitive information about operations and employees.

Nissan said that despite Ghosn's flight from Japan the company still held him responsible for “serious misconduct”.

“The company will continue to take appropriate legal action to hold Ghosn accountable for the harm that his misconduct has caused to Nissan,” the automaker said in a statement.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, on Tuesday described Ghosn's escape to Beirut via Istanbul as “regrettable” and said Tokyo had asked Lebanon for help. “It's necessary to carefully consider the legal systems of both countries,” he told a news conference.

Lebanon does not normally extradite its citizens.

Turkish-based MNG Jet, operator of the private planes Ghosn used to escape, said half of the $350,000 flight contract was paid from Dubai by a company called Al Nitaq Al Akhadar, which it did not know.

MNG said last week it was not aware Ghosn used its jets and has blamed an employee it said falsified documents to transport him from Osaka to Beirut.

31,2020/01/08,"Ukrainian aircraft crashes in Iran, all 176 on board killed","A Boeing 737 aircraft belonging to Ukraine International Airlines carrying 176 people crashed on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s main airport, killing all onboard, state media reported.

The plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in the Iranian capital when a fire struck one of its engines. The pilot of the aircraft then lost control of the plane, sending it crashing into the ground.

The plane carried 167 passengers and nine crew members from different nations on its flight to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The crash killed all on board, Iranian emergency officials and Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry have confirmed.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy extended his condolences to the families of the victims. His office said he had cut his visit to Oman short and was returning to Kyiv because of the crash. The country’s Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk confirmed the casualty toll.

“Our task is to establish the cause of the crash of the Boeing and provide all necessary help to the families of the victims,” said parliament speaker, Dmytro Razumkov, in a Facebook statement.

Ukrainian authorities have offered to help with the investigation of the plane crash. “We’re preparing a group of specialists in order to help with the search operation and the investigation of the cause of the crash,” Mr. Honcharuk said.

The plane had been delayed from taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport by almost an hour. It took off to the west, but never made it above 8,000 feet in the air, according to data from the flight-tracking website FlightRadar24. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The plane, fully loaded with fuel for its 2,300-kilometer (1,430-mile) flight, slammed into farmland near the town of Shahedshahr on the outskirts of Tehran. Videos taken immediately after the crash show blazes lighting up the darkened fields before dawn.

The majority of the passengers were Iranian nationals, Russia’s RIA Novosti agency reported, citing Iranian authorities. Staff at the Boryspil airport in Kyiv, where the plane was headed, told that passengers on this flight are usually Iranian students coming back to Ukraine after winter holidays.

The crash came hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/86hc3w/article30510853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PLANE-CRASHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukrainian-airplane-crashes-near-tehran-state-media/article30510071.ece
32,2020/01/08,"U.S. troops must leave, says Iraq’s outgoing Prime Minister","Iraq’s outgoing Prime Minister said on Tuesday that the United States had no alternative except pulling its troops out of the country, or else face an impending crisis, as the remains of a senior Iraqi militia commander killed in a US drone strike was brought to Iraq from Iran for burial.

Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who resigned in November amid mass anti-government protests, said Iraq wants a U.S. troop withdrawal to avoid further escalation as tensions soar between American and Iran.

Also Read Who was General Qasem Soleimani and why was he so popular?

His comments came just days after the U.S. airstrike killed Iran’s top general, shortly after he arrived at Baghdad’s international airport. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, senior Iraqi commander of an Iran-backed militia, was also killed in Friday’s strike. His remains were brought back to Iraq from Iran to be buried in the holy southern city of Najaf.

Thousands of mourners followed the procession from the border, chanting America is the great Satan.” We have no exit but this, otherwise we are speeding toward confrontation,” Abdul-Mahdi said in a prerecorded televised speech following a weekly cabinet meeting.

He said the historic decision was necessary, otherwise we will not be taken seriously.”

U.S. troops are present in Iraq based on a request by the government in 2014, when vast swathes of the country were being overrun by the Islamic State group. But now that IS has been largely defeated, Abdul-Mahdi said, the mission has devolved into a US-Iran proxy war.

Iraq was barely starting to recover from the devastating four-year war against IS when mass protests erupted in October against the country’s ruling elite, forcing Abdul-Mahdi to resign two months later. He hasn’t been replaced.

Islamic State threat

Referring to the fight against Islamic State extremists, he said: Iraq did its part to fight in the war, and I see that any harm to Iraq will be harmful to all regional states and the whole world.

Iraq’s Parliament passed a non-binding resolution to request that the government expel foreign troops from the country on Sunday, in the wake of the US airstrike. The vote was pushed by pro-Iran political factions but appeared to have the support of Shiite lawmakers from rival camps.

The session was boycotted by Kurdish and many Sunni lawmakers who opposed the decision or took issue with elements of the resolution.

Though the death of Soleimani is stoking broader regional tensions and fears of more violence, in Iraq, the killing of al-Muhandis drove a wedge between Iraq and the US.

Officials in Baghdad consider the strike to be a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, as al-Muhandis, who was also the deputy head of the Popular Mobilization Forces, was assassinated on Iraqi soil without their approval or knowledge.

The PMF is an umbrella group of mostly Shiite militias and a component of Iraq’s armed forces.

Politically in Parliament, there is cross-bloc support (to oust US troops), said Sajad Jiyad, managing director of Bayan Center, an Iraqi think tank.

Even people nominally pro-U.S., anti-Iran or neutral are not happy with what the Donald Trump regime has done, and believe its a dangerous escalation. The common denominator is this was an infringement on sovereignty, he said.

Al-Muhandis’ remains had been taken to Iran for DNA testing. They were sent back through the Shalamsheh border crossing to his hometown of Basra in southern Iraq before being transferred to the holy city of Najaf for burial late Tuesday.

Thousands of mourners in Basra’s city center gathered to receive the body. Many waved banners of the Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades, that al-Muhandis founded. The US has blamed the group, which is separate from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, for a rocket attack in northern Iraq in late December that killed a US contractor. That prompted the airstrike last week.

Amid threats of vengeance from Iran, the US-led military coalition in Iraq had said it was putting the battle against IS militants on hold to focus on protecting its own troops and bases.

Confusion over withdrawal

A letter leaked to social media from the commander of the US task force to Iraqi military authorities has also caused confusion among officials over the US intentions to withdraw militarily.

A letter from Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III to his Iraqi counterpart dated Monday had said the US-led coalition would be repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement. Many media outlets initially reported that was formal notice that the U.S. was withdrawing forces on Iraqi soil.

US Defense Secretary Mark Esper later clarified to reporters that there was no plans for American. troops to leave Iraq. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the letter had been an honest mistake. Abdul-Mahdi responded that Iraqi authorities had thought the letter was legitimate when it was received, and were blindsided when U.S. officials said it was sent in error.

“After four to five hours it was said that the letter was wrong, Abdul-Mahdi said. The letter clearly indicates a withdrawal. So in the future, what should we do if we get such a request? We should check if it is authentic or not? If we are late, then they will tell us that we are late,” he said.

The Prime Minister’s office had immediately sent the letter to the Iraq foreign minister and Iraq’s ambassador in Washington and other parties, Abdul-Mahdi said. An initial Arabic translation of the letter had contradicted the English version, he added, and another copy was then resent.

We have to hold discussions in order to reach the best ways for a withdrawal, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gvpmoy/article30437491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQ-DISSENTCRACKDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-troops-must-leave-says-iraqs-outgoing-prime-minister/article30509832.ece

""At approximately 5.30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on January 7, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq,"" Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. ""It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil.""

There were no immediate reports of casualties at the bases.

The attacks came after pro-Tehran factions in Iraq had vowed to ""respond"" to a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week.

The White House said in a separate statement that President Donald Trump was ""monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.""

Local security sources told AFP earlier that at least nine rockets had slammed into the Ain al-Asad airbase, the largest of the Iraqi military compounds where foreign troops are based.

Iran claimed responsibility, with state TV saying the Islamic republic had launched missiles on the base.

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi military network, was killed in the U.S. drone strike alongside Soleiman, seen as the ""godfather"" of Tehran's proxy network across the region. Hoffman said the Pentagon was working on initial battle damage assessments following Tuesday's airbase attacks.

There were no immediate reports of casualties at the bases.

The Pentagon said Iran had fired more than a dozen missiles against Ain al-Asad and another installation hosting US and coalition forces near Arbil. It said bases hosting foreign troops had expected an attack and had been on ""high alert"" for days.

36,2020/01/08,Withdrawal of US troops will be ‘worst thing’ for Iraq: Trump,"Pulling out U.S. troops from Iraq will be the “worst thing” for the country, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, after the Iraqi parliament demanded expulsion of American forces.

Some 5,000 U.S. soldiers are deployed in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group. On Sunday, the Iraqi parliament had passed a resolution to terminate the agreement that allows for U.S troops in the country.

Mr. Trump said if Iraq expels U.S. troops now, “I think it’s the worst thing that can happen to Iraq“.

“If we leave that would mean that Iran would have a much bigger foothold, and the people in Iraq do not want to see Iran running the country,” he said.

In a brief interaction with reporters at the Oval Office of the White House, Mr. Trump said at some point the U.S. will want to get out of Iraq.

“But this isn’t the right point. The other thing is, if we do get out, we’ve spent a tremendous amount of money on building airports and building one of the largest embassies we have in the world. We want to be reimbursed to the various costs that we have had,” he said.

“They’re very significant...We don’t want to be there forever... I didn’t want to be there in the first place to be honest and everybody knows that. That was when I was a civilian I said it, but we were there and they made a decision and I disagreed with that decision very strongly, Mr.Trump said.

The president said that but “we’re there now we’ve done a great job. We’ve gotten rid of the caliphate. 100 per cent of the caliphate is gone, which is ISIS”.

The Iraqi parliament’s move comes in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the 62-year-old head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and the architect of its regional security apparatus, in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad on Friday.

37,2020/01/08,Donald Trump donor charged with obstructing inauguration inquiry,"Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a major donor to President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee with obstructing a federal investigation into whether foreign nationals unlawfully contributed to the inaugural celebrations.

The donor, Imaad Zuberi, recently pleaded guilty in a separate case in Los Angeles to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and failing to register as a foreign agent.

A criminal information filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court accuses Mr. Zuberi, a globe-trotting Los Angeles venture capitalist, of taking numerous steps to interfere with the investigation into where the inaugural committee received its funding. Prosecutors say Zuberi backdated a $50,000 check and also deleted emails.

Mr. Zuberi’s defense attorney, Tom O’Brien, declined to comment.

Mr. Zuberi, a prolific fundraiser who has also donated large sums to Democrats, gave $900,000 to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee in the months after the president’s 2016 election.

The criminal complaint says that donation was in fact funded using money obtained from other sources,” including a would-be inaugural donor The Associated Press has identified as Murat Guzel, a Turkish-American businessman who has ties to the administration of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mr. Guzel, a Democratic National Committee member, has declined to comment. A message was sent to his attorney Tuesday seeking comment.

The inaugural committee has not been accused of wrongdoing, and prosecutors say Mr. Zuberi, who is American, did not inform the committee that his donation included contributions from others. Under federal law, foreign companies and individuals cannot make contributions to U.S. political campaigns.

Mr. Zuberi has been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in both California and New York over millions of dollars in political contributions, including large donations to the inaugural committees of both President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump. Prosecutors also have alleged he offered six witnesses in his case more than $6 million to keep quiet.

In the Los Angeles case, Mr. Zuberi was accused of soliciting donations from foreign nationals and companies and then acting as a straw donor to make donations to several U.S. political campaigns. The charges in that case are centered on contributions he made during the Obama administration.

Prosecutors have said Mr. Zuberi told foreign nationals and representatives of foreign governments he could use his influence to change foreign policy and create business opportunities for clients and himself.

In the New York case, prosecutors said Mr. Zuberi asked Mr. Guzel to make a donation to the inaugural in exchange for exclusive access to certain inaugural events.” Mr. Guzel wrote Mr. Zuberi a $50,000 check but later decided not to attend the inaugural and asked Mr. Zuberi to refund him the money.

Zuberi is accused of backdating a $50,000 check to Mr. Guzel to make it appear he had refunded Mr. Guzel’s donation before news broke that Mr. Zuberi had been named in the federal subpoena to the inaugural committee.

Prosecutors in California have said Mr. Guzel requested Mr. Zuberi invite a high-level foreign government official to Mr. Trump’s inauguration, but that Mr. Zuberi balked at the request.

The AP previously reported that federal authorities granted Mr. Guzel immunity and questioned him about his dealings with Mr. Zuberi and several U.S. lawmakers and foreign officials. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles also named Mr. Guzel in a court filing that was later withdrawn from the record and amended to remove his name.

Prosecutors in California have said Mr. Zuberi worked as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey. His Facebook page previously showed pictures of him with top Turkish officials, including the country’s foreign minister and ambassador to the U.S. around the time of Mr. Trump’s inauguration. The pictures were later deleted.

38,2020/01/08,Iran support militant groups in Afghanistan: Pompeo,"Iran support militant groups and is actively working to undermine the ongoing peace process in Afghanistan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Tuesday, cautioning that Taliban’s entanglement with Tehran will only harm peace talks in the war-torn country.

Speaking with reporters at the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said Iran’s involvement in Afghanistan deserved more attention.

“Most people know about Iran’s proxy networks in the Arab world, but the regime also has a relationship with the Taliban and related groups, such as the Haqqanis, the Tora Bora, and the Mullah Dadullah group. The Taliban’s entanglement in Iran’s dirty work will only harm the Afghanistan peace process,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters at a news conference here.

In Afghanistan, there is an aspect of that conflict that deserves more attention, and that is Iran’s involvement there.

“Iran has refused to join the regional and international consensus for peace and is, in fact, today actively working to undermine the peace process by continuing its long global efforts to support militant groups there,” Pompeo said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has prioritised peace efforts in Afghanistan and his special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has initiated direct talks with the Taliban.

Khalilzad has held several rounds of talks with the Afghan Taliban in order to reach a settlement that would allow the U.S. to withdraw its army and end the 17-year-old Afghan war, America’s longest.

Pompeo, while speaking at his maiden New Year News Conference, also said China needed to honour its commitments made to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration filed at the United Nations, asserting that it was the right path.

Pompeo said the US was aware of Luo Huining’s appointment as the new head of the Hong Kong Chinese Central Government Liaison Office.

“The right path, as I’ve said before, is for the Chinese Communist Party to honour its commitments made to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration filed at the United Nations, a commitment that guarantees the territory’s independent rule of law and freedoms that the Chinese living on the mainland unfortunately do not enjoy,” Pompeo said.

The United States will continue to work with Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party officials to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong, and to promote the financial hub’s high degree of autonomy, he said.

Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous territory which operates under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle - a structure that grants the city’s citizens some degree of financial and legal independence from the mainland.

The city has been shaken by massive, sometimes violent, protests initially organised to oppose a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. These protests have now turned into a wider movement for democratic reforms.

Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China.

Under the “one country, two systems” arrangement, it has more autonomy than the mainland. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China.

Pompeo also commended members of Bahrain’s Council of Representatives for their recent statement in which they expressed deep concern over the inhumane and painful conditions to which Uighur Muslims in China are subjected.

“Bahrain is recognising what I’ve been saying for months: the Chinese Communist Party is committing mass human rights violations and abuses against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims held in detention in Xinjiang,” he said.

“We’re happy with what Bahrain did, and we ask all countries, particularly those belonging to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League, to denounce the Chinese Communist Party’s brutal treatment of Uighurs, which is part of the party’s broader war on faith,” Pompeo said.

China is facing severe criticism from western countries over persistent reports of mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), in bid to control violent attack by the separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM).

U.N.’s Geneva-based Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination last year said that it was alarmed by “numerous reports of mass detention of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sgdzz8/article30507429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-support-militant-groups-in-afghanistan-pompeo/article30507430.ece
39,2020/01/08,Circuses likely to go extinct in India,"With 20 minutes still left to go before the Great Bombay Circus (GBC) troupe starts its 1 pm show at the SIAA Ground in Kannappar Thidal, a man in his thirties comes rushing to the venue’s entrance.

Holding firm onto the man’s left hand is his four-year-old son, but the duo is stopped by PV Jeyaprakashan, the circus troupe’s manager, who informs them that there is still time before they start letting in the audience.

“We’ve come early to find the best seats. Please, can you let us in now?” the man asks, to which Prakash (as he prefers to be called) responds: “Why are you in a hurry? There are only six people here.”

Once upon a time in India

It is a weekday, and schools have re-opened, which makes Prakash’s reduced expectations seem logical. But his answer has more than just happenstance attached to it.

GBC — the oldest circus company in India — may indeed be on its last legs, and it is ironical that this is happening in its 100th year of existence.

“It is tough running the business these days,” says KM Sanjeev, one of GBC’s managing partners, over phone from Mumbai.

The glorious days do not belong in the distant past either. In fact, studying the drop in number of circus-themed films to have released in various Indian languages over the past decade would help one understand the massive drop in popularity of circuses.

There was a point in time when some of tinsel town’s biggest stars (Raj Kapoor, MG Ramachandran, Shashi Kapoor, Prem Nazir and Suriya to name a few) played circus artistes on screen.

Then, there is Thalassery native CK Jayaraj; a man who, more than anybody else in this business, has rubbed shoulders with these stars, either while playing their dupe, or when training them (he was Suriya’s coach, helping the actor prepare for his role in 7aum Arivu).

“I was Shashi Kapoor’s dupe in Insaaniyat (1974) and Raj Kapoor’s in Mera Naam Joker (1970). Those days I fancied the movie business. I even spoke to Shashi Kapoor about it, and he agreed to sponsor my stunt union membership fee. But I did not have the means to relocate to Bombay. So I had to drop my plans,” he laughs.

Sea change

Jayaraj started out in the circus business at the age of 10; his father too was a trainer like him. Now 72, and with a face that belies his age, Jayaraj rues the changes (discounting the wild animals ban) that has crippled the business.

“If you are to become a circus artiste, then one must start preparing for it from a young age,” he notes.

Since 2011, however, when the Supreme Court of India enforced an amendment to the Child Labour Act that prohibits circus companies from employing anyone under the age of 18, the number of Indian performers have gone down starkly, he says.

“I remember when the order came... boss called me and said we cannot continue to work with the 15 children I had trained for several years. I was in tears,” he adds.

The order came in the wake of legitimate concerns about the treatment of child performers by circus companies, but Prakash opts to see it as a “villain” that has threatened the very business that employs and provides for his family.

Without the guarantee of a stable income, families with circus lineage have all opted to steer clear of the business, like Jayaraj’s children.

These changes, in its wake, albeit inadvertently, have helped to increase the diversity quotient at least.

Where once, as Prakash adds, the circus business was “90% Malayalis” — the town of Thalassery has a long connection with the business; Keeleri Kunhikkannan, known as the father of Indian circus and GBC’s founding partner, hails from here; Thalassery was also the place where the Government of Kerala set up its short-lived circus academy 10 years ago — the shortfall in talent opened up avenues for people of Nepali origin and Northeast India.

Making a compromise

Sabina Maharjan, 27, is one of them. Hailing from Hetauda, Nepal, she enthrals the crowd with her ring dance — where she makes over a dozen hoops go in circles around the curves of her body in a rhythmic fashion.

Her three siblings are all in this business. But starting young meant that she had to compromise on education. “I did very little schooling because I got in to circus when I was seven,” she says.

“If you want to be a good circus artiste, you cannot focus on studies,” Jayaraj remarks.

Lesson in history According to Sanjeev, the company’s inaugural show, under the name Grand Bombay Circus, was held in Hyderabad city in Sindh province of modern-day Pakistan.

In 1947, Grand Bombay Circus merged with White Way and Hind Lion Circuses promoted by Keeleri Kunhikkannan’s family to become the Great Bombay Circus.

Since then, the operative control of GBC has rested with the Kunhikannan family — first under KM Balagopal, and then being subsequently taken over by his sons KM Sanjeev and KM Dilipnath.

GBC’s first show in Madras was held in 1979.

When business was at its peak, Sanjeev says GBC used to collect ₹4 lakh from a weekend. “Today, our revenue has fallen by more than 40%.”

Only about seven major circus companies (GBC, Jumbo, Famous to name a few) exist in India today. More than a dozen big circus companies have shut down over the past two decades.

The oldest living example in GBC for the demography that chose work over wisdom is Tulsidas Chowdhury. In 1959, this native of Bihar, went against the wishes of his family and joined the circus. He was a Class VI student then; his diminutive stature (he is three-and-a-half feet tall) and his own personal liking for the business was a big factor in his call.

However, this trend is common everywhere.

Take the case of Yaret Tadesse: the 19-year-old Ethiopian acrobat only studied till secondary school in his home town of Addis Ababa. He is part of a group of six Ethiopians, who are performing at the GBC. His friend, Yosei, at 21, has been to Turkey, China, UAE, Spain, parts of Asia, and other African countries, performing with other circus companies, juggling and keeping the audience spellbound with his unicycle tricks.

But unlike in Chowdhury’s days, the modern-day audience has plenty to choose from, when it comes to witnessing daredevilry.

Television networks have conceptualised reality shows around this idea, and the advent of mobile phones has placed similar content in the hands of people (courtesy YouTube). The consequent drop in revenue (Indian performers are paid an average of ₹1,200 per day while the foreign artistes make ₹1,800 on average; payment varies on quality and calibre of artiste) makes the economics of sustenance disproportionate and not in favour of promoters like Sanjeev.

However, irrespective of GBC’s future, Sanjeev is certain that this is the last time Chennai residents will get to see his performers in action.

“We rent the ground from Southern Railway, and every time we come to Chennai, the ground has shrunk in size. I’m not sure if there will be any ground left in a few years to hold a circus,” he concludes.

40,2020/01/08,Why a Cochin Postal History collection recently won an award in Mumbai,"Did you know that, at an international competition for the most colourful stamps in 1894, Cochin stamps were placed second? That Cochin had stamps on all the important kings of the State? That the early Cochin stamps were printed at Ernakulam and then later in England ? Later on all the stamps were printed at Madras.

MR Ramesh Kumar, president, Goa Philately and Numismatics Society, explains that the Cochin state had a rich postal tradition and history.

He recently won the silver medal for his exhibit on Cochin State Postal History at the PCI National Stamp Show — INPEX 2019 — held in Mumbai in December. It had some of the best stamps and variety of cancellations and postmarks for different purposes,” he says. “The Royal Family had a privilege: they did not need stamps but only had to to sign on the anchal (post office)cover or cards. Cochin postal stamps are in high demand at the international level and they have many philatelic books and studies on them.”

Ramesh Kumar is a meteorologist by training (he has an MSc in Meteorology from Cochin University of Science and Technology) but his

childhood interest in philately expanded to include stamps and covers on weather and climate. In 1986-1987, as a member of the sixth Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica, he began collecting covers and stamps in Antarctica Philately and won a silver medal at the 2017 exhibition.

He says his father, M V Ranganatha Pai, taught him the basics of stamp collection, storing and preservation. “I have been guided and mentored by several people like Balakrishna Das, ex-President of South India Philatelic Association, Chennai; V R Navelcar, ex-Secretary of Goa Philatelic and Numismatics Society; and friends such as E P James, Dr.K S Mohan and O K Prakash of the Philatelic Club, Thrissur.”

Ramesh Kumar’s Cochin Postal History collection was collected slowly over time and procured from serious collectors like H V Kamath, dealers, friends and e-commerce websites like e-bay. The collection includes stamps of kings of erstwhile Cochin Kingdom; cards and covers that depict the letters sent by kings from Tripunithara to their princes in Thrissur; receipts of the money order (called hundi); received letters and covers from neighbouring states such as Travancore, Mysore. There are several Dead Letter Office letters and covers (those that do not reach the addressee and are returned to sender) and Postage Due Letters (when the sender does not enough stamps for the letter and the addressee needs to pay the balance amount) in his collection as well.

The rare covers include pre-adhesive covers or letters that existed before stamps were printed in the Cochin State, perforated stamps, as well as covers with D and KD (Devaswom and Koodalmanikiam Devaswom) respectively. There was also an older version of the Spee

d Post called Express Letters, in which letters were pasted with a large value of stamps and dispatched through train services within the Cochin State so that they would reach their destination quickly.

“The reason I started with the Cochin Postal History was because my basic association with all the places and their anchal offices. I was born in Irinjalakuda and have lived or visited Thrissur, Cranganore, Wadakkanchery, Mattanchery, Ernakulam, Mala, Tripunithara. I also had a close association with friends who were part of the Cochin Royal Family while I stayed in Tripunithara.”

With writing letters going out of fashion, there is a fear that stamps may become extinct. Ramesh doesn’t think so. “India Post issues several stamps regularly. For youngsters as well as seniors, there is a new way of connecting with the people all over the world called Post Crossing, an online project that allows its members to send and receive postcards from all over the world. The Philatelic Bureau in Ernakulam, near the Maharaja’s College Ground, is a great place to nurture this hobby. I have Philatelic Deposit there and they send me various stamps, special covers and First Day Covers (FDC),” he says.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/cug415/article30513556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpRameshstampjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/mr-ramesh-kumars-cochin-postal-history-collection-won-silver-at-a-national-show-in-mumbai-in-december-2019/article30513562.ece

Among JNPT’s five container terminals, APM Terminals Mumbai (GTI) handled 2 million TEUs, DP World NSIGT 0.99 million TEUs and PSA BMCT 0.82 million TEUs.

JNPT’s own terminal JNPCT handled 0.77 million TEUs while DP World’s second terminal DP World NSICT handled 0.52 million TEUs.

Sanjay Sethi, IAS, Chairman, JNPT, said, “This is a result of our efforts and the quality of service we provide. We are confident that JNPT will be achieving another year of excellent performance during this financial year, too. With the aim of encouraging the country’s trade, we ensure that the entire family of JNPT puts in efforts to constantly evolve our operational efficiency and the port’s capacity by maintaining the global standards.”

Besides focusing on operations, JNPT has been working towards facilitating ease-in-doing business. Under this, JNPT facilitated a MoU for a new Inter-Terminal Rail Handling Operation (ITRHO) agreement between all the terminals at the port.

This is now helping maximise train placement, track productivity, efficiency, cost-effective handling, reduce dwell time of import ICD (inland container depot) boxes, connecting export ICD boxes to respective terminals in time and also increase rail share at JNPT.

Port authorities said the dwell time of import containers moved by rail has improved from 116.09 hours in FY18 to 66.16 hours in FY19 along with increase in rail share to 16.22% in FY19 from 14.66% in FY18.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jnpt-handles-higher-cargo-in-2019/article30516860.ece
43,2020/01/08,Affordable housing boosts Shriram Properties’ sales,"City-based Shriram Properties Ltd. has clocked a growth of 20% in the last two years outpacing the sector’s growth of 5% to 6% in the same period, a top official said.

“We have outgrown the market. While the real estate sector grew by 5% to 6%, we grew by 20% over the last two years” said M. Murali, CMD, Shriram Properties Ltd. “This year too, we are on track, having registered a 20% sales growth in the affordable and mid-market housing segment in the last nine months,” he added.

According to him, there is much more supply in nine Indian cities than demand for affordable and mid-market houses (with ticket sizes ranging from ₹40 lakh to ₹80 lakh). However, there are less number of takers for luxury houses costing more than ₹1 crore.

Mr. Murali said the real estate sector had made good progress in the last three to four years, following demonetisation, introduction of Goods and Services Tax and the passage of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. He foresaw consolidation and said ultimately 50 to 60 big players would serve 90% of the demand.

On the ongoing affordable projects in the city, he said they were in the process of completing work on Tower-I of 883 units, located in Perungalathur, spread over 1.1 million sq.ft. six months ahead of schedule and the apartments would be delivered eight months ahead of target date. More than 80% of the dwellings had been sold. Construction work on Tower-II would commence by April 2020.

Asserting that the real estate sector expected a ‘great’ budget, he said the construction major would be entering the capital market after February 2020.

It will be a ₹750-800 crore issue with primary issue accounting for ₹250 crore and the balance secondary issue.

“As of now, we have a very low debt. We can leverage to draw more than ₹1,000 crore. But, we do not need debt money for the next two years,” he said.

45,2020/01/08,L&T Infra Finance lends ₹518 cr. for gas distribution,"L&T Infrastructure Finance, a subsidiary of L&T Finance Holdings, has entered into an agreement with AG&P India Pvt. Ltd., a subsidiary of Singapore-based downstream gas and logistics firm AG&P Group, to provide term loan of ₹518 crore for development of city gas distribution (CGD) networks in South and West India.

“These funds will be used to develop CGD networks of AG&P CGD in Jodhpur, Barmer and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu,” the company said in a statement.

AG&P CGD holds the exclusive licenses to build CGD networks to sell natural gas in these two areas in addition to 10 other areas across India. These networks are being developed to connect millions of people to compressed natural gas (CNG) for their vehicles and piped natural gas (PNG) for their homes and businesses.

In total, AG&P CGD secured twelve 25-year CGD licenses from the Government of India’s Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in the ninth and tenth rounds of bidding. These licences allow AG&P CGD to supply natural gas to 12 areas covering 28 districts in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, making the company the largest foreign player in India’s rapidly developing CGD sector.

AG&P CGD is building over 1,500 CNG stations, supported by at least 1,800 km of steel pipelines which will run across the length and breadth of the geographies awarded, creating thousands of local jobs.

“These critical CGD networks will bring clean and affordable safe fuel to households and consumers who drive as well as to transportation, industrial and commercial. In these areas, this will be the first time these people have access to natural gas,” Abhilesh Gupta, Chief Financial Officer and Commercial Head, AG&P Group, said.

Raju Dodti, chief executive, L&T Infrastructure Finance, said, “This is our first financing transaction in the CGD sector and we expect these projects to aid the development of communities and businesses in these districts, triggered by the resultant reduction in energy costs, employment generation and overall positive impact of cleaner energy on the environment.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lt-infra-finance-lends-518-cr-for-gas-distribution/article30516796.ece
46,2020/01/08,Rising oil prices may hit Budget math,"The price of crude oil constituting the Indian basket has been increasing since October and is likely to exceed $70 a barrel this month on escalating U.S.-Iran tensions.

Rising oil prices had already led to an increase in the prices of petrol and diesel by about 54 paise a litre and 83 paise a litre respectively since January 1, 2020. The Indian basket of crude oil was pegged at $59.70 per barrel in October 2019, rising to $62.54 per barrel in November and to $65.52 in December. It is currently hovering around $70 per barrel.

The price of benchmark Brent oil went up to $71.75 per barrel after Iran retaliated against the U.S. by attacking the latter’s bases in Iraq, but softened to $67.50 a barrel after Iran said that it did not want to further escalate the tensions.

“I think based on the demand-supply scenario, crude oil prices should be around $65 a barrel but we have to add a risk premium of $5 a barrel for few months due to geopolitical tensions between U.S. and Iran. I think Iran will play a proxy war with the U.S. in the coming months,” Mr. Abhishek Bansal, CMD, Abans Group of Companies told The Hindu. According to Mr. Bansal, higher crude oil prices is ‘bad news’ for the Indian economy that imports over 85% of its crude oil requirements. “Higher crude oil prices will be bad for our current account deficit and it will further tighten our fiscal situation. Further, divestment of oil PSUs will become difficult due to higher crude oil prices,” said Mr. Bansal.

Earnings impact

Rising crude oil prices could impact corporate earnings of several sectors, including auto and oil marketing companies, according to analysts.

However, Sanjiv Bhasin, director, IIFL Securities, believes that the market had already priced in crude oil prices for the above sectors.

“Oil has been extremely over-bought and it’s the best time to sell crude oil as it neared $72 a barrel. I think crude will go down by the end of this month,” Mr. Bhasin said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ngql5x/article30516750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBUFUEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rising-oil-prices-may-hit-budget-math/article30516751.ece
47,2020/01/08,U.S.-Iran spat to impact IT sector: HFS,"The U.S.’ latest attack on Iran could have ‘huge’ ramifications on the global economy and therefore, business and growth expectations of the tech industry may have to be tempered, said Phil Fersht, chief tech analyst & CEO of U.K.-based HFS Research.

All kinds of geopolitical events would have a huge impact on the global business landscape and in turn, it would affect IT budgets of enterprises, he pointed out.

“The fall-out from this latest attack on Iran and its implications, on multiple geographies and businesses, could have huge ramifications on the global economy in general, and the tech sector is not isolated,” Mr. Fersht warned.

Echoing similar sentiments, Prashant Shukla, director at U.S.-based Everest Group, said the U.S.-Iran tension was yet to unfold in terms of impact, but it has ‘surely brought in negative sentiment’ to the tech sector at the beginning of 2020.

As per Mr. Fersht, the U.S. market was already worried over the Brexit impact; the political impact on the economy in an election year would further dictate tech spending levels.

Best placed sectors

“The U.K. and Europe is all about post-Brexit compliance and support. Tech firms... those that are steeped in banking, logistics, supply chain and complex data strategy are best-placed and I see all the big six India-heritage providers getting major opportunities to bid on new deals but also facing major challenges in scaling up the talent to deliver,’’ added Mr. Fersht.

Onshore talent shortage, however, would continue to offer tailwind advantage to Indian service providers in 2020, provided they are able to manage upskilling and attrition better and place themselves competitively, observed Mr. Shukla.

“Indian tech providers can continue to grow above the global average if they efficiently explore their vantage points such as access to talent, long-term client relationships and focus on digital-related investments,’’ he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hpbny4/article30516728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBUITSECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/us-iran-spat-to-impact-it-sector-hfs/article30516729.ece

49,2020/01/08,Telcos seek open court hearing on AGR,"Telecom companies, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, on Wednesday urged an open court hearing of their petitions seeking a review of a Supreme Court judgment upholding the recovery of past dues amounting to ₹1.47 lakh crore from them. The recovery by the government was based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about ₹92,000 crore.

The plea seeking an open court hearing was mentioned before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, who said he would take a decision after talking to Chief Justice S.A. Bobde.

On October 24 last year, dealing a huge blow to telecom service providers, a Bench led by Justice Mishra had upheld the Department of Telecom’s (DoT) move to recover AGR of about ₹92,000 crore from them.

The Bench had found that the telecom sector had long reaped the fruits of the Centre’s liberalised mode of payment by revenue sharing regime. “The sector has benefited immensely under the scheme as apparent from the gross revenue trend from 2004 to 2015,” Justice Mishra had written, adding that the service providers had failed to fulfil their obligations to the government and raised frivolous objections.

The Supreme Court dismissed the telecom service providers’ objection to the government’s formulation of AGR.

The judgment had said that the gross revenue would be inclusive of installation charges, late fees, sale proceeds of handsets (or any other terminal equipment etc.), revenue on account of interest, dividend, value-added services, supplementary services, access or interconnection charges, roaming charges, revenue from permissible sharing of infrastructure and any other miscellaneous revenue, without any set-off for related item of expense, etc.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/4r1vo7/article30516535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBUVODFA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/telcos-seek-open-court-hearing-on-agr/article30516536.ece
50,2020/01/08,Mutual Funds’ asset base slips 2% in Dec.,"The mutual fund industry saw its asset base slip by 2% to ₹26.54 lakh crore at December-end, primarily on account of outflow from debt-oriented schemes, including liquid funds.

The 44-player industry logged an all-time high assets under management (AUM) of ₹27.04 lakh crore at November-end, as compared to ₹26.54 lakh crore by the end of last month, representing a decline of 2%, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).

Mutual fund houses witnessed an overall outflow of ₹61,810 crore last month as compared to an inflow of ₹54,419 crore in November.

Fund managers attributed the drop in the asset base to outflow of ₹78,940 crore from debt-oriented schemes.

Among debt-oriented schemes, liquid funds, with investments in cash assets such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper for shorter horizon, witnessed a pull out of over ₹71,000 crore, the highest among the fixed-income segment last month.

Besides, overnight funds, which invest in securities with a maturity of one day, saw outflows of over ₹8,800 crore. However, banking and PSU funds, which have a high allocation to highest rated bonds, received funds to the tune of ₹4,770 crore.

“Fixed income categories, especially those having modified duration or average maturity less than a year, witnessed net outflows during the month. However, this is on expected lines as these categories typically witness net outflows during the quarter end months on account of advance tax payment obligation,” Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager — Research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said.

Naveen Kukreja, CEO at Paisabazaar.com, attributed the decline in monthly asset base to sell-off in debt schemes.

Equity-oriented funds continued to attract investments, tracking the surge in domestic markets in December. Such funds saw a net infusion of ₹4,432 crore last month. In comparison, net flow of ₹933 crore was seen in November and ₹6,015 crore in October.

“The small cap and mid cap indices are underperforming currently. The industry has seen inflows in the large cap funds and it will continue to be the biggest attraction among equity funds,” Mr. Kukreja added.

Collection through systematic investment plans (SIP) surged to over ₹8,518 crore in December from ₹8,273 crore in the preceding month. The asset base of SIPs rose to an all-time high of ₹3.17 lakh crore from ₹3.12 lakh crore, reflecting positive sentiment in equities.

Amfi chief executive N.S. Venkatesh said, “Retail investors continue to repose trust in mutual funds as reflected by continued flows through SIPs, despite challenging domestic economic scenario and global trade issues and conflicts.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/aehxrm/article30516515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09MUTUAL-FUNDS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mutual-funds-asset-base-slips-2-in-dec/article30516516.ece

52,2020/01/08,SBI to extend completion guarantee for home projects,"State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has announced a new product which provides completion guarantee for particular residential projects.

The lender will refund the amount to the home buyer which was paid to the developer if occupancy certificate for the project is not received within a particular time-frame.

The scheme — Residential Builder Finance with Buyer Guarantee (RBBG) — is applicable to home loans from SBI for certain projects that will be identified by the bank.

The scheme will focus on the affordable housing segment with home price of up to ₹2.50 crore in seven Indian cities initially, and will be extended to 10 cities, Rajnish Kumar chairman, SBI, said at a press conference.

“Under this product, all reputed builders fulfilling the prescribed criteria by the bank can avail loan between ₹50 crore and ₹400 crore,” he said.

The time-frame for the completion of the project will be as per the date specified by the respective State government’s Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA).

“We believe that RBBG will build confidence among home-buyers by securing their hard-earned money and at the same time will boost the real estate sector that is under stress,” Mr. Kumar said.

He said the scheme would give home buyers the confidence to buy properties. “The velocity of sales is expected to double,” he said.

SBI and Sunteck Realty Limited (SRL) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the purpose. SBI aims to enter such an agreement with other developers also.

53,2020/01/08,Maruti output rises for second month in a row,"The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki on Wednesday said it had increased vehicle production for the second month in a row in December by 7.88% to almost 1.16 lakh units.

The increase in output in November and December comes after nine consecutive months of decline in production amid slowdown in domestic demand.

In a regulatory filing, the carmaker said it had produced over 1.07 lakh units in December 2018.

55,2020/01/08,Swapan Dasgupta gheraoed at Visva Bharati University,"Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta, who on Wednesday was scheduled to give a lecture at Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, on the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, faced protests by students. Mr. Dasgupta was scheduled to deliver the lecture, ‘The CAA-2019: Understanding and Interpretation’ as a part of the lecture series of the university.

The students, who continued their protest for several hours since Wednesday afternoon, called off their ‘gheraoing’ of Mr. Dasgupta at the university around 10.30 p.m.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Dasgupta had tweeted, “How does it feel to have a mob attack a peaceful meeting on CAA and intimidation [by] students? This is what is happening to a meeting I am addressing at Vishwa Bharati now. Locked into room now with mob outside.”

Speaking to journalists, Mr. Dasgupta described the situation as “Left fascism” and said there were many who want some kind of confrontation. The venue of the lecture was Lipika auditorium but was later Social Works Department. The moment the students knew of the change of the venue they came in large numbers and gheraoed the venue. Mr. Dasgupta, who arrived at the university in the afternoon, was struck at the venue for several hours till late in the evening.

The protesting students had said they would not allow the university set up by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore to be used for “furthering political interest of the party.”

“When there is a nationwide strike how can such a lecture be held at the university.

56,2020/01/08,Team of 17 envoys to visit Kashmir,"The government will take a delegation of foreign envoys and senior diplomats for a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, in an official visit which marks the first time diplomats have been given access to the former State since the dilution of Article 370 in August 2019.

Officials confirmed to The Hindu that arrangements have been made for the delegation of about 17 envoys, that will comprise diplomats from the United States and Norway, four countries in South America and Africa each, and others from Asian countries including Bangladesh and the Maldives.

Envoys of European Union countries who were invited however, decided not to accept the invitation, asking for more freedom to travel and meet people “unescorted”, diplomatic sources said, drawing unfavourable parallels to a visit by a group of European Parliament members (MEPs) who were taken on a “guided tour” under heavy escort in October last year. The government has decided to organise a separate visit for EU envoys at a later date.

Meanwhile, others like Australia, Afghanistan and Gulf countries invited declined due to other commitments. While many Ambassadors are still on winter vacations and have not returned to Delhi, some are dealing with the fallout of U.S.-Iran tensions on the region, diplomats said.

When asked, government sources denied any suggestion that EU envoys had pulled out due to restrictions in the programme, saying the government was unable to accommodate all 28 countries on this trip.

“We wanted to take a global group of envoys to J&K with only some EU Ambassadors, and not all were asked to join,” said an official source. “The group was free to interact with people subject to security considerations. In any case, no Ambassador had specifically asked to meet anyone who was detained,” the source added.

In particular, the EU countries reportedly expressed a desire to meet with the three former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir Dr. Farooq Abdullah, who is also a Member of Parliament, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, all of whom have been in detention for five months now.

“This [access to the Chief Ministers] is not a condition we can accept at this time,” said an official involved in the planning of the visit in Srinagar.

The visit is being criticised by members of the Opposition, as the government has restricted travel for Indian politicians thus far. “It is the Indian parliamentarians who should have the first right to visit Srinagar and speak to people there and reassure them,” said Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, calling the envoy tour an “attempt to whitewash” continuing restrictions in the Valley.

According to the schedule the delegation will travel first to Srinagar and then to Jammu. The Army will brief the delegation at its headquarters at Badamibagh cantonment first and will coordinate meetings for them. Separate groups of local journalists, elected municipal counsellors and village heads, civil society groups and traders are likely to meet the envoys in the hotel. However, the president of the Valley’s association of trade bodies, the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) Sheikh Ashiq said he was not aware of the visit, nor had he been invited to meet with the first round of diplomats.

In Jammu, the delegation is likely to also be shown some tourist spots, and will be hosted by Lieutenant-Governor of the Union Territory Girish Chandra Murmu.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lnkpyr/article30516876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09GOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/team-of-envoys-to-visit-kashmir/article30516877.ece
57,2020/01/08,Home Ministry issues norms to seek legal aid from abroad,"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has said investigating agencies before seeking information about a subscriber’s email account hosted on servers in foreign countries will have to establish that it is linked to a crime. The MHA said it was not enough to show that the accused had an email account as “the account must have something to do with the crime being investigated” and it was “the lowest legal standard required of all investigative processes”.

The MHA issued revised guidelines to streamline the process of seeking legal assistance from foreign countries in criminal matters where it issued directives for drafting and processing Letters Rogatory, Mutual Legal Assistance Requests and service of summons, notices and other judicial documents.

Most intermediaries and social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Yahoo!, Twitter and YouTube have their servers outside India.

The Centre introduced The Persona Data Protection Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha last month that seeks to provide for protection of personal data of individuals and establishes a Data Protection Authority for it.

In the guidelines issued by the MHA to States and other agencies, it stressed on “data preservation” as it was key in the investigation of cyber offences and those involving digital evidence.

The MHA said the G-8 countries’ 24/7 Network was one such channel that could be used to place request for preserving data in real time.

“Accessing the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) creates important records and other information such as customer records, connection information and stored data. This is very important evidence to prove the guilt intention of the accused. Since this type of evidence can disappear quickly, it is of paramount importance to get the data preserved expeditiously through appropriate channels. The request may be sent to the service provider or to the CBI — the contact point in respect of G-8 24/7 Network,” the MHA said.

The G-8 network allows law enforcement agencies to make urgent preservation requests of the digital data before it perishes.

The MHA said all data including personal must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.

“The requested country has to be informed about the time period for which the data is required. Such period shall be consented by the requested country. The transferred data shall be kept for no longer than the period required for the purpose for which it has been received and shall be returned to the requested country or deleted at the end of the period specified.”

An MHA statement said the guidelines had taken into account the concerns raised by various courts for prompt and timely responses in service of documents on persons residing abroad. “As an initiative, the revised guidelines have provision for service of documents on authorities of foreign country preferably within 10 days of receipt of request in respect of offences committed against women and children,” the MHA statement said.

60,2020/01/08,Tigers return to patchy south Bengal forests,"Almost 20 months after a tiger was killed when it strayed into the forests of south Bengal, officials in West Bengal on Wednesday confirmed the presence of tigers in the fragmented, patchy forest of south Bengal. Unlike in 2018, when a male tiger had come to the forest in search of territory, this time, it is a female tigress with a cub.

“We have got no photographic evidence, but the pug marks indicate that it is a tigress and a cub,” Ravi Kant Sinha, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, West Bengal told The Hindu. He said tracking teams, trap cages and tranquilisation teams have been stationed in the forests from Monday.

‘Need translocation’

Mr. Sinha said that the forests of south Bengal are not suitable habitat for a tiger, and the tigers need to be rescued and translocated elsewhere.

Prior to 2018, for almost 100 years, there has been no record of a tiger in south Bengal. The last recorded evidence of tigers, in Lalgarh, Midnapore, in 1911, is seen in the Bengal District Gazetteers authored by LSS O’Malley. The report points out that carnivores in Midnapore were then represented by tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, foxes and jackals.

In 2018, the first evidence of a tiger’s presence was seen in February, with photographs from camera traps. Before the forest officials could rescue the big cat, the tiger was killed allegedly by locals in second week of April 2018.

Mr. Sinha said that, like in 2018, he was not certain from where the tigress and the cub had come into the forest of south Bengal. “All we know is that the nearest tiger habitat is about 300 km away, either in Jharkhand or in Odisha,” he said.

Causing alarm

The presence of tiger in forested areas with inhabited villages in their fringes have caused considerable alarm. On Tuesday, Rabindranath Pramanik, a villager from Pathatchapri village in Binpur, reported seeing a tiger cub. The villager said that before he could do anything, the cub had disappeared into the forest.

Forest officials are keeping their fingers crossed that the tigress and cub don’t meet the same fate as the male tiger that had strayed into the south Bengal forests in 2018.

Mr. Sinha said that in 2018, the male tiger remained most of time in the Paschim Medinipur forest, but on this occasion, the tigress was staying more in the forests of the Bankura district, an area less than 100 km from where the male tiger was spotted in 2018.

‘Tiger dispersal’

The forests in south Bengal are called Jangalmahal, a patch criss-crossing the three districts of Purulia, West Medinipur (also Jhargram) and Bankura, which have become fragmented because of increase in agricultural activities.

According to experts, the phenomenon of “tiger dispersal” occurs when lack of territorial space and prey base in a particular habitat results in the dispersal of male tigers. A number of examples have come to fore, where male tigers have travelled hundreds of kilometres in search of territory. Experts say that it is only under extreme stress that female tigers come out to look for new territories.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z04qp1/article30516755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2018-03-18-PHOTO-00000066,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tigers-return-to-patchy-south-bengal-forests/article30516756.ece
61,2020/01/08,Jammu and Kashmir to restore movie theatres with Jio Cinema,"Internet may be off in Kashmir since August 5, the J&K administration has come up with major plans to restore other spaces of entertainment for the youth including cinemas and open-air theatres in Srinagar and at all district levels.

An official said the Jio Cinema is in touch with the J&K administration to provide content at identified locations. The administration has asked all deputy commissioners to identify land to start open air theatres across the Valley.

There is also a plan under consideration to convert the famous Tagore Hall, a cultural centre here, into a cinema hall. At least 11 cinema halls were closed in Kashmir in the 1990s as militancy raged, with many militant outfits issuing calls to close them down.

In 1996, the Farooq Abdullah-led government opened two cinema halls, Broadway and Neelam, but they failed to attract local youth and were closed. In 1999, the re-opened Regal cinema screened ‘Pyar Koyi Khel Nahi’ but stopped it when militants hurled a grenade in the first week of its opening.

Scores of local artists assembled at the central market on Tuesday and held a silent protest against the move to convert the Tagore Hall into a cinema hall.

“We came to know that the Tagore hall will be converted into a cinema. It is our cultural identity. The government can use the buildings of old cinemas for the purpose,” said Nissar Naseem, an artist.

Farooq Fayaz, a local writer, said Tagore Hall is the hub of theatre. “We are worried.

“The so-called third front comprise those who dislodged the government in 1984 when Dr. Farooq Abdullah was the chief minister. These people have got no public appeal and the people have rejected them and will continue to do so,” said NC MP Akbar Lone.

The NC on Tuesday held a meeting of the party functionaries, delegates, block presidents, constituency in-charges and block secretaries, in an apparent move to revive the party’s political activities that came to a halt after August 5.

The meeting comes just a day after a joint delegation — comprising Syed Altaf Bukhari, ex-PDP minister; Ghulam Hassan Mir, president of the Democratic Party Nationalist and ex-minister; Dilawar Mir, ex-PDP minister; Zaffar Iqbal, former MLC; Javed Hassan Beig, Noor Mohammad Shiekh, Choudhary Qamar Hussain and Raja Manzoor Ahmad, all former legislators — met the Lieutenant Governor and demanded restoration of statehood.

“The same people from time to time were being used by the Central government; but I am telling you that we are determined and these forces will not be allowed to succeed. They are similar to that of a use and throw commodity,” said Mr. Lone.

The NC leader said his party is not going to contest elections till the pre-August 5 status is restored and will “not accept domicile laws or land guarantees.”

“These people [of third front] are proposing such things. We will not accept it in any form,” he said.

He said the NC has challenged abrogation of Article 370 in the Supreme Court and pursue the case.

A PDP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said the so-called third front was “a smokescreen to divert local and global attention from real issues faced by the people of J&K.”

Another PDP leader Firdous Tak said it was surprising that those opposing Article 370 are now demanding constitutional guarantees on land and jobs, while referring to the BJP’s promises to safeguard locals’ interests.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/third-front-doing-centres-bidding-says-national-conference/article30516398.ece

Speaking to a Bengali TV news channel after reaching the city on Wednesday, Mr. Sen questioned how those who were beaten up by “masked outsiders” were named in the FIR lodged by the Delhi Police.

On the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Mr. Sen who has been vocal against the Narendra Modi government, said it should be scrapped.

The professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard University said, “Some outsiders came and tortured the students of the (Jawaharlal Nehru) University and indulged in lawlessness there. The University authorities could not stop it and even the police could not come on time.

“... They (police) have failed to nab anybody till date. I have heard that the cameras (CCTVs) were not working.

“I have also heard that there were some problems in their (police’s) report and that’s why that cannot be submitted. And instead, an FIR was lodged against those who got beaten up.

“That there is a big absence of justice in this matter is very conspicuous,” Mr. Sen said.

Violence had broken out at JNU on Sunday night as masked men armed with sticks and rods attacked students and teachers and damaged property in the campus, prompting the administration to call in police which conducted a flag march.

At least 28 people, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, were injured.

On the Citizenship Amendment Act, Mr. Sen said it should be scrapped and the Supreme Court should turn it down on grounds of it being unconstitutional.

“I think the CAA must be scrapped because it cannot be an Act ... That’s the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in the Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution,” the Nobel laureate added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/spbghh/article26390630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28KRAAMARTYASEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amartya-sen-criticises-police-role-in-jnu-violence-says-caa-should-be-scrapped/article30516066.ece
65,2020/01/08,Congress Working Committee convenes meet on anti-CAA protests,"The Congress has convened on Saturday a meeting of its working committee, which is the highest decision-making body of the party, to discuss the ongoing student protests following violence in JNU and the nationwide agitation against the amended Citizenship Act.

Party leaders including general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former president Rahul Gandhi have been meeting the families of protesters who have been killed or injured during the agitations.

Ms. Vadra is also going to Varanasi on Friday to meet the students of Banaras Hindu University and other civil society members who were arrested for opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The party on Wednesday slammed the government for filing an FIR against the JNU Students Union president Aishe Ghosh, who was attacked by a masked mob on Sunday night.

“The FIR in the JNU case has been registered against the victim and not the perpetrator of the crime, this is the new normal,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters. He alleged that there is unrest and anger in the country and that every section of society feels disturbed and apprehensive.

“Be it the 45-year record high unemployment, price rise, unkept promises or arrogant attitude of the government, the result can be seen. There is anger and apprehension across the country,” he said.

Meanwhile, the party also sent a four-member fact-finding team to JNU to probe Sunday night’s incidents. The team comprising All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, party MP from Ernakulam Hibi Eden, former NSUI president of JNU unit Syed Nasser Hussain and former NSUI president and ex-president of Delhi University Students Union Amrita Dhawan interacted with students on the issue. The team spent over nine hours at the campus. They visited the rooms that were attacked at Sabarmati Hostel and also had a meeting with JNU Teachers Association.

“We have spoken to the students, teachers and even those affiliated to the ABVP and right-wing organisations. We will be coming up with a factual report in a day or two. The students are still shaken and will bear the scars for a long time to come,” Mr. Eden told The Hindu.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/klxr3w/article30516514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9TH-CONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-working-committee-convenes-meet-on-anti-caa-protests/article30516010.ece
66,2020/01/08,Asthana case: HC questions CBI for again seeking time,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the CBI Director to be present before the court on February 10 if the agency fails to complete investigation into the bribery case allegedly involving its former special director Rakesh Asthana.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru questioned the agency for repeatedly seeking extension of time to complete the probe. The CBI had last month asked the court for extension of time.

The FIR was registered on October 15, 2018 against Mr. Asthana, then Deputy Superintendent of Police Devender Kumar and alleged middleman Manoj Kumar Prasad and others on a written complaint of Satish Babu Sana containing allegations of harassment and extortion in connection with investigation of a case related to meat exporter Moin Akhtar Qureshi.

Money extortion

Mr. Sana had alleged that he was harassed to extort money and had already paid ₹3 crore on different occasions.

After dismissing the pleas of Mr. Asthana, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Prasad to quash the FIR registered against them, the High Court had on January 11, 2019, directed the CBI to complete the probe in 10 weeks. The court had pointed out that the allegations of bribery against Mr. Asthana could only be known after a thorough inquiry.

Subsequently, the court has been extending the time for the investigation on the CBI’s plea. It granted the agency four more months on May 31, 2019 to conclude the probe.

The time was extended again on October 9, 2019, for two months. The court said the investigation could not be delayed indefinitely.

67,2020/01/08,"Workers, bank staff, students go on strike against government’s labour policies, CAA","Industrial workers, bank employees and students went on a strike on Wednesday in parts of the country against what they termed the anti-labour policies of the government as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Ten central trade unions had issued a call for the ‘Bharat bandh’ to demand that the government halt the merger of public sector banks, disinvestment of pubic sector undertakings and the ongoing process of codification of 44 labour laws. With the government passing the CAA in Parliament in December and protests against the law breaking out across the country, the unions demanded that the law be rolled back.

Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said there was a bandh in Kerala, Tripura, Assam, Bihar, Punjab, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Goa. At a protest march in Delhi’s ITO area, Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, said the Narendra Modi government was trying to help employers “in the name of ease of doing business” by bringing out four labour codes. With industrial workers, bank employees and drivers’ union, students from the Ambedkar University Delhi and other institutes joined the march.

Partial in Delhi

However, the impact of the strike was partial in Delhi, with post offices, banks and transport services running smoothly. But workers in some factories in the industrial areas of Okhla and Wazirpur, where protest marches and picketing took place, struck work.

Nearly 25 crore people will participate in the all-India strike on January 8, 2020, the central trade unions claimed as they called for 'Bharath Bandh' against the government's 'anti-people' policies. Life came to a halt in several parts of the nation following the strike. Most shops, business establishments and markets were shut. Public transport was largely off the roads. A view of the protest observed in Coimbatore on Wednesday as a part of the nationwide strike. Several trade unions jointly organised a march at Palakkad, Kerala. The day-long strike called by central trade unions was near total with vehicles keeping off the roads. A group of bank employees assembled at Azad Maidan, Mumbai as they take part in the strike. Security personnel detain students who were protesting during the nationwide strike in Patna. Members of various trade unions staging a protest in Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu. Members of all trade unions gather for the Bharat bandh at Vannarpettai in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. Bank employees taking out a protest rally during the nationwide strike in Bhopal. Leaders and workers of Left parties taking out rallies at a main road in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Student union leaders blocking the bus depot at Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh in support of the all-India bandh. Members of various trade unions participate in a protest march against the government’s anti-labour reform policies, in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Anganwadi volunteers raise slogans during the nationwide strike called by central trade unions in Bihar.

In West Bengal, incidents of violence and arson were reported, with buses, a police vehicle and government property being vandalised by those trying to enforce the strike.

Life was hit in Kerala, with the public transport services off the roads and banking services cut. The 24 hour strike was total in the state. Roads wore a deserted look as Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private buses, auto-rickshaws and taxis did not ply. A few private vehicles were seen on the roads.

In Madhya Pradesh, banking and postal services were hit. Income tax officials also struck work, along with anganwadi and cement factory workers, and insurance company employees.

The strike evoked mixed response in Punjab, while in neighboring Haryana, partial impact was seen. Members of different outfits of public sector banks, farmers, state roadways and post offices in both the States protested at several places while it rained. Members of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee protested to draw the government’s attention to the widespread agrarian distress. Several farmers did not send anything (vegetables, dairy produce etc.) for sale to the urban areas.

The bandh call had partial impact in Bihar. Transport and business establishments were open at most of the places. However, banks were closed and customers had to rely on ATMs to withdraw money. In Patna, bandh supporters took out a protest march holding red flags and shouting slogans against the government’s policies. At the Rajendranagar railway terminal, some bandh supporters tried to disrupt the movement of trains but the railway police force dispersed them by use of mild force.

In the National Capital Region’s Ghaziabad, hundreds of workers protested under the banner of CITU in the Sahibabad Industrial Area.“The Yogi Adityanath government tried to terrorise workers by showing the fear of Section 144, but by turning out in large numbers in an inclement weather in Ghaziabad and Noida, the workers have shown they are united against the anti-labour polices of the BJP,” said Anurag Saxena, general secretary of CITU’s Delhi-NCR unit.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi supported the strike, saying the Modi government's “anti-people and anti-labour” policies have created catastrophic unemployment in the country.

“The Modi-Shah Government's anti people, anti labour policies have created catastrophic unemployment and are weakening our PSUs to justify their sale to Modi's crony capitalist friends,"" he said in a tweet. “Today, over 25 crore workers have called for Bharat Bandh 2020 in protest. I salute them,” he said.

INS Sumedha, presently on an anti-piracy patrol in Gulf of Aden, rescued the dhow, a traditional wooden vessel, on January 6, they said.

“‘Al-Hamid’ was detected by an Indian Navy’s helicopter launched from the deck of INS Sumedha, which confirmed that the vessel was in distress and drifting near the coast of Somalia,” the Navy said in a statement.

A boarding team, along with a naval technical team, embarked on ‘Al-Hamid’ for routine checks onboard and rendered assistance, it said.

“The crew of ‘Al-Hamid’ comprised 13 Indian citizens. The technical team assessment revealed that the dhow had suffered a broken main engine shaft, which was not repairable at sea. The dhow was then towed to safety, away from the Somali coast,” the statement added.

Meanwhile, the owner of ‘Al-Hamid’ has sent another vessel for towing the dhow to port for repairs.

Before departure, INS Sumedha provided fresh water and medical supplies to the crew of the dhow, the officials said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ins-sumedha-rescues-traditional-vessel-al-hamid-after-it-drifted-near-somalian-coast/article30515548.ece

The NEHU, based in Shillong, has campuses in other parts of the northeast.

The JNU alumni in Meghalaya and citizens’ groups gathered in Shillong’s Khyndailad to register their protest against an “authoritarian regime out to muffle the voices of democracy”.

Apart from the violence in the JNU, the protesters panned the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) which they said was aimed at making India a Hindu nation.

A section of students and teachers of the Gauhati University, the Cotton University (Guwahati), Dibrugarh and the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati also expressed solidarity with their JNU counterparts. The protests were organised by the SFI.

The All Assam Students’ Union too condemned the JNU incident.

“We cannot accept such an attack on the students of a prestigious institute like the JNU. We demand exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime,” its chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya said.

According to top sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the idea for such a series of interactions (eight till now and seven more to follow), came after Mr. Modi addressed the centenary meet of the industry body, ASSOCHAM, on December 20 last year. “During his speech there, Prime Minister Modi had asked for honest feedback from industry on the economy, and the meetings have followed after that,” said a source.

72,2020/01/08,Make re-grassing after mining mandatory: Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered that mining lease holders should be held responsible for re-grassing mined areas so that biodiversity gets a second chance in these scarred landscapes.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde ordered the government to include re-grassing of mined areas as a mandatory condition in every mining lease, environmental clearance and mining plan across the country.

The Bench learnt that environmental issues caused by mining include erosion, formation of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes. In fact, the effects of coal mining persist for years, the court was told.

“We see no reason why the area which has been mined should not be restored so that grass and other vegetation, including trees, can grow in the mining area for the benefits of animals. We are of the view that this can be achieved by directing the Union of India to impose a condition in the mining lease and a similar condition in the environmental clearance and the mining plan to the effect that the mining lease holders shall, after ceasing mining operations, undertake re-grassing the mining area and any other area which may have been disturbed due to their mining activities and restore the land to a condition which is fit for growth of fodder, flora, fauna, etc.” the Supreme Court directed in a four-page order.

The government was ordered to file an action taken report in three weeks.

The Bench directed the government to devise the necessary methods to ensure compliance by mining lease holders. The cost of re-grassing the mined area and wherever damaged would be entirely borne by the licence holder.

The mandatory re-grassing would be in addition to the other conditions to restore biodiversity imposed on the licence holder in the mine closure plan.

“An area which is mined results in complete elimination of grass which in turn denies fodder to the herbivores. The only solution can be re-grassing of such mined areas. It is not in dispute that re-grassing technology is available in this country,” Chief Justice Bobde recorded in the order.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvg2qb/article30496646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/make-re-grassing-after-mining-mandatory-supreme-court/article30514775.ece
73,2020/01/08,Minority institutions’ appointments: Supreme Court to examine plea to stay January 6 ruling,"Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde on Wednesday agreed to examine next week a plea to stay a Supreme Court January 6 judgment, which declared that the State is well within its rights to regulate the appointment of teachers to minority-run institutions in the “national interest”.

The judgment, delivered by a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit in S.K. Mohd Raffique versus Managing Committee, Contai Rehmania High Madrasah and Others, gave the State an absolute right to impose regulations on minority established and administered institutions in the appointment of teachers, saying the step was necessary to achieve excellence in education in these institutions.

Contai Rehmania Madrasah Committee, represented by senior advocate Salman Khurshid, made an urgent mention that the judgment by the Bench was contrary to the Court’s consistent stand expressed in Constitution Bench decisions like the T.M.A Pai case of 2002 that minorities have a fundamental right under Article 30 of the Constitution to administer their institutions and appoint teachers.

Contai said the Bench had even contradicted a Court judgment as recent as September 25, 2019 that upheld the rights of the minority communities to establish and run their own institutions without government interference in day-to-day affairs of management like the appointment of teachers. The September 25 judgment in Chandana Das (Malakar) versus State of West Bengal was pronounced by a three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman.

The petition said the Constitution Bench in the TMA Pai case was clear that “regulatory measures of control should be very minimal” and “matters of day-to-day management like appointment of staff, teaching and non-teaching, and administrative control over them, the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency”.

The petition said the judgment segregated a particular community from the privilege of protection under Article 30. It asked what exactly was the “national interest” in regulating the day-to-day functioning of minority educational institutions

The 151-page judgment, authored by Justice Lalit for the Bench, had held that the managements of minority institutions cannot ignore a regulatory regime for appointment of teachers as long as the law ensures the standard of excellence in education.

The January 6 judgment was based on a petition challenging the validity of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act of 2008. The State Act mandated that the process of appointment of teachers in aided madrasahs, recognised as minority institutions, would be done by a commission and its decision would be binding. Justice Mishra’s Bench had upheld the 2008 Act.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/40zkni/article27211594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/minority-institutions-appointments-supreme-court-to-examine-plea-to-stay-january-6-ruling/article30514697.ece

“An elected government that refuses to heed the voice of its people or respond to their anger is bound to lose their confidence and collapse,” said the Punjab CM, adding that the BJP’s stance on the issue smacked of a “dangerously fascist approach that would lead to their [the BJP’s] eventual downfall”.

‘CAA discriminatory’

Capt. Amarinder said that as far as his government was concerned, there was no way it would allow the brazenly divisive Act to be implemented in Punjab. “You cannot force us to do so,” he said, even as he reiterated that neither he nor the Congress was against grant of citizenship to persecuted minorities in other countries, such as Sikhs in Pakistan, but they were completely opposed to the discrimination in the CAA against certain religious communities, including Muslims.

“Despite the nationwide public outrage over the controversial CAA, the BJP-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government at the Centre was refusing to acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the legislation,” said the Punjab Chief Minister, hitting out at Mr. Chauhan for his “shockingly inconsiderate remarks” on the issue.

Spontaneous outrage

In a statement, Capt. Amarinder said Mr. Chauhan had ""absolutely no idea what he was talking about, nor had he bothered to study the Act"", which has triggered massive public protests across the country. These protests, he said, were not “the brainchild of the Congress’ or any other party”, as Mr. Chauhan was claiming, but the result of a spontaneous outrage among Indians cutting across religious and party lines.

“Does Chauhan really believe that the lakhs of people, including youth and students, who had come out on the streets to brave bullets and lathis, were Congress supporters?” asked Captain Amarinder. “Can’t he or the other BJP leaders hear the voice of these protestors, majority of whom have no personal stake in the matter?” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/yf5cn4/article30514276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NorthIndia1NoG0D6QUJUU3-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-will-pay-heavy-price-for-stubbornness-on-caa-says-capt-amarinder/article30514128.ece

Nobody objected to such expression of opinions, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters when asked at a Cabinet briefing about Ms. Padukone’s visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on January 7 to express solidarity with the students who were attacked by a mob.

About the call given by some party functionaries to boycott her upcoming movie, the Minister said he had not read their remarks but sought to underscore the significance of his statement, saying he is stating so as a Minister and a “permanent” BJP spokesperson.

“This country is a democracy. Why only artistes, even a common can go anywhere and express his opinion,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister said.

To questions about violence in JNU where masked people attacked students on January 4 night, Mr. Javadekar expressed confidence that the ongoing police probe will “unmask” the accused and asserted that violence has no place in a “mature democracy” like India.

“We are a mature democracy and everybody has the right to express their opinion. Violence has no place, especially in universities where people go to study,” he said.

Mr. Javadekar added that some unions in JNU had earlier decided to stop students from registering in semesters.

“We should not forget that this is an important issue. Stopping students from semester admission is anti-education,” he said.

At a briefing after a Cabinet meeting, Mr. Javadekar was asked about the violence on the JNU campus on Sunday. He said: “This is a democratic country, any common person, why only an artiste, anyone can go anywhere and give their opinion. There is no objection to it.”

Asked about the calls to boycott her film, he said: “I have not read it. But, I am telling you, I, a BJP Minister and spokesperson, permanent.”

Mr. Javadekar said there was need to remember what happened in the university last week. “Last week, registration for the next semester started in JNU. All students were registering when some unions decided they will not allow this. They locked the server and did not let anyone use it. We should not forget this important issue. This is not the point of education, it is against education.”

The Minister said he had faith in the the police that they would get to the bottom of the matter. “Whoever committed the violence will be found. The masked people will be unmasked,” he added.

“In light of the tensions within the Iranian airspace a decision to temporarily reroute flights of Air India (AI) and Air India Express (AIX) overflying Iran has been taken. This may lead to increase in flying time by approximately 20 minutes for flights from Delhi and 30 to 40 minutes for flights from Mumbai,” said the airline’s spokesperson.

81,2020/01/08,"Govt to provide ₹5,559 crore funding to northeast gas grid","In only the second instance of the government directly funding a gas pipeline, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday approved a ₹5,559 crore viability gap funding for the proposed northeast gas grid, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

The 1,656-km North-East Natural Gas Pipeline Grid will connect Guwahati in Assam to major cities in the region such as Itanagar, Dimapur, Kohima, Imphal, Aizwal, Agartala, Shillong, Silchar, Gangtok, and Numaligarh. The pipeline will enable the supply of piped cooking gas to households and CNG to automobiles, besides fuel to industry.

However, in the absence of anchor customers, the ₹9,265 crore pipeline is not economically viable.

The CCEA headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved “a viability gap funding of 60% of the project cost,” Mr. Pradhan said at a post-Cabinet press briefing here.

The North-East pipeline grid is to be implemented by Indradhanush Gas Grid, a joint venture of state-owned GAIL India, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL).

The consortium had pitched for a 60 per cent funding support from the government and would raise the rest via equity and debt. Without government support, the pipeline will not be viable.

This is the second time that a gas pipeline project in the country will be funded by the government.

In 2016, the government provided a capital grant of ₹5,176 crore, or 40% of the project cost of the 2,655-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra (JHBDPL) gas pipeline project, which GAIL is currently executing.

GAIL is also laying a 750-km line from Barauni to Guwahati as part of the ₹12,940 crore JHBDPL project, which is also known as the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga’ project. This is proposed to be connected to the North-East via the Indradhanush grid.

All other pipelines in the country have been funded by public or private sector companies. Mr. Pradhan said the project is critical towards implementing the government’s Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for the North-East.

The vision envisages the development of the region by leveraging its hydrocarbon potential, enhancing access to clean fuel and accelerating the growth.

“About 20% of India’s natural gas production comes from the North-East. Out of about 75 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output, 15 mmscmd come from North East,” Mr. Pradhan said. “Currently Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura have established gas production potential while there are possibilities for the same in Nagaland and Manipur.”

The funding support to the gas grid is a part of a broader goal of the government to raise the share of natural gas in the country’s energy mix to 15% by 2030 from current 6.2%.

The government has envisaged developing the National Gas Grid. At present, about 16,788 km natural gas pipeline is operational and about 14,239 km gas pipelines are being developed to increase the availability of natural gas across the country.

“Quantum of viability gap funding (VGF) would be capped at 60 per cent of estimated project cost and would not be linked with upward capital cost variation,” an official statement issued after the CCEA briefing said.

For effective monitoring of the project implementation, a committee comprising of officials from Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Development of North East Region, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, and Department of Fertilizers, may be formed, which would periodically review the progress in its implementation and take steps to smoothen out any issues in execution.

Pradhan said the gas pipeline grid will be developed in the eight states of the North-Eastern region -- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.

The capital grant will provide natural gas supplies to various types of consumers and would help in substituting liquid fuels. “The pipeline grid would ensure reliability and uninterrupted natural gas supplies to the consumers which otherwise gets severely affected due to various reasons in this part of the country,” the statement said.

“Availability of natural gas across the region is expected to boost industrial growth without impacting the environment and would offer better quality of life to the people in general due to use of cleaner and green fuel,” it said, adding the move will boost exploration and production of gas in the region and help in early monetisation of natural resources.

Possibility of installing bottling plants for LPG can be explored for reducing transportation cost, it said, adding the uninterrupted supply of LPG and other value-added products can be ensured in the region which will bring energy security to the people in the area.

82,2020/01/08,Asked govt for separate CISF cadre to secure courts: CJI,"Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde revealed in open court on Wednesday that he has asked the government to provide a “separate and dedicated cadre” of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) for security cover to court complexes across the country.

The CJI said such a force would thwart sudden spurts of violence like the one recently seen at the Tis Hazari court complex between lawyers and the police.

The court took into consideration a suggestion made by amicus curiae and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra that the lawyer community should also be taken on board while taking decisions in this regard. The three-judge Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, issued notice to the Bar Council of India (BCI) to respond in two weeks.

The development came while hearing a writ petition filed by Pradyuman Bisht in 2015 to improve security in courts and tribunals by installing closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras.

In March 2017, the apex court directed that CCTV cameras be installed in courts and important locations of court complexes in at least two districts in every State and Union Territory. The monitor of these cameras should be placed in the chamber of the District and Session Judge concerned.

The apex court had, in its order, made it clear that footage from the cameras would not be made available to the public under the Right to Information Act or without the permission of the high court concerned.

The court had also considered the issue of CCTV cameras in tribunals. It had directed the installation of cameras in subordinate courts in a phased manner.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/d9gbh8/article30334929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17-KDR-SC---NGG36S41RK4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/asked-govt-for-separate-cisf-cadre-to-secure-courts-cji/article30513076.ece
83,2020/01/08,SC to examine Dalit Christians’ plea that reservation should be “religion neutral”,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine a plea that Dalit Christians or Christians of Scheduled Castes origin should enjoy the same quota benefits reserved for Scheduled Castes.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the government on a writ petition filed by the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC) that reservation for government jobs and admissions in educational institutions should be made “religion neutral”.

Appearing for NCDC, advocates Franklin Caesar Thomas and S. Gowthaman, submitted that “change in religion does not change social exclusion. Caste hierarchy continues to hold fort within Christianity even though the religion forbids it”.

The petition said, “Allow and extend the Scheduled Caste status to Christians of Scheduled Caste origin for availing special privilege in education, getting scholarships, employment opportunity, welfare measures, affirmative actions, right to contest in the reserved constituencies from panchayat, legislative assemblies up to the Parliament and for availing the legal remedy/ protection under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention) of Atrocities Act, 1989 amended in the year 2018.”

Chief Justice Bobde remarked, “This requires some consideration”.

The NCDC said some of some poorest Christians of Scheduled Castes Origin people were engaged in menial jobs, including manual scavenging.

Chief Justice Bobde remarked that that social hierarchy applied within other religious communities like among Muslims also.

Mr. Thomas submitted that reservation should be delinked from religion. The court sought the government’s response in two weeks.

The petition highlighted how paragraph three of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 restricts Christians of Scheduled Castes origin from availing the Scheduled Castes status.

84,2020/01/08,"Muzaffarpur shelter home case: 35 girls believed murdered are found alive, CBI tells Supreme Court","Thirtyfive girls believed to have been murdered in the Muzaffarpur shelter home sexual abuse case had been found to be alive, the CBI told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Allegations about the ‘murders’ had first surfaced last year in the statements of girls rescued from the shelter home run by the kingpin, Brajesh Thakur. The CBI had also found that the names of these had mysteriously disappeared from the balikagarh (girls’ home). In March 2019, the agency told the court that 35 girls with identical or similar names had indeed lived in the shelter home at one point of time or the other.

Suspicions were raised that Thakur and his accomplices had killed the girls. In the meantime, one of the accused, Guddu Patel, had led them to a “particular spot in a burial ground” where a bundle of human bones were unearthed. These developments coupled with the slow pace had led to accusations that the CBI was going soft and slow in the case.

On Wednesday, Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal, for the CBI, said the agency had tracked each and every one of the 35 missing girls. Mr. Venugopal said the bones did not belong to a child. One was that of a man and the other of a woman.

In its latest status report, the CBI told the Supreme Court that investigation into 17 cases, including the Muzaffarpur one, had been completed and reports filed for taking action against the erring government servants including district Magistrates.

The probe agency said no incriminating evidence proving commission of any criminal offence could be gathered in four preliminary enquiries and as such no FIR had been registered.

“Investigation/Enquiry of all 17 shelter home cases has been completed. The final report in 13 regular cases has been forwarded in the competent court. Enquiry of all four preliminary enquiries has been completed and no evidence proving commission of criminal offence could be gathered and hence no FIR was registered on this count,” the CBI said in the status report.

“The CBI reports/self-contained note have been forwarded to the Bihar Chief Secretary for taking action against erring government servants in all cases. Investigation of all the 17 shelter home cases including Muzaffarpur shelter home case has been completed and final report has been filed in the competent court. Self contained note in the form of CBI report has been sent to the Chief Secretary for corrective action,” it said.

The CBI also said the Bihar government had been requested to take departmental action and cancellation of registration and blacklisting of concerned NGOs by providing them the result of the investigation in the form of report.

“Trial of one case in case of Balika Grih Muzaffarpur has been concluded and judgment is scheduled to be pronounced on January 14,” it said.

85,2020/01/08,CRPF DIG charged with throwing hot water on jawan; inquiry ordered,"Enraged at having burnt his mouth, a DIG-rank CRPF officer allegedly threw hot water on the face of the jawan who had served it to him, prompting the force to order an inquiry into the incident, officials said on Wednesday.

The purported incident took place on Tuesday at the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) recruit training centre in Bihar’s Rajgir district.

An official communication of the force said Deputy Inspector General D.K. Tripathi, who was staying at the officers’ mess of the institute, had ordered hot drinking water when constable Amol Kharat was on duty at the facility.

The officer is said to have burnt his mouth upon drinking the hot water served to him in a thermos flask, following which he summoned Kharat.

An altercation took place between the two and the DIG “threw” hot water on the jawan’s face and in his winter jersey.

The jawan has been admitted to a local hospital.

Tripathi did not respond to phone calls and SMS sent to him.

Officials said a preliminary inquiry by an Inspector General (IG)-rank officer of the force has been ordered and prima facie it looks to be a case of “accident”.

The inquiry report, along with specific recommendations, is expected by January 10 only after which the exact sequence of events and culpability could be established, they said.

An association of ex-paramilitary officials said the jawan “is being pressurised to give statement that the burn injuries were due to spilling of boiled water from the flask”.

86,2020/01/08,Tribal forum holds protest against CAA in Tripura,"Hundreds of tribal people under the banner of Joint Movement against Citizenship Amendment Act (JMACAA) on Tuesday protested against implementation of amended Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

JMACAA is a joint forum of three tribal political parties National Council of Tripura (NCT), Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT), Tipraland State Party (TSP) and several other social organizations like Borok People Human Rights Organisation (BPHRO) and Tribal Student Federation (TSF).

The forum had earlier observed Tripura Bandh from December 9 last year against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. They had later met Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on the issue.

JMACAA convener and human rights activist Anthony Debbarma said they are against implementation of CAA in Tripura since the state has already sheltered thousands of refugees from the then East Pakistan after the partition of the country in 1947.

The princely Tripura joined Indian Union in 1949 after signing a merger agreement.

“Union Home Minister Amit Shah had categorically stated that that we would be called for a second round of dialogue again after 10-15 days. A month has already passed and we did not receive any indication that he would call us again. He said that the ways to protect the interests of the tribals would be found. If the central government can’t keep it’s promises, how can we remain silent. Today’s protest is just a token and we shall resume our movement with more intensity,” Mr. Debbarma told the gathering.

Animesh Debbarma, leader of National Conference of Tripura (NCT), a tribal party and member of JMACAA, said, “We are not against Bengali community or any religious community, but we want to protect and safeguard the interests of our community.”

The Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), an ally of the ruling BJP in the state on Monday launched an indefinite sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near the headquarters of Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council.

The party also pressed for a separate Tipraland by carving out of the tribal council from the state which constitutes two third of the state territory.

IPFT spokesperson Mangal Debbarma said, “The demonstration will continue till the Centre takes a positive step. We want either the scrapping of the act or exempting entire Tripura from its purview.”

IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatia said “Though our alliance partner, the BJP does not agree with our stand we will continue our agitation unless an amicable solution is achieved.”

“We feel that, achieving the separate Tipraland is the ultimate solution to end the tribal angst in the state,” said Mr. Jamatia, who is the Tripura tribal affairs minister.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tribal-forum-holds-protest-against-caa-in-tripura/article30511112.ece
87,2020/01/08,SC to hear on Friday govt. plea to transfer petitions against CAA in High Courts,"The Supreme Court agreed to hear on Friday (January 10) a plea made by the government to transfer pending writ petitions challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) of 2019 in various High Courts across the country to the apex court.

Making an urgent mention before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the situation eventually raised a probability that various High Courts might deliver mutually conflicting views on the legality of the CAA, leading to confusion.

Mr. Mehta said the Supreme Court should make an authoritative pronouncement on the law.

Though initially Chief Justice Bobde orally remarked that it would be advantageous to have the High Courts’ conclusions, the Bench also said that it felt the High Courts should not be entertaining the cases on the CAA when the Supreme Court was already seized of it. There were over 60 writ petitions in the Supreme Court on the CAA.

The petitioners in the Supreme Court cut across political party lines and come from all walks of life from across the country. They include parliamentarians such as Jairam Ramesh, Mahua Moitra and Asaduddin Owaisi and parties such as Assam Gana Parishad, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam and Kerala’s Indian Union Muslim League and an association of lawyers from Assam.

A three-judge Bench led by the CJI has scheduled a hearing on January 22.

‘CAA has unholy nexus with NRC’

The petitions in the Supreme Court argue that the law welcomes “illegal migrants” into India selectively on the basis of their religion and pointedly exclude Muslims. It has an “unholy nexus” with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise and is against the principles of secularism, right to equality and dignity of life enshrined in the basic structure of the Constitution.

While the NRC exercise will result in identification of persons as “illegal migrants”, the CAA seeks to simultaneously offer citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians on the presumed ground of persecution, they contend.

The new citizenship law fast tracks citizenship by naturalisation for minority Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who enter India illegally, claiming religious persecution in their native countries.

But the new law does not impose any requirement on illegal migrants from the six religions to prove their claim of religious persecution or even a reasonable fear of it.

The petitions argue that the legislation effectuates discrimination on the basis of the intrinsic and core identity of an individual, that is, his religious identity as a Muslim.

The Act ensures that only an illegal immigrant who is Muslim would be singled out and prosecuted under the Passports (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or the Foreigners Order 1949 and deprived of his personal liberty. On the other hand, illegal migrants from the six protected religions would be entitled with Indian citizenship and the benefits that come with it.

While Muslim migrants would have to show their proof of residency in India for at least 11 years, the law allows illegal migrants from the six communities to be naturalised in five years’ time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tscki0/article30510955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-on-friday-govt-plea-to-transfer-petitions-against-caa-in-high-courts/article30510956.ece

92,2020/01/08,Middlemen rule the roost in ‘lipstick seed’ trade,"Middlemen continue to dictate terms in the trade of the famed Annatto seed, which is used in making lipstick.

Annatto plant is grown in the Rampa Agency, which is one of the largest producers of the species in South India. The plant species is locally known as ‘jabra’ or ‘lipstick seed’.

Integrated Tribal Development Authority (Rampachodavaram) Assistant Director for Agriculture D. Srinivasa Reddy told The Hindu: “Annatto is being grown in over 6,000 acres, and the majority of the produce comes from the Maredumilli forests. Nearly 2,500 farmers are cultivating it in the Rampachodavaram Agency. The irony is that middlemen from Visakhapatnam and Rajamahendravaram are dictating terms in its procurement and trade.”

ZBNF initiative

In the district, Annatto is cultivated under the Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) initiative.

When this correspondent visited Akumamidikota and Vollangi forest areas, the Konda Reddi tribal families that cultivate it said they would wait for the middlemen, who are non-tribals from coastal Andhra Pradesh, to procure the produce.

Mr. Srinivasa Reddy says 90% of the farmers belonged to the Konda Reddi community. The farmers forayed into Annatto cultivation after failure of the coffee and orange plantations.

At least 60 to 70 middlemen are active in the trade at the Maredumilli weekly shandy with the arrival of the seed that is harvested by January.

Low price

The total yield expected this year is nearly 2,500 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes. The yield per acre is expected to be around 500 kg, which is priced at ₹100 a kg (as per the Girijan Co-operative Corporation).

Amaranath Reddi of Maredumilli, whose family cultivates Annatto in a few acres, said: “Last year, the maximum price offered by the middlemen was ₹120 a kg. Those who did not accept the input cost from the middlemen got that price. The farmers who received input cost were offered as low as ₹60 to ₹70.”

The extent under Annatto cultivation has been increased significantly in the past three years after the tribal farmers started accepting the input cost from potential buyers or middlemen.

The GCC did not attempt to procure the seed, leaving the tribal farmers at the mercy of the middlemen.

GCC target

GCC Rampachodavaram Divisional Manager Jagannath Reddi said: “We did not procure the seed last year. This year, a target has been fixed to procure 500 quintals at ₹100 to ₹110 a kg. However, middlemen offer higher price.”

The GCC will sell the procured seed through open auction. The middlemen resell it to agents involved in the processing industry, or export it to foreign countries.

“The pure red coloured seed, which is preferred in making the lipstick, fetches a good price,” said Mr. Srinivasa Reddy.

According to the Indian Customs Authority data (2016), the seed has been exported to Spain, the U.S., Brazil, Iran, Argentina and Philippines from the JNPT and Mundra sea ports.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7ygey5/article30517384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJANNATO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/middlemen-rule-the-roost-in-lipstick-seed-trade/article30517385.ece
93,2020/01/08,State likely to miss GST target,"The State government is likely to miss the Goods and Services Tax (GST) target for the current financial year if the collections made so far are any indication. It is “likely to net about ₹23,500 crore” by the end of the financial year as against the target of ₹24,800 crore.

According to information, the financial year started on a positive note as the GST collections touched ₹2,113.54 crore. But, in the subsequent months, there was a dip. The State government, apparently, could not sustain the momentum during the first quarter of the current financial year.

The revenue was considerably good during April 2019. However, during May and June, the target could not be achieved. While ₹1,892 crore has been set as target for every month, the collections did not cross ₹1,650 crore each in May and June.

The situation improved in the last quarter, but the “overall performance by the end of the fiscal” may not be on the expected lines. There could be a gap of about 3% between the target and achievement, sources say.

The State registered a growth of 11% by netting ₹2,265 crore in December 2019 compared to ₹2,049 crore in December 2018. “Notwithstanding, there may be a shortfall of ₹1,000 crore to ₹1,500 crore by the end of the financial year,” says a senior official, who did not want to be quoted.

Reasons for shortfall

The officials cite a fall in automobile sales, steel etc. as the reasons. The steel prices witnessed a fall by 10 to 15%, while that of cement decline by about ₹20 per bag.

Though sectors such as automobiles, (more particularly two-wheelers) have improved compared to the initial four-five months, steel and iron still need to pick up.

The fall in crude oil prices, the slowdown in construction industry, falling sale of automobiles etc. are some of the reasons. “This had impacted the performance, collections, target and achievements,” says the official.

The government clocked a growth rate close to 28% (which was among the highest in big States) in the GST collections last fiscal (2018-19).

In fact, the State had set a record in the GST collections amounting to ₹20,746 crore.

Compared to 2017-18, the year of GST implementation, the State registered a growth of 27.75%. The GST collections were ₹10,826 crore for eight months in 2017-18. By the next financial year, the revenue touched ₹20,746 crore.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-likely-to-miss-gst-target/article30517377.ece
94,2020/01/08,CWC orders probe into alleged drugging of minors in W. Godavari,"The West Godavari District Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has ordered a probe into the alleged drugging of siblings by a religious preacher and his wife.

A preacher in the town had struck up an acquaintance several months ago with a man who was living alone with his two children, a daughter aged 14 and a son aged 12. The preacher reportedly used to visit the man’s house frequently. The man had separated from his wife several years ago and was the sole guardian of his two children.

A few days ago, the preacher lodged a police complaint against the man accusing him of neglecting his children allegedly over his alcohol addiction. Police registered the preacher’s complaint and referred the case to the CWC, which ordered a Home Study Report (HSR).

The CWC, in the course of its inquiry, ascertained that contrary to the preacher’s claims, the father was a teetotaller and was taking good care of his children. The children, in their statements that were video-recorded by the investigating officers, said that their father never neglected them or subjected them to ill-treatment. The CWC report also mentioned that the man’s neighbours too affirmed that he was taking good care of his children and giving them a good education.

The father later lodged a police complaint against the preacher couple, stating that during the course of the inquiry, the preacher took the children to his home and experimented on them by giving them some country-made drugs.

The father alleged that ever since the incident, both the children were mentally disturbed.

Following the man’s complaint, the CWC directed the police and the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) of the Women Development and Child Welfare (WD&CW) department to investigate the father’s allegations.

Considering the seriousness of the case and the mental condition of the siblings, the CWC ordered a thorough inquiry and directed that the children be enrolled at separate schools.

The CWC observed that the preacher and his wife seem to have levelled false allegations against the man and his children and had even made attempts to get the children put under foster care.

Speaking to The Hindu on Wednesday, Eluru Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) O. Dileep Kiran said the Eluru Two Town police are investigating the case, which was referred from the CWC.

“Police are assisting the other investigating agencies in the suspected drug injection case, which attracts Section 77 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015,” the DSP said.

95,2020/01/08,Red flags flutter in Seema as Left partyleaders protest against govt. policies,"It appeared as if the entire district of Anantapur was painted red on Wednesday when scores of activists from Left parties, and students poured out on the streets to vehemently oppose the alleged ‘anti-labour’ laws, Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), NRC, NPR, Insurance and banking sector changes and attack on students in Jamia Milia, JNU and Aligarh Muslim University(AMU).

As part of the nationwide call given by trade unions and student organisations, sit-in dharnas began at all RTC bus stations with activists from SFI, AISF and DYFI stopping buses from coming out of the depot for some time. The police, however, arrested the students and cleared the way for operation of buses.

The APSRTC officials told The Hindu that all the buses ran as per schedule later in the evening and that there were no damages.

Most of the schools, business establishments and banks had already declared holiday, but a few which opened their shutters were forcibly shut down by the activists. Leaders of Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party did not participate in the all-India strike.

CPI district secretary D. Jagadeesh led a rally from their party office up to the Municipal Administrative Building and simultaneously, CPI (M) district secretary V. Rambhupal led another rally from their district office near Three Town Police Station and reached Saptagiri Circle via Railway Station and Tower Clock junctions shouting slogans against CAA and alleged divisive politics of the Narendra Modi government.

Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham took out a bullock cart procession in Pedda Podamala village close to Tadipatri and demanded remunerative prices for their produce.

Kurnool

The protests first broke out outside the bus stand, that sported an almost abandoned look in the morning due to the bandh. The auto-rickshaw drivers too participated at a large scale in the city.

Slogans of ‘Narendra Modi down down’ were heard across the city as a large rally emerged from old town area. Numerous Muslim and progressive organisations have also supported the rally. A few Muslim leaders from the ruling YSR Congress Party had also come out on streets against CAA, NRC and NPR.

While protests erupted in all the mandals of the district, major ones were held at Nandyal, Adoni, and Betamcherla.

Tirupati

There was a mixed response to the nationwide bandh call given by Left parties against the Central government’s ‘anti-people’ attitude.

The impact of the bandh was quite palpable at Central government offices, banks and insurance firms having a strong trade union presence, but the response was lukewarm elsewhere. Schools and colleges remained closed, but not the retail outlets employing private employees.

Cadres belonging to CITU, AITUC, INTUC, YSRTU, TNTUC and IFTU came out on the streets, staged a demonstration at Ambedkar Circle in the city and then took a parade on the arterial streets, carrying red flags. The folk song and dance numbers meant to be an eye-opener struck a chord with the passers-by.

In Kadapa, government offices looked deserted, while the members of Insurance Corporation Employees Union (ICEU) members staged a demonstration in front of LIC Kadapa divisional office and vowed to prevent the Centre’s plan to get the company listed in stock markets.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qtogu3/article30516892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJTIRUPATIBANDH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/red-flags-flutter-in-seema-as-left-partyleaders-protest-against-govt-policies/article30516893.ece

The K.C. Sivaramakrishnan Committee constituted by the Union government had favoured location of the capital in the Donakaonda region, he argued. It was unfortunate that neither the previous government nor the present government heeded the suggestions of the committee, he said.

“Visakhapatnam, the proposed ‘Executive Capital’, is difficult to access for the people from Rayalaseema. Even the capitals of the neighbouring States are nearer than the port city.

97,2020/01/08,Woman ‘sexually assaulted’ by seven persons,"A 25-year-old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by seven persons, including two rowdy-sheeters, on the outskirts of Eluru.

The incident came to light after the victim, mother of two children, lodged a complaint with the police.

The Eluru Two-Town police on Wednesday picked up a few suspects in the case and are questioning them. The victim was sent for medical examination to the Government General Hospital.

According to Eluru Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) O. Dileep Kiran, the incident occurred about 20 days ago and the victim lodged a complaint on Tuesday. The woman was staying alone due to family disputes.

The victim alleged that one of the accused offered lift on his two-wheeler when she went out at around 10 p.m. to buy medicines for her three-year-old son who was suffering from fever.

He allegedly dragged her into the roadside bushes and the remaining accused allegedly joined and committed the offence.

Later, the gang allegedly threatened to kill her if she revealed the incident to anybody. The accused were creating panic by knocking the doors of her house during night hours, the victim alleged.

“We registered a case under Section 376 (g) IPC and other sections and took up investigation. The health of the victim is stable.

99,2020/01/08,Alipiri toll plaza all set to get FASTag,"Alipiri, the gateway to the Tirumala hills, considered the abode of Lord Venkateswara, is all set to get FASTag, as the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) management is seriously contemplating its implementation.

FASTag is a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology based system employed to collect payment in toll gates through the prepaid mode. The Union government has already made it mandatory for four-wheelers to have FASTag, with the toll plazas on national highways set to go cashless. The deadline has been finally revised to January 15 this year.

Interestingly, Alipiri is believed to be the first such toll plaza not coming under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as it is totally maintained and operated by the TTD. As many as 10,000 four-wheelers pass through the toll plaza on any given day, which touches 12,000 on peak days, fetching a collection of ₹2.5 lakh on normal days and ₹3.5 lakh on peak days.

Stringent checks

Looking beyond toll collection, the plaza doubles up as a security point to check vehicles bound for Tirumala, in view of the importance of the world-famous shrine and the sensitivity involved in it, in the wake of security alerts. Frisking every individual and scrupulously checking every passing vehicle — even the under carriage — are a routine activity here. Though going the FASTag way would save a lot of time for the travellers, the mandatory security check might not.

According to TTD trust board Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, the temple management is seized of the matter, as it is ‘a national- level initiative.’

“The system will be as stringent as it is now in preventing untoward incidents and as such, there will be no compromise on security,” he maintained.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/83965d/article30515740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJALIPIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/alipiri-toll-plaza-all-set-to-get-fastag/article30515741.ece

The hospital launched an advanced LASIK machine to check refractive disorders, which was formally inaugurated by Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) Gajarao Bhupal here on Wednesday.

Locals continued to gather in village centres voicing their opinion against the proposal, a day after people blocked the National Highway No 16 between Guntur and Vijayawada. Meanwhile, the villagers mourned the death of a farmer, Adepalli Krupanidhi, from Krishnayapalem.

Telugu Desam national general secretary Nara Lokesh consoled the family members and even carried the body up to some distance. Mr. Lokesh earlier visited the district jail in Guntur and interacted with those arrested in the case of assault against media persons.

‘A gift to seer’

The TDP leaders upped the ante against Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Former Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the decision to shift the Capital to Visakhapatnam was taken to placate Swami Swaroopanandendra, based in Visakhapatnam. He alleged that the decision to shift the capital was a ‘Guru dakshina’ to the seer.

TDP leader G.V. Anjaneyulu said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy belied the hopes of five crore people in the State.

Meanwhile, the Guntur police moved in swiftly to arrest the accused in the attack against Chief Whip and Macherla MLA Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy at Chinakakani on Tuesday. The police reportedly took 10 persons in custody and were questioning them.

102,2020/01/08,"When U.P. is doing well with just one capital, why can’t A.P., asks UP Minister","Uttar Pradesh Minister for MSME and Investments Sidharth Nath Singh said Lucknow was working very well as the capital of his State which has 75 districts and 230 million people, suggesting that there is no reason why administration of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) could not be done from a single location (Amaravati).

Addressing media persons here on Wednesday, Mr. Singh, who was previously BJP’s Andhra Pradesh affairs in-charge, said decentralisation was a concept of power, not of executive and legislative bodies and the powers thereof could not be separated (decentralised) because they need to be at one place to work together.

Mr. Singh said the government of U.P. was functioning without any problem from Lucknow and that he would not mind showing to officers from A.P. how it was working, stating that he was clear about what should be done for development.

He pointed out that none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation for Amaravati and the Centre did not give funds for the construction of any capital city except the present capital of A.P.

The BJP has already made its stand clear, that development should be decentralised, not administration, he added.

‘CAA not against minorities’

On the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Mr. Singh said the opposition parties were playing vote bank politics by spreading the word that it was meant to remove the citizenship of some minority communities.

People were instigated to revolt against the Central government even as it tried to allay their apprehensions. He insisted that the minorities benefited the most out of the slew of welfare schemes being implemented by the Centre and recalled that both the YSR Congress and TDP supported the CAA in Parliament.

Addakula Salraju, who claims to be working for KMC for 19 years now, released a video on social media elaborating his plight. The video was shared widely on social media.

In the video, he warned the corporation that he would set himself and his family ablaze if the KMC does not clear his dues by Sankranti. “Taking care of my family has become tough. Children are no longer going to school and there is no food to eat,” Mr. Salraju said.

According to Mr. Salraju, he is yet to get 22 months of salary and his name was not included in the Andhra Pradesh Corporation for Outsourced Services (APCOS).

KMC Municipal Commissioner S. Ravindra Babu told The Hindu that he was aware of the issue. “The Collector has also given us orders to act on the matter swiftly. We are processing his file,” he said.

The commissioner, however, claimed that only 10 months of salary is due to Mr. Salraju, and not 22 months as claimed by him.

According to KMC officials, previous commissioners had not given a work order to over 50 outsourcing employees who were engaged in various works. However, they continued to work with the KMC as the previous two commissioners had permitted it.

Mr. Ravindra Babu claimed that almost all of the 50-odd files have been processed, and only two are yet to be done. “We will process those files too within the next 10 days,” he said, and added that show-cause notices have also been issued to officials concerned within the KMC.

MLA calls up worker

Arun Kumar Pandu, a resident of Khammam who claimed to be a director of the Handlooms and Textiles Department of the Government of Telangana as well as the in-charge of the department in Andhra Pradesh, had applied for darshan tickets.

He had produced an identity card which mentioned that he was an IPS officer of the 1998 batch.

However, TTD Vigilance sleuths grew suspicious about the authenticity of the letter and the identity card, and alerted the local police who immediately took him into custody for questioning.

It is learnt that the accused had reportedly worked as an Officer on Special Duty (OSD) for several Telangana Ministers.

The TTD Vigilance sleuths have lodged a formal complaint with the police and an investigation is on.

105,2020/01/08,Ancient rock inscription faces oblivion,"Ancient inscriptions engraved on a rock near the Gavi Rangaswamy Temple at Chalivendula village in Hindupur mandal of the district are at the risk of vanishing altogether thanks to unauthorised quarrying.

The Kannada inscription panel, measuring 20 ft in length and 18 ft in width, with an incised line drawing of Virupanna, the builder of the renowned Veerabhadra temple at Lepakshi, and footprints of Lord Shiva on granite, is believed to date back to the 16th century and is one of the largest rock inscriptions in Andhra Pradesh.

A concerned citizen of Chalivendula, Lakshmi Narayana Reddy, brought the matter to the notice of the Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati (CCVA) Chief Executive Officer E. Siva Nagi Reddy, who in turn inspected the site on Wednesday and thoroughly examined the inscriptions. Describing the inscription, Mr. Siva Nagi Reddy told The Hindu that the inscription was recorded and published by the Epigraphy branch of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1917 and by the State Department of Archaeology & Museum under the supervision of P. Chenna Reddy, the then Director of the Department, in 2009.

Mr. Siva Nagi Reddy stressed the need for immediate protection and conservation of the site. “The inscription is dated August 6, 1513, and records the genealogy of the Vijayanagara kings at the request of Virapanna, son of Nandi Lakkisetti and Muddamamba. The king made a gift of the village Chalivendula, with surname Achutendrapura, in the presence of God Virapaksha on the banks of the Tungabhadra, for the service of the Gods Virabhadra, Raghunatha and Papavinasa of Lepakshi,” Mr. Siva Nagi Reddy said.

Protection sought

“The site may lose its existence unless the quarrying activity is stopped immediately and the area declared as a protected site with barbed wire fencing put up as protection,” the CCVA CEO said. He requested officials of the State Government to divert tourists visiting the Lepakshi Temple to the Chalivendula inscription spot by erecting a notice board at both the places and appointing an archaeological tourist guide along with security personnel.

106,2020/01/08,"Millennium Towers in Vizag may house Secretariat, CMO","The writing is on the wall. Ahead of the high-power committee’s evaluation on the decentralised Capital for the State, Visakhapatnam is buzz with action on the ground.

While the Millennium Towers in the IT SEZ is touted to be the building to house the Secretariat and the CMO, the Secretariat employees are scouting for residential accommodation in the port city.

Amaravati project

For the record, the YSRCP government had commissioned the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the G.N. Rao Committee to suggest options for the development of capital infrastructure in the backdrop of financial constraints to fund the Amaravati project in over 34,000 acres.

The government is of the view that the grand plan of nine cities in Amaravati, conceptualised by the TDP government, cannot be built as the State exchequer can’t afford to spend an estimated ₹1 lakh crore needed for it.

The high-power committee, comprising senior bureaucrats and Ministers, is evaluating the reports submitted by the BCG and G.N. Rao Committee, and is expected to submit its report soon.

On the other side, the farmers of 29 villages in Amaravati, who had parted with their land for a world-class Capital city, have been protesting the move to shift the Capital for the past few weeks.

The G.N. Rao Committee had recommended the Legislative capital at Amaravati, the Executing capital at Visakhapatnam and the Judicial capital at Kurnool.

On similar lines, the BCG report too had recommended a decentralised development model.

Sources in the Secretariat and the CMO in Amaravati say that the government is likely to zero in on the Millennium Towers to house the Secretariat and the CMO.

Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, a source in the CMO said, “Vizag seems to be the most probable location, and the Millennium Towers is under active consideration. This information is certain, but none will confirm it.”

Departments tipped?

A couple of teams, comprising top bureaucrats, have already made several visits to the Millennium Towers and other major buildings in the port city to choose the best ones for the Secretariat and other key infrastructure.

What lends credence to the buzz is that several Secretariat employees are said to be scouting for residential accommodation in the ‘City of Destiny’.

It is learnt that a few departments have been asked to make arrangements in the likelihood of an announcement in this regard in a week or two.

“We have heard from those who are privy to information that there can be a shift and that we need to be ready to start working from there (Vizag) as soon as the announcement is made,” said an employee in the Education Department in the Secretariat.

“Similar is the case with the employees of the General Administration, Finance and other departments,” he said.

‘Nothing formalised’

When asked about the details on the ground, Visakhapatnam district Collector V. Vinay Chand said there was a discussion about the Millennium Towers and the possibility of conducting the Republic Day parade here. “But nothing has been formalised yet in that direction,” he added.

The Millennium Towers is a massive structure located on one of the four hills near Madhurawada on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam. It was planned to be an IT hub. Some of the global IT majors have already started functioning in the IT SEZ.

It is to be noted here that the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) has served notices on some IT firms in the SEZ for not starting their operations.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/98vc8d/article30515039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPG4-TOWERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/millennium-towers-in-vizag-may-house-secretariat-cmo/article30515040.ece

They expressed happiness that the Chief Minister took personal interest in getting them liberated and would be grateful to him for his gesture.

Mr. Reddy disbursed a financial assistance of ₹5 lakh each to the 20 fishermen belonging to Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts.

Mr. Chandramohan Reddy faulted Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s three capitals proposal.

116,2020/01/08,Minister urged to close down toll plazas in city limits,"AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation has asked the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture chairman T.G. Venkatesh to ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic on the national highways passing through the State.

In a representation submitted to Mr. Venkatesh at an interactive session with CII members at Vizag Conventions here, chamber zonal chairman Sudhir Mulagada thanked him for visiting the city to ascertain ground realities.

Mr. Mulagada requested Mr. Venkatesh to look into the possibility of shutting down toll plazas under the city limits so as to facilitate faster movement of traffic. As per NHAI guidelines, toll fees should not be charged from residents who live within a radius of 20 km from toll plazas.

Mr. Mulagada said that service roads of a minimum 40 to 60 feet on both sides of the highways passing through the cities/town/village limits be laid to enable pedestrians, two-wheelers and three-wheelers to ply on the service roads instead of using the highway. The highways can then be used solely by cars and heavy vehicles.

Mr. Mulagada said that travelling from the Kakinada Port administrative building to Uppada was a herculean task due to the existence of three railway crossings, which cause long traffic jams, thus necessitating the construction of an overbridge.

The chamber zonal chairman also sought improvement of the road condition on the highway from Ravulapalem to Tadepalligudem by ensuring regular maintenance.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/minister-urged-to-close-down-toll-plazas-in-city-limits/article30507506.ece
117,2020/01/08,NHAI to lay 717-km of roads in State,"Minister for Roads and Buildings Dharmana Krishna Das has said that ₹1,700 crore will be spent on development of roads in the State.

Participating in a review meeting held by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture here on Tuesday, Mr. Krishna Das said that a decision, in principle, had been taken by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to lay 11 roads in a stretch of 717 km in the State as national highways. The government had sought the development of 17 roads in a stretch of 1,612 km in the State at national highways.

A proposal was submitted to widen roads in a stretch of 260 km as part of seven projects at a cost of ₹1,700 crore this year. Mr. Krishna Das appealed to the NHAI officials to begin the work at the earliest.

“As many as 432 black spots (accident-prone zones) in the State. Of these, 76 have already been rectified while 41 are being re-designed. The work is yet to start at 316 black spots,” said the Minister.

Giving more details, Mr. Krishna Das said nine black spots have been identified in Rajamahendravaram, which requires construction of flyovers and underpasses. The Benz Circle flyover in Vijayawada is being widened into a three-lane one by the NHAI. The move would ease traffic congestion. However, another three-lane flyover is needed to ensure smooth flow of vehicles.

Expressway project

“The State government has already expressed its willingness to bear 50% of the land acquisition cost for the construction of the Anantpur – Amaravati Expressway,” he added.

Parliamentary Standing Committee Chairman T.G. Venkatesh said that the NHAI should undertake news initiative to bring down road accidents. The implementation of FASTag would prevent long wait at the toll gates on national highways.

On the progress of the ongoing outreach programme, Mr. Tenginkai said party workers had already visited about 4.65 lakh houses spread across 21,000 booths in Karnataka. The remaining 37,000 booths would be covered in the next few days,” he said.

100 houses

As part of the efforts to intensify the awareness campaign, the party has asked all its elected representatives right from gram panchayat members to the MLAs and MPs to visit at least 100 houses in their constituencies on January 11 and 12, Mr. Ravi Kumar said.

“We have planned bike rallies by the Yuva Morcha in taluk headquarters, and Bharat Mata Puja by Mahila Morcha workers and an intellectuals’ meet in district headquarters,” he said.

126,2020/01/08,80-ft statue of Kempegowda at airport,"The State government has proposed to erect a 80 ft Nadaprabhu Kempegowda statue on the premises of Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). In September last, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had announced that it would be a 100-ft statue costing ₹100 crore.

On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan chaired a meeting of the Kempegowda Development Authority and announced that a theme park would be developed on 23 acres near the airport and the statue would be set up at the theme park.

It was also decided that 46 locations linked to Benglauru would be renovated. Development of such locations would help people to acknowledge the contribution of Kempegowda, he said.

Film city in Bengaluru

The government is planning to establish a world-class film city in Bengaluru and the location would be decided after talks with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Mr. Ashwath Narayan said.

He said Bengaluru was an ideal city for setting up the film city. The proposed film city would be different from the existing ones in the country and rest of the world. The film city should provide enabling environment for promoting tourism, he said.

The Deputy Chief Minister said Roerich Art Craft Village would also be established at Roerich and Devika Rani Roerich Estate at Tataguni, a lung space spread over hundreds of acres off Kanakapura Road.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/80-ft-statue-of-kempegowda-at-airport/article30517362.ece
127,2020/01/08,High Court sees highest number of judges at 43,"The total number of judges rose to 43 in the High Court of Karnataka with the three newly appointed additional judges assuming office on Wednesday. This is the highest number of judges the High Court has ever had though the court’s present total sanctioned strength of the judges is 62.

The newly appointed judges are Maralur Indrakumar Arun, Engalaguppe Seetharamaiah Indiresh, and Ravi Venkappa Hosmani.

Born on April 24, 1970 in Mysuru, Mr. Arun obtained his law degree from the National law School of India University, Bengaluru, and began his practice as a lawyer in 1993 by joining the law chamber of former Advocate General the late A.N. Jayaram. He had served as additional government advocate in the High Court, besides being standing counsel for various agencies of the State government. His father, M.J. Indrakumar, is a retired Registrar of Karnataka Lokayukta.

Mr. Indiresh, born on April 16, 1972 at Engalaguppe village in Pandavapura taluk, is the nephew of E.S. Venkataramaiah, former Chief Justice of India. He began his practice as a lawyer in 1996 after completing LLB from Sharada Vilas College, Mysuru, and LLM from University of Mysore by securing first rank in the Constitutional Law branch. His practice as a lawyer began from the law chamber of B.V. Nagarathna (daughter of the late Venkataramaiah), who is now a senior judge of the High Court. He was serving as additional government advocate prior to his elevation as judge and was a regular visiting faculty at the Karnataka Police Academy.

Born on July 29, 1971 at Bebsur village in Dharwad district, Mr. Hosmani secured LLB degree from Karnatak University and LLM from University of Mysore. He commenced his practice as a lawyer in 1995 and served as standing counsel for various public transport corporations of the State, besides serving as an additional government advocate for four years.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-court-sees-highest-number-of-judges-at-43/article30517359.ece
128,2020/01/08,CM likely to go in for an overhaul; some Ministers may get the sack,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is reportedly toying with the idea of not just expanding his Cabinet but also overhauling it, by dropping some Ministers and inducting a few fresh faces, in an effort to maintain caste and regional balance.

He is expected to go to Delhi next week to hold meetings with the party high command to get the expansion and reshuffle cleared.

Of the maximum strength of 34, the Cabinet presently has 18 people, including the Chief Minister, leaving 16 berths vacant. Of this, 11 will go to former Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs who defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party and won the bypolls. Two are expected to be kept vacant for N. Nagaraju (MTB) and R. Shankar, who may be made MLCs in June and Ministers later.

That would leave three more berths, for which there is intense lobbying. Among several leaders lobbying for these berths, senior leaders Umesh Katti, Arvind Limbavali, and S. Angara are reportedly leading the race, party sources said.

However, maintaining caste and regional balance in the Cabinet has turned complex, with fears that too many from Belagavi region and Lingayat community may end up dominating the Cabinet. Belagavi already has two Ministers — Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and the lone woman Minister Shashikala Jolle, both Lingayats. Sources said that they are unlikely to be dropped.

Three defectors who have won from the district — Ramesh Jarkiholi, Shrimanth Patil, and Mahesh Kumathalli, besides Mr. Katti, have been lobbying hard to be inducted. If all of them make it to the Cabinet, there will be six Ministers from the district. Out of the six, four will be Lingayats, with Mr. Jarkiholi and Mr. Patil being non-Lingayats.

“The Chief Minister is trying to convince one of them to accept the post of head of a prominent corporation to ensure regional balance in the Cabinet,” a close associate of the Chief Minister said.

Presently, the Cabinet is dominated by Lingayats with eight Ministers, including the Chief Minister himself. Add to this, there are two from the community among the rebels — B.C. Patil and Mr. Kumathalli. “Mr. Yediyurappa is keen on dropping at least two Lingayat Ministers, if not three, to accommodate new faces,” sources close to him said.

The grapevine in the party has been that Mr. Yediyurappa is reportedly upset with two of his close associates, both Lingayats, for being “ambitious” and trying to lobby within the community to emerge as successors to him to lead the community from the BJP. “The Chief Minister has been grooming his son B.Y. Vijayendra and sees the duo as competitors to his son. The two have also run into controversies recently and are likely to be demoted from the key portfolios they handle, even if they manage to survive in the Cabinet,” sources said.

Dy. CM posts

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister is said to have been aggressively lobbying with the high command to abolish the three Deputy Chief Minister posts, arguing that it had caused much heartburn among other senior leaders. “If the high command is adamant on keeping these posts, he may even suggest creating more deputies,” sources said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hmtzn/article30517350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGMINISTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cm-likely-to-go-in-for-an-overhaul-some-ministers-may-get-the-sack/article30517351.ece
129,2020/01/08,‘Time for second freedom struggle’,"Terming the recent protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, as a mark of the “greatness of the soul of India that has demonstrated itself every time there is a threat to Constitutional values,” noted writer Devanur Mahadeva has said this was the time for a “second freedom struggle.”

He was speaking at a seminar on CAA, National Registry of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR), organised by the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti here on Wednesday.

“Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had said we will lose our freedom for the second time if our loyalties to caste and religion override the identity with the country. I think that time has come now, as the government of the day itself is linking citizenship to religion and dividing the country,” Mr. Mahadeva said. “The government is asking for my father’s birth date and place. My mother told me I was born when the train left the station near our village on a Monday. Then how will I know when my parents were born? I think I have my roots in the Harappa civilisation, which is in Pakistan. What should I do?” he said.

‘Affects Dalits too’

Former bureaucrat Sasikanth Senthil said: “There is a propaganda that CAA will only affect Muslims. But it affects all marginalised communities and Dalits too. They need to join the protests.” Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah made a surprise appearance and was among the audience, but did not address the gathering.

Having a majority in Parliament does not give the government a free pass to enact anti-constitutional laws and opposing them is not disrespecting the Parliament, said writer and film-maker Baragur Ramachandrappa.

Protecting and fostering Hindu-Muslim unity is the most effective way to counter the divisive agenda of the BJP-led Union government, argued journalist Dinesh Amin Mattu.

“Any attempt at Hindu-Muslim unity threatens them. I have received a threat call for being listed as speaker at a Billava-Muslim friendship meet to be held in Mangaluru. The meeting stands postponed as of now,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xhqq7e/article30517338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGDEVANUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/time-for-second-freedom-struggle/article30517339.ece
130,2020/01/08,Teacher revives fortunes of government school that had no students,"At a time when government schools are struggling to retain students, a lower primary school at H. Kadadakatte village in Honnali taluk of Davangere district, which was on the verge of closure, has been revived thanks to the efforts of a teacher.

When Anitha K.C. was transferred in April 2016 to this school, which had classes 1 to 5, the student strength was zero and preparations were on to formally close it. Owing to poor amenities at the school, parents in the vicinity had admitted their children to private schools. Weeds and shrubs had grown on the school campus and the building had become a hub for drinking and gambling.

Many of Ms. Anitha’s well-wishers had even suggested that she submit a report to the Department of Public Instruction stating that reviving this school would be impossible. They also urged her to get a transfer elsewhere. However, Ms. Anitha, who studied in a rural government school herself, knew that government schools were places where bright futures could be moulded for children from rural areas and low-income groups.

Prior to the start of the 2016-17 academic year, Ms. Anitha got the school premises cleaned with her own money. With the help of the local gram panchayat and a few donors, the building was painted. She then made multiple visits to every house in the village and requested the parents to send their wards to the school. The efforts paid off and 15 children enrolled for 2016-17.

Meals, meetings

To attract more students, apart from the food featured in the midday meal menu, healthy snacks and fruits were served to all the students. Ms. Anitha again used her own money to fund this. Special training was provided to the children interested in appearing for the exams for admission to Navodaya and other government-run residential institutions. Regular meetings were held to brief parents about the academic progress of their wards.

The next year, the student strength rose to 19. What is more, students of the school won prizes in the Pratibha Karanji cultural event of the government.

This academic year, the student strength is 28. The Department of Public Instruction has deputed another teacher, Jayamma K.G., to the school now. The department has been requested to sanction two more classrooms for the school.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/oya7ga/article30517328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSMGTEACHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/teacher-revives-fortunes-of-govt-school-that-had-no-students/article30517329.ece
131,2020/01/08,"HC notice on criminal cases against MPs, MLAs","The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a petition that has claimed that a single sessions court established to conduct trial of criminal cases related to MPs and MLAs registered in Karnataka irrespective of the nature of offence is contrary to the directions issued by the apex court.

Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the order on a petition filed by Sunil Kumar Sharma, a resident of Bengaluru and co-accused in one of the cases registered against former Minister D.K. Shivakumar for allegedly attempting to evade income tax and filing false statements.

It was pointed out in the petition that the Income Tax department filed a case before the Special Court of Economic Offences in Bengaluru, which is a magistrate court. However, the case was transferred to the special court, constituted to exclusively deal with criminal cases related to MPs and MLAs in Karnataka, which is a court of sessions.

The petitioner claimed that the apex court, in its 2014 order, had only directed the courts concerned to complete the trial of criminal cases, falling under Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, within one year from the date of framing of charges, and not for all types of offences, and moreover there was no order for setting up special courts.

Contending that the offences under the Income Tax Act are not attracted under the Section 8 of the RP Act, it has been claimed in the petition that the offences alleged against the petitioner and other accused are neither related to RP Act not are triable by a court of sessions.

Hence, the case should have been tried before the magistrate court and not transferred to the special court, the petitioner contended while pointing that as an appeal against the order of magistrate’s court to be filed before the session court, the direct transfer of the case against him to the sessions court deprived one level of appeal in law.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-notice-on-criminal-cases-against-mps-mlas/article30517100.ece
132,2020/01/08,Police deny permission for Sringeri lit fest; organisers say they will go ahead,"The Sringeri police have denied the Chikkamagaluru district unit of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) the permission to hold Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in the town on January 10 and 11. However, the district unit has decided to go ahead with the programme.

The event has been controversial with Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi and some right-wing groups opposing the selection of Kalkuli Vittala Heggade as the sammelan president.

In a letter to Kundur Ashok, president of the district unit of KSP, Sringeri circle Police Inspector Siddaramaiah B.M. said the application seeking permission to hold the sammelan has been rejected and directed him to postpone the event, citing possible law and order issues. “In case you hold the programme and there are any untoward incidents, legal action will be taken holding you as directly responsible,” said the letter. It also cited protests opposing the selection of Mr. Heggade. There had been a tense situation across the country over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and protests were held in Chikkamagaluru too. There would be chances of law and order issues during the event too, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

However, Mr. Ashok told The Hindu that the event would be held as per schedule. “I spoke to the SP of Chikkamagaluru. I have told him that the programme will be peaceful. We have sought police protection for the event,” he said.

Earlier, the central unit of KSP had refused to give ₹5 lakh grant to hold the sammelan, citing Mr. Ravi’s direction. The Minister has criticised the selection of Mr. Heggade as president of the event and said he would support it if he is replaced. The Chikkamagaluru unit of the parishat has crowdfunded resources to hold the sammelana.

Former KSP president and writer Chandrashekhar Patil, writer Baraguru Ramachandrappa and others have criticised the parishat for its stand. Former CM Siddaramaiah criticised Mr. Ravi for his “interference” in the affairs of the parishat, an independent body.

Mr. Ashok said the local committee had been raising funds for the event. “So far, ₹2 lakh has been collected. Our office-bearers are spending from their pockets for the time being,” he said. Many guests have told the organisers that they would attend the event without expecting travel expenses. Interestingly, some have offered to contribute their share to the event.

‘Sammelan will be historic, thanks to opponents’

“The sahitya sammelan at Sringeri will be historic, thanks to all its opponents,” said Mr. Heggade, whose choice as president of the 16th Chikkamagaluru District Kannada Sahitya Sammelan has blown into a controversy.

Kalkuli Vittala Heggade.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Heggade said he never expected to be chosen for this honour. However, he accepted after the executive committee of the district unit of the parishat approached him after selecting him unanimously. If there was no opposition and non-cooperation from the district administration and Central Kannada Sahitya Parishat, this too would have been any other sammelan. “After the parishat refused to give financial assistance, people have come forward to make it a success with their contributions. I am glad a dailywage worker contributed ₹1,000 citing my role in the struggle to save the Tunga and Bhadra rivers,” he said.

Commenting on the allegation that he was a “naxal supporter”, Mr. Heggade said it was a baseless charge. In 2002, the then State government released a list of names terming them “naxal supporters” and withdrew it within two days. “I have fought against a couple of publications for reports calling me a naxal supporter and won the case in court. I have never associated with naxals,” he said.

C.T. Ravi opposes selection of Kalkuli Vittal Heggde

Opposing the selection of Kalkuli Vittala Heggde as the president of Chikkamagaluru district sahitya sammelan, Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi said that he was for changing the president.

Speaking to reporters in Chitradurga on Wednesday, Mr. Ravi alleged that Mr. Heggade had a “naxalite background”.

He said a sahitya sammelan should not trigger clashes and fights but should give a “good cultural message to the people”.

Since the debate in favour of the selection of president of sahitya sammelan and against is going on, the district administration is still discussing on providing funds to the sammelan, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/wafmd/article30520241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-deny-permission-for-sringeri-lit-fest-organisers-say-they-will-go-ahead/article30517076.ece
133,2020/01/08,"Smart City Project: Centre lauds Tumakuru, but State to probe quality","The smart city project at Tumakuru, which has been mired in controversy over allegations of sub-standard works, is finding itself in a paradox of sorts. While the allegation has led to setting up of a probe committee, comprising mostly irrigation experts, it is now being seen as a model for six other smart city projects under way in the State.

On January 10, representatives of other smart city projects will visit Tumakuru to understand its effective implementation. The decision follows appreciation for the way in which the citizen-centric works have been implemented in Tumakuru “with a high degree of quality” during a review of smart city projects by the Secretary and Joint Secretary of Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. So far, 44 projects have been completed in Tumakuru, and 68 have been listed as ongoing.

Interestingly, while the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) letter to the Tumakuru Smart City Ltd. (TSCL) MD lauds the good work, the four-member panel appointed on November 30, 2019, in the light of allegations made by public representatives, has also started its probe.

The “independent” committee is largely formed of irrigation experts — headed by Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (CNNL) MD K. Jayaprakash and technical director M. Ravindrappa, deputy chief engineer of Upper Bhadra Project H.B. Mallesh and retired chief engineer D.S. Harish.

Apart from reviewing and submitting a report on the necessity and quality of the works, the committee has been tasked to “identify” contractors to be “blacklisted” for alleged sub-standard work.

However, top Irrigation Department sources said: “Though the project is monitored by the Urban Development Department, the probe was ordered by the district in-charge secretary. How can Irrigation department officials probe road works? Except Amanikere project, there are no big works concerning water or irrigation. Not only would this amount to unnecessary interference in the work of other departments, but it also raises questions over skill to evaluate projects.”

Other sources said the probe had been taken up based on a note issued by then district in-charge secretary and TSCL chairperson Shalini Rajaneesh in November. “There is no Government Order. It is ridiculous to have a new committee to probe quality as there are already two committees, one by KUIDFC and another by the Public Works Department. In fact, the new committee is seeking technical inputs from the other two,” sources said.

It is learnt that in a semi-government letter addressed to Ms. Rajaneesh, Additional Chief Secretary of Irrigation Department Rakesh Singh, who is also Tumakuru district in-charge secretary, concurred with the appointment of the committee. For the record, amidst allegations by BJP leader Sogadu Shivanna, who also wrote to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Ms. Shalini was transferred. Sources in TSCL also defended the move to appoint the committee. However, sources said that Ms. Rajneesh ordered the probe based on instruction by Tumakuru MP G.S. Basavaraj after he visited the Amanikere project. “It is permissible under law to constitute an independent probe,” said the source.

Meanwhile, TSCL MD T. Bhoobalan said the allegations against quality of works are “superficial and baseless”. “We ensure that we are accountable and transparent in the works. Multiple checks are conducted at each level,” he said. He contended that the allegations had demoralised the staff.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a5hz0d/article30517039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGTUMAKURUSMARTCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/smart-city-project-centre-lauds-tumakuru-but-state-to-probe-quality/article30517040.ece
134,2020/01/08,No effect in Shivamogga,"Normal life remained largely unaffected in the district on Wednesday during the nationwide strike called against the alleged anti-labour policies of the Central government.

As part of the strike, various labour organisations took out a huge rally in Shivamogga city under the aegis of Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU). Members of the organisations representing the employees of nationalised banks and insurance firms, mid-day meals and anganwadi workers, workers serving on contract basis with gram panchayats and medical representatives took part in the rally.

Addressing a protest meet on the premises of Deputy Commissioner’s office, S.B. Shivashankar, convener of JCTU, said the conomic slowdown has resulted in job losses in key sectors including automobiles and textiles. It is unfortunate that the Centre has failed to revive the economy, he said.

He pressed the Centre to take measures for strict enforcement of labour laws related to work duration, payment of salary and allowances, pension, and provident fund and to strengthen the social security net for the workers in the unorganised sector.

Jagadeesh J., president of VISP Workers’ Union, expressed displeasure at the move by the Centre to sell its stake in public sector units (PSUs). He said that the disinvestment in PSUs would prove detrimental to the interests of the workers.

The protesters raised slogans demanding re-commencement of production in Mysore Paper Mills, a PSU in Bhadravati.

135,2020/01/08,Tractor-driven equipment helpsenhance farm yield by up to 25%,"Moisture restoration in soil is vital for better yield for farmers in India, which has over 70 % dry-land area cultivation.

To ensure that moisture remains in soil for a longer period by letting more amount of rainwater percolate, preparation of compartmental bunds is essential.

The University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, has invented a simple tractor-driven compartmental bund preparing equipment that can help easily create smaller bunds in about two acres of land in just about an hour.

“Since most of our land is dependent on rain, farmers have to make sure that they store more amount of rainwater in their farms during rainy season. Preparing compartment bunds helps in collecting more water in farms. This helps retain the moisture for a longer period. The machine which we have developed helps in meeting this objective in a limited time,” says Umar Farooq Momin, Assistant Professor of the University of Agricultural Sciences.

Mr. Momin, who is heading a team, is here to demonstrate the working of the machine at the ongoing Krishi Mela being organised by College of Agricultural Sciences.

He said that the machine creates 4 x 3 size bunds in farms to store rainwater.

Stating that water storing is important for the rabi season, he said that bunds should be prepared during July and August before taking up sowing.

Stating that they have conducted successful trails of the machine in over 100 acres of land in Vijayapura in the past, Mr. Momin said that bunds helped in increase of yield by 20 % to 25 %.

“After such success, several farmers are placing orders for the machine which is priced at around ₹ 40,000. We want more farmers from North Karnataka to use this as it is a rain-dependent area. For better output and higher yield, they should opt for compartmental bunds,” Mr. Momin said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/l1losd/article30516757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGVIJAYAPURATRACTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tractor-driven-equipment-helpsenhance-farm-yield-by-up-to-25/article30516758.ece

Nevertheless, normal life remained unaffected in both the districts as public transport vehicles plied as usual and shops/commercial establishments remained open. Schools and colleges too functioned normally. But, banking and postal services were crippled to some extent.

Demonstrations and protest rallies were held in all 11 taluks – seven in Mandya and four in Ramanagaram district – to condemn the ‘anti-labour policies of the Centre’.

A large number of activists participated in the protest held near Silver Jubilee Park on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here and near KSRTC bus stand in Ramanagaram town.

Members of AIUTUC, CITU, TUCI, ASHAs Workers Association, AIDSO and SUCI among others staged protest in front of the deputy commissioner’s office and shouted slogans against the NDA government’s labour policies. These organisations had planned a procession from Kadapa Maidan to the Deputy Commissioner’s office through the main roads of the city but the police denied them permission to avoid inconvenience to the general public.

138,2020/01/08,"Congress, Left criticised for ‘provoking Muslims’","Sri Ram Sene chief Pramod Mutalik has come down heavily on the Congress and the Left parties for provoking Muslims against CAA and NRC and creating a law and order problem in the country.

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Mutalik said that both of them have spread lies to gain political mileage even though they were aware of the fact that CAA would not do any harm to Muslims.

He said that the Congress has been using Muslims as its vote bank and has never come out with any constructive measures for their [Muslim] amelioration. Now also, it is playing politics to safeguard its vote bank.

He said that the Union government should not budge to its gimmicks. Mahatma Gandhi had said that Hindus fleeing neighbouring Muslim countries should be given Indian citizenship. Nehru and Indira Gandhi too granted citizenship to several Hindus who came to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

During the liberation of Bangladesh, nearly 3,000 Bangladeshi Hindus who fled their country came to Sindhanur taluk of Raichur district and are still living there. Today their population has grown to 30,000 but they do not have citizenship and hence, are deprived of various facilities. This CAA is to help such refugees get shelter in India by granting them citizenship. By opposing this move of the Centre, the Congress and Left parties have betrayed Hindus, he said.

Mr. Mutalik also lashed out at the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for opposing CAA. “Mr. Kumaraswamy himself had admitted that there are more than 50,000 illegal Bangladeshis in Bengaluru and had suggested that the Siddaramaiah government identify them and send them to detention camps. Now, for political gains, Mr. Kumaraswamy is opposing CAA which speaks of his dual standards.

To educate people on CAA and NRC, the Sri Ram Sene will hold awareness programmes involving seers, intellectuals, writers and celebrities in 100 places and also conduct a signature campaign, he said.

The Union Government should shut down Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for two years to throw out mischief-makers and extremists as suggested by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy. However, the Sene opposes the assault on students and professors at JNU and seeks a detailed investigation into the incident.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-left-criticised-for-provoking-muslims/article30516146.ece

140,2020/01/08,Life remains unaffected by strike,"Normal life remained unaffected here on Wednesday even as the nationwide general strike called by various trade unions crippled banking services as the employees struck work and joined the agitation protesting against the Centre’s alleged anti-labour policies and in support of their demands.

A large number of people associated with various trade unions gathered at the JK Grounds and took out a procession till Town Hall seeking fulfilment of their demands. The procession was followed by a public meeting where the members of trade unions sought immediate implementation of a 13-point charter of demands, including minimum wages, pension for all workers, job creation, strict implementation of labour policies, and opening of labour courts in all districts.

The strike, however, did not evoke the anticipated response in the city and had little impact on normal life with all essential services and government offices functioning as usual.

The KSRTC operated normal bus services and schools and colleges functioned as usual. Shops and business establishments, cinema halls and hotels remained open.

Baring the State Bank of India and the Indian Overseas Bank, services of all public sector banks were affected with the members of Mysuru District Bank Employees’ Association (MDBEA) supporting the strike and staging a symbolic demonstration at the Corporation Bank.

With the Postal Joint Action Committee, Mysuru division, supporting the strike, services in post offices were affected.

In view of the strike, the city police deployed elaborate security to prevent any untoward incidents.

The strike was called by INTUC, AITUC, HMS, ClTU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC along with various independent federations and unions in different sectors.

The demands of the banking unions include withdrawal of unwarranted merger of banks; stringent measures to recover defaulted loans from corporates; wage revision and related issues; and adequate recruitment of banking staff.

“Public sector undertakings are being sold away and privatised. Banks, insurance, railways - no sector is being spared. The government is going ahead with privatisation and unwarranted merger of banks despite the employees’ unions’ protests. However, the recovery of corporate bad loans was being ignored while service charges are being increased for the common people,” said a note from MDBEA Secretary Balakrishna H. here. MDBEA spearheaded the strike of bank employees here.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xhhvem/article30520388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/strike-normal-life-unaffected-but-banking-services-hit/article30515313.ece
141,2020/01/08,Little response in Hassan,"The bandh call given by the Left parties and labour organisations received little response in Hassan on Wednesday. The movement of vehicles and public transport was normal, while all government offices were open. Education institutions did not close on the day. Except a few, all private shops were open.

Members of Left parties and farmers’ organisations staged a dharna at the Hemavati Statue Circle in the city. They raised slogans against the Central government and its policies including the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

CITU district president Dharmesh, addressing the gathering, said that country was witnessing economic crisis, while the people in power were engaged in diverting public attention by bringing in the CAA. “The Central government’s policies are against the interests of labourers, farmers, small businessmen and common people. The government has brought in CAA violating the basic principles of the Constitution. All those who have faith in the Constitution should oppose it”, he said. He also criticised the Centre alleging that it had failed to provide jobs for the youths and bring down prices of essential commodities.

M.C. Dongre, district president of the CPI, came down heavily on the Centre for bringing in the CAA. “Show us proof that you people have fought for the country, then we will show our records to prove our citizenship”, he said.

The Centre had failed to control the price of petrol and diesel, and labourers’ fight for enhancement of wages had been ignored. There had been no initiative to eradicate poverty in the country, he added.

Members of Raitha Sangha, AITUC, CITU, municipal workers, pro-Dalit organisations, Tipu Sangharsha Samiti and others participated in the protest.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/53746p/article30515142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08HASSANPROTEST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/little-response-in-hassan/article30514676.ece
142,2020/01/08,"Adivasis bemoan delay in rehabilitation, issue of title deeds","Tribals from Mysuru district have alleged delay in proper rehabilitation of the primitive forest-dwelling tribes by the State government and plan to meet the Chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes to air their grievances.

The Chairman, Nand Kumar Sai, is presently on tour in Karnataka and hence a section of the tribes led by activist M.B. Prabhu of Hunsur will meet him in Bengaluru on Thursday to draw his attention to the plight of the adivasis.

A memorandum highlighting the predicament of the tribals of Hunsur, Periyapatna and H.D. Kote will also be submitted to the Mysuru MP, Pratap Simha, to draw his attention to the lingering tribal rehabilitation problems, said Mr. Prabhu.

The crux of the issue revolves around non-declaration of tribal haadis as revenue villages, non-allotment of title deeds for displaced tribals as part of rehabilitation, and lack of facilities in hamlets.

Mr. Prabhu said though the Lambani thandas have been declared as revenue villages, the tribal haadis have been ignored by the successive governments.

There are scores of tribal hamlets in the district and declaring them as ‘revenue villages’ will help expedite local development by way of better road connectivity, water and power facilities, primary health centres, schools etc. However, the government was dithering on the issue and hence the attention of the National Commission will be drawn towards it, said Mr. Prabhu.

He said there were issues pertaining to non-allotment of land for tribes who were displaced from forests and rehabilitated in Mastigudi in Bheemanahalli GP limits, Sollepura State Forest.

As per the prevailing law the displaced persons, after being shifted to the rehabilitation site, should be handed over the land title deeds so that they can take up agriculture as their vocation.

Though housing and other facilities have been provided, the government has failed to transfer land title deed nor have the scrub jungles cleared to facilitate taking up agriculture on a regular basis, said Mr. Prabhu. Nearly 210 families were shifted to Mastigudi and each family is entitled to nearly 3 acres of land as per the law.

There is a general perception among the tribals that the bulk of the funds released by the Centre and the State governments under various tribal development schemes are cornered by the dominant groups - mainly the Valmiki and the Naika communities – and the primitive tribes like Jenu Kuruba and Soligas are left in the lurch. Hence the tribals, supported by the NGOs, will reiterate their demand for internal reservation for the adivasis, said Mr. Prabhu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kqyf3p/article30520370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tribal-hamlet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/adivasis-bemoan-delay-in-rehabilitation-issue-of-title-deeds/article30514588.ece

144,2020/01/08,Gnyana Sudha NEET Academy inaugurated,"Considering the growing demand for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) coaching in and around Bidar, Gnyana Sudha Vidyalay, a well-known educational institution in the city, launched its Gnyana Sudha NEET Academy on Monday.

After inaugurating the facility at Jyanaranga auditorium on campus, Dhanraj Talampally, Managing Director of Talampally Group, commended Gnyana Sudha Vidyalay for establishing the academy for offering quality coaching to aspirants of medical course after completing PU.

“Gnyana Sudha Vidyalay is known for offering quality education in the district. The institution has now established its own NEET Academy. I hope that the same quality of coaching would be maintained in the academy too. I appeal to students to make use of the academy and be successful in their academic goals,” he said.

Purnima G, president of Gnyana Sudha Vidyalay, said that the academy would, apart from providing coaching for NEET, offer quality coaching for JEE as well.

“The very purpose of establishing this academy is to offer quality coaching at an affordable cost so that the economically weaker sections of society could also benefit. Students need to be more competent to be successful in this highly competitive environment. Such academies would be of great help in making students capable of facing the competitive examinations,” she said.

Muneshwar Lakha, director of the institution, said that the absence of NEET coaching centres in the district and the resultant deprivation of quality coaching to students forced the institution to establish the academy. “We have appointed trained and qualified teaching staff to maintain quality,” he said.

145,2020/01/08,‘Revoke Sudheendra Rao’s appointment to KSPCB’,"Samaj Parivartana Samudaya (SPS) has urged the State government to cancel the appointment of M. Sudheendra Rao as chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, SPS founder-president S.R. Hiremath said that the appointment of Mr. Rao to KSPCB defies a Supreme Court order pertaining to appointments to State Pollution Control Boards.

In this particular case, the State government did not comply with the Supreme Court order of September 22, 2017 in Techi Tagi Tara vs Rajendra Singh Bhandari and others with regard to a National Green Tribunal Order of August 24, 2016 and a High Court of Karnataka order of September 23, 2019 in Anjaneya Reddy vs State of Karnataka and others. Interestingly, the High Court had set aside the appointment of MLA Sudhakar as KSPCB chairman by the previous Siddaramaiah government and had directed the State government to frame appropriate guidelines or recruitment rules within six months thereof. However, it has been more than two years and the State government has not come up with any rules.

Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa and Chief Secretary Sandeep Dave should initiate steps to revoke the appointment of Mr. Rao and appoint a qualified person while complying with court orders. SPS would be compelled to approach court if the government failed to do so, he said.

Mr. Hiremath also condemned the incidents at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on January 5 and demanded that Union Home Minister Amit Shah tender his resignation owning responsibility.

If Mr. Shah refuses to resign from the post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should sack him from the Union Council of Ministers, he said.

Mr. Hiremath also hailed the protest by students and youth against CAA. The non-violent protest of students against CAA has bewildered the BJP government, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8jp699/article30509976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08HBHIREMATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/revoke-sudheendra-raos-appointment-to-kspcb/article30509977.ece

In a release, Jitendra Vashistha, Head of Corporate Communications, JSW Steel, said that the declaration was made after an extensive and stringent audit on January 1, 2020, to mark a new beginning in the new decade.

“Getting in tune with India’s inclusive resolve to put strong measures to reduce plastic pollution, JSW Steel, which is among the largest steel plants in the world, has taken up SUP-free challenge. It’s a step further to emerge into an eco-friendlier world by resolving to earnestly say ‘NO’ to Single-Use Plastics (SUP) from the very beginning of a new year (2020). This inclusive drive came into effect after the organisation-wide appeal made by the JSW Group Chairman Sajjan Jindal, urging all JSW office & plant locations to instantly cease the use of SUP,” he said.

As a continuation of its green initiatives to deal with the climate change challenges, he added, the steel giant as also planted 200 saplings in the newly built Hill Side Township for JSW employees in the presence of Rajashekhar Pattanasetty, President – JSW Steel Vijayanagar Works and other senior executives of JSW, including Vijay Sinha and Manjunath Prabhu, Senior Vice Presidents.

“As a first step in its endeavour, all the employees of the department a building have taken a pledge to not only say ‘no’ to SUP but also create awareness among their family members, friends, relatives, guests and fellow-citizens at large, to give up the use of SUP. It was also categorically informed that these inorganic, man-made materials have become a real big menace to all forms of life; demolishing natural balance across land, sea, and sky as it was notorious for their interference in natural ecosystems and for causing the death of aquatic organisms, animals, and birds. It’s an appeal to accord number one priority to quickly rise to the occasion and act in the direct sync with the loud and clear ‘clarion-call’ of Refusing, Reducing & Renouncing SUP to the extent possible,” he said. During the launch of the movement against SUP at the beginning of the New Year, Mr. Pattanasetty had appealed to the people to join hands and resolve to make their home as well as workplace SUP free.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bg7t0h/article30509956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BG-JSW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jsw-declares-parts-of-its-premises-in-ballari-plastic-free/article30509957.ece

149,2020/01/08,No bar on me becoming Minister: Vishwanath,"The former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, among the aspirants for a Ministerial berth in the State government, has clarified that there is no bar on him becoming a Minister.

Reacting to V. Srinivas Prasad, MP, citing an observation by the Supreme Court that disqualified MLAs could become Ministers only if they win in the bypolls, Mr. Vishwanath said he had spoken to Mr. Prasad on the matter.

“I have sent Mr. Prasad a copy of the SC judgement and even had the lawyer arguing our case speak to him,” Mr. Vishwanath told The Hindu on Tuesday.

“Mr. Prasad had been misinformed. He has made such a statement as somebody told him so,” Mr. Vishwanath said.

A Minister, who is neither a member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council, has six months to become a member of either of the Houses.

Mr. Vishwanath was among the 17 MLAs who resigned from the coalition government, led by H.D. Kumaraswamy, in July last year leading to its collapse.

He was one of the 15 candidates fielded by the BJP in the December 5 bypolls with a promise to accommodate them in the Ministry.

While 13 of the BJP candidates won, Mr. Vishwanath and MTB Nagaraj lost from Hunsur, and Hoskote respectively. Mr. Vishwanath’s hopes of becoming a Minister appeared to suffer a setback when Mr. Prasad argued that candidates who had lost in the bypolls can’t be accommodated in the Ministry.

Mr. Prasad even cited the Supreme Court ruling which, he claimed, had made victory in the bypolls a pre-requisite for becoming a Minister. Incidentally, Harsh Vardhan, Nanjangud MLA, who is also Mr. Prasad’s son-in-law, had thrown his hat in the ring by staking a claim for a Ministerial berth after the results of the bypolls. It may be mentioned here that Mr. Vishwanath regards Mr. Prasad highly and had even claimed that he would not have joined the BJP had it not been for his invitation.

Soon after resigning from the Assembly in July last year, Mr. Vishwanath had even announced his retirement from electoral politics.

He was to enter the BJP Ministry through the Legislative Council route, according to reliable sources.

But, Mr. Vishwanath did a volte face and decided to contest the bypolls only to lose.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-bar-on-me-becoming-minister-vishwanath/article30509931.ece

154,2020/01/08,HC asks Isha Foundation to disclose amount collected for Cauvery Calling,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday asked Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev’s Isha Foundation to spell out the amount collected so far for their ‘Cauvery Calling’ project, besides questioning whether the foundation was authorised to collect funds for the project. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar directed the foundation to file its additional statements as the earlier statement filed did not contain details like the manner of fund collection and whether the contribution towards Cauvery Calling was voluntary or not.

As the statement filed by the foundation did not contain the name of the ‘authorised signatory’, the Bench said that law mandates disclosure of details of persons filling statements before the court and orally observed that “even spiritual organisations are bound by law”.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition, filed by city-based advocate A.V. Amaranathan, who had alleged that the State government was allowing the foundation to use government land to plant saplings by collecting over ₹10,000 crore as donation from the public.

KAPY scheme of 2011

In its statement, the government said that the foundation is only promoting and creating awareness about the government’s Krishi Aranya Protsaha Yojane (KAPY), an agro-forestation scheme, which was started in 2011. The KAPY scheme is about giving saplings of their choice to farmers at subsidised rates and offering them annual incentives of ₹10, ₹15, and ₹20 for the first, the second and the third year for every surviving sapling planted under the scheme. In 2017, these incentives had been enhanced, the government pointed out to the court.

In a bid to encourage private participation in the scheme, the government made provisions for the payment of incentives for the voluntary act of private agencies of educating and mobilising farmers to enrol into the KAPY scheme, the government stated. It pointed out that Cauvery Calling was submitted to the government in April 2019, and it was accepted only for the limited purpose of mobilisation of farmers and enrolling them in to the existing KAPY scheme.

The government has also clarified that the it was neither sponsoring nor financing the project of the foundation, and the drive of the foundation to collect donation for saplings was not part of the KAPY scheme and such collection of donation, if any, would be a “private affair.” The government further clarified that it is neither participating in nor promoting the foundation’s project.

While denying the allegation made by the petitioner that government lands were being used for the foundation’s project, the government said neither any land of the government has been given for the project nor the has the foundation taken over the government’s project. However, the foundation has already started its task of creating awareness programmes for people residing in the Cauvery basin and is promoting KAPY, the government said.

25 crore saplings

In its statement, the foundation stated that total cost of planting saplings (with the cost of each sapling between ₹3 and ₹30), its maintenance, manpower, training, etc., would not be less than ₹100. However, the same has been capped at ₹42 per sapling. At present, 69,760 farmers have come forwarded to provide their lands for planting of the saplings and in Karnataka, it is proposed to plant 25 crore saplings in the Cauvery basin, the foundation claimed.

The Bench adjourned further hearing till February 12.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/94ytz0/article30507341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGCAUVERYCALLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-asks-isha-foundation-to-disclose-amount-collected-for-cauvery-calling/article30507343.ece
155,2020/01/08,There is atmosphere of fear in the country: Priyank Kharge,"Stating that there is an atmosphere of fear in the country created by the Union government, the former Minister and MLA, Priyank Kharge, has said students are out on the streets to oppose such an atmosphere.

Speaking after unveiling a statue of B. R. Ambedkar at Otihal village in Sindgi taluk on Tuesday, he said that BJP is forcing its ideology on the people of India.

“Forcing any idea on citizens is completely against the fundamentals of the Constitution. We are free to raise our views and accept any idea. But the BJP, which never believed in this basic principle, has been forcing the people to accept its ideology,” he accused.

Asserting that the contribution of Sangh Parivar in the freedom movement was nil, Mr. Kharge asked the right-wing organisations where they were when people were sacrificing their lives to fight against the British.

“Today, the same people are bent on changing the principles of the Constitution. India is not run from Delhi but from Nagpur, which is the headquarters of the RSS,” he claimed.

He said that it was Ambedkar who prepared the Constitution which is best suitable as it promotes social and political equality.

Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said that the Act is completely against Article 14 of the Constitution, which bars the government from giving citizenship based on the religion.

156,2020/01/08,24-hour run between two cities for gender equality,"A group of running enthusiasts reached Mysuru from Bengaluru in a 24-hour-long relay run between the two cities.

A total of 28 runners, including nine women, who are all part of Running Roadies, took turns to run on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway as part of their mission to promote gender equality.

The exercise was flagged off from the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru at 3.30 p.m. on Saturday, and it reached the Mysuru palace at 3.30 p.m. on Sunday.

28 participants

A total of 148 km by the 28 participants, who ranged from 52-year-old Seema Gupta to 23-year-old Raushan Kumar Sah. Each participant had run about 6 to 7 km, as drawn up earlier.

About three to four participants ran together. As per the schedule, the other runners would take over when a group’s run was completed.

“To ensure the safety of the participants, the organisers had a SUV tailing the runners, shielding them from the other vehicles on the highway,” Gurleen Singh, founder of the Running Roadies, told The Hindu.

During the night, the runners wore reflector jackets and torches on their heads. Those not running were in a 25-seater bus that accompanied them.

A road stretch of 6 km, starting from a distance of 85 km to 91 km from Bengaluru, was set aside exclusively for women. All the nine women ran the 6 km in addition to their respective slots.

“This was to show that, if we ensure safety, women can do anything possible. The aim of the run was to send out a strong message to the girls out there that they are equal, if not stronger, than boys,” said Mr. Gurleen Singh. “Don’t let the society define your boundaries,” he added.

Joining the runners in the last lap of 1 km was 92-year-old Dattatreya, an avid runner from Bengaluru.

Self-funded

The run was self-funded through donations by the 28 runners and other members of the running group. “Our mission was only to promote gender equality,” Mr. Gurleen Singh added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4jtgvh/article30507308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BG-ADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/24-hour-run-between-two-cities-for-gender-equality/article30507309.ece
157,2020/01/08,"Anganwadi workers, assistants take out protest rally","Anganwadi workers and assistants took out a rally here on Tuesday in protest against the delay in payment of their mother and child tracking system (MCTS) incentive by the State government.

They walked from the Rani Channamma Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office. They held placards and shouted slogans against the government. They submitted a list of demands that included regularisation of services, increase in salary and allowances and time-bound promotions.

They said that the State government had not paid the MCTS incentive for 15 months now. They complained that the State government had failed to keep its promise of paying arrears of the incentive. “Following a rally by anganwadi workers in Bengaluru on January 3, the Chief Minister agreed to fulfil our demands,” they added.

Though he has responded positively to some demands, he is yet to consider the main demand of paying arrears of incentives. That needs to be done immediately, they said.

They vowed not to take up any government work such as surveys, delivery of services, training and examinations and health services that they may be deputed to.

158,2020/01/08,ASCEND 2020 to present three investment channels,"Three investment channels, including a $250 to $500 million Kerala infrastructure fund, are ready to be presented at ASCEND 2020, an investors’ meet which will be inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday.

The two-day conclave of would-be investors will be an occasion to present Kerala as a stage ripe for fresh investments in areas ranging from defence technology and petrochemicals to food processing and hospitality.

The meet will also be an occasion for the State to present a progress card on improving its business environment since the ease-of-doing business campaign was launched at ASCEND 2019, Industries Department sources said. At least 30 to 40 agreements for fresh investments during the conclave are also expected.

M. Khalid, president of the Kerala State Small Industries’ Association and an invited speaker at ASCEND, expects the conclave to take forward Kerala’s efforts to become more business-friendly. Initiatives like allowing a new industry (involving investment up to ₹10 crore) to begin operations for three years on the basis of self-certification are bold, he said.

Investors’ demand

Chairman and managing director of the Kerala State Industries Development Corporation K. Ellangovan said potential investors sought investment framework and project profiles when the State reached out to them through roadshows ahead of ASCEND. Three investment frameworks would be on the meet menu.

As per the first model, the government would offer land to private companies, who as partners would develop industrial parks or spaces that could be sold or rented out to investors. The second was a special purpose vehicle model in which the State would be a minor partner and the private investor would take control with a major share of investment. This was expected to suit mega projects.

The third investment model was for financing projects. The corpus, on the lines of Indian infrastructure fund, would be an instrument for those with capital to invest. Dr. Ellangovan said the fund would close in March.

A hundred projects in sectors such as petrochemicals, agro and food processing, life sciences, ports and harbour, and fisheries will be showcased. Of these 18 involve investments of ₹100 crore or more, said an official statement.

While the conclave’s focus is on fresh investments, industrialists such as Mr. Khalid feel that those already running enterprises in Kerala should be turned into brand ambassadors for the State. He said the government should also develop vehicles to expedite solution sought by units that were already in operation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bllrvq/article30520416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILEPHOTOASCENDKERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ascend-2020-to-present-three-investment-channels/article30517199.ece
159,2020/01/08,HC dismisses bail plea of accused,"The Kerala High Court on Wednesday dismissed the bail petition of ten accused in a case relating to the murder of two Youth Congress workers, Kripesh and P.K. Sarath Lal, at Periye in Kasaragod.

In their petition, A. Peethambaran, former CPI(M) leader, and nine other accused, contended that they were entitled to be released on ‘compulsive bail’ as the chargesheet filed against them by the investigating officer before the expiry period of 90 days had been quashed by a single judge.

The chargesheet was quashed while ordering a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Verdict reserved

Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy observed that the State had filed an appeal against the single judge’s judgment and a Division Bench reserved its verdict.

He also submitted that once the chargesheet had been filed before the court concerned before the expiry of the deadline for filing the same under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the right of the accused to get bail stood extinguished.

Dismissing the bail petition, Justice Narayana Pisharadi observed that once the chargesheet was filed within the statutory period, the right of the accused for default bail had been negated. Besides, such a right did not get revived merely for the reason that the court had set aside or quashed the chargesheet. The single judge’s judgment had not become final.

Finality of judgment

The Division Bench was yet to pronounce the judgment in the appeal. Before the judgment of the single judge attained finality it could not be said that the chargesheet filed against the accused had permanently gone or vanished.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-accused/article30517193.ece

Dr. Ameen was delivering the third Dr. Fazal Mohammed memorial lecture on ‘Smartphone apps in Medicine and Psychiatry’ at the Department of Psychiatry at Pushpagiri Medical College in Thiruvalla on Wednesday.

There are entirely different sets of mobile applications other than social media, which physicians or psychiatrists can use for the benefit of patients.

According to him, there are apps which remind one to take medicines on time and even let the family member know whether one has taken it or not.

However, Dr Ameen stressed the need to ensure the authenticity of the source of these applications, whether they are developed by medical personnel or not. He spoke on the usefulness of the apps in screening for various disorders, for administering psychological scales and tests, and in the field of research.

Presiding over the meeting, Roy Abraham Kallivayalil, secretary general, World Psychiatric Association, said mobile apps should not replace the therapeutic alliance between a patient and the doctor.

To assess health

It was always advisable to use these apps for assessing the patient’s health conditions only and that too on the advice of the treating physician or the psychiatrist.

168,2020/01/08,"Allergy ad irks doctors, health activists","Doctors and health activists have found fault with what they term a “misleading advertisement” on allergy tests that appeared in major Malayalam newspapers recently. As a similar one had found its way onto their front pages a couple of months ago, medical professionals now seek action against those who placed the advertisement.

Functionaries of the Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE), a forum under the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad, on Tuesday lodged a complaint with the State Police Chief and the Advertising Standards Council of India.

TCMC probe

V.G. Pradeep Kumar, vice president, Travancore-Cochin Medical Council (TCMC), told The Hindu on Wednesday that the government should put in place a mechanism to curb such advertisements. When the TCMC conducted an inquiry into the advertisement that appeared last year, it was found that the doctors mentioned had not registered themselves with the council. So, action could not be initiated. The latest advertisement did not have any doctors’ names, Dr. Pradeep Kumar said.

A.V. Jayakrishnan, who is part of the ethics committee of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kerala chapter, said complaints had been lodged with the police and the Health Department last time.

“The committee will discuss the issue at its meeting scheduled for January last week,” he added.

U. Nandakumar, chairman, CAPSULE, and M.P. Anil Kumar, its convener, said in their complaint that the advertisements had urged people to get themselves tested for allergy symptoms at designated labs, offering a flat 50% discount. It defined what allergy was, listed the symptoms, and explained its health impacts. The advertisement asked the people, even if they did not have allergic reactions, to get a blood test done without the advice of a medical practitioner.

The complaint said that only registered medical practitioners were allowed to diagnose and treat diseases in the State, as highlighted by the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court through their orders issued on January 8, 2003 and April 13, 2018 respectively.

The advertisement did not give details of the institution that placed it and the name of the lab mentioned was not legible. The chain of laboratories that collected the blood samples was titled medistreams diagnostics, a Chennai-based firm, but there were no details such as a website, phone number, or email ID. Also, medistreams did not conduct lab tests on its own, but was sending the samples elsewhere. The advertisement did not say what type of tests were being performed, and how much blood was required etc.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/allergy-ad-irks-doctors-health-activists/article30517131.ece
169,2020/01/08,Turning plastic waste into works of art,"There will not be much electronic and plastic junk left in Kottarakara as the block panchayat is planning to turn them into artefacts for its soon-to-be-opened museum.

The objective of the project is to popularise scientific methods of waste processing and spread awareness about permanent waste management systems.

Along with artefacts and sculptures, models of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste-processing systems will be displayed.

“We will be displaying the models of Thumboormuzhi aerobic compost unit, ring composting and pipe composting so that the public will get an idea of various waste management systems,” says block panchayat president S. Sasikumar.

Kottarakara block panchayat has the biggest plastic-shredding facility in the district that started functioning near its office in February last. Currently, the 2,500-sq ft unit supervised by Green Kerala Company receives plastic waste from several places, including areas outside the panchayat.

“The waste brought to the unit will be used for making the items to be exhibited at the museum. Sculptors with expertise in the field will be hired to create works of art out of discarded objects,” Mr. Sasikumar says.

Waste collection system

Trash will be transformed into sculptures, toys, chairs, waste-processing models, and home décor articles. An amount of ₹10 lakh will be used from the Plan fund to construct 1,000-sq ft museum next to the processing plant.

“We already have a very efficient non-biodegradable waste collection system in place with collection points in all panchayats. At the plant, the plastic first gets sorted into some twenty-plus categories. It is then baled to be sold and we recently sold plastic worth ₹3.5 lakh. Plastic that cannot be recycled will be shredded,” he says. The museum will also showcase plastic-waste disposal methods, including the segregation process.

“We get a lot of visitors at the processing unit and the museum will be an ideal platform to educate the public about how to handle trash. We will hire the artists this month and the museum will be opened shortly,” he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/turning-plastic-waste-into-works-of-art/article30517130.ece

He recalled the virulent opposition of the LDF towards the global investors’ meet held on two previous occasions when the United Democratic Front was in power.

He said the allegation of his holding benami property had been a subject of inquiry by the income tax authorities. It was alleged that the petitioner was the benamidar of a property of a company named ISRA Agro Tech Systems Pvt limited.

He pointed out that the property was located in Tamil Nadu and the State police or State government had absolutely no jurisdiction to conduct any inquiry or investigation into the alleged transaction. Besides, a complaint in this regard could be filed only by an officer of the Central government or officer authorised by the State government. In the instant case, the complaint was filed by a third party.

Moreover, there was no reference to the investigation or inquiry by any police officers of the State into such offences under the Act.

Therefore, the government order authorising the Crime Branch to conduct an investigation had no legal validity.

In fact, only those officers who were specified under Section 18 of the Act could conduct any inquiry into the allegation of the benami transaction. Therefore, an investigation by the police officer was totally barred.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-stays-cb-probe-in-jacob-thomas-case/article30517110.ece
173,2020/01/08,"Strike total, incident-free in Palakkad, Malappuram","The 24-hour general strike called by trade unions against the “anti-labour and anti-people” policies of the Central government was total in the neighbouring districts of Palakkad and Malappuram.

All public transport carriers, including Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), stayed off the road.

Shops and business establishments remained closed. Traders in Palakkad and Malappuram did not heed the call by Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi State leader T. Nasiruddeen to open shops. Schools and colleges did not function.

Striking workers and sympathisers took out demonstrations in all major towns, including Palakkad, Malappuram, Ottappalam, Manjeri, Kondotty, Tirur, Perinthalmanna, Shoranur, Kottakkal, Edappal, and Pattambi. Demonstrations were taken out in 58 centres in Palakkad district alone.

No road blocks

Accepting the strike call made quite in advance, people by and large stayed away from venturing out. Very few private vehicles were seen on the road, although no road blocks were erected anywhere. The police said no untoward incident was reported.

Employees in banking and insurance sectors too joined the strike.

Although journalists did not strike work, they held demonstrations registering solidarity with the striking workers.

The Kanjikode industrial sector came to a standstill as workers in various industries stayed away from work. According to the Kanjikode Industrial Forum, the strike caused a heavy loss.

Passengers who reached major railway stations such as Palakkad, Ottappalam, Shoranur, and Tirur had difficulties in reaching their destinations. The police helped some passengers to reach homes.

Although Sabarimala pilgrims were exempted from the strike, the two KSRTC services to Erumeli from Palakkad did not conduct services. The Karunya Pharmacy at District Hospital, Palakkad, remained closed and the patients had to depend on private medical stores outside.

Public vehicles, including KSRTC buses, kept off the road. Taxis and autorickshaws also stayed away. However, private cars and two-wheelers were seen on the road.

Shops and business establishments did not function. Though Kerala Vyapari Vyavasyi Ekopana Samithi refused to participate in the strike, a majority of shops remained closed as the workers failed to reach. Only a few shops in some rural areas were opened in the morning. But they too were closed after sometime. Major markets and bus stands in the city wore a deserted look. Education institutions remained closed. Government offices witnessed a thin attendance.

Striking trade unions took out protest marches in major centres, including Swaraj Round. Workers of organised, unorganised, and traditional sectors participated.

Goods carriers stopped

No major untoward incidents were reported from the district. Strike supporters stopped goods carriers and taxi vehicles at Puthukkad. Hartal supporters blocked workers of Infopark, Koratty. Tight security was in place across the district.

The Guruvayur temple witnessed huge rush on Wednesday. Thousands, including Ayyappa devotees from other States, thronged the temple. Though buses and taxis did not conduct services, vehicles of Ayyappa devotees were not blocked. However, shops were not opened in the temple town. Though some of the shops were opened, strike supporters asked them to close.

As restaurants were not opened, devotees found it difficult to get food. The Prasada Oottu of the temple was the only solace. More than 10,000 devotees attended it. In all, 20 weddings and 500-odd Choroonu rituals were held in the temple.

Mr.Kumar told reporters that the police remained mute spectators to the violence unleashed by hartal supporters. The hartal sponsored by the government preceded an investors’ meet being organised by the government and that is quite strange, he said.

176,2020/01/08,Documenting lives and travels of Khalāsis,"Stories about the seafarers of Malabar underlie the maritime history of Kerala. And K.R. Sunil had a particular way of capturing it. He did it through photographs, several of them.

Now they are on display at the School of Gandhian Thought and Development Studies, Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), Kottayam. The exhibition, being organised in connection with the fifth edition of the Kerala History Congress at the university, will run for three days from January 9 to 11.

Pioneers

‘Manchukkar — The Seafarers of Malabar’ documents the lives and travels of Khalāsis from Malabar. According to the organisers, the history of Manchukkar is the history of the pioneers of cross-regional labour vital to the functioning of trade, transportation, and pilgrimage throughout the Arabian Sea and beyond.

The cross-regional trade incorporated the seafarers of Malabar into a globalised community of great geographical, linguistic, and social diversity.

Fact and fiction

According to MH Ilias, head of the department, the travel accounts of Manchukkar are a rich source of geography, ethnography, and cultural history of Kerala.

As short narrative texts, they provide channels for knowing best the cultural and anthropological settings in each seafaring community, though sometimes they may easily cross the boundaries between reality and imagination.

“The stories of miracles and divinity widely circulated among them make statements of freedom from the prison-like confines of the realist-rationalist conventions. There are several interesting dimensions to such narratives as the particular mode of travel has for all practical purposes been referred to as ‘illegal’ without proper documents and there are many painful experiences attached to each journey,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5yaheh/article30517082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvKhalasisbw2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/documenting-lives-and-travels-of-khalsis/article30517075.ece

Justice Ashok Menon passed the the order on a petition filed by the wife, mother and children of the deceased Rajkumar seeking a CBI probe in the case.

Notification

According to them, despite the government notification according sanction for a CBI investigation in the case registered by the Peermedu police station, the CBI was yet to take over the investigation.

CBI counsel submitted that it could investigate a case only on a specific direction from the High Court.

In the instant case, the State had given its consent for an investigation and requested the Centre to entrust it to CBI.

In fact, it was under consideration before the Central government.

As a result, it was unable to take over the investigation by registering an First Information Report.

Delaying

180,2020/01/08,Buildings will come down safely: experts,"The demolition of H2O Holy Faith and Golden Kayaloram apartments here has been designed in such a way that the structures will come down safely without much impact on nearby structures and the waterbody, according to demolition experts.

Briefing the media on the premises of Golden Kayaloram, Uttkarsh Mehta, partner of Edifice Engineering, and Joe Brinkman of Jet Demolition, South Africa, said the building would come down in two seconds and H2O Holy Faith in four seconds. Jain Coral Cove will take 5.6 seconds to be razed, and the building will collapse towards the east-west direction.

In two stages

A two-stage demolition has been planned for Golden Kayaloram, which will be completed within the time limit, and the structure will come down in the form of a waterfall. The first 11 floors of Golden Kayaloram will come down towards the eastern side of the building and the remaining floors towards the western side.

In the case of H2O Holy Faith, the building will come down towards the area between the waterbody and the bridge, and the debris will land safely. The blasts have been designed in such a way that parts of the building will not fall into the waterbody, the experts said.

The alluvial soil in the area has come as a blessing for the demolition process as it will not transmit vibrations caused when the structure hits the floor. Adequate safety measures have been put in place to contain the impact of the demolition. The possibility of debris falling into the waterbody is less. Debris that may fly off to the waterbody will be removed using excavators, they added.

The blast will be triggered by a team of five men who will be stationed at a distance of 71 metres from the buildings. The dust emanating from the site will settle in a matter of minutes. Water will be sprayed over the rubble and debris to control the dust which will dissipate in five to 10 minutes. There will be no toxic dust from the demolition site and hence no major public health hazard.

The vibration caused by the demolition will be less. The sound of the blast could be heard at least 100 metres away from the site.

Drone cameras

Blast seismographs numbering 10 have been placed to record vibrations caused by the demolition. Drone cameras will be used to document the blast. Documentation of the impact of the demolition is required to find out whether nearby buildings have suffered damage, the experts said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1qohru/article30517034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-EXPERTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/buildings-will-come-down-safely-experts/article30517028.ece
181,2020/01/08,Nobel laureate has a brush with the strike,"Nobel laureate Michael Levitt and a fellow foreign traveller visiting Kuttanad had a harrowing experience on Wednesday after the houseboat they were travelling in was blocked by supporters of the nationwide general strike at C Block near here.

Mr. Levitt, on a visit to Kerala as a guest of the government, was stranded in the boat for more than two hours.

Prof. Levitt, an American-British-Israeli biophysicist, started cruising in a houseboat from Kumarakom in Kottayam on Tuesday and reached R Block by evening.

“As there was no protest on Wednesday, we set sail and reached C Block around 10.30 a.m. Then, strike supporters came in a boat and blocked our houseboat. We were forced to anchor the boat at C Block,” said a boat employee.

Sreekumar M.P., owner of the boat, said he filed an online complaint with the police. The boat was allowed to sail around 12.30 p.m. After completing the cruise, he would disembark at Kumarakom on Thursday.

Based on a complaint filed by the houseboat crew, the Pulinkunnu police registered a case against four persons under Sections 283, 342 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

No complaint

“We have met Michael Levitt. He told us that he has no complaint,” said an official.

Earlier, the coordination committee of trade unions that called the strike against the Union government’s labour policies had said the tourism industry would be exempted.

Meanwhile, Achuthsankar S. Nair, head, Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at University of Kerala, in a Facebook post said Mr. Levitt had mailed him after the incident.

Fan of Kerala

“Prof. Michael Levitt, Nobel laureate, was a fan of Kerala till yesterday. Today, he was stopped from a pre-booked houseboat journey. He just mailed me this: I have been warned against protesting to the union people who are illegally enforcing the strike against the union declaration that “tourism is exempted”.

Still, this treatment of an official guest of the Kerala State Government is not good for tourism, the State of Kerala, or the Country of India,” reads the post by Mr. Achuthsankar.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said on Wednesday that around 200 people, including students and teachers of VMHM Higher Secondary School, Anayamkunnu, near Karassery, Mukkom, had complained of viral fever and throat pain since the first week of this month.

The throat swabs of seven of them were sent to the Manipal Institute of Virology for detailed lab tests which confirmed the presence of H1N1. Dr. Jayasree said none of the affected people had been admitted as in-patients in hospitals. The department stepped up surveillance in view of the reporting of new cases each day, she said.

Meanwhile, Thomas Mathew, headmaster of the school, said there was no chance of any infection from water or food on their premises.

183,2020/01/08,Sabarimala: Travancore Devaswom Board may take tempered stance,"Ahead of the Supreme Court commencing further hearing on the Sabarimala women’s entry issue, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) is reported to be veering round to a tempered stance that will lay accent on ensuring a smooth and peaceful pilgrimage.

The board, scheduled to meet in the next two days, will weigh all options, including its legal obligation for implementing the apex court decision, but will give due weightage to the need for conserving the ritualistic tradition.

Mayhem

The mayhem that erupted after the September 28, 2018 Supreme Court verdict according permission for women of all age groups to have darshan at the temple and the disruption of pilgrimage are the main factors that seem to have prompted the board to give due weightage to all factors before crystallising its stance. The Union Home Department had directed the State to initiate steps to implement the apex court decision, but once the State took the lead, the tables were turned against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the government and the onus was squarely placed on it. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which welcomed the verdict altered their stance in due course and emerged as the champions of those opposed to the verdict. The government and the board had to bear the blame of failing to protect the right of the devotees for a peaceful pilgrimage.

“The TDB has its legal obligation to abide by the Supreme Court decision, whatever it may be. We will accept it in letter and spirit. Along with that, the board has to consider other complementing factors such as conduct of a smooth and peaceful pilgrimage in the coming years and conservation of rituals and traditions. All these would figure in our priorities before arriving at a final conclusion, TDB president N. Vasu told The Hindu.

Improving amenities

The board was now focussed on further improving pilgrim amenities so that more pilgrims could have darshan without giving room for any complaints, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hphy2g/article30520382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SABARIMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tdb-may-take-a-tempered-stance-on-sabarimala/article30515497.ece
184,2020/01/08,General strike paralyses normal life in State,"The 24-hour general strike called by trade unions in protest against the anti-labour policies of the Centre paralysed life in no small measure in Kerala.

The lockdown called by the Joint Action Committee of Trade Unions manifested in a punishing State-wide blockade on the eve of ASCEND 2020, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government's much-publicised pitch to portray Kerala as an investment-friendly destination for global businesses.

In a high-profile incident, strike supporters prevented the passage of a houseboat carrying Nobel laureate Michael Levitt and fellow foreign tourist who were on a leisure trip along the backwaters of Alappuzha.

Mr. Levitt was in Kerala as a State guest and the strike supporters had held up his boat for an hour. The police have registered a case, and Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran has regretted the incident. The action has also angered trade union leaders who had exempted the tourism sector and Sabarimala pilgrimage from the shutdown.

The industrial lockdown assumed the proportions of a bandh in the State. People could not get to hospitals or report for work. Stage carriage services ceased operations. Two-wheelers and private cars plied only at intervals.

JEE aspirants hit

Kerala State Road Transport Corporation employees struck work. Students missed study. Hundreds of aspirants for medical and engineering courses strained to reach Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) (Main) centres in time for the test. Shops and restaurants remained shuttered. The movement of freight stopped. Governance was at a minimum. Public offices worked on skeletal staff.

The strike immobilised the banking sector and turned busy markets and commercial districts into ghost towns. Trade unionists forced the closure of banks in Thiruvalla.

Television channels repeatedly broadcast videos of trade unionists stopping autorickshaws in different parts of the State and forcing passengers, including women, to step out and walk the distance to their destination. Stranded commuters pointed out that Kerala was facing its second siege-like strike in the past 30 days. A dawn-to-dusk hartal in protest the new citizenship law had transfixed normal life on December 17.

Strike supporters attempted to stop private vehicles in front of the Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram. However, sources said the strike did not affect the work at the IT hub.

Sabarimala pilgrimage

The strike did not affect the Sabarimala pilgrimage. The temple witnessed eight-hour queues and unusually large crowds. The business was usual at tourism destinations, including Kovalam in Thiruvananthapuram, which was exempted from the shutdown.

Striking unions held marches in all district centres. CITU State general secretary Elamaram Kareem inaugurated the protest in Thiruvananthapuram.

The intensity of the strike appeared to abate as it ground on to its final hours ending on Wednesday midnight.

By evening, private vehicles and motorbikes had started plying as usual.

189,2020/01/08,"‘Unsung warriors are also women,' says Kajol on 'Tanhaji'","With a history as diverse as India’s, it is easy to forget moments that have set the ball rolling for our future. History textbooks have only told us stories through words and pictures, making it at times difficult to understand the intensity of these events. In keeping with the current trend in Bollywood – historical films – is Ajay Devgn’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.

Legendary hero

Starring Ajay Devgn, Kajol, Saif Ali Khan and Sharad Kelkar among others, the story revolves around the battle led by Tanhaji Malusare, a Maratha warrior from the 17th century Maratha Empire. He was Chattrapati Shivaji's closest aide and trusted lieutenant and was ready to lay down his life for his king. Armed with a few Maratha soldiesr, he set out to get back the Kondana Fort (now known as Sinhagad) against the Mughal army headed by Udai Bhan. Unfortunately, Tanhaji lost his life during this battle, but his efforts did not go in vain.

In conversation with The Hindu, actor Kajol shared her experience playing the part of Savitri Malusare, Tanhaji’s wife and working on her first period film. While the trailer depicts the actor donning the look to perfection, in reality Kajol, says she took time to be fully accustomed to the feeling of having it on for long durations while shooting the film. “The real challenge was to make it look like I did this every day, that I was completely comfortable wearing the nauvari. When you wear it, it’s a different experience,” she explained

The good fight

This experience stood out for Kajol and is quite different from the roles she has played in her career thus far. Savitri’s character is not just that of Tanhaji’s wife. She’s just as much of an unsung warrior as her brave husband. “I always feel that the unsung warriors are also women. We may not have fought with a sword, but we fought with a lot more. Multi-tasking seems to come naturally to all of us,” she emphasised.

Making the film, made sense as Tanhaji’s life and his exploits are part of Maharashtrian history, says the actor. “Om Raut came to us with the script. He was interested in this character and wrote the script around him and hoped we would produce it. We wanted to make it more interesting and make people realise that these great figures thought our country is worthy and fought for it,” she said.

The movie wants to highlight the depth of Indian culture and the diversity that exists today. “Our country has 22 different languages, everybody has a different code of dress but at the same time these people have all fought for us,” she says. The film itself, is a mixture of reverence for the brave warrior and action-packed scenes that add to the entertainment factor of the story. “There is a certain action film zone we are entering and we have worked hard with the special effects. The film is in 3D as well and we want to make this important moment as entertaining and interesting as we can. We want to do more of this if this film does well,” she concluded visibly excited at the forthcoming release.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/r8j43y/article30516036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tanhaji-kajol-image,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/unsung-warriors-are-also-women-says-kajol-on-tanhaji/article30516037.ece
190,2020/01/08,Bombay HC allows release of Meghna Gulzar’s 'Chhapaak',"The Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed Deepika Padukone-starrer Chhapaak, which is based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, to release as scheduled, on Friday.

A Single Bench of Justice S.C. Gupte was hearing a suit filed by Rakesh Bharti on December 26, demanding credit as a screenplay writer for the movie. He has also sought a temporary injunction from the court, restraining the entire team of the film from releasing and exhibiting it unless appropriate credit is given to him. Mr. Bharti has appealed that the court see the film and compare it to the story and screenplay written by him.

The court told Mr. Bharti’s advocate, Girish Godbole, that if there were any similarities between his script and the film, they would have to point it out. Justice Gupte also said their inability to do so, could set a precedent for anyone to file such an appeal in the court.

The court said in order to grant Mr. Bharti pre-release relief, he would have to make a valid case. “How are you claiming copyright infringement in the complaint? You have to prove that your work is in a public domain or that [director Meghna Gulzar] had access to it in order to prove infringement,” the Bench said.

Mr. Godbole said there were one-liners written by Mr. Bharti in the script, that were featured in the film’s promos. The Bench interrupted him and said, “You [Mr. Bharti] are claiming monopoly on a real-life incident. Any victim who has faced an acid attack is bound to say such things.”

The court also said Mr. Bharti would have to prove a copyright infringement either in concept or story, which would not be possible since no one has copyright on a real-life incident.

The court, however, kept the contentions open and adjourned the matter for six weeks. On Wednesday, Ms. Gulzar had filed an affidavit saying, “Copyright protection cannot be extended to information that constitutes facts available in public domain and is based on events that have factually transpired. Protection under the Copyright Act does not extend to ideas/concepts.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kdij3r/article30518441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMCHHAPAAK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bombay-hc-allows-release-of-deepika-padukones-chhapaak/article30513765.ece

192,2020/01/08,Art director Sahi Suresh on why putting up a set works better than shooting at locales,"Art director Sahi Suresh is on a roll. Even as three of his films — World Famous Lover, Bheeshma and Miss India — prepare for release soon, he is already signing fresh projects, including Tuck Jagdeesh. Despite all this, he seems a bit unhappy with what happened in 2019. Suresh and his team had put in great effort to make NTR Kathanayakudu and Mahanayakudu as realistic as possible but the films tanked at the box office. He looks back, “I completed 30 films in seven years but the last year was the most unsatisfying. We had other releases like Raju Gari Gadhi 3, Majili and Arjun Suravaram but I haven’t toiled, mentally and physically for any film as much as I did for the NTR biopic. I got appreciated but that is of no use if the film doesn’t work at the box office.”

A set from Devadasu

Suresh says that in the past four or five years, the trend of putting up sets has returned, in fact, it has become mandatory. That’s because there are lots of advantages in building sets, to keep lighting and the timing in control of the team. He shares, “If you are shooting in a coffee shop, you can take it on lease for around one or two days but beyond that, it is difficult. If there is more work that requires more days, it’s better to put up your own set. Also, there are technical aspects; when you shoot outside, the light fades and weather can play spoilsport. Earlier we would opt for sets mostly for songs but now even for major scenes, we prefer sets. You don’t find production houses flying a team abroad these days.”

A set for Awe

In the past five years, Telugu and Hindi films have regularly featured the backdrop of snow-clad mountains, sun-kissed beaches, narrow staircases or streets of Italy. The audience would easily identify which place a particular song or scene had been picturised. At least three such songs on such locations were a must in some star’s films. That trend has changed with the rise in the number of new directors, giving way to realistic backdrops and montage songs and scenes. Only 30% of a film shoot happen at live locations. Suresh adds, “We recreate foreign locales in Hyderabad. For Keerti Suresh-starrer Miss India, we shot in Spain. Since the story is about how a woman becomes a successful entrepreneur abroad, we shot a lot of exteriors in Spain, the rest of the portion which is indoors has been shot in Ramoji Film City (RFC). So it was with World Famous Lover. There are four stories, one of which happens in Ramagundam. We put up sets of houses in Hyderabad after taking pictures of those in Ramagundam. We shot in Paris too… so creating diverse sets belonging to different social milieu within a stipulated budget is very tough.”

Sahi Suresh

Clearly, it is important for an art director to share a good rapport with the director and understand the film. Except for Boyapati Sreenu, Suresh had mostly been associated with a new generation of directors. Suresh shares, “Balancing is an art. We have group discussions with the director and we brief him about the requirements. Sometimes we modify original locations and use them too.”

Sahi Suresh has mostly worked with directors who make concept films — like Awe or Majili, Kanche, Premam or the forthcoming Bheeshma.

In Bheeshma, he had worked on creating a look and background that reflect the ideologies of the characters who believe in everything organic. So he used his creativity and kept away from anything artificial and plastic as the plot was about using fertilizers that are not contaminating. “It is a challenge to give something new each time that would spell the director’s requirement and yet not pinch the pocket of the producer,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4rhnyg/article30513335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sahi-Suresh-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sahi-suresh-has-designed-sets-for-the-forthcoming-telugu-films-world-famous-lover-bheeshma-and-miss-india/article30513339.ece
193,2020/01/08,How will ‘Darbar’ fare at the box office?,"Today is a big day for Rajinikanth. Darbar is his 167th movie in a career spanning nearly five decades. The movie comes at an important juncture in his life, especially when Rajinikanth is facing the heat from younger actors such as Vijay and Ajith Kumar, in his fiefdom — Tamil Nadu.

Exactly a year ago, Rajinikanth’s Petta clashed with Ajith’s Viswasam on Pongal. The trade was taken by surprise when Thala outdid Thalaivar, as far as the Tamil Nadu box-office was concerned. Though Petta was a hit, it would not have grossed as much as Bigil and Viswasam did in Tamil Nadu. Reports seem to suggest that today’s millennials are rooting for Vijay and Ajith — the reason why they are eating into Rajinkanth’s business.

A global phenomenon

It is at this point that Darbar is releasing. Rumoured to be made on a budget of ₹200 crore, Darbar is simultaneously releasing in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. If rumour mills are to be believed, Rajinikanth was paid a bomb for Darbar. The market buzz is that theatrical and digital rights have been sold for over ₹230 crore. Trade analysts indicate that most of the theatrical rights were sold on a minimum guarantee basis. According to the producers, the movie is releasing in over 7,000 screens worldwide. Darbar will face heavy competition from two Telugu movies, Sarileru Neekevvaru and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, in the overseas market.

In Malaysia, the movie might face the threat of litigation from local distributors. Darbar’s business outside Tamil Nadu also looks dicey at the moment. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where Rajinikanth has a huge market, Darbar will clash with the Telugu entertainers. It has an edge over the other two Telugu releases, since Darbar is releasing on Thursday, while Sarileru Neekevvaru and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo are releasing on Saturday and Sunday respectively. As far as the North is concerned, there are two movies releasing this week — Ajay Devgn’s period drama Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior and Deepika Padukone’s Chhapaak. It must be noted that after 2.0, none of Rajinikanth’s movies have performed well in the Hindi belt.

The lone warrior

In Tamil Nadu, Darbar could not have got a better release date. It is the only movie releasing this week, followed by Dhanush’s Pattas, which is hitting screens next week. Rakesh Gowthaman of Vettri Theatre says, “Darbar’s advance booking is brisk and encouraging, but not in the same league as Bigil, where we were almost sold out for the opening week, when we opened the advance booking. However, the solo release is a huge advantage, and hopefully, if the content lives up to expectations, it can be a hit.” About its business, another exhibitor says: “The releases post-Deepavali were hugely disappointing. Now, the spotlight is on Darbar to revive the market. The trend among the audience is to wait and watch for the initial reports. Had there been competition, the pressure would have been much more than what it is.”

Darbar’s Tamil Nadu theatrical value is rumoured to be around ₹55 to 60 crore. A leading distributor says, “The onus is on Rajinikanth, as Darbar will have to match or better the business of Bigil and Viswasam in Tamil Nadu. Rajinikanth still has it in him, after all he is the Superstar. Darbar’s box-office performance will also decide the future of mass entertainers in 2020.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2f66z0/article30512939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2L6A5984jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/it-is-time-for-darbar/article30512940.ece
194,2020/01/08,Salman Khan gifts co-star Kichcha Sudeep a new BMW M5 car,"Looks like Salman Khan and Kichcha Sudeep’s bromance is going stronger and stronger, well after Dabangg 3. The co-stars seem to have struck up a strong bond during the shooting of the film, and now days after its release, the two stars are still displaying their friendship.

Salman already gifted Sudeep his favourite jacket during the shoot of the film (one that had a picture of Salman’s favourite pet painted on it) and now it’s a swanky new BMW M5! The car is estimated to cost around ₹ 1.7 crores.

The Bollywood megastar is known for gifting expensive purchases to his co-stars, but this gift to Sudeep seems quite special. The Kannada actor took to Instagram to thank Salman for the car and for visiting his house :“Good always happens when u do good. @beingsalmankhan sir made me believe this line further when this surprise landed at home along with him. BMW M5.... a sweetest gesture. Thank u for the luv u have showered on me n my family sir. It was an honour to have worked with u n to have had u vist us (sic).”

Rangoli Chandel, who is an acid attack survivor, on Wednesday tweeted a video of Kangana thanking director Meghna Gulzar and Deepika for making a film like Chhapaak.

In the video, Kangana speaking in Hindi, said: “I recently saw the trailer of Chhapaak and after watching I remembered the acid attack incident that took place with my sister Rangoli. The kind of courage my sister showed during and after the attack gave me the strength and inspires me to face every challenge that comes my way. Her smile gives me the courage to take Panga with every sadness.”

She added: “Today, me and my family thank Meghna Gulzar and Deepika for making a film on this. For all those who are dealing with similar ordeal will gain strength, even those who have given up. This film is a slap on those who have committed this crime...”

Kangana hopes the film brings an end to the sale of acid in the country.

“I hope this year there will be a ‘Panga’ on the sale of acid so that this country becomes acid attack free. I wish the team of ‘Chhapaak’ good luck,” she concluded.

Rangoli captioned the clip: “The pain still lingers. Our family thanks team #chhapaak for a story that needs to be told!“

Chhapaak is based on the life of Laxmi Agarwal, an acid attack survivor. The film is slated to release on January 10.

Kangana is currently prepping for the release of her upcoming film Panga. Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, the film revolves around a mother (Kangana) who is also a Kabbadi player.

197,2020/01/08,Hans Zimmer composes for new James Bond film ‘No Time To Die’,"Celebrated German composer Hans Zimmer is composing the music for the upcoming James Bond film No Time To Die.

According to multiple sources to Variety, the composer, famous for his work in numerous Hollywood biggies including “Gladiator”, “Inception” and “The Da Vinci Code”, has already started working on “No Time To Die”, the 25th film in the 007 franchise starring Daniel Craig.

Zimmer replaces Dan Romer, the Hollywood musician who had previously been announced as composer of the film.

“Creative differences” are said to have been the reason behind Romer leaving the project.

A spokesperson for MGM, the studio that produces the Bond flicks, had no comment on the matter.

There was a buzz for weeks over the status of music for the film, which is now in post-production in London.

Director Cary Fukunaga roped in Romer into the project last year. The filmmaker and the composer had earlier collaborated on “Beasts Of No Nation” and the mini-series “Maniac”.

Recording of the film’s music reportedly needs to be completed by mid-February.

There have been several reports indicating that since time is short, Zimmer might get his frequent collaborators such as Benjamin Wallfisch or Lorne Balfe on board.

198,2020/01/08,"With JNU visit, Deepika Padukone runs a huge risk","A day after the rousing show of strength by Bollywood at Carter Road in Mumbai, Deepika Padukone also came out to express solidarity with the Jawaharlal Nehru University students and faculty on Tuesday.

The actor, in the national capital to promote her new film, Chhapaak, joined the protests at the JNU against the violence on the campus on Sunday evening.

She also met Aishe Ghosh, the injured president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU).

A gesture from a big star like her acquires significance in the light of the fact that Bollywood, which has usually desisted from taking on the Establishment, has been a lot more vocal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the JNU violence, especially the younger lot, more so the women.

It was actor Sayani Gupta who lit the fire, calling out the selfie gang on social media and forcing some of them to issue statements.

Actors Swara Bhaskar, Richa Chadha, Alia Bhatt, Parineeti Chopra, Konkona Sen Sharma, Huma Qureshi, Taapsee Pannu, Dia Mirza and Sonam Kapur have all consistently been raising their voices for a secular and syncretic India, and against violence.

“The female of the species is, and was, and will always be the strongest of the two #DeepikaPadukone. Chhapak first day all shows. Let’s all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them. Make our silent statement which will be the loudest,” tweeted filmmaker Anurag Kashyap.

While there is the usual cynicism and speculation about Deepika’s gesture being part of the film promotion drive, it is also a fact that taking on the government as well as the so-called “bhakts” at this point in time can invite a backlash against the film.

Hers has not entirely been a safe position to take, considering that she herself is the producer of the film and has a huge financial stake in it.

“She has risked it by standing up for students and human rights. This is NOT publicity, these are values! Which are bigger than films!” Atika Chohan, the co-writer of Chhapaak, told The Hindu.

“This moment in time is bigger than films and financial stakes, and she has shown the way ahead for everyone else.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mwxpf1/article30507468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI172020000225BSG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/with-jnu-visit-deepika-padukone-runs-a-huge-risk/article30507469.ece
199,2020/01/08,JNU alumni in Bollywood revisit glory days,"Screenwriter and lyricist Ravinder Randhawa spent 1996-2000 in Narmada and Tapti hostels in New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) doing undergraduation in Korean and postgraduation in linguistics before moving to pursue a course in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia.

Ravinder Randhawa

For someone hailing from the small town of Chittaranjan on the West Bengal-Jharkhand border, JNU shaped his mind profoundly, providing access and exposure to the whole wide world. “As a teenager, it was a spectacular sight to find people having chai at one or two in the night, discussing politics, arts and culture, women walking around safely… Till date, I have maintained that there can be no other space for women in the country that is safer than the JNU campus,” he says.

‘Vibrant campus’

Then there has been the democratic nature of the vibrant campus; equal opportunity for all, no matter what class, caste, region, religion, gender you belonged to. “The teachers too were not feudal in their relationship with the students,” says Randhawa. The recent violence unleashed in JNU has been making the alumni, some of them, like him, working in the Hindi film industry in Mumbai, revisit and relive those glory days.

Prabhat Raghunandan

Actor Prabhat Raghunandan has a similar experience to narrate, about how the campus helped a small town boy like him embrace the world. He too, like Randhawa, studied Korean literature from 2001-2005, and lived in Tapti and Jhelum hostels. When he moved from Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi for schooling, he found it hard to cope with the change in the medium of education, from Hindi to English. The culture shock was difficult to absorb as well. Once very active as a kid in theatre back home, he went into a shell. “Things changed gradually when I went to JNU. I got the space to indulge in my passion and joined Bahroop Arts group… It helped me realise my dream of becoming an actor, took me onwards to the FTII [Film and Television Institute of India].” For him, JNU has not just been about Marx and Lenin or a certain kind of politics. “JNU is humanist, it stands for the downtrodden,” says Raghunandan. “If you are anti-JNU, then you are anti-poor, anti-disenfranchised,” adds Randhawa.

For actor Swara Bhaskar — who admits to coming from a sheltered, privileged, urban background — JNU was again about getting exposed to the world, but from the other side of the economic and cultural divide. As a Delhi-bred girl, the fact that people could be forced to study under the sky in schools lacking proper building and infrastructure, was a reality that shook her. “JNU helped me know about the many Indias within one,” she says. It brought a diverse set of fellow students from across the country into her social circle. “It made me more empathetic. It was a liberating campus that changed my life,” she says of her alma mater that turned home. Bhaskar did her postgraduation in sociology and now her mother, Ira Bhaskar, is professor, cinema studies, and dean at the School of Arts and Aesthetics.

Filmmaker Kabir Khan feels privileged to have experienced the best of three worlds in Delhi. He did his graduation from Delhi University and postgraduation from Jamia. His father, Rasheeduddin Khan, was one of the founding professors of JNU. He was the professor of political science in the Centre for Political Studies in the School of Social Sciences. So JNU was home for Khan from 1982 to 1991, the space where he grew up, in all ways possible. “It was a fascinating experience. When you are there, you probably don’t realise it, but when I look back, I think it is unique — the quality of students, faculty and professors. The atmosphere that is inculcated over there. The throbbing politics. Every evening and night at Ganga dhaba, there would be some debate going on… There would be people giving talks… I was surrounded by politics. Our dining table conversations used to be about politics, what’s happening in the world and the country.”

For Randhawa, the “sauntering in and out” of the goons on Sunday evening, without being held accountable, has been shocking. “It could be any one of our homes tomorrow,” he says. “It was an organised attack and is not acceptable,” says Raghunandan. “Just the sight of seeing goons entering a university like JNU and at will vandalising and beating up people is heartbreaking,” says Khan.

‘Violence with impunity’

Bhaskar remembers the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad not being a strong presence in student politics in her postgraduation years. “No one took them seriously. Now it’s toxic, vicious, emboldened, perpetrating violence with impunity,” she says. Randhawa admits that JNU has been the target of the reactionary forces for a long while now. “They have been trying to discredit the students, teachers and student leaders,” he says.

For Bhaskar, the targeted vilification of JNU is also a larger attempt to hit out at the progressive Leftist academia. “They have been the greatest challenge to BJP/RSS from gaining any moral legitimacy and credibility,” she says.

Khan feels that there is no university like JNU and is very confident that whatever may come, the institution will survive. He says, “They have taken on the wrong guys. Nothing can bring them down. Nothing can destroy JNU. ”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ek0ruz/article30499111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06JNUTA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jnu-alumni-in-bollywood-revisit-glory-days/article30507717.ece
200,2020/01/08,"CAA, NRC: AIADMK attempts to allay fears of Opposition parties","Maintaining that it has been protecting the interests of minorities in Tamil Nadu for 30 years, the AIADMK government in the Assembly on Wednesday said that no work towards the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has been taken up in the State.

The debate on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the NRC came up in the Assembly yet again on Tuesday, after Congress Legislative Party leader K.R. Ramasamy raised the issue in the House.

Responding to apprehensions raised by the Congress member, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar emphatically said that the NRC has not come in. “The NRC has not come in,” Mr. Udhayakumar repeated thrice, attempting to allay the apprehensions raised by the Opposition party member.

“Even if it [the NRC] comes and if the minorities are affected, the AIADMK would be the first to raise its voice to defend the interests of minorities,” Mr. Udhayakumar said. Soon Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam joined the debate to quote from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statements that the topic of the NRC has neither come up nor has been discussed in the meeting of the Union Cabinet as yet.

“When the Prime Minister has made it clear about the NRC, how can the government answer hypothetical questions raised by the Opposition parties?” Mr. Shanmugam asked.

To Mr. Ramasamy’s statement in the House that there were reports about some detention camps in Maharashtra and Karnataka and what would happen if citizenship of lakhs of people were taken away, Mr. Udhayakumar asked whether any such camp has come up in Tamil Nadu.

“You are talking about camps in other States. You should ask those governments about those camps. Is there any camp that has come up in Tamil Nadu? Has anyone from Tamil Nadu lost citizenship?” Mr. Udhayakumar asked.

When the Revenue Minister attempted to avoid further debate in the House over the topic by saying cases regarding the CAA was pending before the courts, DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan sought to clarify only contents of a case in the court could not be debated not the case by itself.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami came to the defence of Mr. Udhayakumar to say Mr. Duraimurugan had given the same reason several times in the House during the erstwhile DMK regime.

201,2020/01/08,"AIADMK, DMK flex muscles over election results yet again","The results of the recently-concluded rural local body elections in 27 districts across the State continued to be debated in the Assembly on Wednesday. Both the AIADMK and DMK vowed to win the polls in the remaining nine districts.

While Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami vowed that his party would record a massive win in the remaining nine districts, DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin said his party would not just secure a pass but a distinction in the remaining nine districts.

During a debate in the House, Mr. Palaniswami replied to Congress Legislative Party leader K.R. Ramasamy, who raised the issue. Mr. Palaniswami compared the votes secured by the DMK during the Parliamentary elections last year with that of the recently-concluded rural local body polls and said it was a huge decline.

“What is your position in rural local bodies? It has become upside down. Nine districts are remaining. In these nine districts, AIADMK candidates would register a massive win,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The CM also pointed out how the DMK and Congress lost the by-polls in Vikravandi and Nanguneri Assembly constituencies, which were earlier held by them respectively.

202,2020/01/08,When an Indian gaur in the Nilgiris did not budge,"A video posted by an IAS officer in the Nilgiris that highlights how Coonoor residents coexist with the Indian gaur, has been doing the rounds on social media.

Supriya Sahu, managing director, Tamil Nadu Small Tea Growers’ Industrial Cooperative Tea Factories’ Federation Limited (INDCOSERVE), posted the short clip on Twitter on Wednesday morning.

In the video, an elderly woman is seen asking two adult Indian gaurs, one on the road and the other a few metre away in the woods, in the middle of Brooklands Road in Coonoor to move out of her way.

The woman and another person wait for some time on the road, on their way to work. The Indian gaur stands where it is, not moving an inch. And then the woman is heard saying in Tamil. 'Poppa, Po, ellarum velaikku ponum,” meaning: Move dear, just move. It’s time for all of us to go to work. Even after her request, the gaur stays put. Then the woman and the man, both unidentified, slowly climb up the road to go to their work place without any trouble from the two gaurs.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Sahu said that she was in the middle of her morning walk when she saw the gaurs and the workers. “I was pleasantly surprised about how local residents and the Indian gaur live in harmony with very little conflict. The video showcases the mutual respect between wildlife and the people with whom they share their space.”

“The woman was not aggressive in any way towards the gaur and the two gaurs too were minding their own business,” said Ms. Sahu. The senior IAS officer is not new to The Nilgiris.

203,2020/01/08,TNPCB seeks citizenship proof to give info under RTI,"The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) declined information sought by a researcher under the Right to Information (RTI) Act stating that proof of citizenship, such as Aadhaar, voter’s identity, ration card etc had to be submitted.

The RTI Act is open to citizens of India and nowhere in the Act is it mentioned that petitioners should furnish proof of citizenship or identity while seeking information from designated Public Information Officer (PIO).

Replying to a petition filed by the researcher of Chennai-based Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group (CAG) calling for a mandatory pollution disclosure of an industry, the TNPCB’s PIO said any citizen of India had the right to seek such information from an Indian government organisation.

“Hence, I request that necessary information can be obtained from this office by enclosing a copy of proof of identity along with your application, such as copy of Aadhaar, Voter ID, Ration Card and other such...,” District Environmental Engineer of the agency said.

When contacted, a senior official in the Tamil Nadu Information Commission said that rejecting information for want of citizenship documents was “very unusual”.

The PIO could call for identity details if the name of the petitioner or his address was found to be suspicious. Replies to many petitions return to the PIO with “addressee not found” remark because of the wrong addresses.

Verifiable address

However, in this case, the petitioner has an Indian name and the address was local and verifiable, since it belonged to a reputed organisation handling public issues.

When contacted, the CAG officials said there was no question of providing proof of citizenship to the PIO and the petitioner would appeal against the TNPCB reply.

“As an organisation, we file hundreds of RTI applications to receive information that supports our research and outreach activities. We have not received such a response asking for proof of citizenship,” Sharadha Narayanan, senior researcher, CAG, said.

“The information requested was part of the annual disclosures required to be made by industries. We have obtained similar information through RTI applications several times in the past, with no such requirement of citizenship proof. We will be filing an appeal against the response received,” she added.

In a 2018 case, the Chief Information Commissioner had penalised a PIO of Housing and Urban Development Corporation for demanding Aadhaar card for providing information and ruled that he couldn’t “invent” new grounds to deny information.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpcb-seeks-citizenship-proof-to-give-info-under-rti/article30509680.ece
204,2020/01/08,Have told Amit Shah that NRC isn’t acceptable to us: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday said in the Assembly that he had told Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is not acceptable to the AIADMK government. At the same time, he had urged that dual citizenship should be granted to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu, and Mr. Shah had promised “remedial measures”.

This is the first time Mr. Palaniswami has made public his stand on the issue of NRC. In the past, he had only stated that during his meeting with Mr. Shah in New Delhi last month, he pressed for granting dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in the State. He also endorsed the implementation of the National Population Register, saying that the exercise would be undertaken in the State from April.

Responding to an issue on the subject raised by DMK MLA Mathivanan, the Chief Minister said, “Mr. Shah also said that Sri Lankan Tamils had come as refugees and remedial measures would be taken [on examining dual citizenship] as requested. We are doing what the DMK has failed to do.”

Slams DMK

The Chief Minister said though the DMK was part of the Centre for many years, it never thought about obtaining citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils.

“People gave you 12 years to be part of the government at the Centre. You gave up your responsibility. Did you get citizenship for the Sri Lankan Tamils? As far as we are concerned, whether in power or not, we will not deviate from our ideology,” he said.

Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government was extending all the benefits available to the people of Tamil Nadu to the Sri Lankan Tamils.

“The DMK government only implemented the welfare measures of the Centre,” he said, adding that AIADMK government would continue to press the Centre to grant dual citizenship to the Sri Lankan Tamils.

Pointing out that the Pongal gift would also be given to the Sri Lankan Tamils, the Chief Minister said scholarship would extended to Sri Lankan Tamils students, irrespective of the communities they had belonged to.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s3ua12/article30507972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Edappadi1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/have-told-amit-shah-that-nrc-isnt-acceptable-to-us-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-edappadi-palaniswami/article30507964.ece

208,2020/01/08,"Civic polls: DMK, AIADMK trade charges over counting process","The AIADMK and the DMK on Tuesday accused each other in the Assembly of having attempted to influence the outcome of the recently concluded rural local body elections by interfering during the counting process. Both the parties claimed they had the trust of voters.

The ruling AIADMK claimed that the elections were held so fairly that its own candidates lost by one vote in some instances. On its part, the DMK claimed that had the elections been held fairly, it would have bagged more seats.

Assembly Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman, who spoke first on the discussion on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address, referred to the violence during the local body elections in Chennai when the DMK was in power in 2006 and described it as a murder of democracy.

Mr. Jayaraman added that it was the DMK which went to court to stop the 2019 local body elections multiple times. Lauding the AIADMK leadership for securing victory in the bypolls to the Vikravandi and Nanguneri Assembly constituencies, he pointed out that the winning margins in these constituencies were high.

Countering his claims, DMK MLA J. Anbazhagan (Chepauk-Triplicane), drew attention to an incident in Pudukkottai district, where a government servant was harassed and threatened by a ruling party MLA in the presence of a Minister.

Mr. Anbazhagan also claimed that the DMK was not against the elections, but only wanted to ensure that reservation and delimitation of wards were carried out properly. In response, Electricity Minister P. Thangamani said that the DMK Dharmapuri MP too had a quarrel with election officials. Forests Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan joined in alleging that DMK whip R. Sakkarapani was in a counting centre, interfering in the process in Dindigul district.

While Mr. Sakkarapani clarified his position, DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan refused to accept that the elections were held in a fair manner.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/civic-polls-dmk-aiadmk-trade-charges-over-counting-process/article30507726.ece
209,2020/01/08,‘Action will be based on panel findings’,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami informed the Assembly on Tuesday that action in the death of 13 anti-Sterlite protesters killed in police firing in Thoothukudi in May 2018 would be taken based only on the findings of the Commission of Inquiry (CoI).

The probe by CoI led by retired High Court judge Justice Aruna Jagadeesan was still on.

The CBI too was investigating the case, on the directions of the Madras High Court, he pointed out.

“So, only based on the findings, action could be taken. Impulsive action cannot be taken,” Mr. Palaniswami said and pointed out that a case in this regard was still pending in the court.

He was responding to DMK member M. Ramchandran (Orathanadu) in the House, who questioned the delay by various CoIs in submitting their reports.

Mr. Ramchandran questioned the non-submission of reports by the CoIs constituted to go into Thoothukudi firing incident, jallikattu protests and death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam explained that the Justice S. Rajeswaran Commission has been given a final extension to complete the inquiry into the violence on the last day of jallikattu protests and was expected to submit its report soon.

“It is only natural for the Commissions of Inquiry to seek extension of their tenure to complete their probe. If we do not grant extension, the same opposition parties, suspecting something, will question us as to why was the extension was denied,” Mr. Shanmugam argued.

210,2020/01/08,"AIADMK, DMK spar over CAA in House","The ruling AIADMK and the principal opposition DMK were at loggerheads in the Assembly on Tuesday over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), questioning each other’s claim over protecting the interests of Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils.

DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin led his MLAs in a walkout from the House after his request to take up discussion on a resolution to urge the Centre to withdraw the CAA was not accepted by the Speaker. Congress and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislators followed suit.

While the DMK attempted to debate specific aspects of the CAA with the ruling party, the AIADMK criticised the DMK for “misleading” Muslims into staging protests over the Act and went on to claim that the principal opposition party was shedding “crocodile tears” for the minorities.

Though he was present in the House all through the debate, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami chose not to speak on the issue, but was seen helping Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar, who was replying to concerns raised by the DMK, with some points.

Speaker P. Dhanapal maintained that Mr. Stalin’s request to take up his resolution was still under his consideration and he would come up with an “appropriate action at an appropriate time.” He declined to commit to take up the issue before the end of the ongoing session, for which a request was made by DMK Deputy floor leader Duraimurugan.

Whenever the issue of CAA came up in the House on Tuesday, Mr. Udhayakumar maintained that the Act was neither against any citizen of the country nor against minorities, as was projected by the Opposition parties.

He charged the DMK of having supported the National Population Register (NPR) during the United Progressive Alliance (NPR) regime when senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram was the Home Minister only to oppose it presently. But, Mr. Stalin said the DMK did not vote on the issue then, unlike the AIADMK, which did recently.

‘Baseless fears’

Mr. Udhayakumar also said no official word has come yet on the NPR and whether the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would be implemented. Presently, the NRC was implemented only in Assam on the directions of the Supreme Court. He claimed that the apprehensions of the Opposition parties were baseless.

The AIADMK government also did not accede to the demand of the DMK to pass a resolution against the CAA like Kerala.

Mr. Stalin pointed out many Chief Ministers had opposed the CAA and some like Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister decided not to implement it, despite having supported it in Parliament.

Mr. Udhayakumar said the DMK’s apprehensions were based on some “dreams” and said the government was willing to engage in a long debate over the issue. But, Mr. Stalin pointed out that his party was raising concerns on the CAA, but Mr. Udhayakuar was offering replies on the NPR and the NRC.

Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said the Chief Minister had personally met Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi to say that the minorities in Tamil Nadu should not be affected by the Act.

Mr. Duraimurugan questioned as to why the BJP government was discriminating against Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees on the basis of religion.

Muhammed Abubacker (Kadayanallur) sought a chance to speak during the debate, the Speaker said he would be given an opportunity later during the day.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tdk58w/article30507664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-dmk-spar-over-caa-in-house/article30507665.ece
211,2020/01/08,Anbazhagan suspended from Assembly for three days,"Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal on Tuesday suspended DMK MLA J. Anbazhagan from taking part in the House proceedings for three days until January 9. The decision was taken after the legislator representing Chepauk-Triplicane constituency tore a copy of the Governor’s address and threw it before the Speaker.

Certain remarks (since expunged) made by him against Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani led to acrimonious scenes in the House. Eventually when the Speaker cut Mr. Anbazhagan’s speech short, he walked up to the Chair, tore a copy of the Governor’s address and threw it on the Speaker’s desk.

When a visibly agitated Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami attempted to seek action against the DMK MLA, Speaker P. Dhanapal proposed suspension of Mr. Anbazhagan from the House until the end of the session, which was seconded by Leader of the House O. Panneerselvam.

The Speaker said it was not the first time Mr. Anbazhagan was involved in actions like these and a warning must be issued with suspension.

But later in the day, on the request of DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan, the duration of Mr. Anbazhagan’s suspension was eventually reduced to three days until January 9 (though the House Business will end on that day, the session has not been prorogued).

Short of eviction

Earlier in the day, Mr. Panneerselvam proposed that Mr. Anbazhagan be evicted following his remarks against Mr. Velumani.

However, the action was dropped on the intervention of DMK president M.K. Stalin, who while not defending his party legislator’s action, contended that Mr. Velumani and some Ministers too had made unacceptable remarks after Mr. Anbazhagan spoke.

Eventually, leaders of both parties agreed to “forgive and forget” Mr. Anbazhagan’s actions and move on.

The Chief Minister said though there was no issue with any DMK member in the House, Mr. Anbazhagan was deliberately speaking to provoke.

On his part, Mr. Duraimurugan questioned whether the Leader of the House was waiting for an opportunity to suspend the DMK MLA and hence had necessary papers ready from which he read out the proposal to suspend. Mr. Panneerselvam vehemently denied the claim.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pmh4n8/article30507622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THANBAZHAGANMLADMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/anbazhagan-suspended-from-assembly-for-three-days/article30507623.ece
212,2020/01/08,"Vedanta made at least ₹20,000 cr. in 20 years: TNPCB","The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on Tuesday vehemently defended the decision to permanently close down the Sterlite copper smelting plant in Thoothukudi and claimed that its owners, Vedanta Limited, would have earned at least than ₹20,000 crore ever since the plant was commissioned in 1997.

Arguing before a Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and V. Bhavani Subbaroyan, senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan decried the repeated assertion made on behalf of Vedanta that it had invested around ₹3,000 crore on the copper plant and that the State government could not shut it down abruptly citing environmental concerns.

Referring to one of the affidavits filed by the company claiming to be losing ₹5 crore a day ever since the plant was closed down permanently in May 2018, the senior counsel, who had commenced arguing the matter for the TNPCB after advocates T. Mohan and A. Yogeshwaran completed their arguments on behalf of anti-Sterlite activists, said even going by its own submission, the company would have earned at least ₹1,500 crore every year.

“In the last 20 years since the operations began, they would have made at least ₹20,000 crore. After having made such huge profits, they cannot cry hoarse today that they are suffering because of closure. On the other hand, the damage caused to the environment by the plant is much greater,” the senior counsel said.

Assisted by TNPCB standing counsel Abdul Saleem, Mr. Vaidyanathan said, “It has been proven conclusively through scientific evidence that no amount of remedial measures taken by them (Vedanta) will improve the water quality in the locality. The only way to save the environment is to close down the unit.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nox8ws/article30507548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08STERLITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vedanta-made-at-least-20000-cr-in-20-years-tnpcb/article30507549.ece
213,2020/01/08,Karti Chidambaram’s discharge plea dismissed,"The judge of the special court for cases related to elected MPs and MLAs in Chennai has dismissed a discharge petition filed by Congress Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Chidambaram in a case relating to the alleged non-disclosure of income for the financial year 2015-16 and evasion of tax.

Officials earlier alleged that Mr. Karti received ₹6.38 crore in cash, while his wife received ₹1.35 crore in cash during that financial year. The transaction came to light when Income Tax sleuths conducted inquiries with employees of Agni Estates Foundation, the firm which purchased land near Muttukadu, belonging to the Chidambaram family, according to sources.

Electronic evidence

On December 1, 2015, the Enforcement Directorate and I-T officials, during a search on the premises of Advantage and Chess Global and other places with which Mr. Karti was associated, seized electronic evidence, which purportedly contained evidence on the money transfer in the case.

The ED and I-T department had submitted the details to the court in December 2018 along with a printout of documents, which the court reviewed recently.

Judge D. Lingeswaran rejected the plea of the accused that hard drives could not be admitted as evidence. He noted that it is clear that the hard drives in question were seized from Chess Global Advisory Services, sealed properly and were under custody.

So far there is no reason to believe that the incriminating contents were voluntarily inserted by the officers who seized them, the judge said.

Notebooks as proof

Mr. Lingeswaran also said that the small notebooks seized from Agni Group showing alleged cash payments and the sworn statements of its officials, K. Narayanan and Jayaprakash, recorded by Rohan Raj, Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation), and the complainant could be considered as evidence.

216,2020/01/08,CB-CID reopens probe into IPL betting scam,"The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police have reopened investigation into the sensational IPL cricket betting scam and summoned city-based hotelier Vikram Agarwal, one of the suspects in the case on Tuesday. This is the second time that the agency is re-investigating the seven-year-old case and has now decided to add the offence of “cheating” the public in the chargesheet.

Investigators said that Mr. Agarwal was questioned for about four hours in the CB-CID headquarters. A total of 23 persons, including Gurunath Meiyappan who was then associated with the Chennai Super Kings, alleged bookie Uttam C Jain alias Kitty, among others, were named accused in the case.

The IPL betting scam hit the headlines in 2013 triggering simultaneous investigations by the Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi police. This led to the arrest or interrogation of prominent personalities directly or indirectly involved in the conduct of the matches. The issue led to the Supreme Court appointing a committee headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal to probe the scam.

“Earlier we had focused on the offence of betting and gaming. Now, we have decided to investigate the angle of cheating the public. A revised chargesheet will be filed by introducing Sections 419 and 420 of IPC.

‘Lapses rectified’

The modus operandi of the suspects in organising the betting to make money and ultimately cheat the fans has to be probed,” a senior CB-CID official confirmed to The Hindu. Parrying questions on whether investigators would look into the aspect of alleged match-fixing, the official said all issues pertaining to the betting had already been in investigated and chargesheet filed. “We will re-examine all possible angles in this case. The lapses pointed out by the trial court magistrate in the first chargesheet have been rectified,” the official who preferred not to be quoted said.

In May 2016, when the CB-CID completed investigation and filed chargesheet, the trial court magistrate sought certain clarifications, including why the investigation was “so silent” on the allegation that inside information on IPL team strategies was passed on to bookies and the role of senior IPS officer G. Sampath Kumar, who was later acquitted of all charges.

The first re-Investigation was necessitated on the basis of new evidence emerging during the Mudgal committee enquiry proceedings in 2014.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cb-cid-reopens-probe-into-ipl-betting-scam/article30507496.ece
217,2020/01/08,‘SIT must investigate corruption allegations against Velumani’,"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi as well as Arappor Iyakkam managing trustee Jayaram Venkatesan on Tuesday told the Madras High Court that they had lost faith in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) and hence a special investigation team (SIT) should be constituted to probe allegations of corruption against Municipal Administration Minister S. P. Velumani under court supervision.

Arguing before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, senior counsel N. R. Elango as well as advocate V. Suresh impressed upon the court to constitute a SIT and also monitor the probe into serious charges of the Minister having created a cartel and ensured that all civil contracts by Greater Chennai Corporation as well as Coimbatore Corporation were awarded to private firms run either by his family members or benamis.

In his submission, the senior counsel criticised the DVAC for having conducted a detailed investigation in the guise of conducting a preliminary inquiry on complaints lodged by Mr. Bharathi and Mr. Venkatesan in September 2018 and thereby attempting to give a clean chit to the Minister without even registering a First Information Report.

He said the term ‘preliminary inquiry’ could not be found anywhere in the Code of Criminal Procedure and that it was basically a judge made law.

The Supreme Court had in various pronouncements recognised the right of the police to conduct a preliminary inquiry before registering an FIR, but had also clarified that the scope of the inquiry should be limited to find out whether a cognisable offence had been made out by the complainant or not. “If a bare reading of the complaint makes out a cognisable offence, an FIR should be registered straight away. There is no necessity for a preliminary inquiry,” he asserted.

Mr. Elango went on state that the DVAC could not also take umbrage under the fact that it was governed by the provisions laid down in its manual because the latter contained mere executive instructions.

“The DVAC manual is not a statute, it cannot supersede the Cr.P.C.,” he said.

Appearing on behalf of the NGO Arappor Iyakkam, Mr. Suresh pointed out that even the DVAC manual provided a maximum of three months for completion of preliminary inquiry. However, in so far as the complaint against the Minister was concerned, the DVAC sleuths had well crossed the time limit prescribed in their own manual. He also claimed that elaborate statements of witnesses had been recorded though it could not be done without registering a FIR.

218,2020/01/08,"When will plastic be banned completely, asks HC","The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to list the steps taken by it so far to implement a complete ban on all kinds of plastic products and not just single-use plastics. The court also wanted officials to act tough against all those who were continuing to use the banned ‘use and throw’ plastic products.

Justices S. Vaidyanathan and P.T. Asha granted time till February 11 for Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian to file a detailed report regarding steps taken for making the State completely plastic free.

The judges in December 2018 refused to stay a Government Order for banning single-use plastics in the State from January 1, 2019. Then, they had gone a step ahead and opined that even products exempted under the GO should be banned in order to make the State completely plastic free and encourage the use of paper and cloth products. Subsequently, another Division Bench of Justices R. Subbiah and Krishnan Ramasamy upheld the validity of the GO in July 2019 and they too agreed with the earlier Bench led by Justice Vaidyanathan that all kinds of plastic products including multi-layered plastic wrappers used to pack milk, oil, biscuits, snacks, chocolates and medicines should be banned.

When the case was listed for reporting compliance before the Bench, comprising Justice Asha, on Tuesday, the judges pointed out that plastic carry bags were still being used illegally by many hawkers. The judges pointed out that flower sellers outside many temples were continuing to use the banned carry bags.

AAG seeks time

Then, the AAG informed the court about several news articles carried by The Hindu regarding the earnest steps taken by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to implement the ban and how people still find ways to use the banned products. He urged the court to grant him a month’s time to come up with a detailed report on the issue. An advocate appearing on behalf of a plastic manufacturers association told the court that the selective ban imposed by the State government on few products had led to the decline of the plastic manufacturing industry in the State whereas the same industries in other States were flourishing by supplying the same goods to Tamil Nadu.

Since there was no ban on selling edibles and other goods in pre-packed plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, such bags were being supplied by manufacturers in neighbouring districts, whereas domestic manufacturers had been completely banned from making them within the State, he claimed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/when-will-plastic-be-banned-completely-asks-hc/article30507369.ece
219,2020/01/08,Genco wants BHEL to speed up work,"As intra-day demand of power on the system is approaching 11,000 MW already this season, the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco) has asked Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) to speed up work on the revival of the 800 MW unit in Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (KTPS) and commercial operation of two units of 4×270 MW Bhadradri TPS.

Progress of all ongoing work being executed by BHEL was reviewed at a high-level meeting held here on Wednesday.

Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao, CMD of BHEL Nalin Singhal, Director (Power) of BHEL M.K. Varma and others participated in the meeting.

The 800 MW super critical unit of KTPS is under outage due to high turbine vibrations from 1402 hours on November 28 and later the break in generation has been converted to annual overhaul.

However, BHEL is yet to complete the unit revival work even after 42 days till date. The executives of BHEL assured to rectify the snags and bring back the unit on to bars as soon as possible to help Genco cope up with the increasing demand in the ongoing rabi/yasangi season.

Kaleshwaram project

According to the officials, the power systems has been experiencing high demand due to intensified rabi operations and increasing consumption by agricultural pumpsets and lift irrigation schemes, including Kaleshwaram project. Paddy transplantation has already been completed in over 2.5 lakh hectares out of nearly 6.75 lakh hectares of rabi cultivation so far.

Further, the executives of BHEL were understood to have assured their Genco counterparts that they are committed to commission commercial operations of the first two units of 4×270 MW BTPS and to run continuously to take them to full load by the end of March. They have also assured to bring the third unit on to bars by that time. However, the Genco officials has sought for a detailed schedule of commissioning of the third and fourth units pointing out that work on the fourth unit is progressing very slow and the quantum of pending work is very high.

Similarly, the Genco officials expressed disappointment over the pace of work at the 5×800 MW Yadadri Thermal Power Station. Stating that the pace of work is moving at a snail’s pace, Genco officials wanted BHEL to commence all work together and commission all the five units in next three-and-a-half years. The BHEL-CMD has informed that he would personally review the progress of work to avoid slippage to ensure commissioning of units as per the committed schedule.

220,2020/01/08,ULB polls: groupism to the fore in TRS,"Intense competition in the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) for tickets in the ensuing municipal polls is leading to groupism in the party but immediate intervention by senior leaders seem to have quelled it to some effect.

In fact, the party wants to suppress any such aggressive mood, sending a strong message that the promoters won’t be tolerated.

A message mixed with a promise of nominated posts for those who are left out and also with a warning of disciplinary action for those planning to contest as rebels was let out by Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav.

The Minister, who mediated with Tandur MLA P. Rohith Reddy and former Minister and MLC P. Mahender Reddy, over the issues with ticket distribution for their followers, said the party would amicably settle all the differences.

However, problems between the leaders is seen in most municipalities, particularly where MLAs elected on Congress tickets shifted loyalties to the TRS. Two layers of local leaders exist here and the cadre too are divided with loyalty.

Similar situation

The situation is similar in most municipalities in and around erstwhile Rangareddy district where Congress candidates won as MLAs but later joined the TRS.

It is also the case in areas where TRS leaders lost out in the race for MLA tickets but continue to be strong in their respective areas. Senior leaders however warned that any effort to sabotage the party candidates’ chances will be viewed seriously.

Mr. Yadav in fact went to the extent of saying that Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekar Rao himself has the list of all the leaders from village-level with him and he would not tolerate any indiscipline.

At the same time, he reminded the aspirants that the TRS government will be in power for the next four years and it will be to their advantage to support the party candidates.

The Chief Minister has called for a meeting of all the TRS MLAs on Thursday at the Telangana Bhavan to discuss the poll strategy with them. Party in-charges in the constituencies represented by the Opposition parties have also been invited.

Apart from sending a strong message once again that MLAs would be held responsible for the bad performance, the Chief Minister will also explain the party campaign strategy and the guidelines to be followed while issuing the B forms.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iujkjs/article30517427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09TALSUNI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/groupism-to-the-fore-in-trs/article30516663.ece
221,2020/01/08,Mahabubabad denied its due,"The quaint looking Mahabubabad town, though located strategically between Warangal and Khammam districts, has not witnessed the development it deserves.

A commercial town with lot of cotton and chilli procured and exported to other places by the local traders, it has rail and road connectivity and is surrounded by scores of tribal hamlets. Of late, there is lot of migration from Yellandu and other coal belt areas and also from the surrounding hamlets to Mahabubabad town. Some come in search of a job and some others to buy a plot and settle down.

Major problems facing the people are poor sanitation, roads and lack of permanent drinking water source. The authorities have constructed a checkdam over Munneru stream passing through the town and however, it has not been able to cater to the drinking water needs during peak summer season. Many promises have been made, but in vain.

Mahabubabad was a major gram panchayat before it was upgraded to second grade municipality in 2011 with 28 wards. With the inclusion of five villages – Bethole, Edulapusapally, Rajalpet, Jamulapalli and Anantharam, the number of wards in the town has gone up to 36, thus becoming the largest municipality in the erstwhile Warangal district. The people gave a fractured mandate in the last municipal elections held in 2014, before the formation of Telangana State.

In a closely contested election, the Congress and the TRS had won seven wards each out of the 28 wards. While the CPI(M) had finished with five, the CPI, Telugu Desam and Independents had three each. The Congress candidate Bukya Uma Murali Naik clinched the municipal chairperson’s post with the support of the Left parties. Surnapu Somaiah of the CPI(M) became vice-chairperson.

Even though the Congress was at the helm of municipality affairs in the last term, and the Left Parties still command considerable sway over the town, it is going to be tough time ahead for them with the TRS securing both the Assembly and Parliament seats this time.

Former Union Minister Porika Balaram Naik, All India Adivasi Congress vice chairman Tejavath Bellaiah Naik and former Municipal Chairperson Bukya Uma Murali Naik are holding hectic parley these days discussing about the municipal elections to be held on January 22. “Notwithstanding its political dominance, the TRS leadership will also be difficult for the leadership to select winning candidate among a host of aspirants competing for the ticket. It is said that the local MLAs will be given the task of selecting aspirants and ensuring their victory in all their respective ULBs. In such a case, Mahabubabad MLA Banoth Shankar Naik will hold all the cards, and it could be an embarrassing situation for the aspirants belonging to Minister for Tribal Welfare Satyavathi Rathod and MP Maloth Kavitha, who also hail from the district.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/v0k18l/article30516443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09MAHABUBABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mahabubabad-denied-its-due/article30516444.ece
222,2020/01/08,NIRED among three best rural employment training institutes,"Nagavali Institute of Rural Entrepreneurship Development (NIRED) at Rajam in Andhra Pradesh has been adjudged as one of the three best performing Rural Self-Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) in the country by the Ministry of Rural Development. It is jointly run by GMR Varalakshmi Foundation, CSR arm of GMR Group, and Andhra Bank, has become the only RSETI to win this recognition for the second year in a row.

NIRED identifies unemployed school or college dropouts from under-privileged families from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, to train them in vocational skills and also assist in taking up self-employment or jobs. Union Minister for Rural Development & Panchayat Raj Narendra Singh Thomar and Minister of State Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti gave away the awards at the National Awards Distribution ceremony in Delhi last month.

“We are overwhelmed to receive the award for the second year running. This puts greater responsibility on us, and we will strive to reach out to the youth in the most under-served areas, to put them on the first step on the ladder of a skilled vocation,” GMRVF executive director Meena Raghunathan.

NIRED is a residential training facility with capacity to run six streams simultaneously. Candidates are provided in-house training in both technical and soft skills. Successful trainees are helped out with bank loans for starting their own enterprises, wherever required. Also, hand holding support is given for two years to the trainees, such as advice in setting up the enterprises, training in business development techniques, facilitating market linkages etc.

The Institute was established in January 2003 under joint sponsorship of GMR Varalakshmi Foundation and Andhra Bank Rural Development Trust (ABRDT). Since inception, free training has been provided to about 16,500 unemployed youths of which over 13,000 are self-employed or working in their chosen field.

223,2020/01/08,Moglaikar Athram Raj Gonds offer gratitude to goddess Jangubai,"The tiny Moglaikar Athram clan of Raj Gonds and Pradhans, living scattered in Sirpur (U), Shettihadapnur and Chapri in Sirpur (U) mandal, Ghumnur and Kanchanpalli in Lingapur mandal and Rasimetta and Busimetta in Jainoor mandal in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district and some parts of Maharashtra, finally got to thank the most revered goddess Jangubai on Wednesday.

Some 15 years ago, the goddess had helped the Adivasis find one of their ‘stolen’ gods, Bhojjaibhali, because of which they needed to thank her and arrange a meeting taking the two gods, Moglaibhali and Bhojjaibhali, to meet her at her cave-abode deep inside the forest at Kota Parandoli Gram Panchayat located in Kerameri mandal of KB Asifabad district on the border with Maharashtra’s Jivti taluk.

Yes, there are a number of stories that lie scattered on the tribal heartland of former composite Adilabad district, which are heart-warming and sometimes bizarre, but all throwing light on the concerns, fears and anxieties of the ancient aboriginal communities, even in this age. These stories, which stay hidden in the hearts of concerned clans, have evolved around real life instances.

“In 2005, we went to Kaplai cave temple for pilgrimage carrying only Moglaibhali as by then Bhojjaibhali was stolen. The katoda or clan priest had a vision in which Jangubai appeared and told him that the missing god would be found soon but the clan must bring the god duo, considered her brothers, to meet her at her cave temple,” Athram Neelkant Rao and Athram Hamsa Rao, the present katodas recounted the tale.

“For some reason, we could not go to Jangubai during the last decade and half which had the community facing problems all along. We have now made the brothers meet their sister and hope to live in peace and in good health,” Shettihadapnur village head man of patel, Athram Sri Rao observed as he affirmed faith in the Adivasi beliefs.

Another interesting fact about the Moglaikar Athram is the name of their clan. According to elders, they are called Moglaikars because of some kind of association they had with the Mughals earlier.

The ethnic people, about 100 of them, travelled about 35 km barefooted, trailed by a caravan of 13 bullock carts and two mules, to the far flung abode of the goddess camping at two places for night on both sides of the journey. They camped on the outskirts of Rasimetta on the first night and at Vijjakasa on the second.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/moglaikar-athram-raj-gonds-offer-gratitude-to-goddess-jangubai/article30515829.ece
224,2020/01/08,CCTVs keep an eye on open defecation in this village,"M. Venkataiah (name changed) is in his early 50s. He is a barber by profession and goes to his customers’ houses to cut their hair and also do other odd jobs.

For doing so, he is offered rice (around 50 kg per house that varies according to the number of members) instead of money.

He used to go to the village outskirts to attend to nature’s call, a socially-accepted practice in villages, for several decades. But, not any more.

Construction of individual sanitary latrines (ISLs) changed his decade-old habit. Even his grandchildren are now using the toilet at home.

Not only that, CCTV cameras put up in the village for security reasons are coming handy for the authorities to stop people from open defecation.

Fearing that they might be caught carrying water bottles to attend to nature’s call, people have stopped this practice.

“We have four CCTV cameras in the village that have helped us in curbing open defecation,” said P. Prakash, sarpanch of the village.

So, is anybody in the village defecating in the open? No, is the firm answer from Mr. Venkataiah. The village was declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) and without fail, everybody is using toilets. The village has also passed a resolution to impose a fine of ₹500 on those who violate this rule.

“Four CCTVs were arranged to prevent thefts.

226,2020/01/08,Centre to blame for country’s mess: trade union leaders,"Several trade unions affiliated to the CPI, CPI (M) and other Left organisations took out demonstrations across erstwhile Warangal district on Wednesday in protest against the ‘anti-people’ policies of the Central government.

The strike was in response to the nationwide call given by 10 central trade unions and various independent federations and associations.

Addressing the gathering at Shiva Nagar here, CPI State secretariat member Thakkallapally Srinivasa Rao accused the Central government of being anti-working class and the anti-national. “The Modi government has been trying to privatise as many as 42 public sector units (PSUs) in steel, engineering, construction, electronics, ports, railways, aviation and defence,” Mr Rao alleged.

He said the unemployment situation was alarming with many jobs lost owing to the closure of medium- and small-scale industries in the country. The country’s growth had fallen to 4.9 per cent, he added. He said the nation was in chaos due to the Centre’s anti-people policies.

CPI district council secretary Mekala Ravi, K Bikshapathi and Sheikh Bashamiya were among those present.

Trade union activists also took out a rally from Thousand Pillars temple to Ambedkar statue. They shouted slogans against the Centre and State governments demanding a minimum pay of ₹21,000, health cards etc. They threatened to intensify their agitation if the government failed to reverse its anti-working class policies.

Peaceful

In undivided Nizamabad district, the Bharat bandh observed by trade unions under the banner of the Trade Unions United JAC evoked a partial response but was peaceful.

The TSRTC plied buses and banks transacted business as usual. Some schools were open, while others declared holiday. Shops and establishment downed their shutters, while cinema halls suspended morning show. Some autorikshaws were off the road.

Activists of Left parties, trade unions and student unions took out a massive rally from the office of the DEO to the Collectorate, shouting slogans against the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

At a meeting later held in front of the Collector office, CITU State vice-president Jayalaxmi, AITUC State vice-president Gangadhar Rao and IFTU president V. Krishna said the Centre, in the name of 100-day plan, was privatising some public sector undertakings and trampling on the rights of regular and contract workers. The State government was also following in the footsteps of the Centre, they said.

They demanded withdrawal of decision on merger of banks and solution for unemployment.

CITU district general secretary Noorjahan, Omaiah (AITUC), Narender (IFTU) and LB Ravi spoke.

In Adilabad, grameen Bharat bandh was partial even as trade unions staged demonstrations. In Mancherial, trade unions took out a rally and formed a human chain.

It is a well known fact the MLA is pushing for his son to become next chairman of the Adilabad Municipality and hence nominated him from his own Shantinagar, ward number 34.

The move has, however, drawn criticism within party ranks. Those who criticised the MLA maintained that he should have left the opportunity for aspirants from open category as the municipal chairman seat fell in that category.

""Mr. Ramanna could have pushed for his son’s elevation in case the seat is reserved for Backward Classes,” said a close relative of a former chairperson.

228,2020/01/08,This exhibition in Hyderabad turns its gaze on Kashmir from the 1920s,"A photograph on display at Kalakriti art gallery shows Kashmir’s first photo studio run by an Indian, Mahatta & Co, in 1915. It was then called Mahatta Art Studio and was set up by Amar Nath Mehta on a houseboat on river Jhelum. The story goes that the British used to address Mehta as Mahatta and hence the name. Amar Nath moved to Delhi to set up another studio in 1948 and his younger brother Ram Chand Mehta or R C Mehta, took over the Srinagar operations. The Mehtas have documented the Valley, its people and pristine landscapes for over a century.

‘R C Mehta - exploring the familiar and the iconic’ is the first of the three exhibitions in Hyderabad to mark the Krishnakriti Festival of Arts and Culture 2020, the 17th edition of the festival. This year’s festival will unfold from January to March, presenting three exhibitions on Kashmir with the theme ‘Makers and Meanings’, and the collective series is titled ‘Deconstructing Paradise: Images and Imaginations of Kashmir’.

Photo call ‘R C Mehta - exploring the familiar and the iconic’ is on view at Kalakriti art gallery, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, till January 26.

Part two of the exhibition, tentatively scheduled for February, will go back in time to explore Kashmir before the invention of photography, from the 18th century, with the help of maps, lithographs and paintings.

The third part of the exhibition, in March, will explore life, arts and culture in contemporary Kashmir, through colour photography and other visual narratives.

The photographs now on view at Kalakriti are from the 1930s to the 1960s, from the archives of Mahatta & Co.

The studio thrived on portraiture from the 1920s to mid 1930s. Hemant Mehta, the grandson of R C Mehta, has grown up listening to stories of how his forefathers worked around constraints. When the studio was on a houseboat in the 1910s, ingenuity made photography possible when electricity was a luxury: “Reflectors were fitted like flaps to the windows of the houseboat. When sun rays fell on Jhelum waters, these reflectors directed the sunlight into the houseboat and portraits were shot. Once the full-fledged studio was established, high wattage bulbs were used.”

The clarity and detailing in the photographs of the 1920s and 1930s speak of the mastery of technique. If the archives are picture perfect, Hemant credits it partly to the dry, non-humid weather conditions in Srinagar.

Hemant Mehta | Photo Credit: By arrangement

In the attic of the Srinagar studio, Hemant chanced upon old, bulky cameras that weighed around 50 kilograms, with iron stands, and used glass plate negatives.

This was before the advent of film photography. These heavy cameras were not portable and hence, studio portraiture was the mainstay.

In pre-Independent India, Kashmir was a holiday destination for well-heeled Indians, the British and European travellers, many of whom stepped into Mahatta & Co for portraits.

In the mid 1930s, as cameras became smaller, the Mehtas carried them out of the studio and captured Kashmir’s landmarks and people. There are candid moments of women in agriculture, houseboats pulling logs on the Jhelum, breathtaking visuals of Nanga Parbhat, Khilanmarg, Fateh Kadal, Shalimar Bagh and the backwaters of Dal lake.

The studio made postcards and slides of these landscape images and these became collectibles for the tourists. Visuals of chinar trees in winter in 1945, and a view of the ski routes on the slopes of Gulmarg in the mid 1940s are among the stunning captures.

Abeer Gupta of Krishnakriti Foundation remarks that some of the visuals shot by the studio were referred to by Hindi film units who wanted to shoot in picturesque locales in the Valley.

The studio also turned its gaze on arts and crafts — carpet manufacturing and chain stitched rugs in the 1960s, for instance. They also documented Maharaja Hari Singh, Karan Singh, Maharani Tara Devi and Jawaharlal Nehru.

The ongoing exhibition displays images of Kashmir till the 1960s, before colour photography came into practice. “R C Mehta witnessed life in Kashmir as a local, was a practitioner of photography and a studio owner from the 1920s to the 80s,” says Abeer.

Jawaharlal Nehru in Kashmir

The studio also stood witness to the struggles in the Valley over the decades. “During World War II, film rolls were rationed. When people would queue up outside the studio, film rolls were directly loaded into their cameras to prevent black market selling,” says Hemant.

In the last four months following the abrogation of Article 370, nothing much has happened. Each time the region witnessed an unrest, the studio would barely function and wait in hope of better times.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/j6jueg/article30513159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Krishnakriti---kashmir-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/at-the-krishnakriti-festival-in-hyderabad-photography-archives-of-mahatta-co-showcase-kashmir-from-the-1920s-to-the-1960s/article30513165.ece
229,2020/01/08,"Heavy snowfall, rain bring life to standstill in Himachal","Normal life was thrown out of gear in Himachal Pradesh as the State received heavy snowfall and showers on Wednesday, affecting road connectivity, electricity and water supply.

Hundreds of tourists were stranded in Shimla, Kufri, Narkanda, Manali and Dalhousie as officials said 879 roads in the State were blocked due to heavy snowfall.

The Shimla police have rescued 43 tourists who were stranded at different places in the district and rushed 20 people to hospitals, Shimal SP Omapati Jamwal said.

Earlier in the day, authorities had advised people not to travel to popular tourist destinations of Shimla and Manali owing to intermittent snowfall.

The high and middle hills of Himachal Pradesh witnessed heavy snowfall, while lower hills received showers throughout the day.

Power supply has been disrupted in the snow-bound areas and several villages have been rendered without electricity.

The heavy snowfall has resulted in freezing of residential water supply pipes in some areas of the State.

Forty roads were blocked in Nahan’s Sangrah, Shillai, Sarahan and Rajgarh sub divisions.

AAP is the main Opposition party in the State Assembly.

AAP Punjab chief and Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann said that the Chief Minister should answer as to why consumers in the State were forced to pay a higher tariff as compared to other States even though Punjab produced its own electricity.

Expensive pacts

Mr. Mann in a statement said that had the ruling government been a little sympathetic, it would had scrapped the expensive power purchase agreements inked by the previous SAD-BJP government with private power companies.

He alleged that the Congress government had succumbed to pressure from the powerful power mafia.

The ruling Congress had failed to honour its poll promise of cancelling the agreements with private thermal plants after forming the government, he said

232,2020/01/08,Kidnapped child found dead in Jaipur after mother’s murder,"A two-year-old child, who was kidnapped after the heinous murder of his mother at her residential apartment in Pratap Nagar, was found dead at the rear side of Unique Tower flats here on Wednesday.

His kidnappers had earlier demanded a ransom of ₹30 lakh from his father, who is a manager with the Indian Oil Corporation.

Grave injuries

The unidentified assailants had killed Shweta, 30, by slitting her throat with a knife and taken away her son, Shriyam, on Tuesday. Her grave head injuries indicated that she might also have been hit on the head with a pestle.

The murderers sent a text message to her husband, Rohit Tiwari, from Shweta's mobile phone with the demand for ransom.

When Mr. Tiwari, currently posted as fuel in-charge at Sanganer International Airport here, called back, he was asked to come with the money to Gandhi Nagar locality. No valuables were found missing from the apartment. Mr. Tiwari was not at home when the crime was committed and he arrived after the cops informed him of the murder.

Based on the assessment of the crime scene, the police suspect the involvement of someone close to the family. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Jaipur East) Rahul Jain said the line of investigation had changed after the recovery of Shriyam's body and the emphasis of the police would be on finding out the motive for the double murder.

The couple and their son had shifted from New Delhi to Jaipur one-and-a-half years ago and were staying in Unique Tower’s flat on rent. Shweta's body, lying in a pool of blood, was first noticed by the maid who came to the flat on Tuesday evening and found the entrance door open.

‘Friendly entry’

A police team later found two cups of tea and snacks on the dining table and no signs of struggle between the assailants and the victim.

234,2020/01/08,"CID still part of Haryana Home Ministry, says Vij","Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Wednesday asserted that the Criminal Investigation Department was still part of the Home Ministry and if the Chief Minister wanted to change it, it had to be passed by the Cabinet.

Mr. Vij was talking to journalists in Ambala after the Haryana government websites suggested that the State’s CID was being handled by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

Asserting that the CID was still with him, Mr. Vij said: “If the Chief Minister wishes, he can take the CID from the Home Minister. But that cannot happen without a Cabinet meeting. And, therefore CID is still with me.”

“Governments are not run by websites. They are run by the rule of law,” he added.

“Chief Minister is supreme, if he wishes, he can take back CID from me. But as per law it can’t be done without passing it in the Cabinet and later in the State Assembly. So far, no meeting has been held in this matter,” Mr. Vij said.

235,2020/01/08,‘BJP will pay a heavy price for its stubbornness on CAA’,"A day after former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan stated that the Centre would implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at any cost, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Wednesday that the Bharatiya Janata Party would have to “pay a heavy price for such stubbornness”.

“An elected government that refuses to heed the voice of its people or respond to their anger is bound to lose their confidence and collapse,” said the Punjab CM, adding that the BJP’s stance on the issue smacked of a “dangerously fascist approach that would lead to their [the BJP’s] eventual downfall”.

Capt. Amarinder said that as far as his government was concerned, there was no way it would allow the brazenly divisive Act to be implemented in Punjab. “You cannot force us to do so,” he said, even as he reiterated that neither he nor the Congress was against grant of citizenship to persecuted minorities in other countries, such as Sikhs in Pakistan, but they were completely opposed to the discrimination in the CAA against certain religious communities, including Muslims.

“Despite the nationwide public outrage over the controversial CAA, the BJP-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government at the Centre was refusing to acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the legislation,” said the Punjab Chief Minister, hitting out at Mr. Chouhan for his “shockingly inconsiderate remarks” on the issue.

In a statement, Capt. Amarinder said Mr. Chouhan had “absolutely no idea what he was talking about, nor had he bothered to study the Act”, which has triggered massive public protests across the country. These protests, he said, were not “the brainchild of the Congress’ or any other party”, as Mr. Chouhan was claiming, but the result of a spontaneous outrage among Indians cutting across religious and party lines.

‘No personal stake’

“Does Mr. Chouhan really believe that the lakhs of people, including youth and students, who had come out on the streets to brave bullets and lathis, were Congress supporters?” said Capt. Amarinder. “Can’t he or the other BJP leaders hear the voice of these protesters, majority of whom have no personal stake in the matter?” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kv6hm2/article30517009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-will-pay-a-heavy-price-for-its-stubbornness-on-caa/article30517011.ece
236,2020/01/08,Jolt for BJP in Vidarbha as party loses Nagpur Zilla Parishad,"While registering an emphatic win in the Dhule Zilla Parishad, the BJP’s efforts in their stronghold in the Vidarbha region largely came a cropper as they lost the crucial Nagpur ZP while drawing even with the Congress in the Nandurbar ZP.

Poll results to six ZPs including Washim, Akola and Palghar besides the hotly-contested ZPs of Dhule, Nashik and Nandurbar were declared on Wednesday. In fact, besides Dhule, the BJP failed to make any gains in the remaining five ZPs.

In the 58-seat Nagpur ZP, the BJP could manage only 15 seats while the Congress reigned supreme snaring 31 seats and its ally the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 10.

The BJP lost the ZP seat in Dhapewada, which is the native village of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Likewise, former Nagpur Guardian Minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule, too, was forced to eat humble pie after a Congress candidate defeated the party nominee in the Koradi Circle ZP seat. Koradi is Mr. Bawankule’s hometown.

While not quite the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition formula, the Congress had fought the Nagpur ZP in alliance with the NCP and the Peasants and Workers’ Party (PWP), which won one seat. The Shiv Sena, which contested on its own, could manage to win a single seat.

The ZP results indicated that the BJP had yet to rally from its damaging setback in the Vidarbha region, where it lost 17 seats in the Assembly polls despite the area considered as the party’s bastion.

“The BJP had been in power for seven years in the Nagpur ZP but had not done any development work in the rural areas.,” said State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, whose son Salil Deshmukh won the Metpanjra Panchayat Samiti seat.

Likewise, former NCP Minister Ramesh Bang’s son, Dinesh, too won the Hingna Panchayat Samiti seat.

According to observers, the reason for the BJP’s defeat in Nagpur is that besides former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, none of the party brass including Mr. Bawankule were seen campaigning hard enough.

Mr. Fadnavis’ spirited campaign paid off for the party in the 56-seat Nandurbar ZP where the BJP had bagged 23 seats.

Tehre was no MVA coalition in Nandurbar as the Congress, the NCP and the Sena fought separately despite being in alliance at the State level.

The Congress, too, managed to win 23 seats, while the Shiv Sena won seven and the NCP three.

Sources said an MVA formula was most likely to come into play here in the coming days, as the Sena has emerged as ‘king-maker’.

The Sena dealt a big blow to recently sworn-in Maharashtra Tribal Affairs Minister and seven-time MLA from Nandurbar K.C. Padavi (Congress). His wife Hemlata Padavi was beaten by Sena’s Ganesh Paradke.

The BJP effortlessly won the 56-seat Dhule ZP as the collective leadership of party Dhule MP and former Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre and that of former Maharashtra Minister Jaykumar Rawal, paid off handsomely.

“The BJP has helped bring a number of irrigation projects in the rural areas and the public have recognised the efforts,” said Dr. Bhamre.

On his part, Mr. Rawal lashed out at the MVA coalition calling it an “opportunistic alliance” and not the people’s true mandate.

“The people of Maharashtra have comprehensively rejected this unnatural alliance [Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA] and this sentiment has been reflected in the results to the Dhule ZP where, for the first time, we [the BJP] have secured more than 35 seats,” said Mr. Rawal, while lauding Mr. Fadnavis’ campaign.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6cm0/article30515781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZILLAPARISHADELECTIONNAGPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jolt-for-bjp-in-vidarbha-as-party-loses-nagpur-zilla-parishad/article30515782.ece

238,2020/01/08,Sambhaji Brigade lodges complaint against Akshay Kumar,"After a storm of criticism on social media, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar’s Nirma detergent advertisement, which allegedly disparaged soldiers of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, has now raised the hackles of the pro-Maratha Sambhaji Brigade, which filed a complaint against the actor on Wednesday and demanded an immediate broadcast ban on the ad.

The Brigade has further threatened to launch a statewide agitation in the event the police failed to act on its complaint and register a First Information Report, and has warned that it would not permit the screening of Mr. Kumar’s films until he issued a public apology.

Shivaji’s mavlas

Members of the outfit, led by the Brigade’s Pune district president Santosh Shinde, filed a complaint against the Bollywood star and the management of the Nirma Group of Companies at the Shivajinagar Police Station, for defaming Chhatrapati Shivaji and the mavlas (warriors).

“Have the sacrifices of king Shivaji’s valiant mavlas been reduced to the frivolous selling of a product used for washing clothes? Chhatrapati Shivaji’s soldiers sacrificed their lives and shed their blood to fulfil their dream of Swarajya (Independence)…the deeds of Mavlas under the leadership of the Maratha generals Holkar and Scindia are renowned throughout the world. This crass advert seems to imply that the Maratha soldiers only spent time washing their clothes after their battles,” Mr. Shinde said.

‘Parodying’

In the advertisement, Mr. Kumar, who plays a king, is seen walking in with his soldiers and saying: “Maharaj aur uski sena dushman ko dhona jaanti hai, aur apne kapde bhi (the king and his armies know to trounce their enemies and also to keep their clothes clean).” When a woman ticks-off the men for their soiled clothes, they are seen washing their clothes with Nirma washing powder.

Strongly objecting to the very idea of parodying historical characters for the purposes of selling products, Mr. Shinde said that, in the past, filmmakers, novelists and other media had used Chhatrapati Shivaji as “a soft target” to sell “their cheap artistic wares”.

“There have been distortions about King Shivaji’s life in the past, with books and pamphlets misrepresenting facts or deliberately falsifying history. All this is highly condemnable,” he said.

The Brigade was in political limelight in 2004 after its infamous vandalism of the city’s Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in protest against American scholar James Laine’s book on Shivaji titled Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India (2003).

Vehement opposition

In August 2015, Brigade activists had vehemently opposed the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party government’s decision to honour nonagenarian right-wing historian Babasaheb Purandare with the prestigious ‘Maharashtra Bhushan’ award on grounds that the latter had deliberately distorted facts about king Shivaji’s childhood in service of a socially divisive agenda.

In January 2017, Sambhaji Brigade activists vandalised the bust of legendary Marathi litterateur Ram Ganesh Gadkari on grounds that the writer had negatively portrayed king Sambhaji, eldest son of king Shivaji, in his magnum opus Raj-Sanyas. The Brigade had claimed that Gadkari, in his unfinished Raj-Sanyas (roughly translated as ‘Kingdom renounced’) in 1919, portrayed Sambhaji as an alcoholic and a womaniser.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1r4t2e/article30513702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AKSHAYKUMARKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sambhaji-brigade-lodges-complaint-against-akshay-kumar/article30513703.ece

240,2020/01/08,"Kicked, abused in police custody, says Sadaf Jafar","Congress worker and social activist Sadaf Jafar on Tuesday alleged that not only did male police officers assault her in custody but they also subjected her to communal slurs and humiliation and asked her to “go to Pakistan”.

“They said ‘you are a Pakistani’,” Ms. Jafar told The Hindu after being released from jail, more than two weeks after her arrest following the violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Lucknow.

“They said ‘you eat here but sing songs of Pakistan. What have we not provided to you people? You are doing jobs here, getting to eat and also produce kids’,” she claimed.

Ms. Jafar, a single mother with two minor children, said the police accused her of receiving funds from Pakistan. She claimed that when she begged the police to allow her to inform her family of her detention on December 19, a male police officer beat her up while women constables slapped her multiple times and abused her.

“An officer walked up to me and pulled my hair — the whole strand of hair came off — and then he kicked me on my stomach and my knee,” Ms. Jafar alleged. “They used such filthy language that I can’t repeat it.”

Ms. Jafar and retired IPS officer S.R. Darapuri were among the 14 persons granted bail by a Lucknow court on Saturday in connection with the violence.

Social activist and teacher Robin Verma and theatre artiste Deepak Mishra, who too were arrested in connection with the violence during the anti-CAA protests in Lucknow, were granted bail on Tuesday.

Ex-IPS officer ‘mistreated’

Mr. Darapuri (76), too, alleged mistreatment at the hands of the police. He claimed he was denied a blanket in the cold and was also not provided food for 24 hours. “On December 20, I was picked up from my house at 11 a.m. and kept the whole day at the Ghazipur police station and was taken to the Hazratganj police station in the evening. They showed my arrest at 7 p.m., and not 11 a.m., from some park,” he said.

“I didn’t have any [warm] clothes. They [police] refused to give me a blanket and food,” the septuagenarian said. The police also did not record his statement at the police station and fabricated it, he alleged.

Mr. Darapuri, who is also an Ambedkarite activist, said the arrests were an attempt by the government to suppress the voice of activists.

“The government was rattled by the manner in which the entire country opposed the law and adopted a tactic of suppression. They sent political and social activists to jail with the strategy that it would leave protesters outside without anyone to guide them. But the government has failed in it,” he said.

Mr. Darapuri was under house arrest on December 19 but was arrested the following day. During his house detention, he had posted on Facebook a photo of him holding a placard, which read “Save citizenship”, to express solidarity with the protesters.

He said he would continue to exercise his “democratic right to protest till the law [CAA] is withdrawn”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fq2m3r/article30507955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08PG12-COL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kicked-abused-in-police-custody-says-sadaf-jafar/article30507956.ece
241,2020/01/08,Pawar to keep tabs on NCP ministers,"The performance of ministers of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the State government will be monitored directly by party president Sharad Pawar through periodic meetings.

The first of these meetings will be held on Wednesday. Apart from guiding the ministers on their administrative duties, Mr. Pawar is also likely to discuss with them how to handle politically sensitive matters.

With the NCP getting the lion’s share in the Cabinet and key portfolios like Home, Finance, Rural Development and Cooperation, the party leadership sees this as an opportunity to expand its base in areas other than western Maharashtra and Marathwada.

The NCP has not been able to make inroads in Vidarbha, north Maharashtra and urban areas such as Mumbai. The three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance has now given it an opportunity to cement its organisation in these areas.

Mumbai NCP chief and Minority Development Minister Nawab Malik told The Hindu that Mr. Pawar used to interact with the party’s ministers earlier too. “This is his method of working — taking feedback and guiding the junior ministers. He will be talking to us about priorities of the government and how priorities of the work need to be fixed,” he said.

Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the meeting is to provide guidance to the ministers. “This is the first meeting and Pawar saheb is likely to take such review meetings at regular intervals,” he said.

242,2020/01/08,State reverses earlier govt.’s decision on APMCs,"The State Cabinet on Tuesday reversed yet another decision of the previous government to appoint four technical experts on agriculture produce market committees (APMCs).

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government had brought in an amendment to the Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963, which gave the government power to appoint four special invitees on every market committee whose income from fees levied and collection exceeded ₹5 crore. For APMCs with income up to ₹5 crore, the government could appoint two special invitees.

The special invitees were to be experts from the field of agriculture, agriculture processing, agriculture marketing, law, economics or commerce.

The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), then in the Opposition, had called the decision the BJP’s attempt to control the APMCs as it could not win them by contesting internal elections. The APMCs have for long been strongholds of the Congress and NCP, enabling the two parties to control rural politics.

The Cabinet on Tuesday decided to annul the amendment to the Act. “We have been against this amendment from the start. The move will ensure smooth functioning of the APMCs without any conflict,” Cooperation Minister Balasaheb Patil said.

243,2020/01/08,"Raj meets Fadnavis, sets tongues wagging","Fuelling speculation of what could be yet another strange political alliance in the State, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Tuesday met former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis.

The meeting held in Prabhadevi lasted for more than an hour, but neither of the two leaders was available for comment after it ended. However, sources said the meeting could be the beginning of the two parties coming together.

Driving force

The BJP’s long-term ally, the Shiv Sena, quit the partnership to form a government with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The MNS, which managed to win only one seat in the Assembly polls, neither has any power left in the ruling alliance, nor the Opposition. This seems to be compelling the two parties to join hands, despite the animosity between them in the last five years.

“Mr. Thackeray is set to address a public meeting on January 23, where he will announce the future course of action. There have been talks within the party fold to turn to the Hindutva ideology as the Sena has deserted it by joining hands with the Congress and the NCP,” an MNS leader said, on the condition of anonymity.

According to sources, the party is also likely to change its flag to add more saffron colour to it.

Strained past

The relations between the two parties were strained last year after Mr. Thackeray campaigned against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though his party did not contest the Lok Sabha polls. Mr. Thackeray was later served a notice by the Enforcement Directorate in the Kohinoor mill case, which further worsened the relations.

The MNS chief had met NCP chief Sharad Pawar and party leader Ajit Pawar prior to the polls, giving rise to speculation that he might reach a tacit understanding with the NCP.

For the BJP, the loss of the Sena as an ally in Mumbai and Pune creates difficulty in civic polls, and an alliance with the MNS would mean the party can break into the Sena’s Marathi vote bank.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/raj-meets-fadnavis-sets-tongues-wagging/article30507672.ece
244,2020/01/08,"CM urges India Inc. to revive business environment, create jobs","Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has assured industrialists that the new three-party government under his leadership will not work with a vendetta against business deals signed by the previous regime.

Mr. Thackeray promised top CEOs and industrialists a basket of incentives for businesses agreeing to promote employment for local youth, while assuring a business-friendly environment in the State over the next five years. In his first interaction with top corporate honchos, the Shiv Sena leader urged the corporates to help Mumbai become a global tourism hub and transform cities like Pune, often called the Oxford of the East, into global educational centres on the lines of Oxford.

The interaction at State guest house Sahyadri was attended by industry captains, including Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Anand Mahindra, Adi Godrej, Sajjan Jindal, Uday Kotak, Deepak Parekh, Gautam Singhania and Baba Kalyani.

Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said the government will develop 66 urban forests in Mumbai, and at the same time work to promote night life in the financial capital.

‘Fabulous talk’

Industrialists told The Hindu they left the meeting impressed with the CM’s honest appeal to revive the State’s business environment and attempts at fostering a personal bond with each of them.

“It was a fabulous talk, he was unprepared and spoke from the heart, as he was not supposed to speak. Everyone went and congratulated Uddhav Thackeray that the star of the show was none of us, but Aaditya Thackeray,” RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka told The Hindu.

Mr. Goenka suggested making Pune a global educational centre, and tapping into investments in manufacturing moving away from China. “A lot of manufacturing is running away from China, and Vietnam is taking away 50% of those investments. Why cannot Maharashtra [focus on] getting those investments and becoming a manufacturing hub driven by electronics?” he asked.

Industrialist Venugopal Dhoot told The Hindu, “For the industrial growth of Maharashtra, [the CM] is ready to help the corporates at any level. If any corporate comes to him at midnight ready to create jobs, he will go to any extent to help him. Further, he was more interested in dispersal of industry in backward areas. He also emphasised that his government will give maximum benefits to those who give employment to locals.”

Others present in the meeting said the Chief Minister spoke with a lot of passion towards the policies which would help facilitate future investments. He is said to have told industrialists, “I am there for you to serve you, and you all need to invest in Maharashtra and not anywhere else. Let me know how we can help. We will meet every three months to discuss issues. This is an action-oriented government, and we will continuously take feedback and action accordingly.”

One industrialist said it was a rare meeting where “everybody felt happy”. “We attend so many meetings by chief ministers and political leaders, where you go just to fill the quorum. But here, he was speaking with passion and from the heart. He was treating the businessmen like family, and not like ‘I am the master and you are the slave’,” the industrialist said.

Raymond Ltd. CMD Gautam Singhania said the meeting was very fruitful. “I urged the Chief Minister to enhance the quality of infrastructure and public transport in Maharashtra and more specifically in Mumbai, which is the commerce capital of India,” Mr. Singhania said.

Uday Kotak, president designate of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said business and industry would strongly support the CM’s vision, and the CII is committed to work with the government for the development of the State. “At around 15%, Maharashtra contributes highest to the Indian GDP. Mumbai can play a significant role in being the financial capital of the world, and the State should leverage significant opportunity in the Fintech space,” he said.

‘Clear roadmap’

Gopichand Hinduja, co-chairman of the Hinduja Group, and Ashok Hinduja, chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies (India), said the CM had clearly laid down the roadmap to make the State into a $1 trillion economy. “His blue print had a clear emphasis on building more industry, upgrade health and education facilities, give boost to tourism in order to create more jobs, coupled with policy-friendly governance to increase ease of doing business. The single most important business-friendly message to all of us he gave with humility was to consider [that] it’s your own government and one that listens — come and work with us hand in hand,” the Hindujas said.

For Anand Piramal, executive director of Piramal Group, the meeting had a great symbolic significance as it recognised the critical role that companies can play in nation building. “The State can and wants to play a greater role in the revitalisation of the real estate sector. The Chief Minister listened to both our constructive feedback and suggestions, and committed to take actions to simplify and shorten the approval process as well as to rationalise ready reckoner rates to make real estate more affordable, in order to boost consumer sentiment,” Mr. Piramal said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/41mek6/article30507631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BM-CM-with-Industrialist-Meeting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cm-urges-india-inc-to-revive-business-environment-create-jobs/article30507632.ece

247,2020/01/08,Children continue to die in Rajasthan: Pilot,"Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said here on Tuesday that children continue to die in parts of the State and the problem needs to be resolved.

Mr. Pilot, who is also the State Congress chief, reiterated his earlier stance that the responsibility should be fixed for the death of infants at a Kota hospital.

Steps taken

He, however, expressed confidence that the steps taken by the State government will prove to be effective.

“Infants are dying continuously in different districts of the State and the problem within the system should be resolved,” he said replying to a question.

He added that it would raise people’s confidence in the government and send the message that it was serious.

“But we must decide the responsibility for what has happened. I still stand on my point that one person, one leader or one person does not a matter. The deficiency should be rectified and there should be confidence in the public that this incident will not recur,” he said.

Mr. Pilot also cautioned that the biggest strength of a democracy are its people who show the door to those who do not perform.

“I have seen many of our comrades who come from political families, which benefits them. People know them by name. But, people also expect you to perform. If you do not perform, then the voters do not spare anyone,” Mr. Pilot said at the inauguration of a students’ union office in Rajasthan University on Tuesday.

‘Need to deliver’

Commenting on the death of infants at the Kota hospital, Mr. Pilot had earlier said, “We have to fix accountability. After 13 months of being in the government, it may not serve any purpose to keep pointing towards the previous government. That government was voted out and we were voted in. We have to face responsibility and consequences. People expect us to deliver,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/children-continue-to-die-in-rajasthan-pilot/article30507495.ece
248,2020/01/08,Guest staff demand regularisation of jobs,"Besides teaching Hindi, Shaheen Khan, removed recently as a guest faculty member at a college in Katni district, for 15 years mentored students with their career goals, even lent them emotional support. But never did she imagine that despite having a PhD and qualifying the National Eligibility Test and the State Eligibility Test, her own future could look this bleak.

“Should we focus on our own future or our children’s?” wonders Ms. Khan, a single mother of a daughter, a BSc student, and a son in Class XII. Not paid salary for six months, she is left grappling to pay ₹8,000 as house rent every month, and has even accrued a ₹2-lakh debt.

With the appointment of 3,418 permanent faculty members in government colleges by the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission (MPPSC) last month, around 2,300 guests — assistant professors, librarians and sports officers — faced removal from present postings on December 7, leaving their future uncertain. Although the State government has extended them an edge in securing a regular job, even assured them of an appointment, though ad hoc, still elsewhere, the former guests, who earned ₹1,500 a day, demand regularisation. The last appointments happened in 2007, and before that in 1993.

As the dharna in Bhopal entered the 29th day on Tuesday, Devraj Singh, who taught in Vidisha district, called upon Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and the party to keep its election promise.

“We will create a policy to regularise guest faculty members according to the roster. In case they are not selected by the MPPSC, they will not be removed,” reads Section 17.22 of the party’s manifesto for the M.P. adhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha election in November 2018 reads “...they will not be removed”.

During a public meeting in Indore in October 2018, as a guest professor explained his plight, Mr. Gandhi said, “The party will attempt to remove this feeling.The manifesto is not of the party, but yours.”

Kamal Nath, now Chief Minister, had asserted, “The party doesn’t believe in the tradition of guests and contracts. And this is about justice. Just wait for some days, and you won’t complain any more.”

Around 1,200 former guest professors marched 170 km from Pipariya, Hoshangabad district, to Bhopal, where they launched a dharna. Tonsuring oneself, a signature campaign using blood, poster-making and staging funeral processions of government orders have characterised protests.

While Ms. Khan didn’t receive a ‘fallen out’ letter, most, including Saraswati Pandey, 45, can use it to seek appointment at other colleges having vacant posts based on merit, according to a policy promulgated on December 17.

Though Ms. Pandey, who taught music for 20 years, seven as a guest faculty member, was removed, her husband, Ashok Kumar Sharma, a geography professor, remains a guest, for 17 years now. There are 2,800 guests who face uncertainty.

“I’ll lose my job the moment they appointment a permanent professor on my post,” says Mr. Sharma, who has two sons, 18 and 12. “We will never want our children to become professors.”

D.P. Ahuja, Higher Education Commissioner, told The Hindu, “The guests were appointed in a temporary arrangement. And in the next three years, we plan to fill all the regular posts.”

Stating that the government was not aiming at regularising all the guests through a ""backdoor channel"", he said, “They can have a maximum benefit of 20 marks in regular appointments and there is no age bar for them in taking the examination.”

Though the government wants to consider only ‘fallen out’ guests for the remaining posts until permanent appointments are made, the Indore Bench of the High Court in an interim order opened it for all. The government will move the court against the order.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/izegq0/article30507477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08TEACHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/guest-staff-demand-regularisation-of-jobs/article30507479.ece

According to the FIR, the 16-year-old, who hailed from a village near Ranchi in Jharkhand, was being sold by her step-aunt at Naurangabad village for ₹75,000. “The police team raided the house of Savitri after a tip-off. We found the girl locked in a room,” said Harendra Kumar, SP (Rural) Bulandshahr.

Suresh Kumar, CO, Shikarpur said the girl’s step-aunt Kalawati brought her to the village to sell her to a family looking for a bride. “People usually consider Haryana as the hub of such marriages but we do get such cases in western Uttar Pradesh as well. Here the sex ratio is poor as well and rural unemployment is widespread but gets covered because districts of eastern U.P. fare better,” he said.

The FIR said wedding material, such as sari and a vanity kit, was recovered from the spot. “Prima facie, Kalawati, from Ranchi, made use of the girl’s poor financial condition. The girl was allegedly sold by her stepmother,” said Mr. Kumar.

Anil Kumar Singh, Additional Superintendent of Police, said a couple of days ago the police got a complaint from a Scheduled Caste couple from Bijrol village of Baghpat. According to the complaint, Shikha, wife of Mohar Singh, gave birth to a child in Usha Nursing Home of Baraut in September 2018. They were not in a condition to pay ₹40,000, the bill for C-section. When they paid ₹10,000 only, they were asked to give thumb impressions on blank papers and were told that the infant would remain with the hospital till they pay the rest of the amount. “When they returned to pay the amount, they were allegedly driven out,” said Mr. Singh.

He said after the police started investigating the case, the couple started changing the statement. “They alleged that the doctor sold the child in Muzaffarnagar. We are looking into that angle.”

Mr. Mohar also told local reporters that some people tried to kidnap him.

Teshu Hooda, the doctor at the Usha Nursing Home, said they were not in the wrong. “When the police approached us, we submitted all the documents. Shikha delivered a male child by C-section and the couple had made the required payment.”

253,2020/01/08,"Sikhs safe in India, says Amarinder","A day after Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikh religion, acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh stated that Sikhs were not safe even in India, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has said he did not agree with him.

Capt. Amarinder on Tuesday expressed concern over Akal Takht acting Jathedar’s remarks that Sikhs were not safe even in India, and asked the Takht to put pressure on the Shiromani Akali Dal to sever all ties with the ruling alliance at the Centre, which has been unable to ensure a sense of safety among the minorities in the country.

While he himself did not agree with the Akal Takht Jathedar’s remarks, the Chief Minister in a statement here said that if the former did feel that way then he should take up the matter with the SAD and ask them to leave the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre, of which they are a part.

“Unlike Pakistan, India had always taken pride in being a secular nation, with no discrimination on religious grounds,” said Capt. Amarinder, adding that any feeling among the Sikh community that they were not secure here was a matter of grave concern. “If Sikhs were feeling insecure in this country, as stated by the acting Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh, then it was the dispensation at the Centre which was to blame,” he said.

Capt. Amarinder said that given that the Akalis’ claim to be the custodians of the Sikh religion, and the community, they should take a stand on the issue, and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal should also ask his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal to resign immediately as a Union Minister.

Capt. Amarinder said that while some incidents here and there could not be construed to be a case of Sikhs not being safe in India, perception was as important as reality. “The Sikhs had lived through a very dark period in the 1980s and any feeling of being at the receiving end in any way would revive their sense of fear, which would be detrimental to the community’s interest, as well as that of the nation,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sikhs-safe-in-india-says-amarinder/article30507414.ece

256,2020/01/08,Four-day Tests | Sandeep Patil critical of the proposal,"The cricketing fraternity appears to be divided on four-day Tests. While a section of former players have given the new proposal a thumbs up, most of them are against the idea.

Former India cricketer Sandeep Patil, too, isn’t in favour of the new proposal. Talking to scribes on the sidelines of the Harris Shield final at the Brabourne Stadium on Wednesday, Patil went to the extent of calling the four-day Test a ‘nonsense’.

“I belong to the old school and I believe that in five-day cricket, the first day belongs to the medium-pacers. Test cricket itself is a test of character for a cricketer. It’s a test for every individual and you are taking that away,” Patil said.

Also Read ICC cricket committee member Jayawardene feels Test cricket should be for five days

Recent reports suggested that the ICC’s cricket committee plans to recommend trimming Tests to four days from five for the 2023-2031 World Test Championship cycle.

Up to ICC

In 2017, South Africa played a four-day Test against Zimbabwe — a concept that did not go down well with many. “A cricketer is put to test on the first day and also on the last day, when the wicket is turning. It doesn’t work for India, but for all the teams. It’s up to the ICC to take a call on this,” Patil, a former chairman of the national selection committee, said.

But at a time when Test cricket is struggling to attract spectators, won’t the new move work well?

“It all depends on how you are looking at it. Excitement is there in every season. How you look at it is important,” Patil said.

Focus on cricket

While addressing young cricketers, Patil also advised them to focus on the game and not get swayed by other temptations. “The game hasn’t changed at all from our times. It’s just that nowadays you have all sorts of creams (sunscreen) available, something that we didn’t. Nowadays we see even kids in Harris and Giles Shield putting on these creams. I would like to urge you to stop throwing tantrums,” he said.

“Don’t aspire to be a Hardik Pandya, instead try and follow into the footsteps of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajinkya Rahane, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. You may not like it but keep all your focus on the game and don’t get swayed by any other temptations,” the former national chief selector told the youngsters.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a3erhf/article30516636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09PATIL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/four-day-tests-sandeep-patil-critical-of-the-proposal/article30516637.ece
257,2020/01/08,Patil warns against a knee-jerk reaction,"It has been a nightmare season for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy. It lost to Railways and Karnataka and has six points from three games. Former India batsman Sandeep Patil, tells The Hindu that it’s time for the players to take responsibility. Excerpts…

What is wrong with Mumbai this season?

I am not involved with Mumbai cricket and so it’s difficult for me to pinpoint. You have to ask the CIC and the selection committee.

May be, it’s the effect of T20s. What I have heard is that they lack patience and cannot occupy the crease.

Shreyas Iyer and Shivam Dube did not play the last two games…

You mean to say, Sunil Gavaskar was available all the time? When Sunil was not available, Sudhir Naik led us to victory. Ashok Mankad led Mumbai to victory. You can’t give excuse that Ajinkya (Rahane) is not available or Shardul (Thakur) is not available… Mumbai has enormous bench strength, maybe, there’s something wrong with the selection, and the approach.

What should the players do for the remaining matches?

They should take responsibility. You can say that it’s a team game, but every individual should think that ‘I have to take responsibility and do my job’. Everybody is selected on the basis of certain numbers and are given a specific role. If you fail to do that, the result will be negative.

More responsibility should be taken by the players — not necessarily by the seniors, also by the juniors. When Dilip (Vengsarkar) and I started playing, we would look up to Mankad, Eknath Solkar, Gavaskar… We learnt from them. Mumbai losing two home matches is difficult to digest.

What’s the way forward?

There is a Mumbai spirit of fighting back. You can’t just say we had a bad game. You have to fight back. I want the Mumbai train to be back on track. Dhawal has been unfit for the last four-five years, same with Shardul. Other seamers are having the same problem. But knee-jerk reaction is not required.

258,2020/01/08,ICC cricket committee member Jayawardene feels Test cricket should be for five days,"ICC Cricket Committee member Mahela Jayawardene on Wednesday said Tests should remain a five-day affair even though the body he is a part of will discuss curtailing the format to four days in an upcoming meeting.

Former India captain Anil Kumble, who heads the cricket committee of the sport’s governing body, has said that the proposal will be discussed in the next round of the ICC meetings, to held in Dubai from March 27-31.

Jayawardene said he is personally against any change in the Test format.

“We will discuss it in the meeting in March, and I don’t know what will happen after that but my personal opinion is that it should remain five days. I would not want any change,” he told PTI.

The likes of Andrew Strauss, Rahul Dravid, and Shaun Pollock are also on the cricket committee.

Legendary England all-rounder Ian Botham has urged the ICC to leave Test cricket “alone” after England’s thrilling win against South Africa in the final hour of the fifth day.

“Well played England...Such a good idea to end 5day test cricket....full house watching cricket at its best !! Leave the flag ship of cricket alone it’s a real test of character, skill,guts,stamina & ability...it’s real cricket for real players !!! Leave it Alone !!!!!!,” Botham tweeted after Ben Stokes’ three-wicket burst on the final evening ensured a series levelling 189-run win for visitors.

The proposal, which has been floated for the 2023-2031 cycle, has not gone down well with the greats of the game, including Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting, opposing the idea.

However, member boards from England and Australia are open to the idea while BCCI boss Sourav Ganguly has said that “it is too early” to talk about it.

Ahead of the three-match T20 series opener against Sri Lanka in Guwahati last week, Kohli made his stance very clear on the subject.

Leading Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has termed the idea “ridiculous”.

More recently, Australian great Ponting expressed his disapproval of four-day Tests.

Among former players who want to see four-day Tests are Shane Warne, Mark Taylor and Michael Vaughan.

The ICC wants to try out four-day Tests primarily to free up space in the crowded calendar and use that time for the commercially lucrative shorter formats.

It is not a new phenomenon. England and Ireland played a four-day Test last year.

Boult was ruled out of the final Test between New Zealand and Australia after fracturing his right hand when he was struck on the gloves by a Mitchell Starc delivery and coach Gary Stead said the pacer was “touch-and-go to be available” for the Twenty20 series against India.

“Boult has been resting his broken right-hand and will return to bowling later this week,” Stead said in a statement on Wednesday.

“He’ll be touch-and-go to be available for the Indian T20 series later this month and we’ll continue to monitor him closely over the next few weeks,” he added.

“We’d like to commend Chris and the Thunder for the way they have approached this process with complete co-operation and respect,” Cricket Australia’s Head of Operations Peter Roach said in a statement posted on cricket.com.au.

“Chris undertook testing at the earliest possible time and satisfactorily replicated his bowling action in the controlled environment.

“We look forward to working with Chris in the coming months and conducting further testing once the suspension period has elapsed,” he added.

Green’s participation in the IPL would be subject to approval of the league’s governing council as his ban would still be in force when the event gets underway on March 29.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kkrs-new-signing-chris-green-banned-for-suspect-bowling-action-at-bbl/article30513358.ece
261,2020/01/08,"Kohli retains top spot; Rahane, Pujara slip in ICC Test rankings","India skipper Virat Kohli retained his top spot among batsmen while Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane slipped in the latest ICC Test rankings issued on Wednesday.

With 928 points, Kohli is way ahead of second-placed Australian maestro Steve Smith (911), the ICC said in a statement.

Pujara was placed sixth, down one rung, with 791 points, while Rahane occupied the ninth spot after slipping a couple of positions with 759 points.

In bowling, India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, returning from an injury layoff, remained static at sixth position with 794 points, while spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (772 points) and seamer Mohammed Shami (771) were ninth and 10th respectively.

Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne grabbed a career-best third place. The 25-year-old moved up one slot after scores of 215 and 59 in the final Test against New Zealand.

He was the highest scorer in the recently-concluded series with 549 runs, while his five previous Tests that include two at home against Pakistan, have seen him amass 896 runs.

Australian speedster Pat Cummins was at the top of the standings with 904 points ahead of Neil Wagner (852) and West Indies’ Jason Holder (830).

Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc equalled a career-best fifth position that he previously achieved in March 2018.

He finished with 15 wickets in the series that included four in Sydney. Spinner Nathan Lyon’s 10-wicket haul has helped him advance five places to joint-14th.

For New Zealand, all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme was a notable gainer. He moved from 47th to 39th among batsmen and from 36th to 34th among bowlers. Matt Henry has moved up three places to 66th among bowlers.

England all-rounder Ben Stokes has made it into the top 10 for batsmen for the second time in his career after scores of 47 and 72. He moved from 15th to 10th, while his best was ninth, achieved in November last year.

Dom Sibley’s maiden Test century has lifted him 87 places to 80th while fast bowler James Anderson’s record 28th five-wicket haul in the first innings sees him back in the top 10 for bowlers.

Opener Dean Elgar (up three places to 19th) and Aiden Markram (up one place to 22nd) among batsmen and Anrich Nortje (up 34 places to 62nd) are the notable gainers for South Africa.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/etqprl/article30390534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KINGSTON-KESAVAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-retains-top-spot-rahane-pujara-slip-in-icc-test-rankings/article30512126.ece
262,2020/01/08,Shedding pseudo-light on a non-problem,"On the one hand, Joe Root, Michael Vaughan, Shane Warne, Mark Taylor. On the other, Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Nathan Lyon, Ricky Ponting. The first lot supports four-day Test matches; the second opposes it.

Test cricket hasn’t always been played over five days, with 90 overs a day, six balls an over bowled over-arm. There have been timeless Tests, three-day and four-day Tests, four-ball and eight-ball overs. Wickets were once left uncovered. Bats have changed, the height of stumps has changed, the laws have been amended.

So why not give in to television, and administrators with dollar signs in their eyes? Someone has calculated that in the current eight-year cycle, 335 days would have been freed up if four-day Tests had been played.

To make it all sound cozy and generous, one official has said that it would mean cricketers get to spend more time with the family. No one believes him, though.

But the important question is: why fix it if it ain’t broke?

The only real issue here is financial: television wants more money while those hosting Tests which end in four days want to save the final day’s expenses. Television’s response is understandable – after all, they are in it to make money, but the International Cricket Council needs to remember that they are not in it to make profit, but to ensure the growth of the game and preserve its essence.

False debate

Four days versus five is a false debate. Gideon Haigh, quoting the Kingsley Amis character ‘Lucky Jim’ got it right when he said that it “merely sheds pseudo-light on a non-problem.” Ninety eight overs in a day when teams are struggling to bowl 90? Unlikely. A mere 58 overs lost overall? Come on! More matches per series? (what happened to rest and family time?).

The spinner will be denied a fifth-day wicket which seems like part a conspiracy to drive him out of the game. That alone should ensure the proposal is thrown out of the window when the ICC’s Cricket Committee sits down to discuss it.

In any case, bilateral Tests can be played over four days, as South Africa have done against Zimbabwe, or England against Ireland. It would be interesting to see if England and Australia play an Ashes Test over four days.

Many Tests end on the fourth day because there is a fifth day available. This is not as mystifying as it sounds. The extra day calls for changes in the approach. The fifth day’s 90 overs is not merely mathematical, it is psychological. The richness of the game reveals itself, as does the character of the players. This might be a romantic view, but what is sport without romance? Interestingly, players (especially current ones) are in favour of five days. And fans have no complaints.

Test cricket is a peculiar sport, and its charm lies in its peculiarity. Part of this lies in its duration, in the fact that teams break for tea, and in the manner it is a series of individual contests within the framework of an overall contest.

No other team sport has such sustained individual competition within itself. A team, to quote Mike Brearley, works by dint of differentiation. You need the attacking batsman, and the defensive one; you need the wicket-taking bowler, and the one who has a holding job. The range is wide, the possibility of surprises ever present.

Test cricket is not an extension of the white ball game, and it would be a shame to shorten it for mere financial reasons. Already the long innings, the grinding defence is becoming a thing of the past; the only current batsman to play over 500 deliveries in an innings is Cheteshwar Pujara (in the Ranchi Test against Australia a couple of years ago).

Test cricket must produce Test batsmen and Test bowlers, and the ICC is failing if it does not provide the proper challenge, and remains content with white ball players who do not have to work as hard with the fifth day off.

Results aren’t an issue

Results aren’t an issue. There have been fewer and fewer drawn Tests over the years – in the last decade over 80 percent of matches have produced results, as opposed to the 64 percent in the 1990s and 54 in the 1980s. The format is fine, leave it alone.

Perhaps when a team in the top half of the ICC rankings plays one in the bottom half, the Test can be of four days’ duration. Just a thought, it needs work.

The problem with Test cricket is not that it is played over five days, but that it is not being marketed well or made more competitive.

That’s a completely different debate; tinkering with the essence of the game is not the answer.

Still, with Kohli placing Test cricket above all, and five-day Tests at that, we know the direction the world’s best batsman wants to go in.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/70j1h6/article30506018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ENGKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/shedding-pseudo-light-on-a-non-problem/article30506020.ece
263,2020/01/08,Four-day Tests | Not everything is about money!,"Do not take away Test cricket’s soul!

Presently, the five-day format represents, perhaps, the toughest combination of a players’ physical and mental attributes and his skill-set.

As the match enters the fifth day, the teams face their most severe examination of mind and body apart from the natural deterioration of the pitch. This brings under the scanner a batsman’s footwork, balance, and the bowlers’ ability to exploit the rough and the cracks that develop over five days.

You want to take all that away just to suit commercial interests, seeking to squeeze in more lucrative ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals?

Not everything in the game is about money. Every game has a spirit and a soul and a Test is the purest form of cricket.

True, quite a few Tests end under four days in these times when shorter forms of the game have made inroads into the technique and mind-set required for the longer formats.

However, there have been Test classics that have thrown up explosive fifth-day finishes. There can be no greater example than the titanic India-Australia clash at the Eden Gardens in 2001.

The ICC, that could use the four-day Tests as part of its FTP from 2023 to 2031, plans to have 98 overs a day instead of the present 90.

Still with fewer overs and days, a draw becomes an increasing possibility. If the first two innings do not conclude by lunch on day three, a draw is the likely result, unlike in a five-day Test where there is more time and space to force the issue, not to forget the pitch’s wear and tear.

The spinners will take a hit.

For and against

Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar held a slightly different view. He told The Hindu, “I prefer five-day Tests but I am not vehemently against four-dayers. You see around 60 per cent of Tests these days are ending under four days in any case because of the influence of Twenty20 cricket. And the spinners will still have the moisture to exploit and there will be some help for them on days three and four.”

Meanwhile, legends such as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting are strongly opposed to the idea. So is off-spinning great Nathan Lyon.

There is nothing wrong with Tests in its present form. Do not tamper with it.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/k0e38r/article30496555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07TEST,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/four-day-tests-not-everything-is-about-money/article30496556.ece
264,2020/01/08,Dancer Baladevi Chandrashekar believes Bharatanatyam does not have to be diluted to be more popular,"“My aim is to present ancient texts from India across the world to a global audience. All my work has layered music with a multitude of artists collaborating with me,” says New Jersey-based Bharatanatyam exponent Baladevi Chandrashekar, who was in the city to launch her academy, Shree Padma Nrityam Academy of Performing Arts Inc. (SPNAPA), in Kakkanad. She also performed her production “Padmavathy, an avatar” at the academy.

A committed teacher of Bharatanatyam, she started her training under Guru Jayalakshmi Narayanan in Hyderabad. Baladevi then went on to learn under Dr Padma Subrahmanyam in Chennai, who awarded her the titles ‘Bharata Nritya Seva Mani’ and ‘Nrtyasali-completed the course in 108 Karanas’.

Baladevi has produced nine critically-acclaimed dance productions based on her extensive research. In a rare honour, the UNESCO head office in Paris hosted her production — “Brihadeeswara — form to formless, through the eyes of a Devaradiyal — a temple dancer” in 2018. This show is based on the 1,000-year-old Brihadeeswara temple.

Excerpts from an email interview:

Have you performed in Kerala before? Your Kerala connect.

I have presented one of my works “Karna—Destiny’s Child” at the Soorya Festival and Swaralaya in Palakkad. I believe that Kerala as a State is known for diversity and inclusiveness. All classical dance forms in India have their connection to the oldest treatise on dance, Natyasastra.

How would you describe your learning under Dr Padma Subramanyam?

Dr Padma Subrahmanyam, my revered guru, has been an inspiration to my individualistic dance style. My style is strongly backed by intense research and methodology from authentic texts and constant collaboration with senior gurus and scholars in this field.

As artistic director at the Bharatanatyam School in Princeton, what are the challenges you face? Could you tell us about the innovations that you have brought in?

I take great joy in developing an interest in our literature, dance and music among the younger generation. The challenge is to keep a sustained interest and I have been able to keep that interest alive both in my Academy and the universities that I have been engaged in teaching. Like my productions, I have constantly innovated with music, paper presentations, large exhibits on dance related subjects, seminars and live performances across diverse regions.

You have developed a new dance technique.

While I strictly follow the tradition of Bharatanatyam and the treatise on Natyashastra, I have devised a sound technique in imparting to students this valuable knowledge. All my productions have elaborate classical music detailing that will engage audiences across the world. While I present strictly margam format kutcheris, I also actively engage in solo, thematic productions in Bharatanatyam without compromising on the techniques which are operatic—Bhanika style. A strong grounding in the traditional margam is imperative for ongoing development. Two of my works “MLV favorites” and “Krishnarpanam” are based on the margam format.

You talk about the relationship between ancient temple architecture and Bharatanatyam. Please elaborate

All my dance choreography, along with basic units of adavus and technique, incorporates the core components of the 108 karanas, which are temple sculptures.

The state of Bharatanatyam in USA?

The state of Bharatanatyam is mature in the USA since there are well equipped gurus and enthusiastic parents who are willing to invest time to learn this ancient art form to ensure its beauty and vibrancy. We do not have to dilute the art form to make it any more popular.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/baladevi-chandrashekar-has-launched-her-dance-academy-in-kochi/article30513374.ece

Not only was there more rainfall in the district in 2019 but also more rain days as the 50 years’ average was only 46 rain days, Mr. Ramanathan said.

The excess rainfall that the district had received was both during the South West and North East monsoon seasons. It had received 98.1mm in excess of the 50 years' average during the SW Monsoon season – an increase of 46.7% and 145mm in excess of the 50 years' average during the NE Monsoon season – an increase of 47.5%.

The figures for the last year was also better than the last 10 years’ average, he said and pointed out that the rainfall received in the last SW Monsoon season was the highest in the decade. And, the NE Monsoon rainfall was the third highest for the period.

The maximum NE Monsoon rainfall was in 2011 – 560mm and the second highest was 502.5mm in 2010.

275,2020/01/08,CMCH introduces new system for patients’ safety,"Being the largest tertiary level healthcare facility in the region, Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) is also a place where large number of people come.

Handling about 7,000 outpatients and around 2,000 in-patients a day, it is also a tough task for the administration to control visitors who accompany patients or come for other purposes.

Though the hospital is having a police aid post, surveillance camera network and security guards at most places, fraudsters cheating patients or attenders and stealing money, valuables, vehicles and gadgets like mobile phone remains unabated.

Last week, the Race Course police arrested M. Krishnakumar (43) from Sundarapuram who cheated a 76-year-old woman patient of her 7.5-sovereign jewellery, ₹ 200 and a mobile phone on the pretext of arranging her government aid for treatment.

The woman complained to the police that the accused took her to a place where she was made to wait to meet an official.

The man had collected jewellery, money and the phone from the woman, telling her that the authorities who sanction the government aid may reject the application if they see the jewellery.

Though he escaped with the valuables and money, the police managed to arrest him.

According to CMCH Dean B. Asokan, the hospital administration had also received complaints about persons cheating patients of their jewellery and money on the pretext of helping them get X-ray and CT scan done without much delay.

Such fraudsters had posed as hospital staff or persons having influence in the hospital to ‘speed up’ procedures and get special attention for patients.

Some of them reportedly collected jewellery from patients before they entered the scanning room.

Dr. Asokan also added that the hospital had also received complaints about persons who posed as helpers at mortuary to get money from the relatives of deceased after autopsy.

After several such instances, CMCH has now introduced temporary identification card for the attenders of in-patients. Under the new system, such cards will be issued to two attenders of an in-patient.

This prevents entry of unknown persons to various wards of the 2,300-bedded hospital.

An attenders card will have details of the attender and the patient under treatment at the hospital. The hospital will issue two attenders cards when a patient is admitted to the hospital. Nursing staff or security persons in charge of each ward will allow attenders to visit patients only if they have the card.

They will also cross check the serial number of the card and details of the patient with the details available in the registry at the ward.

Medical Superintendent T. Sadagopan said the initiative would help keep antisocial elements away from the hospital.

“The cards are printed in three colours. Pink colour card is given to attenders of patients who undergo treatment in Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and New born Care ward and labour ward where women and children undergo treatment. While attenders of patients admitted to the centenary building comprising various wards are given green colour card, blue colour card is given to attenders of patients who undergo treatment in wards for surgery and medicine paediatrics,” he said.

According to the police, theft of money, mobile phone, jewellery, vehicle, attention diversion and cheating were among cases largely reported from CMCH.

Dr. Asokan said that the hospital administration had also instructed all the staff to wear their identification card during duty hours.

“We have also instructed the staff to follow their respective dress code when at work,” he said.

He said the hospital was bearing the expense of printing the attenders card and the hospital would welcome sponsors for the card.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/jnvaq2/article30507206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB08IDENTIFICATIONCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cmch-introduces-new-system-for-patients-safety/article30507207.ece

278,2020/01/08,Protest against efforts to eliminate use of toxic pesticides,"Hundreds of people belonging to farmers’ associations in the Nilgiris staged a protest in Udhagamandalam town on Tuesday against the efforts taken by the Horticulture Department and the District Administration to eliminate the use of toxic pesticides that are blamed for the high incidence of cancer, lung and kidney diseases among the farmers and residents in the district.

As part of the government’s campaign over the last few years to turn the Nilgiris into an “organic district”, many farmers have been encouraged to take up organic farming. Efforts are on to gradually phase out the use of toxic red and yellow-labelled pesticides that are said to pose diseases threat.

At Tuesday’s protest, associations that claimed to represent the interests of thousands of farmers across the district, said the crackdown on toxic pesticides would lead to the loss of livelihood for landowners, cultivators and daily wage workers. Shops in the Ooty Municipal Market were also closed in support of the protest.

Support for ban

At the same time, a number of farmers’ associations and farm workers, who are most exposed to the toxic pesticides, voiced their support for the district administration’s decision to ban the toxic pesticides.

H.N. Sivan, founder-president of the Nilgiris Nelikolu Micro and Small Tea Growers and Farmers’ Development Society (NSTF), said in a statement that his organisation fully supported the district administration’s efforts to promote organic farming.

281,2020/01/08,JNU violence: Delhi University students come out in support of JNU students,"Thousands of Delhi University students took to the streets on Wednesday in support of JNU students and teachers, who were brutally beaten by masked attackers on Sunday, and also demanded the scrapping of the CAA-NRC-NPR regime.

As demands for bringing the masked perpetrators to justice continued, the stand-off in JNU is expected to continue with the Central government showing no indication of removing Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar from the post as demanded by students.

Registration extended

A government statement claimed that “about 3,300 students” had registered for the upcoming winter semester, which is less than half of JNU’s total strength of 8,700 students. The date by which students can register has been extended till January 12 even as no exams have been held for the semester gone by.

The Delhi police continued to treat Sunday’s attack as a “clash” between two student groups, prompting JNUSU to tweet, “For the last time, what happened on Sunday night was no ‘clash’. It was a brutal attack, an assault, an act of terrorism on students and teachers assembled for a peace march. Such wording only goes on to obfuscate facts and distort the truth.” Till Wednesday night, the Delhi police had not identified any of the masked attackers or make any arrests. A police official told The Hindu that a total of 11 complaints had been received — seven “from the Left” and three from ABVP — but no fresh FIRs had been registered.

Aishe’s complaint

In her complaint, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, who suffered grievous head injuries, stated that she had been attacked by a mob of 20-30 persons, who used filthy language about her.

Ms. Ghosh said that she was hit on the head multiple times with iron rods. “I fell to the ground and my head started bleeding, and some of them kicked me and hit me with the rod on my hand and…head, chest and back.”

Ms. Ghosh said the ambulance carrying her and other students was not allowed to exit from the main (north) gate, which was totally blocked.

Ritu Raj, SHO Vasant Kunj North police station, along with 30-40 police personnel were present at the gate along with a number of goons and persons affiliated to the ABVP.

The JNUSU president said she came out of the ambulance to plead with the people to allow the vehicle to exit, but was abused by ABVP activist Onkar Srivastava, who also justified the attack on her.

“With great anguish and pain, I have to write that there were police personnel standing at the main gate but they remained mute spectators…eventually we were forced to…take the longer route to go through the east gate of JNU to reach AIIMS,” Ms. Ghosh’s complaint to the police added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8bxjub/article30516431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9TH-JNUSUPPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-violence-delhi-university-students-come-out-in-support-of-jnu-students/article30516432.ece

Talking about the violence in JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia, he said: “I am too worried. The way violence is happening in universities, that is not good. Children go to university to study… The way students were attacked inside Jamia and the violence that happened in JNU, I am very worried.”

287,2020/01/08,Cong. asks whether Tiwari decided poll date; ECI refutes allegation,"Over two weeks before the Election Commission of India on Monday announced that the Delhi Assembly elections would be held on February 8, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari told a television channel on December 18 that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party’s fate would be known on February 8. After the Congress on Monday questioned whether Mr. Tiwari decided the election date, the ECI on Tuesday termed the allegation incorrect.

Sharing a video clip of Mr. Tiwari speaking at the News 18 Chaupal event, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet on Monday night: “The nation knows CBI, ED, DRI, CBDT and Income Tax are permanent allies of Modi-Shah duo! Has ECI joined the bandwagon with Manoj Tiwari? Delhi wants to know – Delhi polling dates were decided by ECI or in advance by Manoj Tiwari? Tiwari decides, ECI stamps?.”

Video clip

In the video, Mr. Tiwari responds to a question about Mr. Kejriwal by saying: “Whether or not he is dabang [fearless], we will find out on February 8.” Asked by the anchor how he knew the date when elections had not been announced, Mr. Tiwari said the 2015 Assembly elections were on February 7. “If not February 8, it will happen on February 14,” he said.

When asked whether any complaint had been received in the matter and for comment on Mr. Surjewala’s allegation, an ECI spokesperson said: “No complaint received by ECI. Such averments are factually incorrect.”

Tiwari’s response

On his part, Mr. Tiwari rejected the allegation.

“This is an attempt to spread misconception among the people. What I said was that the result would be out on February 8 – but I have clearly been proved wrong since the results will be out on February 11. What was said was based on the dates of the previous elections.

All government departments have been instructed to take down political posters and images of political leaders from their websites and social media accounts within 24 hours, the CEO said.

All five urban local bodies of the city have also been instructed to enforce these provisions which primarily deal with enforcement of the anti-defacement law, the CEO said. This includes ensuring all such defacement is removed from private property as well within 72 hours. The MCC also provides that no new development work must be started and that government vehicles and other resources are not misused, the CEO added.

At a meeting of all political parties held on Tuesday, provisions of the MCC were conveyed and the process of Media Certification and Monitoring Cell (MCMC) were also explained. So far, two complaints on violations of the MCC had been received from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over certain television programmes, the CEO said.

In a first, the CEO said that persons with disabilities flagged on the electoral roll and senior citizens above the age of 80 across Delhi will have the facility to cast their vote as “Absentee Voters”. Such voters would have to file their applications with the respective returning officer within five days from the notification of the election on January 14. Between January 14 and January 19, special teams will be constituted to go door-to-door and facilitate the process, the CEO said.

Digital voter slip

Apart from this, at 11 constituencies in Delhi, voters will also have the facility to use a digital voter slip, the CEO said. At such polling stations, mobile phones will be allowed inside the booth for the QR code on the digital slip to be scanned following which phones will have to be deposited in a tray before the vote is cast and can be picked up later, he added.

Commenting on the impact of violent clashes during the election process, Mr. Singh said that there was no reason to believe that the law and order situation in Delhi was not conducive to carry out elections. He added that the police would keep a check on the same and would make provisions to ensure safety.

290,2020/01/08,"No need for binoculars, just look up to find CCTVs: AAP","The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday attacked the BJP over Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that the latter couldn’t spot CCTV cameras in Delhi and showed footages of Mr. Shah from government-installed CCTV cameras in Lajpat Nagar.

“You don’t need binoculars, when you are doing door-to-door [election campaigning], just look up, you can see them at 10 feet height,” AAP leader Manish Sisodia said during a press conference, after showing footage of Mr. Shah from the CCTV.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party is now nothing but a ‘Bharatiya Jumla Party’, and one that now believes that all other political parties make false promises like they do. We want to remind the Bharatiya Janata Party and Amit Shah that Delhi has a government that actually does real work that impacts and transform the lives of the citizens,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Mr. Shah has been repeatedly asking about the CCTV cameras since the last two or three days, the AAP said.

“In the very same locality of Lajpat Nagar where he had conducted door-to-door campaigning two days ago, 16 cameras were installed by the AAP government. In fact, right opposite the house where he had gone to meet voters, there was a CCTV camera,” Mr. Sisodia said.

He also said that the Delhi government has fulfilled its 2015 manifesto promise of installing CCTV cameras in buses and public spaces.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-need-for-binoculars-just-look-up-to-find-cctvs-aap/article30507535.ece
291,2020/01/08,BJP undertakes public outreach programme in support of CAA,"Senior leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, on Tuesday undertook a public outreach programme on the amended Citizenship Act (CAA) here.

While Mr. Javadekar sought to apprise citizens of the CAA at Madrasi Camp in Moti Bagh, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel and Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai took out a peace march from Sadar Bazar to Jama Masjid in support of the CAA.

False propaganda

“The CAA is for providing citizenship to the refugees and not depriving any person of it. People of all religious communities live in Madrasi Camp and I feel very happy talking to them because I found that they have no misconception about it. But some people are deliberately creating misconception and false propaganda in the society,” Mr. Javadekar said.

“Those spreading rumours regarding CAA are not the well wishers of the country...130 crore people of the country are welcoming the citizenship law because this law does not affect any citizens born in India. Yet some people are trying to create confusion among the people but they will not succeed,” he said further.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-undertakes-public-outreach-programme-in-support-of-caa/article30507534.ece
292,2020/01/08,Focus on food security in manifestos: Delhiites,"A day after the Delhi Assembly elections’ schedule was announced, women, residents of slums, homeless people and Delhiites from different backgrounds gathered on Tuesday to demand all political parties to focus on food security while drafting their manifestos.

At a public meeting organised by the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, residents from across the Capital narrated their experience with availing of ration, pension and other government services.

Ramwati, a resident of Mangolpuri, said about 50 applicants in her neighbourhood had been awaiting information about the pension scheme forms they had filled in June, but there had been no update from the government.

Quality of ration

Noor Jahan, a resident of Begumpur, said the quality of ration received through the public distribution system was poor. “At the time of voting, they [political parties] promise all kinds of things, but after the elections, it all stops,” she said.

Kamlesh, a resident of Janta Mazdoor Colony, said she had applied to add names to her family’s ration card in 2016, but there had been no progress.

With several speakers complaining of the pending ration card applications, Anjali Bhardwaj of the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, said while the Centre decides the amount of ration and funds to be allocated to the PDS, the Delhi government could give funds from its own budget to expand the PDS benefits.

At the end of the meeting, the Delhiites gathered there demanded that the political parties promise they will provide pulses, oil and sugar at subsidised rates to all food security cardholders, enhance the coverage of food security to include the homeless, transgenders and migrant workers and end the quota system in PDS. Representatives from the Aam Aadmi Party, the Congress and Swaraj India were present, while no one from the BJP attended, a statement from the Abhiyan said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/focus-on-food-security-in-manifestos-delhiites/article30507526.ece
293,2020/01/08,It breaks my heart to see JNU go down this way: Prof. Sucharita Sen,"Nursing her head injury while sitting at her friend’s house in south Delhi on Tuesday, Professor Sucharita Sen, who has become one of the faces of the violent attack that took place inside Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on January 5, said that the “regime (JNU administration) had completely disconnected with the students and teachers”.

“For the first time, there is a regime (JNU administration and Vice-Chancellor) which has no relationship with the students and teachers. I do not think that the V-C, today, can turn around and say that these are my students and my teachers. It breaks my heart to see JNU going down this way,” she said, adding that there have been V-Cs with whom teachers and students have disagreed and dissented, but there was never a lack of communication.

No security

Recalling the day of the attack, Ms. Sen said she noticed something unusual — the absence of security from the peace meeting on Sunday. The professor said that whenever there has been a call for any gathering, there are security officials around, but on Sunday “I did not see any, which was strange”.

Due to scuffles on campus over the past few days, the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) had called for a peace meeting on Sunday evening where they advised students to not indulge in violence. While the meeting was under way, a student came and informed Ms. Sen that a large group of people wearing masks and carrying sticks had entered the campus from the main gate and was coming towards Sabarmati T-Point where the meeting was taking place.

Ms. Sen’s colleague Amit Thorat then took his bicycle and went to check. A while later, he came back running and told them that he had been thrashed by the mob and had to leave his bicycle behind. “We decided to form a human chain... the women came forward thinking that the group would not attack women. We had thought that group would show some respect for teachers. But I now realise that this thought process does not apply to them because they did not want to scare anyone... the attack was murderous”.

As the violence ensued, Ms. Sen was attacked with a stone that she said was about half the size of a brick.

A student on a two-wheeler and a colleague came to her assistance and tried to get her to a hospital but they were stopped at the university’s main gate.

“There were police on one side and a very aggressive group on the other. I was unable to register much but the student I was with kept arguing with the aggressive group to let us leave but we were not allowed to do so. The police did not intervene and kept watching. This is not the kind of police I want my country to have. They didn’t even facilitate the movement,” she said.

Ms. Sen was then taken to the health centre on campus and was later shifted to a hospital in her blood-soaked clothes.

The professor came to the university as a Master’s student in 1984 and started teaching in 1997.

“JNU taught me what it means to be an Indian as the university is a microcosm of India with people from varying backgrounds. It teaches me and I am sure others too that there is no one way of living, there are 100 valid ways,” she said.

She admitted that the university has been changing in significant ways and that the democratic structure of the institution was crumbling.

The kind of violence seen on Sunday was unthinkable, she said, adding: “Three years ago, we didn’t even know ‘V’ of violence. There were strikes, dissent and protests but no violence. I’ll forgive them for thrashing me but I’ll never forgive them for turning my university – a safe space – into a space of terror”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7kgnhh/article30508886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sucharita-sencol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/it-breaks-my-heart-to-see-jnu-go-down-this-way/article30507508.ece
294,2020/01/08,"Nearly 48 hours after attack on JNU students, V-C dodges tough questions","Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar on Tuesday faced a volley of questions from reporters on how a large number of masked visitors managed to unleash violence at the university on January 5. The V-C said that were many versions about how the people with weapons got onto campus, and that the police were investigating the matter.

“Let the police investigate, let the facts come to the front and then we will know what exactly happened. We must not add additional versions to what is going around and cause further confusion,” said Mr. Kumar.

The V-C said that a security committee will be formed to find the facts behind the incident, but did not give a timeline for when the report would be tabled. “Let the committee work and come out with the facts instead of pressurising them,” he said.

‘Campus is secure’

On a question regarding immediate steps that the JNU administration will take to ensure students feel safe as various probes take place, the V-C said: “We had a meeting with the wardens, provost and the hostel administration... we will do whatever we need to do so that security is provided. We are repairing damaged hostel property to make them safe... we are also requesting all students to come back.”

“Our heart goes out to all injured students. The incident (violence) is unfortunate. I would like to tell students that JNU campus is a secure place. I urge all students to come back to the campus. Let us put the past behind,” the V-C said.

Commenting on the university’s statements after the incident, which suggested that the people behind the violent attack were students who were protesting against the fee hike, Mr Kumar said that on January 3, students with masks had attacked JNU’s server rooms to derail the registration process.

“These masked students damaged the data centre to prevent hundreds of students from registering and had a clear intent to stop the academic functioning of the university,” he said, adding that the investigation would tell whether the same students were behind the January 5 violence.

He added that since registration for the new semester reopened on Tuesday, over 2,800 students had paid their hostel fee, “which shows that students want to resume their academic life”.

Reacting to allegations that he had not reached out personally to injured students and faculty members, the V-C said that several administration officials had contacted students and staff.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/uvg2vo/article30507416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8TH-VC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nearly-48-hours-after-attack-on-jnu-students-v-c-dodges-tough-questions/article30507417.ece
295,2020/01/08,BJP wants to make JNU an election issue: Kanhaiya,"Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar alleged that the January 5 attack on the university was an attempt to create an election issue for the BJP as it did not have much work to show or a chief ministerial face to project ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.

“It has been four years since the February 9 incident in JNU and they did not manage to prove anything. Now, just ahead of the Assembly elections, Home Minister Amit Shah brought up the issue on Monday at a public event as he wants to make JNU an election issue by defaming it and divert attention from the real issues,” Mr. Kumar said. A sedition case has been filed against Mr. Kumar and others for slogans raised on the campus during an event on February 9, 2016, against the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.

Mr. Kumar was speaking at a meeting organised by the JNUSU and the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) that took place on campus after a solidarity march taken out by JNU alumni.

Several other alumni of the university spoke at the public meeting. Former JNUSU chief and CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yetchury said that he headed the union during the Emergency and at that time also the fight was in defence of democracy and the Constitution. He alleged that on the night of the attack, he visited AIIMS where BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi and other senior BJP leaders were ensuring that some members of the ABVP were admitted to the hospital so that they could say that the violence happened on both sides.

“I salute the doctors at AIIMS who did not succumb to such pressure and treated those who really needed medical care,” Mr. Yechury said, while encouraging the students to keep their struggle alive. “It is an extreme form of patriotism to defend the Constitution... if there is anybody who is anti-national, it is the government.”

“Modi-Shah duo, please remember that JNU students sent back Indira Gandhi during the Emergency and did not let her enter campus and ensured that she was defeated in the elections soon after due to the students’ movement. We can do it to you as well,” Mr. Yechury said.

AIPWA secretary Kavita Krishnan said that the Delhi Police is quick to lathi charge JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia students but provide safe passage to masked attackers.

D. Raja, Yogendra Yadav, Bezwada Wilson and Sharmishta Mukherjee also spoke at the event and said that the attack on JNU students was an attack on the minds of reason and critical thinking.

296,2020/01/08,Kherki Daula toll plaza traffic shifts to alternative route due to congestion,"In the wake of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways order for dedicated FASTag lanes at all National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) tolls from December 15 last year, a sizeable chunk of traffic at Kherki Daula toll plaza here has shifted to an alternative road connecting the Southern Peripheral Expressway to the Delhi-Jaipur Highway, opposite Hyatt Regency Hotel.

Though the 5-km road passing through Sector 77 has been in use for the past six months, the traffic has suddenly increased on this stretch over the past few weeks due to congestion and long waiting time at the toll plaza. The commuters also save the toll fees into the bargain.

Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) toll operation assistant manager Mohammad Sohrab Khan told The Hindu that the traffic at the toll has gone drastically down from 80,000 vehicles per day earlier to around 65,000. He said the heavy traffic mostly had diverted to the new route, causing revenue loss to the company.

Legal aspects

He said the MCEPL was looking into the legal aspects of the matter since the agreement did not allow construction of an alternative road within 2-3 km of the toll plaza. Losses incurred would be claimed from the agency responsible for the construction of the road, he added.

Ajit Singh, a vendor, said the traffic had increased 20-30% over the past few weeks and traffic snarls were seen in the evening at the T-point connecting the road to the Delhi-Jaipur Highway service road. “Suddenly the road has become busy. More private and commercial vehicles have started plying on the stretch,” he said.

The traffic on the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway of the highway — mostly private vehicles from group housing societies along the Dwarka Expressway — take right from the U-turn cut, about 400 m before the toll plaza, blocking the traffic on the adjoining carriageway to reach the service road on the opposite side. The motorists then drive another 200 m on the service road to turn left on the road connecting to the SPR.

Though the statistics for December indicate an increase of around 20% in FASTag users in a month’s time, Mr. Khan said, still 50% of the users paid through cash and there was not much improvement in the traffic situation at the toll. “The real picture would emerge in the second week of January after the automotive companies open again after the routine shutdown and the regular commuters to IMT Manesar return to work,” said Mr. Khan.

He said there was also a possibility of FASTag users going back to the cash payment mode and it was, thus, at a meeting with the NHAI officials, a decision to begin charging penalty from the cash users entering the FASTag lanes was taken. “Since the tag users may find it inconvenient to frequently recharge their tags and most are not comfortable using technology, they might go back to cash payment mode if we do not penalise the cash users,” said Mr. Khan.

Though eight lanes on Jaipur-Delhi carriageway and 11 lanes on Delhi-Jaipur carriageway were declared as dedicated FASTag lanes on December 15, all the toll lanes, except one on each side, would be operated as FASTag lanes from January 15. The trial for one only-cash lane on each side, i.e. Lane No.22 (heading to Delhi) and Lane no.28 (heading to Jaipur), will start on January 8.

“All the users under the exemption category will be allowed free passage on the production of a valid document to authenticate their exemption. However, they are also advised to get the exempted tag fitted on their vehicle as per the standard operation procedure of MoRTH,” said NHAI Project Director (Gurugram) Ashok Sharma.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/e889sh/article30507405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07TOLLPLAZA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kherki-daula-toll-plaza-traffic-shifts-to-alternative-route-due-to-congestion/article30507406.ece

While persuing a report furnished by the apex pollution monitoring body, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson observed that the data was insufficient and that information pertaining to sewage generation and treatment reflected a gap. “Grading made by the CPCB into “good”, “average”, “poor” and “no information” is not based on any qualitative analysis but the extent of information furnished,” it said. With regard to the restoration of 351 polluted river stretches, the NGT directed the State governments to provide information on the in-situ and ex-situ remediation.

The Tribunal added: “Chief Secretaries need to monitor and compile information on the subject of execution of action plans for containment of air pollution in 122 cities where air quality is not within permissible limits.” The NGT also sought information on the quantity of municipal solid waste generated, segregated and treated along with data on the quantity of legacy waste.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/give-information-on-air-quality-management-ngt-tells-states/article30507393.ece
299,2020/01/08,Green tribunal seeks report on sewage overflowing on NH-19,"The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board and Faridabad District Magistrate to furnish a factual and action taken report on sewage overflowing on the Delhi-Agra Highway.

Taking cognisance of a report published by The Hindu on safety concerns being raised due to the overflowing sewage on National Highway-19, a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed authorities to furnish the report within one month.

The Bench said: “The news report gives rise to a substantial question of the environment which may call for the intervention of this Tribunal. The situation may need to be remedied forthwith in the interest of the environment and public health.”

The Hindu on January 6 had highlighted how sewage from the Seekri village was overflowing onto a service road for the last six months and had become a major cause of hindrance to locals and motorists.

The locals had complained of foul smell and water-borne diseases resulting from the sewage.

They had also raised concerns about accidents being caused due to the water logging in the area.

The green panel noted: “The flooded road hampers the movement of vehicles, emits a foul smell, causes water-borne diseases and accidents on the highway. Pipeline and drains get frequently choked due to dumping of garbage in the open drain, leading to overflowing of sewage to the service road.”

An egg-stall owner, Prahlad, had said: “A portion of the road is damaged due to waterlogging and a truck overturned a month ago. The highway authorities then closed the right turn to the road passing through Seekri and connecting a dozen villages.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qfnr6e/article30507389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07FLOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/green-tribunal-seeks-report-on-sewage-overflowing-on-nh-19/article30507390.ece
300,2020/01/08,Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal welcomes verdict in Nirbhaya rape and murder case,"The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday welcomed the Delhi court’s verdict on the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

“Today, a long term wish of the people of Delhi has been fulfilled. I think, the others will also learn that people who misbehave with women will not be spared,” said AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal while addressing the seventh town hall meeting, a part of the party’s election campaign.

The meeting was organised by AAP and anchored by Aaj Tak. During the meeting, senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said: “I am happy that the efforts of their lawyers, family, friends and activists have paid off. The court took a decision, for which people of the country have been waiting for a long time.”

Mr. Kejriwal tweeted: “There is some sense of satisfaction after the issuance of death warrants against the convicts in the Nirbhaya case. It took seven years. This system will have to change. Such a system must be put in place, which ensures that the rapist is hanged within six months.”

Terming the verdict “justice to all Nirbhayas”, Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal on Tuesday said: “Even though it has taken a long time, the verdict is a win for all the Nirbhayas of the country.”

When asked whether the death penalty handed will act as a deterrent, she told The Hindu, “It will of course act as a deterrent in future as the hanging of the convicts will send out a strong message. Up until now, perpetrators were under the impression that there is no grave consequences to such heinous crimes. However, now with this judgment, it will be proved that justice will be brought in each case henceforth.”

Ms. Maliwal, who had gone on an indefinite hunger strike last December as well, demanding the death penalty for rape convicts maintained that such verdicts should be meted out within six months of the crime and “not wait for seven years”.

“I appeal to the Centre to ensure that in the future, the death penalty should be awarded within six months so that justice is provided swiftly. It has to be guaranteed that perpetrators will be punished at the earliest,” she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/syncw9/article30507385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07NIRBHAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/chief-minister-welcomes-verdict/article30507386.ece

The Crime Branch, which has been tasked with carrying out an investigation into the incident, appealed to eyewitnesses and people who have information or captured any activity on their mobile phones or cameras to share the information with the Special Investigation Team.

A senior police officer said that they have decided not to call anyone to the police station and will record statements and collect evidence at JNU’s Administration Block, which is considered to be a “neutral place”. The exercise will continue for seven days starting Wednesday. The officer said they will speak to the injured students and teachers first.

The officer said that the Crime Branch is investigating three First Information Reports registered in connection with incidents on January 3, 4 and 5.

While two FIRs registered in connection with January 3 and 4 are based on complaints by the JNU Administration and have named the accused, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh; the third FIR registered for Sunday’s attack is based on an Inspector’s complaint.

“The strategy is to speak to injured students and teachers first. We have been able to speak to some of them and we are waiting for others to return... many of them had left after the incident,” the officer said.

The association also asked President Ram Nath Kovind to visit the JNU campus and assure the students and teachers that there would be an atmosphere of free teaching.

In the two-page letter, the teachers demanded that an inquiry be held to find administrative and security lapses, and “fix responsibility for the violence and terror on JNU premises”.

The letter further said that the absence of any action by JNU security or the police to stop the violence, despite being informed of it, brought the role and intention of the JNU administration under doubt.

Quoting former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that a university stood “for tolerance, for reason, for the adventure of ideas and for the search of truth”, the letter said that what happened on January 5 juxtaposed this vision.

‘Reign of terror’

“Fierce debate on local and global issues among the students, and slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’, ‘Aazaadi’ and social justice resonating in the atmosphere, and songs and theatre reflecting the dream of a just society, are identifiers of the ‘normal’ JNU life, but on January 5 this life was eclipsed by the horrible reign of terror,” read the letter.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-teachers-ask-president-to-visit-jnu/article30507358.ece

305,2020/01/08,"Get ready with poll arrangements, CS tells Collectors","Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has directed the district Collectors to make necessary arrangements for peaceful conduct of the ensuing elections to municipalities and municipal corporations.

The officials should complete the arrangements as per the time line and be prepared for holding the polls as per the schedule fixed by the State Election Commission. He wanted the Collectors to focus on every aspect, including allotment of staff, printing of ballot papers and procurement of ballot boxes for the elections being held in highest number of ULBs.

Mr. Somesh Kumar conducted a video conference with Collectors and other senior officials to review the election preparedness at the field-level on Wednesday. He was particular that the Collectors of Ranga Reddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Mancherial, Sangareddy and Nalgonda districts be extra cautious owing to high number of ULBs under their purview that are going to polls.

The focus should be equally on the new municipalities that are going to polls. The Collectors were advised to prepare a calendar of activities for each day and they were directed to deal carefully with the rejected nominations. The Collectors have a crucial role in the conduct of the elections and they should therefore involve themselves fully in the process, he said.

Municipal Administration Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar said the Collectors should be in close liaison with the municipal commissioners in all the stages of the polls. The district Collectors should set up monitoring systems in their respective areas and send reports to the State Election Commission on a regular basis about the activities undertaken by them.

The officers drafted for poll duties should not be allowed to go on leave and the department would not tolerate unauthorised absence of any of these officers.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/obs8ek/article30517264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09NALGONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/get-ready-with-poll-arrangements-cs-tells-collectors/article30517265.ece

The Minister expressed these views when Member of Parliament from New Zealand, Priyanca Radhakrishnan, called on him on Wednesday.

The Minister informed her of the government promoted T-Bridge, an initiative that helped connect local startups with global market opportunities, and said efforts would be made to work with New Zealand based start-ups. Talking about the IT sector in the State, he said Telangana was leading the country in the startup and innovation sector. He highlighted T-Hub and We Hub, which encouraged and mentored start-ups in the State. He also spoke about the government’s ambitious project T Hub 2, world’s largest start-up incubator.

KTR also discussed the investment opportunities for industries and educational sectors in Telangana. Among a host of issues discussed were possibilities of mutual cooperation in Agritech, start-up and innovation sectors.

The Minister stated that the Telangana government had been giving top priority to the agricultural and irrigation sectors. This had led to an increase in crop production, giving a large scope for the agritech and food processing industry.

He also praised the works of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and said the country was fast progressing under her leadership. Ms. Priyanca Radhakrishnan invited KTR to New Zealand and assured that she would organise a formal meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister.

311,2020/01/08,"₹2,500-cr. term loan only for ongoing projects","Several components of the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP), for which tenders have been finalised, may have to wait more for grounding, even after sanction of ₹2,500-crore term loan.

This is despite the fact that the corporation has listed all these components in the loan document.

Officials are calculating that the bounty of term loan sanctioned recently by the State Bank of India, will merely suffice completion of ongoing projects.

“We are focussing on the projects in progress as of now. The term loan will help us sail through,” says a senior official of the GHMC.

GHMC has listed a total of 24 components as part of the SRDP in its loan document, which require a total of ₹6,000 crore loan for completion. Of this, up to ₹1,500 crore is required for property acquisition alone. However, only ₹2,500 crore has been sanctioned for all the project components put together, officials say.

Of this, about ₹250 crore to ₹350 crore is scheduled to be paid for property acquisition alone, before March-end. Already cheques for ₹140 crore have been kept ready for payment with regard to the ongoing projects, officials said.

There are several works in various stages of progress, which include the flyovers at L.B.Nagar junction, Biodiversity junction, Road No. 45, Shaikpet, Kothaguda, Bahadurpura and Owaisi Hospital junction, Durgam Cheruvu cable-stayed bridge, and the Road-Under-Bridges (RUBs) at Uppuguda, and Tukaram Gate. Besides, land acquisition is GHMC’s responsibility for R&B projects such as the flyovers at Amberpet, and Uppal.

Agencies have been finalised for a few more projects such as the flyovers planned between Rethibowli and Nanal Nagar, between Shilpa Layout and Gachibowli Junction, and between Aramghar and Zoo Park. However, so far, agreements have not been entered into with contracting agencies, as fund availability is a limiting factor.

Besides, a few projects like the steel bridges proposed near Nalgonda Crossroads and VST ran into rough weather, due to Vigilance & Enforcement notices about excess quotation.

GHMC officials, in their defence, say that 5% excess is permitted as per the government orders. As few contractors are coming forth for carrying out urban civic projects, excess between 2% and 5% was recommended for various components of SRDP, and was also cleared by government before it was objected to by the Vigilance wing.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2500-cr-term-loan-only-for-ongoing-projects/article30516412.ece

Senior leaders including former Ministers M.V. Mysura Reddy, S. Sailajanath and R. Chenga Reddy, former DGPs Anjaneya Reddy and V. Dinesh Reddy and others lamented that the high power committee had only three members from Rayalaseema while all others were from Andhra region. They wanted the committee to take into account the sacrifices made in the past by the people of Rayalaseema for the unity of Telugu people and accordingly, recommend the location of the capital in the region as the issue had become a sentiment for the people.

They recalled how the people agreed to shift the capital from Kurnool after formation of Andhra Pradesh as linguistic State as also surrendering 80,000 acres land to facilitate construction of the Srisailam project which had been key source for water and power supply to the erstwhile united State. “The committees headed by G.N.

314,2020/01/08,Hyderabad police in a Twitter row over response to tweet on ‘jihadis’,"The Cyberabad Police found themselves embroiled in a controversy after their Twitter handle responded to a tweet of a Twitter user who claimed that there were several ‘wannabe jihadis’ working for software companies in the city. He sought to know whether police have done background checks of such employees.

In a series of tweets, the Twitter user, one Suresh Kochattil used the word ‘peacefuls’, widely considered a pejorative, to describe Muslims, as he sought to know that given with the US-Iran standoff, whether the police have done ‘risk assessment’ of ‘wannabe jihadis’ working in American software companies.

“Many wannabe Jihadis work for American software companies in Hyderabad? After #Iran threatened to hit US assets, has @hydcitypolice @cyberabadpolice @RachakondaCop done background check/risk assessment of these Peacefuls? Or cops are clueless? @KTRTRS @TelanganaDGP @USCGHyderabad,” he tweeted.

The Cyberabad Police Twitter handle replied in the affirmative, thanked him for alerting them and said that there are ‘specialised wings’ which work on gathering intelligence. Both tweets were widely shared.

In another tweet, the Twitter user said that ‘each peaceful is a suspect’.

Hours later, Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi criticised Cyberabad Police’s tweet and demanded a clarification. In another tweet, he took a swipe at Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V C Sajjanar, as he invoked the encounter post the Disha case, and said that terrorism has no religion.

“@cpcybd sir you say “yes sir” please enlighten me how many such “jihadis” are working in software companies; kindly give the number if not please clarify what you meant. Will you reply to an MP or only a bhakt?” Mr Owaisi tweeted.

Apart from Mr Owaisi several netizens from Hyderabad and other parts of the country tweeted their shock and disapproval of the Cyberabad Police’s tweet.

For their part, the Cyberabad Police issued a clarification, claiming that its tweet was misconstrued.

“Our tweet has been misconstrued. The intent is only to suggest that we are always alert and well equipped to ensure security and it does not mean to agree with the suggestion. We reiterate that we are committed to maintain peace and order in society without prejudice towards any person and community,” reads a tweet.

Another top official said that ‘appropriate measures’ would be taken.

Meanwhile, the Students Islamic Organisation on Wednesday accused Cyberabad Police’s Twitter response as ‘islamophobic’.

SIO state president Talha Fayyazuddin urged police not to encourage those who are ‘tools of hate’. Describing the response as ‘illogical’, he said, “the entire struggle against CAA-NPR-NRC is to prevent damage to the social fabric of India, and what destroys it is the sowing of hatred and creating divide by raising suspicions in the minds of people against their own people.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/xmrgxi/article30520425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tweethydpoliceJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/row-over-police-response-to-tweet-on-jihadis/article30515882.ece
315,2020/01/08,15 best rock ‘n’ roll albums of 2019,"About a year ago, many predicted the imminent death of rock music, even though newer bands Greta Van Fleet and Rival Sons were attracting the younger generation. Now, as we’ve entered 2020, it’s a good time to note that the year gone by was actually great for the genre.

Many artistes released full-length albums, instead of following the fad of putting out singles. For those who missed the 2019 magic, here are 15 albums one must check out. It’s a personal choice, of course, with an order that can keep changing every two days. Most fall purely in the rock field, but we have included some folk-related and singer-songwriter material too.

Top of the pops

Let’s begin with the Boss. Bruce Springsteen had a great year, and his album Western Stars is an ode to the American countryside. It’s folk brilliance all the way. Next comes, US progressive metal band Tool’s Fear Inoculum. Released 13 years after its previous record, this 87-minute beauty simply grows on you.

Up at number three is the album Who, the comeback by British monsters The Who, now represented by vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and a few guests. It has a very trademark Who sound, standout tracks being ‘Ball And Chain’ and ‘Beads On One String’. Also going back to his earlier style was Canadian rocker Neil Young, who released Colorado with his old band Crazy Horse.

The Darkness, a 2000s British band blending heavy metal and glam-rock, comes in with its cracker Easter Is Cancelled, which has some amazing guitars and high-pitched vocals. At number six is the late Canadian legend Leonard Cohen, whose posthumous Thanks For The Dance is filled with hard-hitting poetry. The songs ‘It’s Torn’ and ‘Puppets’ are literary works.

Retro bands, modern sound

British folk-rock band Steeleye Span is up next with Est’d 1969, released to mark its 50th year. Santana’s African Skies, which blends frontman Carlos Santana’s Latin-rock style with African sounds, and Swedish progressive metal giant Opeth’s In Caude Venenum would definitely be in the reckoning. So would Irish great Van Morrison’s 3 Chords & The Truth, where his voice is in perfect shape 52 years after his debut. Other recommendations include Sinematic by Robbie Robertson of The Band, Feral Roots by the younger Rival Sons and Let’s Rock by American duo The Black Keys.

Home ground

Finally, representing India, we have Diverse Delusions by guitarist Claver Menezes, who teams up with many guest vocalists on this assorted affair, and the Shubhangi Joshi Collective’s alternative album Babelfish.

What’s in store for 2020? Alanis Morissette, Green Day, the Killers, Evanescence and Sepultura have announced new albums, which makes this year look like rock ‘n’ rock is in safe hands.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/54fd6c/article30516032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Western-Star,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/15-best-rock-n-roll-albums-of-2019/article30516033.ece
316,2020/01/08,"Susheela Raman on her journey with music that traverses borders, genres and identities","I stumbled and I saw

That it was not meant to be

You are still hanging on

And you are always, always

Out of reach...

Singer Susheela Raman’s hauntingly deep voice echoes off the soberly lit The Apartment of Park Hyatt. Sitting in front of the grand piano, the international musician, along with her “partner-in-crime”, long-time collaborator and husband, Sam Mills, is lost in a beautiful melody with a unique tonal quality — ‘Beautiful Moon’, an enchanting and introspective track from their 2018 album, Ghost Gamelan. Eyes closed, she soaks in the brief pauses when guitar interludes by Sam take over. Lit from below, the frame lends itself to the eerie and intimate quality of the music.

Susheela is an international name more than an Indian one. She has made diverse music — from Ethiopian-influenced covers of Jimi Hendrix jams to trance-inducing devotional music — in her illustrious career spanning 22 years. “It has been a very long journey. Initially, I wanted to create a musical sound which was representative of all of my different nationalities: my parents are from India but I was born in Britain and raised in Australia. It was largely driven by the trials of finding a home for oneself,” Susheela reminisces of the year 1997, when her relationship with music took an official turn.

Amorphous identities

“My parents moved to Australia when I was four, and there were practically no Indians on television when I was growing up. I grew up in parallel realities — the experience I had in school was different from that of home. By 16, I decided I wanted to do my own music.” Susheela was into the music of the 1960s then, but soon enough, she realised that she could not ignore her rich Indian ancestry. “I wanted to come and connect with that and do interpretations of the music studied here,” says Susheela who was particularly drawn to the sacred music traditions of the country. A lot of research followed, particularly of the religious and sacred traditions of South Asia.

Her first album, Salt Rain, was based in London. “I was working with the Indian diaspora in England, and also some African musicians based in France. One factor is that you need to establish a personal connection with the artistes. It is more like, you are trying to cross over and make a direct connection.”

From the third album, she decided to come back and work with Carnatic musicians Embar Kannan, ghatam Karthik, and Aruna Sairam. Over the course, she discovered the Vellalar community. “My upbringing in England was very insular. I didn’t realise that it was a whole subculture here. Soon, I stumbled upon the music of the dasis.” She was later drawn towards the tavil and the nadhaswaram and these connections led her to devotional music on Lord Muruga. “My work is all about the connections I have with people and how much those interactions stimulate.”

Instruments to the fore

A lot of Susheela’s music has a calming, almost therapeutic effect on its listeners. “I have to give some credit to guitarist Sam. He has a PhD in Anthropology, so not just music, a lot of different thoughts and philosophies go into his creations. We are interested in music which is transcendent and are also interested in exploring spaces that go beyond regular existence,” she adds. Modern music is another area of interest for the duo. This quality is born largely out of the production but also from the dynamic they share.

Another noteworthy aspect of their music is the instruments — many of her earlier works had sounds that stood out, lending it a character of their own. ‘Tanpa Nama’ is one of them. “I think it’s just following your curiosity, it leads you to places where you discover new voices and instruments,” says Susheela. Their most recent journey was to Indonesia to explore Gamelan music. “Gamelan musicians have sets of large gongs and metallic instruments like xylophones in different shapes and sizes. Their tonal system is completely different from any kind of Western or Indian system. Their music is like its from another planet,” Susheela explains. Her Tamil background helped when she worked with the complexity of this music. “The connections between Tamil Nadu and Java are strong. Raja Raja Chola made expeditions to Java and Sumatra.” Though they started work on this project in 2015, it’s still an ongoing one. “It was a trial to connect Britain, India and Indonesia and I think we did it.”

In the pipeline

In 2019, Susheela forayed into the film music industry for Raju Murugan film Gypsy slated for release this year. In it, one of the characters is a fictitious Susheela Raman. “He wanted me to do two songs for the film and one of them was a version of a Murugan song called ‘Ullam Urugathaiya’, which sadly was struck down by CBFC. It will be present only in the international version of the film. Another one is ‘Aasai Mugam’, based on Subramania Bharati’s poem,” she says. But she clarifies that she does not see herself involved in film music, in the long run.

Susheela says a new album is in the works — a collaboration with Western Classical orchestras; the Gamelan project is an ongoing one. “It is starting to become known in Indonesia and I would love to come and present it in Chennai. People here might find it fascinating because of these three vantage points involved — Britain-India-Indonesia,” she concludes.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/2bu9qh/article30514141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09mpSusheelaRamanGhostGamelanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/susheela-raman-on-her-journey-with-music-that-traverses-borders-genres-and-identities/article30514143.ece
317,2020/01/08,Yodels set to Carnatic music at The Amithias Project’s Indo-German performance,"What would a Bharatanatyam piece set to trumpets, flugelhorns and flutes look like? You could find out at The Amithias Project’s performance at Goethe-Institut this weekend.

The Amithias Project is headed by Bangalore-based flautist Amith Nadig and German trumpeter Matthias Schriefl. The performance will also feature Vinod Shyam Anoor on the mridangam and Sunaad Anoor on the kanjira. Bringing movement to the music will be Bharatanatayam dancer Nivedita Sharma, Amith’s wife.

The performance is part of Goethe’s MusiX series, that aims to offer innovative musical experiences. The first in this series is Amithias’ strange fusion of “world music from the Alps and India”.

The collaboration brings Jazz and Carnatic together — while Amith is a Carnatic flautist, son of flautist BK Anantharam, Matthias Schriefl is an established jazz musician. This weekend, they will be playing 12 songs, with sounds ranging from Blues to mambo, such as renditions of ‘Madrid Mambo’ and the Bharatanatyam piece ‘Jathiswaram’.

For Amithias, it is all about experimenting: “We are performing ‘Mallari’, the traditional South Indian songs played by nadaswaram artistes, and giving it a twist of Indo-German jazz. In another one of our songs, ‘Rolling Bangalore’, we try and convert sounds of the Bangalore traffic into music,” says Amith. The quartet will also imbibe the classic European yodelling into a Carnatic style, complete with complex mukhtayam in ‘Langenwanger’.

Explaining why Carnatic and Jazz go well with each other, he says, “Indian music is highly sophisticated in two aspects: it has gamakas, and it is mathematical. Jazz on the other hand has harmonies. So you have a complex rhythmic structure, on top of which you add layers of harmonies. Both Jazz and Carnatic allow scope for improvisation, so you are bringing the best of both worlds together.”

Quelling concerns of dissonance, he points out that the Indian audience has preconceived notions of what genres should sound like. “We compare what we hear with what we already know, looking to relate, and when we don’t find that, we go back disappointed.” Unlike, he claims, in Europe, where people come with a more open mind and focus their energies on understanding what is happening. “That is probably why we are more recognised there.”

The Amithias Project played at the Frankfurt jazz festival last year; they had started touring in 2012. “Mathias and I first met in 2009, when he landed in Bengaluru and attended a concert I was playing at ISKCON. He came to India because he happened to listen to Indian music in a festival in Munich, was impressed by it, and wanted to learn more,” he says. Since then, Mathias has been coming to India every year, and Amith has been travelling to Germany and other parts of Europe, to sustain their music.

The dance component of their performance was added in during their first tour in Bolzano, Italy. “My wife, Niveditha, was travelling with us, and we thought, ‘why not try dancing to a couple of songs?’ Once she did, the visual appeal of the piece provided a totally different level of connection with the audience,” he recalls.

The Amithias Project will be playing at Goethe-Institut Chennai, Nungambakkam, on January 11 from 7 pm. Entry is free.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bw0cxe/article30512977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPTheAmithiasProjectJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/yodels-set-to-carnatic-music-at-the-amithias-projects-indo-german-performance/article30512978.ece
318,2020/01/08,Bharath bandh: Strike by trade unions total and peaceful in Ernakulam,"The nation-wide strike called by trade unions is total in Ernakulam district with public transport largely off the roads, shops and establishments and educational institutions remaining closed and government offices reporting abysmally low attendance rates.

The joint coordination committee of trade unions took out a mammoth protest march from the municipal Town Hall to Kaloor at 9 a.m. Besides, protest marches and meetings are being held in 24 different centres across the district, said C.N. Mohanan, district secretary, CPI (M).

No untoward incident has been reported in the city and rural limits so far.

The State-run KSRTC has restricted operations to Pampa services — for passengers to Sabarimala — from the South railway station with the sparse staff that have turned up for duty. Till now, 70 Pampa services have been operated for Sabarimala-bound passengers reaching the railway station. The Railway authorities have earmarked parking space for seven KSRTC buses within the South station premises for operating Pampa services.

“The KSRTC depot at Ernakulam is completely deserted with just the staff members of the pool created for Pampa services alone reporting for duty. We are willing to operate services in other routes as well provided there are passengers,” said Thajudheen Shahib, District Transport Officer, Ernakulam.

Private buses are staying completely off the roads. “We don’t want to risk buses getting damaged in stone pelting. Besides, none of the workers are available for duty,” said Kerala State Private Bus Operators Federation president M.B. Sathyan.

Train services remain more or less unaffected in the strike with majority of the trains passing through the district operating on time. “Train services are operating as on any normal day and so far no attempts to disrupt services have been reported from anywhere. A few autorickshaws are also operating from the prepaid stand at the railway station,” said T.S. Gopakumar, Assistant Commissioner, Railway Protection Force, Ernakulam.

K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ernakulam, said that city police have deployed their vehicles for operating circular city trips for passengers reaching railway stations.

Boat services remain completely disrupted in the district. “We haven’t operated a single service in the district since majority of the workers are striking,” said M. Sujith, Traffic Superintendent, State Water Transport Department, Ernakulam.

Kochi Metro started operating services as usual from 6 a.m. Around 4,000 passengers have used the metro services till 9 a.m., which was less than the average occupancy during peak hours on normal days.

The otherwise bustling Ernakulam market wore a deserted look. “With workers striking and cargo vehicles remaining off the roads, there is no way the market can operate,” said K.K. Ashraf, Secretary, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.

Mohammed Sageer, president, Kerala Steel Traders Association, said that not withstanding declaration by a section of traders to not cooperate with the strike, nearly all shops and establishments in the district remained closed as this was a strike backed by all trade unions.

The offices at the civil station reported abysmally low attendance rate. “Out of the 70-odd offices and around 2,500 employees, just about five offices with only a handful of employees are operating till now,” said Additional District Magistrate Chandrasekharan Nair.

Operations of Infopark remained largely unaffected though the attendance rate remains relatively low. Vehicles deployed by IT companies operated with police escort from Palarivattom. Besides, many workers have chosen to opt for work from home.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3hfnnk/article30512786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trade-union-strike-kerala-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bharat-bandh-strike-by-trade-unions-total-and-peaceful-in-ernakulam/article30512815.ece

320,2020/01/08,KWA likely to set up water vending points by Friday,"The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is likely to set up over 10 water vending points at its plants in the district for private tankers to collect water as part of Operation Pure Water. Water vending points will be set up at Aluva, Maradu and Choondi by Friday.

“For the time being, water tankers are collecting water from wells in Aluva and Kalamassery as KWA is not equipped to provide enough water for distribution in the city,” said Ramachandran of the Ernakulam District Water Transporters Welfare Association.

The District Collector had ordered that tankers should not collect water from wells in the district as part of ensuring the quality of water. The order was based on a directive by an Assembly Committee.

However, water tanker owners had complained that there were not enough KWA hydrants from which water could be collected.

According to senior KWA officials, water vending facilities are limited at the storage tanks at Perumannoor and Thammanam located in the city.

Facilities for vending water from these tanks could not be enhanced considering traffic snarls they could create on busy roads. So far, about 25 loads of water are being collected a day from the Perumannoor storage tank. This is against the requirement of about 2,000 loads of water being transported every day.

According to KWA officials at the Aluva plant, they have received application from water tanker owners for collecting water.

However, it is also learnt that water tanker owners are concerned about the cost of bringing water from Aluva, Nettoor and Choondi plants to the city.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kwa-likely-to-set-up-water-vending-points-by-friday/article30509849.ece

322,2020/01/08,"Stray incidents of violence as Left, Congress sponsored-strike draws mixed response in Bengal","Stray incidents of violence was reported in Kolkata on Wednesday as the supporters of Left and the Congress tried to enforce the 24-hour all India strike that was called by the central trade unions.

Until afternoon, there was a mixed response to the strike as shops in certain parts of the city and suburbs remained closed and there were fewer number of vehicles seen on road. Suburban Railways services were also affected due to strike as protesters obstructed tracks and covered railway overhead wires with banana leaves. At Barasat, three crude bombs were retrieved from under the railway tracks.

The situation turned volatile at Jadavpur area in the southern parts of the city when the leader of Left Legislature Party and Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLA Sujan Chakraborty was taken in custody by the police. Mr. Chakraborty was leading a rally in support of the strike. The Left supporters attacked buses and vandalised police vehicles.

Several rallies led by Left supporters blocked traffic at key arterial interactions in the city. Shops in Burrabazar area, the wholesale hub of the city remained closed. In some districts, bandh supporters stopped public vehicles and forced people to come out of their vehicles.

At Siliguri in north Bengal, bandh supporters brought out rallies disrupting traffic. They attacked buses at Cooch Behar and Malda in north Bengal and Birbhum in south Bengal. ATM and banking services has also been severly affected by the strike.

At Aramabaghi in Hooghly, Trinamool Congress supporters tried to open closed shops. Asansol Mayor and Trinamool Congress leader Jitendra Tewari was seen trying to open shops which he alleged was forcibly shut down by strike or bandh supporters.

The strike called by several trade unions including that of the Congress has a long charter of demands, including universalisation of public distribution system, containing unemployment through concrete measures for employment generation, increase of minimum wages and trade union rights among other issues. The leaders of the trade unions had said that issues like opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill have been included among the charter of demands and has helped them garner more response from people in support of the strike.

Though opposing the bandh, the Trinamool Congress said it supports the issues on which the strike has been called for. The State government has issued a notification that no kind of leave will be granted to State government employees for January 8 and absence will be considered as a break in service.

Mamata directs police to take action

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that those trying to enforce the bandh forcibly are looking for “cheap publicity”. “Police will take a strong action wherever action is required. I still appeal to them (supporters of the strike) to go for democratic people protests,” she said. Ms. Banerjee said that she will not allow anyone to enforce the bandh in the state forcibly.

“For 34 years they could not do anything and whatever I am trying to build they are destroying. The CPI(M) in Kerala is a lot better, at least they believe in their ideology,” she said. Condemning the protests, she dared those enforcing the strike to go and indulge in such hooliganism in Delhi or any other state.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/qxy3av/article30512596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHINAYABANDH2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/stray-incidents-of-violence-as-all-india-strike-draws-mixed-response-in-bengal/article30512103.ece

New issues

“A number of issues have been added since we called the strike and people are keen to protest against the fascist tendencies of the Centre. Not only working class, but tomorrow we will see support of students, youth and middle class” State president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions ( CITU) and former Labour Minister Anadi Sahu told The Hindu.

Mr. Sahu said rallies in support of the strike would start in different parts of the city at 6 a.m. “The central rally from the CITU headquarters in central Kolkata will start at 10 a.m. and will cover Entally and other parts of the city,” Mr. Sahu said.

TMC’s stand

A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that though she supported the issues related to the strike, she would not allow bandh, Trinamool leader Partha Chaterjee said bandh was the last weapon and by using it often the Left parties were making it blunt. “For 34 years in the Left Front rule bandhs have become holidays,” he said.

On being asked whether they were opposed to the strike, Mr. Chatterjee reiterated what Ms. Banerjee had said, “We are not in support of the bandh, we are supporting the issues.”

The representatives of the trade unions however, expressed confidence that unlike the aggression shown over the past few years the ruling TMC would not foil the bandh this time

324,2020/01/08,Clothing label Ilamra is for those who believe in sustainable fashion,"ILAMRA is a fashion label that’s driven by the concept of slow and ethical fashion. The label juxtaposes arts and crafts with contemporary designs, blending Kalamkari in modern silhouettes. The founders of the label, siblings Yashila and Trishala aim to revive and promote artisans and weavers using handcrafted techniques and organic textiles.

The name Ilamra is derived from the Sanskrit word Ila - earth, Amra - mango tree and Ra - the sun. Yashila and Trishala say they were inspired to come up with the name from the fond memories of their childhood. “We were very nature-centric. Whenever we were at our aunt’s backyard, we would sit under the mango tree and watch the sunlight falling on us. It gave us a huge sense of positivity and inspiration,” says Yashila.

Ilamara at an exhibition

Yashila and Trishala both hold a degree in engineering and have always been interested in fashion, arts, and crafts since childhood. “There was a time when we had to choose a fixed career path, that is when we decided that our true calling is making something out of the crafts that we really love, and we decided to go into designing. We wanted to create something that has meaning to us and in some form gives back to the community,” says Trishala. Thus was born the label in in 2017 as an online store and became fully operational in 2018.

Initially, the sisters designed their clothes with hand block printing and chemical dyes but realised the impact of it on the environment and decided to switch to organic cotton, natural dyes, and kalamkari.

With no exposure in entrepreneurship or even fashion, Yashila and Trishala started the company from scratch. “We had an idea but we didn’t know where our money would come from. We started with the seed money of ₹30,000 that was generously donated by our parents,” says Trishala.

Yashila and Trishala manage most of the work from content writing to designing. They freelance with illustrators, photographers, models and work with a marketing agency on a monthly basis.

“Ilamra has taught us everything from digital marketing to merchandising. We divide our work equally. In designing the clothes, I am on the technical side like the prints and Yashila is on the details and the styling part of it. We design our clothes on the basis of something that we would like to wear or would like to see on people,” says Trishala.

The prints are inspired by their travels and anything in their daily life that fascinates them, but Nature remains the main source of inspiration. “We don’t blindly follow the market trends, with sustainability as our core, we focus on things that last for a long time,” comments Yashila.

As a startup company and most importantly as a slow fashion brand, the execution was one of the challenges. The cottons are sourced from Pedana, a village in Krishna district of AP and the textiles are washed in the river — a move that helps keep the carbon footprints as low as possible.

“Time is very important. The process is slow from the dyeing of clothes to the sourcing of cotton, and a hindrance would mean slowing the process that is already slow,” adds Trishala.

The audience’s knowledge of slow fashion is also a challenge because not everyone is aware of ethical consumerism and sustainability and that’s where the relevance of work of the label is limited.

Yashila and Trishala plan to launch a digital magazine soon keeping in mind the motive to promote arts and crafts while following ethical and sustainable practices in fashion.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/i3tnap/article30513385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym09Imara-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/hyderabadi-sisters-yashila-and-trishalas-label-ilamra-is-for-those-who-believe-in-sustainable-fashion/article30513386.ece

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed the petition filed by the State Election Commission (SEC), seeking additional time to submit CCTV footages of the counting process in the rural local body polls in the 12 districts (excluding Tirunelveli and Tenkasi) falling under its jurisdiction.

Since the SEC was unable to confirm the date of submission of the footages, a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran observed that the reasons given for extension of time could not be accepted.

The Bench observed that the court had directed the SEC to submit the footages to the High Court Registry on January 3. However, even after the election results were announced, the footages had not been submitted. The Bench dismissed the petition that sought extension of time, citing technical reasons, as devoid of merits.

Two women candidates, M. Devi and A. Priyadharshini, had contested for the post of panchayat president, which was reserved for woman (general). First, Ms. Devi was declared elected and then following a commotion, Ms. Priyadharshini was announced the winner. Both the candidates had been awarded certificates.

The court had ordered a stay on the conduct of the swearing in of the president. During the hearing, Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian said when Ms. Devi was declared elected, the counting process was not complete. when the entire counting process was completed, it was established that Ms. Priyadharshini had secured more votes. The certificate given to Ms. Devi was cancelled by the Returning Officer.

The court asked the State how the Returning Officer/ Election Officer had exercised such a power.

In a counter filed in the court, the Sivaganga Collector stated that action had been initiated by framing appropriate charges against the Returning Officer and the Assistant Returning Officer under Rule 17 (b) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules.

However, the strike observed against the “wrong” economic policies of the Central Government, did not impact normal life as regular traffic was unaffected and markets and shops remained open.

In Dindigul, members of the central trade unions, engaged in a road block and protest outside the head post office. They raised slogans against price rise of essential commodities including fuel, unemployment and the move to privatize PSU bodies.

A group of protesters from Communist Party of India (Marxist) led by former MLA K. Bala Bharathi, attempted a rail roko at the Dindigul railway junction but the police intervened and stopped them from entering the platform.

“The government has been wreaking havoc on the economy of the country through its wrong and flawed economic policies. The farmers and downtrodden sections of the society are extremely distressed due to this,” alleged Bala Bharathi. The police arrested over 500 people who attempted to lay siege to the railway station.

Members of the trade unions and affiliated bodies, staged protests in public places such as bus stands and railway stations across the major towns in the district, including Palani, Oddanchatram, Batlagundu and Vedasandur.

330,2020/01/08,Stir by Opposition parties against Centre’s policies,"TIRUNELVELI

While the State government employees and the teachers ignored the nationwide bandh call fearing stringent action from Tamil Nadu Government, over 2,500 cadre of Opposition parties who staged road roko in 15 places in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts condemning the anti-people economic policies of the BJP-led Union Government were arrested on Wednesday.

In Tirunelveli city, cadres of the Opposition parties attempted to block the road at busy Vannarpet Junction where the police arrested 413 protesters, including 76 women.

Similar protests were organised in Nanguneri, Valliyoor, Ambasamudram, Veeravanallur, Mukkoodal, Tenkasi, Shencottai, Kadayam, Alangulam, Paavoorchathram, Kadayanallur, Sivagiri, Puliyangudi and Sankarankovil where the police arrested 2,543 persons, including 592 women.

The protesters said the Centre’s “anti-people” economic policies, which had resulted in unprecedented inflation, unemployment and loss of over 30 lakh jobs, had brought down the Gross Domestic Product to just 5%, which was much below than the global economic meltdown that rocked the country in the last decade.

Privatisation of public sector undertakings in the guise of saving the country from huge accumulated losses by these companies was being actively pursued with an eye on helping the private corporate firms in the same business, they alleged.

Though the Opposition parties had appealed to the teachers and the employees of government departments and the labourers to join hands with them in the nationwide strike, they reported for duty as usual. There was no response to the bandh call in the southern districts as life was normal here. All buses being operated by the State Express Transport Corporation and the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation were plying as usual.

Only the buses being operated from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Kanniyakumari and Nagercoil to various destinations in Kerala were operated up to the border.

However, banking operations in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts were seriously affected as most of the bank employees and the officials participated in the nationwide strike, as they had announced earlier.

In Thoothukudi district, 378 protesters, including 91 women, were held as they blocked traffic in Thoothukudi, Tiruchendur, Kovilpatti and Vilaathikulam. Functioning of the postal department and banks was completely paralysed owing to the strike in which employees of Life Insurance Corporation, VOC Port and Bharat Petroleum Corporation’s LPG Filling Plant actively participated.

In Kanniyakumari district, 719 persons, including 69 women, were arrested as they staged road roko in 5 places viz. Kottar, Vadaserry, Nesamony Nagar, Kaliyakkavilai and Kotticode.

334,2020/01/08,Snag cripples operation of solar-powered boat,"TIRUNELVELI

The fun ride in the solar-powered boat in the Manimuthar dam has suffered a temporary setback as technical snag has crippled the boat’s operation into the district’s largest reservoir.

The Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve administration, which introduced coracle ride in Manimuthar Dam in the first quarter of last year to attract tourists, deployed the 26-seater solar-powered boat (including two seats for the crew), fabricated by the Mahindra Group, in April last for field trials. Under the Tamil Nadu Innovation Initiative, the Department of Forest received ₹ 2.25 crore for promoting eco-tourism activities in KMTR and a portion of this grant has been utilised for procuring the solar-powered boat.

The boat, propelled by a lithium-ion battery, is 11.8 metre long and 4 metre wide. One of its unique aspects is that it has a German motor (20 KW) with solar roof on top which can generate 3.8 KW of power. The solar roof will help the boat get partially charged while moving. The field trials were conducted successfully with 24 persons cruising in the boat. Once it becomes operational, the boat will take tourists into the dam’s water, surrounded by the Western Ghats, it was announced.

After the ₹ 80-lakh worth boat’s field trials in the largest reservoir of the district were completed successfully in phases, the boat was formally commissioned by Deputy Director Kommu Omkaram on New Year.

Mr. Omkaram, after witnessing the trials, said the boat performed well during the field trials and met all pre-set parameters. “The boat is very easy to operate though it would be so windy in Manimuthar dam between June and September,” he said.

As the dam now has water for about 114 feet against the maximum storage level of 118 feet, the solar boat was expected to attract a decent number of tourists every day, particularly during the ‘Pongal’ holidays. While ₹ 110 is being charged per adult for the 30-minute ride, ₹ 55 is the fare for the children.

However, the unexpected breakdown of the solar-powered boat due to technical glitches has shocked the officials, who have informed their higher-ups to send the service engineers at the earliest to make the boat operational again.

Sources in the KMTR’s Ambasamudram Range told The Hindu that the boat, which is being operated at very slow speed with solar power, should be accelerated further and hence a few modifications are to be done. Since the solar power panels on the roof of the boat had developed “technical glitches”, either repairing or replacement would be done by the supplier shortly.

“If the speed of the boat can be increased a bit, the 30-minute-long ride in the dam will be more attractive. Anyway, the boat will be ready to receive the tourists coming to Manimuthar dam during Pongal holidays,” hoped the sources.

Since the plastic used for the seats in the boat cannot withstand the weight of heavier passengers, the seats should also be replaced, opined the sources.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/awlbxv/article30514629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA09TVL-BOAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/snag-cripples-operation-of-solar-powered-boat/article30514630.ece

337,2020/01/08,Bommai asks Muslims not to fall for Cong. ‘smear campaign’,"Reiterating that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will not affect Muslims, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday asked Muslims not to fall for the ‘smear campaign’ by Opposition parties, more so by the Congress, on the Act.

Launching a signature campaign in support of the CAA at Surathkal here, Mr. Bommai said there will be no trouble for any Muslim from the CAA.

“Your ration card will be more strengthened. Nothing will happen to your Aadhaar card. Nobody will drive you out from the place you are staying. Opposition parties, more so the Congress, were trying to create fear and building a sense of insecurity among Muslims,” he said.

In plain terms, Mr. Bommai said, the CAA was nothing but a process of legitimising the stay of persons who have fled from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh following religious persecution. “You see good number of people from different parts of the country, who have problems at their place, come to earn their living in Mangaluru. The government gives such residents electricity, water and title deed for place they are staying. Does this in any way affect you at all?. No. With CAA, a similar exercise will be carried out and it will not affect Muslims or any other residents here. Those spreading lies and creating fear among Muslims are acting against the State,” he said.

BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the BJP will hold massive CAA awareness programmes at three places including Mangaluru and Sindhanur in Raichur district, which has large number of Bangladeshi refugees. There will be awareness campaigns in all district centres.

Mr. Bommai and Mr. Kateel earlier signed on the big poster to begin the campaign to send letters addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah in support of CAA.

The Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) had been told to identify land it had in its bank to be used for industrial development, he said.

He said that there were a lot of vented dams in the district. There was a problem of who should do the work to remove silt work in these dams.

It had been decided that the Panchayat Development Officers (PDOs) would do it at the gram panchayats, while the commissioners would do it in the urban areas. The executive officers of the taluk panchayats should supervise the work to remove silt in the gram panchayats, he said.

Nearly ₹90 lakh was expected from the sale of sand removed from these dams. This amount would be used again for removing silt.

There were some issues with regard to removal of sand in the non-coastal regulation zone (CRZ) areas.

A meeting would be held with the Ministers of Forests and Environment, and Mines and Geology in Bengaluru soon to thrash out this problem. The issues of quarries in deemed forests too would be taken up in the same meeting, he said.

344,2020/01/08,Telecom majors seek open court hearing in SC of their pleas for review of certain directions on AGR,"Telecom majors, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, on Wednesday sought an open court hearing of their pleas seeking review of certain directions of the Supreme Court on recovery of past dues amounting to ₹1.47 lakh crore from telecom service providers.

The recovery of past dues by the government was based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about ₹92,000 crore.

The plea seeking an open court hearing was mentioned before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, who said he will take a decision after talking to Chief Justice S. A. Bobde.

The apex court had on October 24 last year upheld the AGR definition formulated by the Department of Telecom (DoT) and termed as “frivolous” the nature of objections raised by telecom service providers.

Bharti Airtel, in its plea, had sought review of the directions on aspects of levy of interest, penalty and interest on penalty relating to AGR, a source related to the development had said.

Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had told Parliament in November that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the government as much as ₹1.47 lakh crore in past statutory dues.

He had added that there is no proposal at present to waive interest and penalties on such dues.

In replies to separate questions in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Prasad had said telecom companies owe the government ₹92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee, and another ₹55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

In an affidavit filed earlier in the top court, the DoT said Airtel owed ₹21,682.13 crore as licence fee to the government and dues from Vodafone totalled ₹19,823.71 crore, while Reliance Communications owed ₹16,456.47 crore. BSNL owed ₹2,098.72 crore, and MTNL ₹2,537.48 crore.

Holding that interest and penalty have rightly been levied on the telecom companies, the apex court had made it clear that there would be no further litigation on the issue and it would fix a time-frame for calculation and payment of dues by the telecom companies.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gi9dl1/article30498980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06thNDYBG01telGSQ6UP3PJ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/telecom-majors-seek-open-court-hearing-in-sc-of-their-pleas-for-review-of-certain-directions-on-agr/article30512470.ece

352,2020/01/08,Samsung flags smaller-than-expected fall in Q4 profit as chip price fall eases,"Samsung Electronics flagged a smaller-than-expected fall in quarterly operating profit, indicating that memory chip prices bottomed out quicker than analysts had anticipated, strengthening hopes of a recovery.

The world's top memory chip maker has struggled since late 2018 as a weak global economy curbed spending by data centre customers and rising inventory of memory chips squeezed prices, ending a two-year industry boom.

But hopes for a rebound in chip prices are gaining momentum, and an expected easing in the U.S.-China trade war is lifting optimism that demand from servers and 5G smartphones customers will return this year.

Operating profit in the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 34% to 7.1 trillion won ($6.09 billion) from 10.8 trillion won a year earlier. That came in ahead of the 6.5 trillion won forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

Samsung's annual profit declined 53% to 27.7 trillion won, its lowest since 2015 and the biggest annual profit percentage drop in a decade.

Fourth-quarter revenue fell 0.5% to 59 trillion won.

Chip-price tracker DRAMeXchange said spot prices of DRAM chips — which provide devices with temporary workspace and allow them to multi-task — started to rebound in late 2019, and expected DRAM prices to stop falling in the first quarter.

Samsung Electronics is scheduled to disclose detailed results later this month.

As news broke of a missile attack against two airbases in Iraq housing U.S. and coalition forces, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped nearly 2.5%, with the broader Topix index off more than 2%.

""It's not going to be pretty today,"" said AxiTrader's Stephen Innes, reacting to the initial reports of Iran's first response to the U.S. assassination of military commander Qasem Soleimani.

Oil climbed sharply higher on the news, with the benchmark WTI jumping as much as 4.53% to $65.54 a barrel before settling down slightly.

Japanese stocks were also affected by flight to the safe-haven yen — an asset in which investors often take refuge in times of uncertainty. A rising yen pulls down the price of Japan's export-led firms.

""The yen is firming to the 107.78-79 levels"" that generally hurt Japanese stocks, Kyoko Amemiya, senior market adviser at SBI Securities, told AFP.

Japanese stocks are also being hit by concerns over the economic impact on resource-poor Japan from a higher oil price, Amemiya said.

Before the latest escalation, investors had been weighing how to trade the latest flare-up in Middle East tensions, with stocks choppy since Soleimani's killing.

In Tuesday trade, U.S. stocks had finished slightly lower while European markets were broadly flat — Frankfurt outperforming its peers with a 0.8% gain.

Iran fired ""more than a dozen"" ballistic missiles Tuesday against two airbases in Iraq where U.S. and coalition forces are based, the U.S. Department of State said after the Tokyo market opened.

""It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil,"" Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.

The dollar fetched 107.78 yen in early Asian trade, against 108.42 yen in New York on Tuesday. In Tokyo, the higher yen hit blue-chip exporters, which were down across the board, with Sony slipping 1.07% to 7,573 yen and game giant Nintendo trading down 1.07% at 42,480 yen.

Car giant Toyota was off 1.45% at 7,603 yen and chip-making equipment manufacturer Tokyo Electron down 1.34% at 23,200 yen. Nissan was down 1.20% at 628.8 yen ahead of its former CEO Carlos Ghosn's press conference in Lebanon after his audacious escape from Japan.

354,2020/01/08,The domestic perils of Trump’s adventurism abroad,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to assassinate top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani has faced brickbats abroad for the risks that it poses to peace in West Asia and beyond. But there is also little doubt that in embarking on this adventurist path of antagonising Tehran, the American President has driven a deeper wedge between political constituents at home.

Deepening fear and anger

First, in invoking the spectre of national security to justify the assassination, Mr. Trump has endangered American persons and assets, military and civilian, abroad. A bill passed in the Iranian parliament this week designated all U.S. forces involved in the “martyrdom” of Soleimani as “terrorists”. Every one of them could now potentially find themselves in the cross hairs of the inevitable reprisal that will originate from an angry Iranian regime.

Second, Mr. Trump’s strike against Iran has deepened the sense of angst and hostility on Capitol Hill, where partisan bickering has already polarised lawmakers over the impeachment of the President in an election year. Now the House is formulating a response to Mr. Trump not notifying it in advance of the drone strike that killed Soleimani. The Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and her Democratic colleagues will do so via a war powers resolution — even if there are slim chances of the Republican-controlled Senate passing any such bill into law. Mr. Trump could only continue so far without running afoul of the 1973 War Powers Act. The Act requires that the President inform Congress within 48 hours of introducing military forces into armed conflict abroad. Second, it bars the president from committing armed forces to any foreign action lasting over 60 days without Congressional approval. Already questions of presidential propriety have been raised regarding Mr. Trump’s decision to make the White House’s notification to Congress on the Soleimani strike a classified document, a move clearly aimed at limiting transparency on the subject.

Also Read Who was General Qasem Soleimani and why was he so popular?

A third strand of domestic opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda in West Asia comes from the American public. Last weekend, anti-war protests swirled through communities across the U.S. Protesters numbering from a few hundred to more than a thousand called for an end to the hostility against Iran and Iraq. This begs the question: what is the exit strategy Mr. Trump and his team have in mind for their West Asia strategy, one that they will have to explain to their domestic constituents? Washington has steadily nudged Tehran onto the warpath — first by scuttling the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, then by slapping Iran with crushing sanctions, and finally by killing Soleimani.

More hostility towards the U.S.

The White House appears to have exponentially multiplied hostility against itself from Baghdad as well — as the strike against Soleimani was at the Baghdad airport, U.S. personnel in the country might be considered targets of the Iranian regime. It was thus entirely unsurprising that the Iraqi parliament voted to have U.S. troops withdraw from their country within an unspecified time frame. Saudi Arabia may also have been displeased with the strike, however ironic that may seem, particularly given the intelligence that Soleimani was in the process of taking forward proposals to de-escalate tensions between Riyadh and Tehran.

Mr. Trump may have won himself a reprieve from the negative publicity associated with his impeachment by the House of Representatives last month. However, if he sees military adventurism on foreign soil — missions that at best have a hazy strategic denouement — as a legitimate means to divert attention from issues in domestic politics, he may well be opening the door to forces that are genuinely beyond his control.

355,2020/01/08,The road to radicalisation,"Whenever there are acts of violence, there is an urgency to label them as acts of terror. The basis for categorisation of violent acts as terrorist acts include the type of weapons used in the killings, the beliefs of the accused, the number of people killed, etc. Categorising violence is important, but if it is done without due thought or diligence, it could end up harming the affected state or community and lead to vastly different policy imperatives. Three attacks last year, one in the U.K. and two in the U.S.’s military facilities, illustrate this point clearly.

Complex reality

The stabbing at London Bridge in the U.K., and the shootings at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and Pensacola Naval Air Station in the U.S., were all quickly characterised by sections of the media and by analysts as ‘lone wolf’ attacks. The reality is more complex. Though all three cases are still under investigation, news reports establish the fact that Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, was not a lone wolf. Khan, a radical preacher, had been arrested earlier in a major counterterrorism operation. He had spent eight years in prison, before being released in December 2018, for plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange. The attack in the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii was also classified as a lone wolf attack, but since the attacker’s motive seemed to have been non-political, it may be classified as homicide. Mohammad al-shamrani, who was training to be a pilot at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, and carried out the third attack, seems to fit the profile of a lone wolf. Al-shamrani had professed anger towards the U.S. for its policies against Muslims. His family said that he had never shown any inclination towards extremism or violence. And no group claimed responsibility for the attack.

In the first case, by labelling Khan a lone wolf, many discounted the influence of an extremist organisation’s concerted efforts at recruiting individuals to its cause. The focus of counterterrorism programmes are on individuals and do not take into consideration overarching structural factors in play; an individual who is getting radicalised because of propaganda on the Internet is simply called “self-radicalised”. A majority of programmes on counter extremism or terrorism aiming at cognitive change concentrate their efforts on a single aspect without taking into account a host of factors. There is also no statistical correlation between the number of people admitted to such programmes and the number of people who emerge ‘deradicalised’, as admitted tacitly by Khan’s supervisors at the Healthy Identity Intervention Programme at Belmarsh prison, where he was incarcerated for eight years.

Process of radicalisation

The second issue is how the process of radicalisation is perceived by analysts and academics. Most consider radicalisation as a linear process where the individual goes through a number of stages. The most common model is the one designed by the New York Police Department, which believes that radicalisation has four steps. The first stage, pre-radicalisation, assumes an individual to be a blank slate, at best, or an eager receptor, at worst. This is followed by self-identification where he or she realises the uniqueness of his or her identity. Then comes the stage of indoctrination and, finally, jihadisation. Conversely, a major element of a person committing murder in the pursuit of an alleged political objective is what I call ‘radicalising cumulatives’, an aggregation of factors, structural and causal, that may push him to do this. Of course, the final cognitive step of actually committing violence cannot be prejudged accurately every time.

The final issue is that of the divide between the state and the family. The state’s coercive institutions do not directly interfere into familial structures and hierarchies, where the likelihood of influencing factors is very high. A significant number of attacks have been carried out by second generation or later generations of immigrants. The patriarchal nature of the immigrants’ families may be one of the reasons behind this phenomena and this needs to be investigated further. However, the state’s right to intrude into the family has been limited by a number of regulations that afford all citizens the right to privacy and considerable autonomy. This dilemma of finding the right balance between security and autonomy needs to be delved upon. ‘Prevent’, the U.K.’s disastrous attempt at involving civil society and local communities in its fight against terrorism, has shown that this is a major issue for civilised societies. No society can benefit by oversimplifying the factors that push an individual towards violence. Oversimplification will mean that we will be left with poor policies.

356,2020/01/08,"Amidst a tragedy, an opportunity","The writer David Horne once described Australia as “the lucky country”, with its abundance of natural resources, good weather, and its relative geographical isolation from the turbulence of the world. Today, with wildfires burning more than 12 million hectares of land, destroying native flora, killing thousands of wild animals, including endangered species, and displacing residents and tourists, Australia is confronted with a dystopian vision, where “apocalypse becomes the new normal”, to borrow the title of a recent op-ed by Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman.

Dialogue on energy

At this moment of crisis, and while the tragedy of the bushfires is still unfolding, New Delhi and Canberra have a rare opportunity: to translate their rapidly converging interests and coalescing of values into a formidable partnership for the 21st century. When I co-chaired the Australia India Leadership Dialogue last month in Melbourne, the breadth and depth of the relationship was evident, as was the scope for the future in diverse areas, including the grand challenges facing our planet.

Clearly, as a consequence of the bushfires, the debate on global warming, climate change and fossil fuels is going to intensify in the weeks ahead, even while scientists grapple with the new evidence. Australia’s celebrated novelist Richard Flanagan concluded in a powerful, if controversial, essay: “Australia today is ground zero for the climate catastrophe.” As evidence, he pointed out that the Great Barrier Reef “is dying”, the “world-heritage rain forests are burning”, giant kelp forests have disappeared, “numerous towns have run out of water or are about to, and now the vast continent is burning on a scale never before seen.”

Mr. Flanagan is not alone; environmental activism has gained ground throughout the country, and while the Indian Ocean Dipole may have triggered the drought that is related to the fires, the campaign against fossil fuels and the export of coal is sure to intensify in the days to come.

As two economies with a great stakeholding in fossil fuels, it is critical for India and Australia to ensure that their dialogue on energy acquires momentum. This will require a joint scientific task force to disinter the latest evidence linking climate change and extreme climatic events with fossil fuels and to study the promise and potential of “clean” coal technology. Both countries must simultaneously strengthen the International Solar Alliance and the search for other alternative green fuels.

The Leadership Dialogue also recognised that we are living through a period of immense turbulence, disruption and even subversion. For instance, the near overwhelming presence of an illiberal, totalitarian China, increasingly unilateralist, interventionist and mercantilist and willing to write its own rules, is the single biggest challenge to our two countries. Not even our thought leaders of the future or political representatives today, especially in Australian universities and democratic institutions, are sanitised from Beijing’s surveillance or longer-term grand designs.

Fortunately, in New Delhi there is a near consensus within the political leadership and the strategic community that the Australia-India relationship is an idea whose time has well and truly come. From water management to trauma research to skills and higher education, from maritime and cybersecurity to counterterrorism, a world of opportunities awaits the two countries if they can work in coordination.

A few years ago, the Australia-India Institute at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, commissioned one of the most comprehensive surveys of Indian public opinion on key foreign policy issues and critical challenges of governance. Indians ranked Australia in the top four nations towards which they feel most warmly. Only the U.S., Singapore and Japan ranked higher. Today, Indians feel warmer towards Australia than towards European countries and BRICS nations.

Apart from being two English-speaking, multicultural, federal democracies that believe in and respect the rule of law, both have a strategic interest in ensuring a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific region in which the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are ensured. In addition, Indians are today the largest source of skilled migrants in Australia and the economic relationship, already robust, could potentially be transformed if the promise of the Peter Varghese and Anil Wadhwa reports, commissioned by the two governments, is realised. In Canberra, there is considerable sensitivity to India’s concerns over the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership while there is still hope that there is an early conclusion of a bilateral Free Trade Agreement.

An important partner

After more than six decades characterised by misperception, lack of trust, neglect, missed opportunities and even hostility, a new chapter in India’s relations with Australia has well and truly begun. Consider this: in 1955, Prime Minister Robert Menzies decided that Australia should not take part in the Bandung Afro-Asian conference. By distancing Australia from the ‘new world’, Menzies (who would later confess that Occidentals did not understand India) alienated Indians, offended Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and left Australia unsure for decades about its Asian identity. India and Australia should bring this chequered past to a closure, and herald a new united front for the Indo-Pacific.

Nearly a decade ago, when I decided to be the inaugural director of the Australia India Institute at Melbourne, it was seen as a giant leap of faith. I had not visited Australia before and had little knowledge of the country. My friends warned me that I was literally going “Down Under”, soon to become irrelevant and marginal to all policy issues in India. At school, my teenage daughters were told they risked being bashed up in school and college, and my extended family was astounded. But today I have no doubt that it was one of the best decisions of my life. With not one unpleasant experience in the country, as a family we have found Australians open, friendly, fair, accepting and generous, and the country a model of good governance.

In her account of India-Australia bilateral relations, historian Meg Gurry relates how Arthur Tange, High Commissioner to India and one of Australia’s most formidable diplomats, wrote in 1965 to his Foreign Minister, Paul Hasluck, that there was fertile ground between the two countries, but “no one seems to know what seed to plant”. More than 50 years on, there are not only many seeds waiting to be planted, but also ripe fruit ready to harvest.

While Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who postponed his visit to India because of the bushfires, will be missed at the Raisina Dialogue, one hopes that one immediate decision that be will taken by New Delhi and Canberra is to elevate the ‘two plus two’ format for talks from the secretary level to the level of foreign and defence ministers. That should signal that New Delhi recognises Canberra as important a partner as Washington and Tokyo.

357,2020/01/08,There is a design flaw with this military post,"The scale of the First World War underscored the command and control dilemmas of concurrent conflicts playing out simultaneously in multiple theatres of conflict.

War and the West

During the locust years of Great Britain, an issue that received consideration was the British higher command and control structures. With the declaration of the Second World War, the onus for the higher direction of war fell to the remit of the War Cabinet serviced by the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British legislative system functioned through the Second World War. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister, was given supreme powers but stayed accountable to Parliament through the War Cabinet. He assumed the portfolio of Minister for Defence, with the resultant duty of overseeing the British War effort. This allowed him, as Chairperson of Chiefs of Staff Committee, to exercise both tactical and strategic options.

After the United States entered the war, following the Pearl Harbor attack, an integrated command became the norm during the Second World War as diverse allies including the Soviet Union had to work in unison. A unified command required a single commander liable to the joint chiefs of staff supported by a joint staff and exerting command over all constituents of his allocated force irrespective of their service.

After the war ended and the world split into two ideological blocs, General Dwight D. Eisenhower became the First North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) supreme commander while political power was vested in the NATO Council. The First Supreme Commander of the Warsaw Pact Forces was Marshal Ivan Konev, while de-facto political authority resided with the General Secretary of the Soviet Union in Moscow. The United States, vide the National Security Act 1947, established the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were jointly tasked to be Military Advisers to the President and the Secretary of Defence. Despite the experience of the Second World War, they chose not to appoint a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). The U.S. amended this structure vide the Goldwater–Nichols Act in 1986 by having a chairperson and vice-chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs in unison are again the principal military advisers to the government. There is no CDS. The military chain of command runs directly from the theatre commanders through a civilian Defence Secretary to the President. However, Britain, conversely in 1959, created a Chief of the Defence Staff. Air Chief Marshal Sir William Dickson became the first CDS after serving as the rotational chairperson of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Was it required or was it the hubris of a declining power — the jury is still out on that.

The outline for India

In India, ‘in 1947, Lord Ismay, the Chief of Staff to Lord Mountbatten, Governor General of India, recommended a three-tier higher defence management structure to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Three committees were constituted: the defence committee of cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister; the Defence Minister’s Committee chaired by the Defence Minister, and the Chiefs of Staff Committee integrated into the military wing of the Cabinet Secretariat. The chair of the committee was rotational, with the Service Chief longest in the committee becoming the chairperson’.

This procedure operated into ‘the middle of the 1950s despite the Commander-in-Chief only being an invitee to the Defence Committee of Cabinet. The designation of the Commander in-Chief of the three services was consciously altered to Chiefs of Staff in 1955. After the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the Defence Committee of the Cabinet first morphed into the Emergency Committee of Cabinet and then later into the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs’. It is now the Cabinet Committee on Security, or CCS. This system has served India well over the years.

On December 24, 2019, a Press Information Bureau release on the Cabinet clearing the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)said: “The following areas will be dealt by the Department of Military Affairs headed by CDS: The Armed Forces of the Union, namely, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Integrated Headquarters of the Ministry of Defence comprising Army Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, Air Headquarters and Defence Staff Headquarters. The Territorial Army. Works relating to the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Procurement exclusive to the Services except capital acquisitions, as per prevalent rules and procedures.”

It added, “The Chief of Defence Staff, apart from being the head of the Department of Military Affairs, will also be the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. He will act as the Principal Military Adviser to the Raksha Mantri [RM] on all tri-Services matters. The three Chiefs will continue to advise RM on matters exclusively concerning their respective Services. CDS will not exercise any military command, including over the three Service Chiefs, so as to be able to provide impartial advice to the political leadership.”

A subordination

Herein lies the contradiction and the design flaw. As Secretary in charge of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and having superintendence over the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force, there would be an implied subordination of the three service chiefs to the CDS notwithstanding any declaration to the contrary. As Secretary of the DMA, the CDS is tasked with facilitating the restructuring of military commands, bringing about jointness in operations including through the establishment of joint/theatre commands.

This will invariably encroach upon the domain of the service chiefs.

The CDS, as Permanent Chairperson of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, would outrank the three service chiefs even though theoretically all are four star. Moreover the advice of the CDS could override the advice of the respective Service Chiefs on critical tactical and perhaps even strategic issues.

With the creation of the DMA on most issues, the reporting structure of the three services to the Defence Minister would now be through the CDS; if not immediately it would become the norm over time. Even today while in theory the service chiefs report directly to the Defence Minister, in practice all files and decisions are routed through the Defence Secretary.

However most problematic is the erosion of civilian supremacy over the defence establishment in the Ministry of Defence itself. This impacts on the first principles of constitutionalism and has implications for our democratic polity also. Sophistry is being employed to suggest that the Secretary DMA would be in charge of military affairs and the Defence Secretary would look after the ‘defence of the realm’. The fact is that the defence of India is managed by the three services who would now report to the DMA.

Since the DMA would exercise control over the three services, it virtually makes the CDS the ‘Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces’. A new czar has risen.

358,2020/01/08,A battle over welfare: On Delhi Assembly polls,"Delhi, the Union Territory (UT) that hosts India’s capital city, might lag behind several States in total population and in area, but it enjoys outsize significance in terms of media and political attention. With 1.47 crore electors spread across the largely metropolitan national capital region and its pockets of rural voters in some suburbs, Delhi is expected, in polls scheduled on February 8, to reprise the three-cornered electoral fight which has been the norm in recent elections. The Aam Aadmi Party, which graduated from a social movement to a political party less than a decade ago, will now seek to stand on its governance record, five years after nearly sweeping the Assembly results in 2015. The Bharatiya Janata Party will hope that unlike in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, the legions of voters who supported it in the Lok Sabha election will not transfer their votes to its competitors, while the Congress will seek to regain the support of the UT’s poorer and marginalised sections, most of whom shifted allegiance to the AAP in 2015. The AAP, if multiple opinion polls are to be believed, is on a strong wicket despite its setback in the Lok Sabha election where it won only 18% of the votes for the third place behind the BJP’s 56.6% and the Congress’s 22.5%. A Centre for the Study of Developing Societies-Lokniti survey of May 2019 found that most of Delhi’s voters who voted against the AAP for other parties in the national elections wanted the party to return to power in the Assembly election. This dichotomy in support could be explained by the reasonable satisfaction among voters with the welfare and development work done by the Arvind Kejriwal led-government.

A PRS Legislative Research report has shown that Delhi spends the most — nearly 40% of its overall Budget allocation compared to an average of 23% elsewhere in India — on education, health, water supply and sanitation between 2011 and 2019. The AAP’s focus on improving government-run primary education, health care (the Mohalla clinic scheme in particular), lowering electricity and water supply costs besides easing public transport woes (through schemes such as free ridership for women in government-run buses) has earned the party strong campaign points. This could not yield it dividends in May, as the party still does not have a coherent ideological position or a national presence, while voters were concerned with other issues such as national security that favoured the BJP. The AAP’s incoherence on questions related to ideology was a drawback then, and that is the reason why it will seek to turn the polls into a referendum on its tenure. The BJP hopes to challenge the AAP on this turf after passing a Bill in December 2019 that came up with a legal framework to provide ownership rights to those living in Delhi’s unauthorised colonies. Whether this recent gesture, that is of importance to the roughly five million people in such areas, will sway voters remains to be seen.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-battle-over-welfare/article30506739.ece
359,2020/01/08,None for four: On Test format,"Brevity and quicksilver processes constitute a raging trend be it Twitter or two-minute noodles. It is in sync with the current era notorious for its shrinking attention spans and paucity of time. Organised sport too isn’t immune from this need to shorten formats. In this universe of instant gratification, Test cricket with its five-day schedule and breaks for lunch and tea, might seem an anachronism. It may boggle the mind that there were timeless Tests in the past during which a contest stretched beyond five days till a result was arrived at. That phase ended in 1939 as visiting squads were constrained by the urgency to catch a ship back home. Since those days of the slow life, cricket evolved and Tests now have two raucous siblings in One Day Internationals and Twenty20s, where a result is inevitable and the thrills, however transitory, seem limitless in these abridged formats. ODIs and T20s draw in the crowds and sponsors while Tests are now seen as an ageing matriarch lost to nostalgia and the prospect of ever-dwindling revenues. In a bid to bolster cricket’s original form, the International Cricket Council (ICC), is mulling over four-day Tests from 2023. Cold logic has trumped relevance and it is a move that will destroy the sanctity of Tests and all that it stood for.

The tussle spread over five days is considered as the ultimate benchmark for judging cricketing greatness. Batsmen have to cope with fast bowlers on a fresh first day pitch and also counter wily spinners on a wearing surface on the fifth day. The action gathers steam over four days before a spectacular combustion on the concluding day. Yes, in recent times many Tests have finished within three or four days and broadcasting companies that spend top-dollar for telecast rights, have to craft studio-analysis to justify their ad-inventory. Another factor is that the ICC is keen to create more space for various T20 leagues ranging from the Indian Premier League to the Big Bash in Australia besides supporting the World Cup for Twenty20s. However, a four-day Test will lack character. Imagine what would have happened during that epochal March in the summer of 2001 at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens where V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh inspired India to stun Steve Waugh’s Australians. If that Test had ended as a mere draw in four days, Indian cricket may not have progressed over the last decade-and-a-half. A five-day Test is the acme, a four-day one will slowly blur the distinction with limited overs cricket and it is a clear and present danger that players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Virat Kohli have recognised. It is time the ICC woke up to this reality.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/none-for-four/article30506740.ece
360,2020/01/08,BBMP to install plastic bollards on bus priority lane,"Two months after the bus priority lane on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) was introduced between Tin Factory and Silk Board, commuters, BMTC drivers and officials say that it is yet to reach its potential. Initially, after a flurry of campaigns, motorists for the most part followed the rules. But in the absence of a physical barrier and constant vigilance, private vehicles, especially two-wheelers, have started using the bus lane.

To tackle the problem, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to install plastic bollards designed by the Department of Urban Land Transport (DULT), along the bus priority lane. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that flexible plastic bollards will be installed, and in certain spots, there will be interlocking plastic barricades.

Officials hope that the plastic barriers will instil discipline among motorists.

In the early days, the civic body had installed metal bollards, many of which were damaged during the trial run. Owing to fear of accidents, the bollards were removed.

Citizens’ groups, which have been conducting their own campaigns urging people to switch to public transport, pointed out that barricades alone will not solve the problem. More signage and punitive action against errant drivers is required, they argued.

“I was on ORR on Tuesday morning and saw motorists, mostly on two-wheelers, using the bus lane,” said Prasad D. “Closer to Marathahalli, there was a traffic pile-up. Buses were on the priority lane, but they were blocked by other vehicles who were also using the lane. What I saw was a collapse of the concept.”

K.G. Mohan of Bellandur Jothege, who commutes frequently on ORR, said that awareness drives need to carried out at regular intervals. “Stringent punitive action should be taken against those who stray into the bus priority lane. Until there is strong enforcement of punishment, there won’t be tangible change,” he said.

The BMTC, which had launched an innovative social media campaign, is optimistic. C. Shikha, Managing Director, BMTC, said: “We are stabilising operations on the bus priority lane. They are improving day by day. Once everything is set and bus priority lane is expanded, our services will be more effective.”

BMTC drivers that The Hindu spoke to admitted that it’s not always a smooth ride on the stretch, and hoped that the plastic bollards will be a deterrent.

A BMTC bus driver said, “Since two-wheeler riders are conditioned to ride on the left of the road, they naturally get into the bus priority lane. If bollards are installed, it is easy to enforce lane discipline.”

DULT to submit design for bus priority lane

The Department of Urban Land Transport (DULT) has prepared a design for effective and sustainable implementation of bus priority lanes in the city, which it will submit to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

V. Ponnuraj, Chairman, DULT, said that the design was prepared at the behest of civic officials. “We have prepared a design based on the transportation engineering principles and practical knowledge. It includes practical solutions for handling vehicles at junctions and signals, installation of signages and colour codes. This will make the bus priority lane more efficient and sustainable,” he said.

He also said that other agencies involved in implementing bus priority lane, including the Bangalore Traffic Police (BTP) and BMTC, have been briefed about the design.

“We have spoken and taken inputs from all the agencies concerned. We have got a positive response from all the departments,” he added.

‘Police should go smart’

Citizens want the Bangalore Traffic Police to add violations on the bus lane to the Public Eye app, which allows users to submit photos or videos of violations. However, there is no provision for lane violation.

“Once violations on bus priority lane can be uploaded on the Public Eye app, it will encourage people not only to follow the rules but also make others follow them,” said a BMTC driver.

A marshal on ORR, who was monitoring traffic, said that it is not possible to catch every errant motorist. “Every day, I spot many violations. If I can take a picture or a video with the vehicle’s number plate and post it on the Public Eye app, it will be effective,” said the marshal.

Acknowledging the problems, senior police officials cited the lack of manpower and unwillingness on the part of motorists to obey rules. “Installing mannequins with cameras throughout the stretch will definitely help in bringing down such violations,” said an inspector.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/f0pv9u/article30516961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGDEDICATEDBUSLANEFORBMTCBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-install-plastic-bollards-on-bus-priority-lane/article30516962.ece
361,2020/01/08,BMTC conductor assaulted,"A BMTC conductor was attacked by a man on a moped when he tried to intervene in a fight between him and the bus driver. The conductor, Madesha, 39, sustained multiple injuries on the head, hands and legs, and is being treated at M.S. Ramaiah Hospital, said the police.

The incident took place on Monday when the BMTC bus was heading to Hebbal. According to the police, at BEL Circle, the driver started manoeuvring the bus to take a U-turn.

“Murthy, 31, who was on a moped, rebuked the bus driver for rash driving. This led to an argument. Murthy parked his moped in front of the bus and forced the driver to step out,” said a police officer.

The two men started arguing in the middle of the road. As traffic was being held up, and passengers were getting restless, Madesha got out of the bus to intervene. When he tried to pacify Murthy, the latter allegedly picked up a log of wood and attacked the conductor repeatedly.

“Madesha was rendered unconscious by a severe blow on the head,” the police officer added.

The driver and a few passengers caught Murthy while others took Madesha to M.S. Ramaiah Hospital. The Jalahalli police have arrested Murthy and charged him under Sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.

“The accused is a tender coconut vendor. He claims that he chased the bus from Yeshwantpur to BEL Circle as the driver had tried to knock him down,” said the police.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-conductor-assaulted/article30516661.ece
362,2020/01/08,Do we need to caution public about risk in entering K.R. Market: HC,"The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday said it may have to issue a direction to put up a notice board in front of K.R. Market to caution visitors that they are “exposed to risks by entering a market lacking in fire safety measures” if the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fails to act immediately to rectify lapses pointed out in the fire audit report of 2019.

Castigating the BBMP for its “lacklustre approach” in rectifying serious lapses in fire safety measures in the market complex, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar said that the “BBMP is neither bothered about citizens visiting the market nor those having their businesses inside the market complex.” The bench was hearing PIL petitions complaining about illegally allotted shops in the market blocking fire exits.

The bench made these observations in its order after noticing from the affidavit filed by Joint Commissioner (West), that the BBMP is unable to rectify some of the fire safety measures as there was no response to the tender while pointing out that those evicted from open approach areas around the market are re-occupying the area again and again.

Terming as “lame excuses” the reasons given for the delay in rectifying fire safety lapses, the bench also wondered how the BBMP could completely ignore fire safety aspects of the market complex, which sees at least 50,000 visitors every day and over 2 lakh visitors during festivals.

Building plan

The Joint Commissioner stated that the building plan of the market exists, but at present the plan is “missing”. It was pointed out by the counsel representing some shopkeepers that the plan was produced in court in 2013 in connection with another litigation.

As the Joint Commissioner stated that he had written to the Chief Engineer (Projects) enquiring about the plan but is yet to receive a response, the bench said that when it is obvious that the plan did exist, the Joint Commissioner was not helpless to trace the plan by approaching the Commissioner.

Declining to accept the affidavit filed by the Joint Commissioner, the bench adjourned further hearing till February 5 while directing the BBMP Commissioner to file a report on compliance of fire safety measures.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/x5cyc8/article30516377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGKRMARKETVENDORSENCRAOCHMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/do-we-need-to-caution-public-about-risk-in-entering-kr-market-hc/article30516378.ece
363,2020/01/08,Last date for schools to upload fees is January 31,"Private school managements, who refuse to display the fee structure, have been issued a strict warning by the government. The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has once again reiterated that they must immediately display the fee structure on the department’s website, failing which it will initiate legal action.

The last date to upload the fee structure for the 2020-21 academic year is January 31. The department had initially announced that the deadline would be December 31, but decided to extend it after many private schools did not comply with the order.

Managements have to give details of the fees for students in every grade and also upload the audit report of the previous financial year. The details will be updated on the department’s ‘Know My school’ page.

“Schools also have to upload the SSLC examination results along with the fee structure,” said an official.

The department has stipulated that the fee structure should include recurring costs. Managements are allowed to charge an additional differential fee that can vary depending on the location of the school. The additional fee ranges from 70% of the recurring fee in gram panchayat and town panchayat limits to about 100% in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) areas.

Besides this, schools are allowed to charge a special development fee of ₹2,500, but cannot hike the fees by more than 15% from the previous academic year.

D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that while they have no objection to declaring the fees, he criticised the fee structure mandated by the government on the grounds that it is rigid. “School managements are unable to comply with it. It does not consider all the costs that we incur. We want the department to hear our grievances, but they refuse to even engage in a dialogue with us,” he said.

The association has also demanded that the differential fee, based on location, should be done away with, and a common fee introduced.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/last-date-for-schools-to-upload-fees-is-january-31/article30516224.ece

The ambulance, which was transporting a patient in critical condition, collided with the motorcycle on Tuesday evening at Srinivagilu Junction in Ashok Nagar.

The deceased, Mohammed Monsoor, 28, a resident of Venkateshpura and Ibrahem Khaleelullah, 23, from Govindapura, worked at a jewellery shop together.

“They were travelling together after work; Mansoor was riding the motorbike while Ibrahim was riding pillion,” said a police officer. “The ambulance was ferrying a critically ill patient from St John’s To Manipal Hospital for treatment.”

Around 6.30 p.m. on Tuesday, the driver allegedly decided to go against traffic on a one-way road on Inner Ring Road at Srinivagilu Junction. As he was speeding, he collided with the motorbike.

Mansoor and Ibrahim fell on the ground and sustained severe injuries. They were immediately rushed to the Manipal Hospital for treatment where they succumbed to injuries on Wednesday.

365,2020/01/08,Metro rail smart card discount reduced from 15% to 5%,"Regular users of Namma Metro who have smart cards will have to shell out more for their daily commute.

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited on Wednesday announced that the discount offered on smart cards will be reduced from the current 15% to 5%. This will come into effect on January 20 for all smart card holders on both Green and Purple Lines.

The BMRCL, in a press release, cited various reasons for this decision from rise in operational costs to a poor showing this financial year.

“The move to upgrade three-car train sets to six cars have increased the operational expenses, besides a general increase in the cost of services. However, BMRCL’s base fares have not been revised from the year 2017. In the financial year 2019-20, the likely net cash loss is estimated to be ₹60 crore,” read the release.

According to BMRCL’s data, around 62% of metro commuters use smart cards, while the rest buy tokens. To popularise smart card usage, it had been advertising the 15% discount, but with the new nominal 5% discount, those who don’t use the metro every day are questioning whether it is cost-effective.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/miae14/article30514978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08METROSMARTCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/metro-rail-smart-card-discount-cut-from-15-to-5/article30514979.ece

367,2020/01/08,Solid waste management bylaws finalised,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has finalised the solid waste management (SWM) bylaws, which will be tabled before the civic council for approval.

The draft SWM bylaws that call for separate tenders for dry and wet waste collection were notified in August 2019, as per rule 15 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, following which public objections and suggestions were invited. According to senior civic officials, they received nearly 40 objections from various civil society organisations, non-government organisations, and residents’ welfare associations.

‘Increase penalties’

While most organisations, including Solid Waste Management Round Table (SWMRT) and CIVIC, largely supported the bylaws, they said that penalties for various offences were less and needed to be enhanced. “Many organisations felt that enforcement on the ground will be effective only if penalties are prohibitive,” sources said.

Some organisations had raised objections to the bulk waste generator classification. Under the new classification, anyone who generated more than 10 kg is said to be a bulk waste generator. Sandya Narayanan from SWMRT said they had pointed out to the inequity in the system that did not match the SWM Rules. While the BBMP collects waste from households at no charge, bulk generators have to pay for services. They urged the BBMP to align the definition of bulk waste generators to address the issue.

Most organisations, especially SWMRT, sought segregated collection of waste, as the BBMP had set up separate infrastructure for both wet and dry. They also urged the civic body to not go back on separate collection of segregated waste, as envisaged in the new garbage tenders.

While there is a dedicated budget for SWM, the user charge is minimal compared to the cost incurred. Organisations suggested that the BBMP rationalise the user charges or SWM cess, which is the fee imposed to provide waste collection, transportation, processing, and disposal. “We have taken into account the suggestions and objections received, based on which modifications have been made to the SWM bylaws. Once approved by BBMP council, the same will be sent to the Urban Development Department for final notification,” sources in the BBMP said.

Each State is expected to notify bylaws within a year of SWM Rules 2016.

However, the State government had empowered the BBMP to notify the bylaws as the challenges of the city were different from other urban centres in the State.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xzol7i/article30509842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGGARBAGEWASTECOLLECTIONAGGREGATIONANDDISPOSAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/solid-waste-management-bylaws-finalised/article30509844.ece

371,2020/01/08,Six persons awarded Infosys Prize for 2019,"Economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen stressed upon the “constructive role of friendship” and the damages of divisiveness after he gave away the Infosys Prize for 2019 to the winners on Tuesday.

Prof. Sen, who was the chief guest, said there are deep links between friendship and knowledge. “Our intellectual horizons expand when we learn from each other. We can give to the world much more than what we get from it. For example, the mathematical revolution in India from the fifth century onwards, led particularly by Aryabhata, was influenced by intellectual developments in Greece, Babylon and Rome, but Aryabhatian mathematics, in turn, took gigantic leaps in India, and then spread abroad, with transformational impact on China, on the Arab world and eventually on Europe.”

The awards, instituted by the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF), were given to six persons for their contributions in the fields of Engineering and Computer Science, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences. The winners were felicitated with a gold medal, a citation and a prize purse of $100,000.

Among the winners was Anand Pandian, Department of Anthropology, Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, who was honoured for his “imaginative work on ethics, selfhood and the creative process.” Professor Pandian said, “Research depends upon some inkling of the destination ahead. Good science requires faith in the moment and the journey. But these are dark and difficult times for such conviction. We sometimes find that the institutions we rely upon may sacrifice creative vision for narrow-minded calculation. All around the world, we see violence and suffering when we can ensue when hard lines are drawn between those who belong and those who don’t; those who have a place, and others cast out to survive as they will. We share this world with countless beings. We must try and find a way to live with these differences.”

374,2020/01/08,Chennai’s OMR residents urge government to take up Phase II of widening the road,"Residents of Rajiv Gandhi Salai, also known as OMR or the IT Expressway, have urged the State government to take up widening in phase-II of the road from Siruseri to Mamallapuram on a war footing.

In 2012, the State Government sanctioned ₹260 crore for acquiring land for the project that requires nearly 200 acres from 13 revenue villages. The consultant for the project had submitted the detailed project report in 2014. The 26.8 km-long road is currently a four-lane stretch with a median and will be widened into a six-lane facility as per the plan.

“Even phase I from Madhya Kailash is not in good shape. The service lanes are of uneven surfaces and motorists park on the sides usurping pedestrian space. Phase II is even worse. Potholes and bad patches are common. Traffic snarls too, happen almost daily. Motorists have to use only the main road as there are no other alternative routes,” said S. Lakshmi, a resident of Thoraipakkam.

Though thousands of flats and individual houses, colleges, schools, hotels and companies have come up along the stretch, residents said that there is no attempt on part of the government to provide basic services.

V. S. Ramana, a resident of Navalur, said the vehicle users pay toll fee and face hurdles including stray cattle that lead to accidents, in the stretch that needs to be widened. “The road remains narrow and has mud and cattle. The localities nearby have bad roads and storm water drains and sewer lines are yet to be laid. If the road is widened, it would help reduce jams that seem to happen at all times of the day,” said G. Murugan, who takes this stretch frequently to Puducherry.

Residents have been suggesting that the toll plaza at Navalur be moved to Mamallapuram where the road ends. “Crossing the toll plaza takes a lot of time, especially during rush hour. The road beyond the toll is no match to what is on phase I,” said S. Kannan, a resident.

Meanwhile work is underway for the formation of two new by-passes for Kelambakkam and Thiruporur. One by-pass, running to a length of 4.67 km, will connect Padur and Thaiyyur-B village, by-passing Kelambakkam. Similarly, the other by-pass of 5.75 km takes off in Kalavakkam and joins Vengaleri by-passing Thiruporur.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rzmw1f/article30513595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08JANTH-OMR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-omr-residents-urge-government-to-take-up-phase-ii-of-widening-the-road/article30513596.ece
375,2020/01/08,Chennai’s Vidyodaya School alumni donate refrigerators to the school,"In a step to give back to their alma mater and contribute towards its development, the class of 1969 of Vidyodaya School have come together now, and donated two refrigerators for biology labs that will help students.

Sudha Ramalingam, an alumni of the school from the batch of 1969, said, “This is our humble contribution; but we want to talk about it because it may inspire many others to come forward to do something for the institution that has done so much for its students.”

She recollected how decades ago, when she was a student, she was thrilled to go for her science lab sessions. “The lab had a skeleton on display and I still vividly remember the lessons on introduction to various body parts and their functioning,” she said.

Nandita Krishnan, correspondent of Vidyodaya Schools Society, said, “It’s great when old students connect and give something for their school. Some of the alumni are also planning to provide sanitary napkin vending machines and incinerators too.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/s7lpi1/article30511836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08JANTH-Vidyodayajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-vidyodaya-school-alumni-donate-refrigerators-to-the-school/article30511837.ece
376,2020/01/08,Private equity inflows into Chennai real estate market dip 45% in 2019: study,"Private equity players largely steered clear of the Chennai real estate market in 2019 -- the city saw inflows decline by 45% when compared to last year, according to study by a real estate consultant.

Private equity inflows into the Chennai real estate market declined to $370 million in 2019 from $675 million in 2018, according to ANAROCK Property Consultants Pvt. Ltd. However, the difference between the two years is that one of the deals was large in value terms in 2018. Mapletree Investments invested over $350 million in SP Infocity in one single large deal in 2018, Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO – ANAROCK Capital, said.

“The decline in total inflows in Chennai in 2019 doesn’t really reflect any losing interest of the private equity players. Such a decline in overall inflows is inevitable because there are years when large deals (in value terms) happen and in others smaller ones,” he added.

For instance, he pointed out in 2018 five private deals happen in the city, during the year and similarly in 2019 also the same number of deals materialized.

Overall, Indian real estate attracted more than $5 billion private equity inflows in 2019 -- recording a marginal drop of 2% against the preceding year, the study said. Of the total, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Delhi New Capital Region together received close to $2.7 billion.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jht0st/article30511711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08JANTH-REALESTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/private-equity-inflows-into-chennai-real-estate-market-dip-45-in-2019-study/article30511713.ece
377,2020/01/08,Parents start online petition for more occupational therapists in Tamil Nadu government schools,"It was to address the need for occupational therapists that forced B. Dhanya Vardhini to start an online petition to attract the Chief Minister’s attention. “I am a parent of a special needs child who really wants to make a change in our child’s life. We rely on therapies and in order to get good quality therapy we travel 40 km daily,” she wrote. Over 25,000 parents have signed her petition so far.

Ms. Dhanya lives in Guduvanchery and travels two hours daily to T. Nagar for therapy for her 7-year-old son who is on the autism spectrum. “He is mildly autistic. In mainstream schools, he doesn’t get therapy. We take him to different places for speech, occupational therapy and special education,” she said.

She moved from Thoothukudi to Chennai as the school there offered only a fortnightly therapy session. “A small primary school in an interior area accepted him but branded schools did not want him,” she said.

Shanthi’s* only concern too, was to find a school that would accept her son who has autism. The government school in Medavakkam did. “The teachers have accepted him as he is,” she said.

The Medavakkam school is among the few to have special educators. But the therapists are required to visit many schools leaving little room for the dedicated training that students require.

When Thamaraiselvi moved from Coimbatore to Chennai she thought better facilities would be available for her moderately autistic, hyperactive 8-year-old son. As no school offered personal attention, this resident of Perungalathur travels to Thoraipakkam for special education classes. “We need an occupational therapist, a speech therapist and special educators. In Coimbatore everything was under one roof. I spend Rs. 30,000 a month on therapies alone,” she said.

The State government, when it decided to appoint an occupational therapist in every district headquarters hospital’s psychiatry department, designated them as technicians in low pay grades. As a result, only 11 of 18 posts were filled, pointed out a therapist.

P. Raghuram, convener of the Tamil Nadu branch of All India Occupational Therapists’ Association said, ""We expect to get a council for OT by this year. We have urged college principals to register their graduates. In the next few years, each school will definitely have OTs. We are also trying to get the government to designate us as therapists,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wvm6l0/article30511198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08JANTH-OT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/parents-start-online-petition-for-more-occupational-therapists-in-tamil-nadu-government-schools/article30511199.ece
378,2020/01/08,Bharat bandh: Trade Union members detained in Chennai’s Anna Salai,"Protesters who were on the streets as part of the nation-wide strike called by trade unions, had a heated exchange of words with police when the latter attempted to remove them from Anna Salai.

As the protesters squatted on the arterial road blocking vehicular traffic, police forcibly removed them and bundled them into police vehicles.

The strike call was made to protest against the “anti-working class policies of the Modi-led government.” The employees of banks, Income tax department, BSNL, Postal department were staging demonstrations in the city.

On Anna Salai, the leaders of The Central Trade Unions (CTUs) namely INTUC, AITUC, CITU, LPF along with independent federations and associations from various sectors staged a demonstration. They shouted slogans seeking reversal of the anti-worker, anti-people, anti-national policies of the Government.

LPF General Secretary M. Shanmugam said the government, after failing to tackle a crisis ridden economy is busy in privatising and selling PSUs, natural resources and other national assets, which is detrimental to the national interest and national development.

The trade unions said in a statement that 12 airports have already been “sold out to private hands,” 100% sale of Air India has already been decided upon, the decision to sell BPCL taken, BSNL-MTNL merger announced and 93,600 telecom workers already thrown out of work under the garb of voluntary retirement scheme. The privatisation of railways is being pursued in steps, attempts to privatise railway production units are being made, forcible merger of banks, despite opposition from employees and officers unions, and 100% FDI in the coal sector is also on the cards.

The leaders also said privatisation of power and road transport as well as moves to encourage private insurance companies of Indian and foreign origin to weaken the public sector in insurance are being pursued. It is a policy to put the national assets and resources on sale.

M.Durai Pandian, General Secretary of Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers' Union said, in Tamil Nadu, over one lakh Central Government Employees are participating in the strike.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i1hrp3/article30510900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thiruma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bharat-bandh-trade-union-members-detained-in-chennais-anna-salai/article30510816.ece

380,2020/01/08,"Congress cadre, protesters clash at Valluvar Kottam","Tension prevailed here on Tuesday after Congress cadres who were protesting against the attack on JNU students, engaged in an argument with another group of protesters at Valluvar Kottam. Congress leader K.S. Alagiri himself came down from the dais and questioned their act.

Youth Congress and National Students’ Union of India organised a protest at Valluvar Kottam on Tuesday evening. Another group comprising students of city colleges, civil right activists and alumni of JNU gathered there and were shouting slogans condemning the Modi government for passing the controversial citizenship law. Even as the protest by the Congress cadre was in progress, the other group took to shouting slogans. Some of the Congress party workers asked them to stop but they did not do so. There was brief of exchange of words between them. and however both sides were pacified.

Speaking at the venue, Secretary of All India Congress Committee, Sanjay Dutt, who is in charge of the party’s Tamil Nadu affairs condemned the attack on the students. He said the country is witnessing undemocratic government and Modi government is stifling the voice of the youth of the country.

Mr. Alagiri said the ruling AIADMK government has committed a blunder in detaining people who had drawn anti-CAA kolams. After their protest was wound up, Mr. Alagiri met the other protesting group and questioned them for raising slogans while the Congress meeting was on. This was followed by heated exchange of words. Mr. Alagiri then along with his men left the venue.

Protesters from the other group claimed that the Deputy Commissioner of Triplicane had allowed them to conduct their protest in the same venue every day.

385,2020/01/08,"Chennai’s lost, neglected pavements","A sad lack of respect for pavements gives grief to pedestrians in Chennai. Well-laid pavements with bollards are quickly vandalised, making them convenient for vehicular parking and for two-wheelers to whiz past. As a result, pedestrians are forced to walk on the roads, endangering life and limb.

Pavements with paverblocks and granite stones were laid on the Rajiv Gandhi Salai for pedestrians a few years ago. Today, the pavement, supposedly dedicated for pedestrians to walk safe, has become a regular route for motorists to drive in reckless manner, rendering its original purpose invalid.

“There are no clear pavements here for pedestrians. Everywhere, footpaths have been damaged due to vehicles and other encroachments. A part of the service road was used by people to walk. Even on that, we now have lots of encroachments in the form of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) cables and autorickshaw parking. It is a maze. Pedestrians have to negotiate all these hurdles to reach their destination,” said Harsha Koda, co-ordinator, Federation of OMR (Old Mahabalipuram Road) Residents Welfare Associations.

Velachery worst-hit

The situation is much worse on the 100 Feet Road in Velachery, which is one of the densely populated areas in the city. S. Kumararaja, the Velachery Annai Indira Nagar Residents’ Welfare Assocition said, “During peak hours, motorists are least bothered about pedestrians as they run their vehicles on the pavement, without giving space for pedestrians to use the area demarcated for them.”

Social activist Traffic Ramasamy said neatly laid footpaths and pavements were broken at several places in the city or, since they have been encroached upon recklessly, pedestrians are forced to walk on the busy roads.”

In the heart of city — in Egmore, Royapettah and Triplicane — footpaths are encroached upon by garages, parked two-wheelers, bunk shops, iron shops, signboards of shopskeepers, mannequins, hawkers and innumerable other encroachments. Sometimes, even a police patrol vehicle is parked on a pavement. The long stretch of pavement from Pallavan Salai to the Central Railway Station is scarcely used by anyone who walks, and is instead used by homeless people with no other options by way of shelter, to sleep at night.

Even in Pondy Bazaar, with its “fancy” walking space, two-wheelers have slowly encroached upon the vast area of pavements.

K. P. Subaramanian, former professor in Anna University’s Urban Engineering Department, said, “Walking is a green mode of transport with minimum energy consumption and zero emission. It’s inexpensive and immensely healthy. Nevertheless, it is neglected in favour of motorised modes [of transport]. About 85% of the transport infrastructure investment for Chennai city is expended on roads, bridges and flyovers, and an insignificant percentage of around 10% is spent for walking infrastructure. Chennai compares poorly with Delhi and Hyderabad, for those cities invest about 45% and 40%, respectively, on non-motorised transport (NMT, that is, walking and cycling) infrastructure, as per 2010 data from the Ministry of Urban Affairs.”

Chennai was among the very few cities in the country to adopt the NMT Policy in 2014, which mandates a minimum of 60% of its capital budget be allocated to NMT infrastructure. Chennai is a compact city with mixed land use, an ideal precondition for walking, for shorter trips, and as a feeder mode to go to or return from railway stations/ bus terminals/ stops.

Targets unmet

Accordingly, the Corporation, with a holistic and forward-thinking project, set an ambitious target to retrieve about 70 roads from encroachments, and widened footpaths even when this required reducing the road width, with a substantial investment.

However, those projects did not yield expected results.

Improved footpaths are very handy and helpful to eateries, hawkers and shoppers to encroach. The city has about 54 lakh two-wheelers and 12 lakh of four-wheelers, whereas parking space available is only for 3 lakh vehicles.

Professor Subramanian said, “The awful inadequacy of parking space cannot be a justification for indiscriminate parking, and that too on footpaths, because parking is a commodity and not a right that can be demanded, like road space itself. Therefore, parking space should be purchased by the vehicle owner or it should be facilitated by the concerned shopper or enterprise. The Corporation or the government are not obliged to provide it.”

‘Will initiate action’

In light of the above, members of the public are sceptical about the inability and failure of the authorities to prevent misuse of public properties. The Greater Chennai Corporation, in co-ordination with the Traffic Police, as a first step, should seize vehicles parked on footpaths and go ahead with the continuous upgradation and building of footpaths in tune with the NMT Policy. A senior Traffic Police officer said, “We are constantly removing encroachments whenever we receive complaints, either from the public or the Chennai Corporation. We will initiate action against motorists who park their vehicles on the pavements, damaging public property meant for pedestrians.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/whf9sg/article30507458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THPAVERBLOCKROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-lost-neglected-pavements/article30507459.ece
386,2020/01/08,HC clears decks for release of Rajinikanth-starrer 'Darbar',"The Madras High Court on Tuesday cleared the decks for the worldwide release of Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar, reportedly made at a cost of ₹220 crore, on Thursday. It ordered that the movie should not be released in Malaysia alone if Lyca Productions fails to furnish a bank guarantee for ₹4.9 crore until the disposal of a civil suit filed by a Malaysian film distributor.

Justice G. Jayachandran passed the interim order on an application preferred by DMY Creation SDN BHD of Malaysia seeking to restrain the worldwide release of Darbar until Lyca Productions settles its dues to the tune of ₹23.70 crore. The applicant also insisted on attaching the positive, negative and digital storage of Darbar until the disposal of the civil suit.

According to the applicant company, it had entered into an agreement with Lyca Productions on December 11, 2017, for the exhibition and distribution of rights of Robot 2.0 across Malaysia and paid ₹20 crore to the production firm for the outright purchase of the rights for a period of 10 years. However, the release of the movie got delayed beyond a reasonable time.

On coming to know that the delay in release was because of financial constraints, DMY Creation supposedly offered a loan of ₹12 crore to Lyca Productions. It was also reportedly agreed that the total amount of ₹32 crore would carry an interest of 30% per annum and that the production house should offer the distribution rights of its future projects too to the applicant company.

In June 6, 2018, Lyca released Rajinikanth starrer Kaala and gave the distribution rights to DMY Creation on profit sharing basis. Since that movie collected only ₹4.38 crore in Malaysia, the applicant paid ₹2.7 crore to Lyca. Similarly, out of ₹2.69 crore collected by Chekka Sivandha Vaanam, the applicant paid ₹1.5 crore to Lyca.

A similar formula was adopted for various other movies including Vada Chennai, Maari 2 and Vandha Rajavaathan Varuven. In the meantime, Robot 2.0 also got released on November 9, 2018. Suddenly, when Darbar was about to be released, Lyca refused to give its distribution rights to DMY Creation and hence the present civil suit.

Allegations denied

Lyca Productions, in its counter denied all allegations, and stated that it was a financially sound company which had no necessity to borrow money. It claimed that the applicant company had purchased the outright distribution rights of Robot 2.0 for ₹20 crore and that of Kaala on payment of ₹12 crore which was now being projected as a loan.

Lyca also claimed that it was actually DMY which was yet to settle ₹1.59 crore for having distributed various movies. In support of its contention, Lyca relied upon an agreement and an e-mail sent to DMY regarding the distribution rights of Kaala but on perusing those two documents, the judge found that they did not contain any signatures.

Stating that the dispute was primarily as to whether the ₹12 crore offered by DMY Creations was a loan or a consideration for distribution rights of Kaala, the judge said, all contentious issues could be decided only during the final hearing of the civil suit.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i939i8/article30507978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/darbar1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-clears-decks-for-release-of-rajinikanth-starrer-darbar/article30507424.ece
387,2020/01/08,Corporation workers demand permanent jobs,"Corporation workers on Tuesday staged a protest demanding roll back of the decision to privatise conservancy operations. They also demanded the Greater Chennai Corporation to give permanent jobs to 14,000 temporary workers who have been hired in the past few years in various Departments.

The Corporation has privatised conservancy operations, announcing the decision on a new system of conservancy operations last month.

Roll back privatisation

Following the protest on Tuesday, representatives of the conservancy workers of the Corporation met with the Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash and requested a repeal of the decision.

The Commissioner said the decision was taken because of the government policy to implement conservancy work under private public partnership mode. “Over 14,000 employees are working for more than ten years. They should get permanent jobs. Otherwise they will lose their livelihood. Corporation officials have assured us that the private employees will have job security after privatisation,” an employee said.

Workers at the protest also alleged that the Corporation was not providing brooms to sweep roads. Most workers were forced to purchase brooms with money from their own pockets in order to sweep roads. “The Chennai Corporation failed to get the opinion of workers before taking the decision to privatise conservancy operations,” an employee said.

Policemen at the Ripon Buildings’ gate allegedly manhandled women conservancy workers who tried to participate. Some were even dragged and pushed around, preventing them from entering the premises.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-workers-demand-permanent-jobs/article30507407.ece

389,2020/01/08,"Residential sales in city saw a year-on-year growth of 6% in 2019, says study","Residential launches in Chennai grew by 11% year on year (YoY) to 11,542 units in 2019.

This growth momentum was marginalised in the second half of 2019 as launches dwindled to -2% YoY on account of the credit crunch being faced by developers and slow demand, according to a report by Knight Frank India.

The twelfth edition of its flagship half-yearly report — India Real Estate: H2 2019 — which presents a comprehensive analysis of the residential and office market performance across eight major cities for the July-December 2019 (H2 2019) period.

The report establishes 2019 to be a year of much-awaited stability and recovery for Chennai’s residential real estate, with sales rising by 6% YoY to 16,959 units in 2019 and launches rising by 11% YoY to 11,542 units.

South Chennai, which includes Perumbakkam, Chromepet, Sholinganallur, Guduvancheri and Kelambakkam, accounted for the highest number of launches as well as sales at 9,145 units (49% YoY increase) and at 11,409 units (9% YoY increase), respectively in 2019.

The sub ₹3 million (₹30 lakh) ticket size segment has been and continues to be the most transacted residential segment in the Chennai market.

Srinivas Anikipatti, Senior Director - Tamil Nadu & Kerala, Knight Frank India, said, “Primary drivers of the residential demand have been the ready-to-move-in units and the affordable housing segment.”

Office transactions in Chennai were at an all-time high of 0.5 mnsq m (5.2 million square feet (mnsqft)) in 2019, registering a 50% YoY increase.

391,2020/01/08,Retrieving ideas of democracy and nation,"Within much of modern Indian thought, the idea of India as a nation implied the assumption that it would invariably be a democracy — i.e., India realising itself or constituting itself as a nation will necessarily do so as a democracy. The relationship between the two was not problematised.

There were some exceptions though: the Gandhians laid stress on Swaraj but this idea, while not being not opposed to democracy, did not directly connote self-rule of the citizen-community. The socialists and communists who were interested in the idea of democracy, and uncoupling it from the idea of nation, tended to lay stress on the economic prerequisites and redistribution of power to realise the former. There were some thinkers such as V.D. Savarkar who argued that the idea of nation took shape in India in the epochal past, but they dwelt little on democracy. Some Islamic scholars such as Maulana Maududi introduced concepts such as “theo-democracy”, i.e., the mode of self-rule where believers ordain their common affairs; but apart from the hierarchisation and exclusion such a conception threw up, it was hardly linked to the idea of nation as a bond or fellowship that marks it off from every other kindred entity. There were those who thought through the lens of caste, examples being E.V. Ramaswami Naicker, K.M. Panikkar and B.R. Ambedkar and also Adivasi leaders such as Jaipal Singh, who argued that the idea of nation has to be profoundly rethought in India and that such rethinking was needed to foreground democracy in an anticipatory mode.

While posing the relation between the ideas of the nation and democracy before the emerging public in India in this fashion is a gross simplification, and the arguments that people made and the positions they took were far more complex, this debate came to an abrupt end, or merely became the ideological fixtures of political parties, once India embraced constitutional democracy and held periodic elections under universal adult franchise. Interestingly, certain measures that the current government has embraced in the name of constitutional rectitude have reopened new fissures within the Indian body polity. It has made it imperative that we reopen the relation between the nation and democracy in India afresh even to sustain meaningful versions of constitutional democracy and periodic elections.

Trajectory of democracy

There were complex questions that had to be explored in the wake of Independence, and particularly following Partition. One was if India is a nation, what kind of a nation is it? If democracy is the mode of political association of this nation, what kind of democracy is conducive to it? However, giving short shrift to these questions, an amazing constitutional architecture came to be put in place. Amid a setting of bewildering social diversity and inequalities, India stepped into holding periodic elections on the basis of universal adult franchise.

The elite who were at the helm of operationalising constitutional democracy and periodic franchise made some place for diversity and preferential considerations to the disadvantaged in the Indian public. Some were aware of the course such a complex constitutional and institutional ship was to set sail in and were apprehensive of its future course. Others wished it bon voyage for a variety of reasons including utility calculations. Whichever way one looked at it through a phalanx of institutions dovetailed to constitutional democracy and periodic elections, the elite thought the future of India lay in operationalising a set course of action rather than rethinking its foundations.

The course of action that India took came to be theorised by the likes of the late Rajni Kothari who argued that democracy is alive and kicking by accommodating diversity within the policy-making process through a distinct type of party system, that he termed one-party dominance. There was much claptrap that came from elsewhere too.

Comparativists such as Atul Kohli argued that India demonstrated “a delicate balance” between “forces of centralization and decentralization” and “the interests of the powerful” have been pursued “without fully excluding the weaker groups”. Consociationalists such as Arend Lijphart thought that the Indian case demonstrated that democracy is viable — in spite of diversity and inequality — if it accommodates them in the governing institutions of a polity. These arguments came to be profoundly qualified by their proponents later, in the context of the failure or inadequacy of these institutions, and the rise of powerful dissent movements from below. However, their emphasis remained on rectification of the course and the institutions and policy measures arising therefrom, rather than envisaging the future of India beyond these confines.

A notion of the nation

The rise of the ruling party has placed a particular notion of the nation on the political agenda, and it has sought to refract constitutional democracy and elections through it. It has confined constitutional democracy to the bare letter of the law and periodic elections to merely subserve a majority in the House. In the process it has shorn them off from even residual considerations of democracy as the self-rule of the citizen community and the nation as the outcome of this process.

One of the most ominous expressions of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s version of the nation is found in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, 2019 and the National Register of Citizens, allegedly on the anvil but officially denied in the face of widespread resistance. Several commentators have already pointed out that the CAA calls into question the foundations of citizenship in India, the role and place of the majority in a political democracy and minority rights and reorders them to suit the notion of the nation the current ruling dispensation cherishes.

How do we go about retrieving ideas of democracy and nation authentic to our context? One route leading to the same is subjecting the demands that the popular upsurge has voiced after the dilution of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, and particularly following the enactment of the CAA, to reflective consideration. There are many angularities to the popular upsurge of the scale that we are witnessing in India today. But certain issues stand out if we read the kind of slogans that have been voiced, the songs that reverberate, paintings and plays that hold the crowds in rapt attention, and the extent and intensity of participation, and connect them to the popular demands that have been voiced by the very same people overtime.

In the Northeast, there is a widespread feeling that the CAA has watered down the autonomy that they sought for their culture, language, and land rights and very forcefully voiced before the Bordoloi Committee of the Constituent Assembly. The large-scale participation of Muslims in this upsurge demonstrates that they do not want to be kept out but be treated as equal citizens. There is universal outrage about the communication blockade in the Kashmir Valley.

But what is more is the participation of the rest, especially students in this movement. They seem to be saying: We do not want you to shove down our throat your pet notions of the nation and rules. Stop befuddling us with your doubletalk. There are matters of much more profound concern and urgency that we need to put upfront, and since they can be pursued only together, we need to reopen a conversation across our divides. The nation can only be that big and small that such a conversation affords.

While this popular upsurge does not give us a full-blown ideal of democracy that we wish to be and the image of the nation it recasts, the indicators are all there to see. There is a surplus in the ideas of nation and democracy that formal rules of law and modes of representation can never exhaust, and you cannot trump the former by invoking the latter.
