1,2020/01/10,ATP Cup | Goffin upsets Nadal to keep Belgium alive in quarter-final,"David Goffin claimed an upset victory over world number one Rafael Nadal on Friday in Sydney to keep Belgium alive in their quarter-final clash at the inaugural ATP Cup team event.

Goffin, ranked 11 in the world, proved to be one of the few players who can handle Nadal's heavy spin, which he did with aplomb on both the return of serve and in general baseline play, to claim a 6-4 7-6(3) victory.

The tie will now be decided by a high-stakes doubles match, after Spain claimed the opening singles early in the evening when Roberto Bautista Agut defeated Kimmer Coppejans 6-1 6-4.

The winners of the deciding doubles will play Australia in Saturday's semi-final, while Serbia, led by world number two Novak Djokovic, take on Russia.

SERBIA ADVANCE

In the day session, Serbia's Novak Djokovic battled through a stirring challenge from rising Canadian star Denis Shapovalov to propel his country into the semi-finals with a 4-6 6-1 7-6(4) victory.

It was Djokovic's fifth victory over the 20-year-old Canadian in as many clashes but by far the toughest, after Shapovalov controlled significant portions of the match played in Australia's intense summer heat.

The victory, set up earlier by Serbia's Dusan Lajovic's upset win over Canadian teenager Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4 6-2, means Serbia will play Russia in the semi-final, where Djokovic will face the in-form world number five Daniil Medvedev.

The vocal crowds appear to be playing a pivotal role in the latter stages of the team event, after lifting host nation Australia on Thursday and then Serbia on Friday. Djokovic said after the match he understood Shapovalov's frustration as the noise level kept threatening to interrupt play.

“They were so loud, they were engaged, sometimes a little bit too much,” said Djokovic.

“It was a Davis Cup-like atmosphere,” he said, referring to the traditional men's team tennis event to which the ATP Cup is being compared.

Djokovic lost the first set against the heavy-swinging Canadian and struggled very early in the second before momentum shifted abruptly.

After some late third-set drama, where the two exchanged breaks of serve, the match fittingly entered into a tiebreak.

Shapovalov looked the more likely to prevail - but the Serbian had a joker up his sleeve he has successfully deployed over the years in tense situations.

He simply refused to miss, daring his younger rival to find a way to hit seven winners and claim the tiebreak.

It was too much for the Canadian, and, after floating a ground stroke long, Djokovic raised his arms in victory.

2,2020/01/10,How Big Tech is helping transform cars into smartphones,"Technology companies transformed smartphones and televisions into continuous fountains of revenue. Now, big tech wants to work with automakers to do the same thing for your car.

With the widespread rollout of autonomous vehicles still years away, the two industries have converged on the idea of cars providing services and features delivered “over the air” — that is, over the same wireless data networks used by smart phones.

Those services — streaming video, vehicle performance upgrades, dashboard commerce — could answer a pressing need for automakers. They need to learn how to milk their hardware for revenue long after vehicles roll off dealers’ lots. Tech companies see cars and the time people spend in them as a new frontier for growth.

Both auto and tech companies used the big CES technology show here this week to showcase their determination to make the vision of vehicles as connected revenue machines a reality. Cloud computing giants Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were in the forefront, chasing the opportunity to manage torrents of data flowing to and from connected vehicles.

It’s absolutely huge, General Motors Co President Mark Reuss said in December of the opportunities to generate revenue after a vehicle is sold by providing streamed services and over-the-air upgrades facilitated by GM’s new high-capacity on-board electrical system.

The pivot comes at a time when global automakers are looking for fresh revenue sources as sales slow and as rising costs to comply with tougher emissions standards threaten profit margins. Shares of legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co and GM badly lagged broader market indexes in 2019. The contrast is Tesla Inc, whose market cap on Wednesday for the first time exceeded Ford and GM’s combined market values.

Tesla pioneered the model for charging for over-the-air upgrades, now asking customers to pay $6,000 to turn on the full self-driving option.

Other automakers are eager to try their hand at turning cars into upgradeable, revenue-generating gadgets.

Chinese carmaker Byton’s new M-Byte sedan features a 48-inch screen as a dashboard, as well as a steering-wheel display and a digital tablet for passengers. When parked, the car can be an office, enabling video conference calls, or a roadside cinema.

BMW showed at its CES display a concept of its future interior with reclining lounge chairs and a wind-shield with augmented reality built in to annotate the road ahead. BMW executive Klaus Froehlich told Reuters that the automaker is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get U.S. approval for the seats, but could not say when they would appear in production.

Tech companies and suppliers want to accelerate the transformation of vehicles into subscription bundle-ready machines by helping automakers sort out the tangle of computer chips that make most current vehicles difficult or impossible to upgrade over the air.

The current crazy quilt of vehicle processors is not cost-effective, and it’s hard to get (vehicles) developed and launched so that everything works all the time, said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of auto supplier Aptiv Plc. Aptiv’s solution: A new Smart Vehicle Architecture that consolidates most computerised functions.

Harman, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, is also pushing a similar digital platform to control the flow of data in and out of the car. A centralized system, said Chief Executive Dinesh Paliwal, would help protect the car against hackers, who would have only one way in rather than dozens.

Harman, which supplies some of the technology that automakers, including Tesla, use to deliver the over-the-air upgrades, plans to sell its new vehicle computing brain with cybersecurity features built in. However, some car buyers will have to pay to turn it on.

Qualcomm Inc, which already provides the cellular modem chips that allow vehicles to connect to the Internet, introduced a more comprehensive computing system that can manage in-vehicle entertainment and help the car drive itself. One element is a much easier way for automakers and their partners to deliver feature upgrades, such as unlocking a better sound system already built into the car.

NXP Semiconductors is working on a chip that would serve as a gateway between the car and the cloud, to help automakers cope with the massive amounts of data that sensors and digital cockpits will create.

That data has to be stored and managed, and that’s where cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services come in.

5,2020/01/10,US announces new sanctions on Iran after missile strikes,"The Trump administration on Friday announced a new wave of sanctions on Iran following this week’s missile strikes by the Islamic Republic on U.S. bases in Iraq.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the new sanctions will target eight senior Iranian officials involved in “destabilising” activities in the Middle East as well as Tuesday’s missile strike, which came in retaliation for the US killing of a senior Iranian general in a drone strike.

Mr. Mnuchin said President Donald Trump will issue an executive order imposing sanctions on anyone involved in the Iranian textile, construction, manufacturing or mining sectors.

They will also impose separate sanctions against the steel and iron sectors.

“As a result of these actions we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime,” the treasury secretary said.

The administration has already reinstated all the US sanctions that were eased under the 2015 nuclear deal, which has caused significant economic hardship in Iran and cut its oil exports to historic lows.

6,2020/01/10,Iranian missile downed airliner: Trudeau,"Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday multiple intelligence sources indicate that Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner after it took off from Tehran, killing all 176 on board, including 63 Canadians.

Mr. Trudeau’s comments came as video emerged that appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.

That and other footage posted on social media increasingly pointed to a catastrophic mistake by Tehran’s air defense batteries in bringing down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 early on Wednesday.

The video, which The New York Times said it verified, shows a fast-moving object rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash is seen, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later an explosion is heard.

Citing information from allies as well as Canada’s own intelligence, Mr. Trudeau said the plane appeared to have been hit by an Iranian surface-to-air (SAM) missile.

“We know this may have been unintentional. Canadians have questions, and they deserve answers,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board late on Thursday said it had received formal notification of the crash from Iran and would send a representative to join the crash probe.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry earlier invited the U.S. plane maker Boeing to “participate” in the inquiry.

Mr. Trudeau said Canada was working with allies to ensure a credible probe. “The families of the victims want answers, Canadians want answers, I want answers,” he said.

With tensions high between the U.S. and Iran, the disaster unfolded just hours after Tehran launched ballistic missiles towards bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.

Ukraine called for United Nations support for a broad investigation, and sent 45 crash investigators to Tehran to take part in the inquiry led by Iranian authorities.

“If any country has information that can help conduct a transparent and objective investigation into the tragedy, we are ready to receive it and cooperate in further verification,” the Ukraine presidency said in an English-language statement.

Tehran denies

Iran’s civil aviation chief denied on Friday that a missile downed the Ukrainian airliner, dismissing claims of a catastrophic mistake by Tehran’s air defences.

“One thing is for certain, this airplane was not hit by a missile,” Iran’s civil aviation chief Ali Abedzadeh said, adding that “any remarks made before the data is extracted (from the plane's black box flight recorders) ... is not an expert opinion.”

Mr. Abedzadeh said Tehran had invited “Americans, Canadians, the French, Ukrainians and the Swedish” to be present during the investigations, showing that “we are honest in our procedure”. He said the missile theory could not be “scientifically correct” because it was not possible for an airliner to be hit and “continue flying for 60 to 70 seconds”.

And “the debris collected has been in a very limited area. If there was an explosion in the wings it should have been much more scattered,” Mr. Abedzadeh added, noting that analysing the black box data “will take time”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dqloct/article30536747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THRDIRAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iranian-missile-downed-airliner-trudeau/article30536748.ece

North Korea has never officially confirmed Mr. Kim’s age or date of birth, but Mr. Rodman’s breathy Marilyn Monroe-style performance of “Happy Birthday” took place before an exhibition basketball match in Pyongyang on January 8, 2014.

Seoul’s national security adviser Chung Eui-yong met Mr. Trump in Washington on Wednesday and said the former real estate mogul — who in warmer times proclaimed he and Mr. Kim had fallen in love — “recalled” it was his birthday.

“President Trump wished Chairman Kim Jong-un a happy birthday and asked President Moon to convey it to him,” Mr. Chung told reporters as he arrived back in South Korea on Friday.

10,2020/01/10,Iraq asks U.S. for team to prepare troop pullout,"Iraq’s caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi has asked the United States to send a delegation to Baghdad to begin preparing for a troop pullout, his office said on Friday.

In a phone call late on Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mr. Abdel Mahdi “requested that delegates be sent to Iraq to set the mechanisms to implement Parliament’s decision for the secure withdrawal of (foreign) forces from Iraq.”

Some 5,200 U.S. soldiers are stationed at bases across Iraq to support local troops preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State group.

They make up the bulk of a broader U.S.-led coalition, invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help combat the jihadists. Their deployment was based on an executive-to-executive agreement never ratified by Iraq’s Parliament.

But on Sunday, Iraq’s Parliament voted in favour of rescinding that invitation and ousting all foreign troops.

The following day, U.S. commanders sent a letter to their counterparts in Baghdad saying they were preparing for “movement out of Iraq”.

Signed copies

The letter said the coalition would “be repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement”.

The Pentagon said the letter was a draft sent by mistake but Mr. Abdel Mahdi disputed that account, saying his office had received signed and translated copies.

11,2020/01/10,Lanka’s Rajapaksa orders investigation on previous govt’s corruption probe panels,"Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday ordered a presidential probe on the previous government’s anti-corruption panels which investigated the members of the Rajapaksa family including himself.

Two retired senior judges and a former police chief have been appointed to the panel which has been mandated to come out with a report within six months from January 9, according to a gazette issued by the government.

The work of the Financial Crime Division (FCID) of the police, the Bribery and Corruption Commission and the police’s special investigation units would come under the focus of the probe covering the period commencing January 9, 2015 to November 16, 2019, the day of the presidential election when Rajapaksa was elected president.

The probe panels of former president Maithripala Sirisena and ex-prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe government investigated the members of the Rajapaksa family on the alleged misconduct during 2005 and 2015.

Many of them were arrested and remanded before securing bail. None of the cases have been concluded so far.

The probe would focus on whether any public service personnel had been politically victimised during the previous government through its probe panels.

The Sirisena/Wickremesinghe government was elected on its pledge to eradicate corruption and expose alleged corruption during the tenure of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who was in office from November, 2005 to January, 2015.

The Rajapaksas cried foul over the investigations claiming they were part of the political witch-hunt. They were particularly critical of the FCID which they claimed had been set up illegally. The FCID launched investigations into alleged mass scale financial fraud.

The appointment of the special panel has come in the wake of the current political storm involving recorded telephone conversations between a parliamentarian of the last government and some of the judges and top police investigators on the probes between 2015 and 2019.

12,2020/01/10,Israel prepares to test laser air defence system,"The Israeli Defence Ministry has hailed a “breakthrough” in the development of cheaper laser-based air defences, as tensions soar in the region after Iran hit U.S. targets in retaliation for a high-proﬁle assassination.

The lasers, still under development, would be capable of intercepting “everything” ﬁred at Israel, including long and medium range missiles, rockets, mortar rounds and drones, an oﬃcial said on Thursday, asking not to be identiﬁed.

The new technology, which Israel hopes to test later this year, uses electricity to power the lasers, doing away with the need for stocks of munitions, the oﬃcial said.

The lasers would be used to “complement” existing air defences such as the shortrange Iron Dome system, David’s Sling, which targets medium-range threats, and the Arrow, Israel’s highestaltitude missile interception system.

It is not clear when the system will become operational. While Israel prepares to test the technology, countries across the Middle East remain on alert following last week’s killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

The shock assassination of Major General Qasem Soleimani raised alarm in Israel — a key U.S. ally — that it could be hit after Tehran warned it would be among the targets for reprisals if Washington took any further military action.

Israel has been a bitter foe of Iran ever since the Islamic revolution of 1979 overthrew the pro-Western shah.

It has been working on developing laser-based air defences for more than three decades, according to retired general Isaac Ben Israel.

A former head of the defence ministry's directorate of defence research and development, Ben Israel said the new system used electric not chemical lasers, making it more efficient.

The official who asked not to be identified said the system could be mounted on armoured vehicles to intercept anti-tank missiles or mortar fire.

The lasers could also be fitted onto a drone to tackle threats above cloud level, the official added.

Ben Israel said the one major shortcoming of the lasers was their dependence on the weather.

Their reliance on optics to hit a target meant they could not be used when sand-storms or thick cloud cover impeded visibility.

But using lasers instead of munitions to intercept incoming fire is vastly cheaper and more efficient, Ben Israel said.

Once a laser is locked onto its target it would “take about a second” to eliminate a threat, he said.

“The regular air defence systems — Patriot, Hawk or anti-aircraft guns — are inefficient, the threat is too immediate,” he said. “That's where the (laser) system has an advantage.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-prepares-to-test-laser-air-defence-system/article30536011.ece
13,2020/01/10,Strong winds create Australian 'megablaze',"Gale-force winds in Australia merged two enormous fires into a megablaze spanning an area four times the size of Greater London on Friday, while tens of thousands rallied to again demand action on climate change.

“The conditions are difficult today,” said Shane Fitzsimmons, rural fire service commissioner for New South Wales state, after days of relative calm.

“It's the hot, dry winds that will prove once again to be the real challenge.”

Temperatures soared above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria, where attention was focused on the two fires that linked to form yet another monster blaze of more than 600,000 hectares.

Fire service spokesman Anthony Bradstreet told AFP it is believed the blaze was sparked by dry lightning.

A “state of disaster” was extended 48 hours ahead of Friday's forecast of scorching temperatures, and evacuation orders were issued for areas around the New South Wales-Victoria border.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said there were more than 130 fires burning in the state, with just over 50 not yet under control.

On Kangaroo Island off South Australia, the largest town was cut off as firefighters battled dangerous infernos, forcing some residents to flee to the local jetty.

The catastrophic bushfires have killed at least 26 people, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched some ten million hectares (100,000 square kilometres) — an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.

University of Sydney scientists estimate one billion mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed in the fires.

The Insurance Council of Australia estimated losses from the fires have so far totalled Aus$939 (US$645) million.

The severe conditions have been fuelled by a prolonged drought and worsened by climate change, with experts warning that such massive blazes were becoming more frequent and intense.

Australia experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius recorded in mid-December.

In Sydney and Melbourne, thousands of people again took to the streets to demand Australia's conservative government do more to tackle global warming and reduce coal exports.

“Change the politics not the climate,” read one sign, reflecting an increasingly charged argument over the cause of the fires.

Researchers say the bushfire emergency has sparked an online disinformation campaign “unprecedented” in the country's history, with bots deployed to shift blame for the blazes away from climate change.

One hashtag in particular, #arsonemergency, has gained traction rapidly and conservative-leaning newspapers, websites and politicians across the globe have promoted the theory that arson is largely to blame, rather than climate change, drought or record high temperatures.

Timothy Graham, a digital media expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said his research showed half of the Twitter users deploying the hashtag displayed bot- and troll-like behaviour.

“Our findings show a concerted effort aimed to misinform the public about the cause of the bushfires,” Mr. Graham said.

“The campaign is nothing on the scale of what we have been seeing in other countries, such as the 2016 U.S. election, but this amount of disinformation in Australia is unprecedented.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday tried to parry journalists' questions about whether climate change would make horrific bushfire seasons the norm.

“Look, we have covered that on a number of occasions now,” Mr. Morrison said testily, adding that reviews will take place once the bushfire season is over.

Towamba volunteer firefighter Tony Larkings, 65, said battling the fires in recent weeks had been a “hot, dirty and dangerous” task.

“It's been horrendous. It's never been like this before,” he told AFP.

He was deeply critical of Morrison's response to the bushfires, calling it mere “lip service” and slamming the leader's response to public criticism.

“His great statement was 'I don't take this personally',” Mr. Larkings said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8ehsaj/article30535814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/strong-winds-create-australian-megablaze/article30535815.ece
14,2020/01/10,Congo ethnic killings may amount to crimes against humanity: U.N.,"Killings, rapes and other barbaric violence committed by an ethnic armed group in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo against a rival group may amount to crimes against humanity and possibly even genocide, the United Nations said on Friday.

The attacks in Ituri province have mostly targeted Hema herders, who have long been in conflict with Lendu farmers over grazing rights and political representation.

Lendu armed groups have carried out systematic and widespread attacks, trying to “inflict lasting trauma” on the Hema and clear them from what they deem to be their ancestral lands, the U.N. human rights office said in a report.

“The widespread nature of the organisation, the systematic nature, is certainly characteristic of crimes against humanity,” U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a briefing.

“The burden of proof of genocide, the intent to destroy a whole part of a population, is far more difficult to prove.”

Lendu groups have acquired more firearms after seizing them from the military, U.N. investigators said.

“The barbarity that characterises these attacks including the beheading of women and children with machetes, the dismemberment and removal of body parts of the victims as trophies of war reflects the desire of the attackers to inflict lasting trauma to the Hema communities and to force them to flee and not return to their villages,” the report said.

“Certain elements constituting genocide” - a rare designation under international law - may be present, it said.

The FARDC army and police have failed to stop the violence and have themselves carried out executions, rapes and arbitrary arrests, it said. Congolese authorities must deploy more security forces and investigate abuses, it added.

At least 701 people have been killed and 168 injured during inter-ethnic violence between the Hema and Lendu communities in Djugu and Mahagi territories from December 2017 to September 2019, the report said. At least 142 people have suffered acts of sexual violence, it added.

Most victims are from the Hema community, but the U.N. investigators said they had also documented acts of reprisals by some Hema, including the burning of villages.

Nearly 57,000 Congolese have fled to Uganda while more than half a million have been displaced in their homeland, it said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/congo-ethnic-killings-may-amount-to-crimes-against-humanity-un/article30535657.ece
15,2020/01/10,Madame Tussauds removes waxworks of Harry and Meghan from royal family display,"Madame Tussauds waxwork museum has removed the figures of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan from its British royal family display, in response to the couple's announcement that they will be stepping back from royal duties.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced on Wednesday that they intend to divide their time between North America and the UK to carve out a “progressive new role” and step back from their senior positions.

Senior members of the royal family were disappointed by the move, a royal source said.

Madame Tussauds, which contains more than 250 wax models of celebrities, said the two figures will go in a separate section, away from that which includes Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Prince William and his wife Kate.

“Alongside the rest of the world, we are reacting to the surprising news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be stepping back as senior Royals,” said general manager Steve Davies.

He added in a statement: “As two of our most popular and well-loved figures, they will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as we watch to see what the next chapter holds for them.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vlnzdx/article30535614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXBRITAINROYALSPRINCEHARRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/madame-tussauds-removes-waxworks-of-harry-and-meghan-from-royal-family-display/article30535615.ece
16,2020/01/10,Indian national pleads guilty to operating call centres to scam Americans,"A 43-year-old Indian national, who was extradited from Singapore, has pleaded guilty for his involvement in a multi-million dollar India-based call centre scam that targeted Americans, according to the Department of Justice.

Hitesh Madhubhai Patel played a “prominent” role in operating and funding the call centres whose callers and U.S.-based conspirators defrauded American victims between 2013 and 2016, it said on Thursday.

Mr. Patel, also known as Hitesh Hinglaj, of Ahmedabad, pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and general conspiracy to commit identification fraud, access device fraud, money laundering, and impersonation of a federal officer or employee, the department said.

“Hitesh Patel played a prominent role in this massive, India-based fraud scheme that bilked vulnerable Americans out of millions of dollars,” Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said.

“This important resolution would not have occurred without the assistance of our Singaporean colleagues, to whom we extend our deep appreciation,” he said.

Mr. Patel was prosecuted in the U.S. after being extradited from Singapore in April 2019 to face charges in the telefraud and money laundering case.

Singapore authorities apprehended Mr. Patel at the request of the U.S., following a provisional arrest warrant in September 2018, after he flew there from India.

The Singaporean Minister for Law issued a warrant on March 25, 2019 for Mr. Patel to be delivered into custody of the U.S.

In his guilty plea, Mr. Patel and his co-conspirators perpetrated a complex fraudulent scheme involving a network of call centres based in Ahmedabad.

Using information obtained from data brokers and other sources, the employees of the call centres impersonated officials from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and engaged in scams designed to defraud victims throughout the U.S.

The Justice Department said the American victims were threatened with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay monies, like taxes or penalties, owed to the government.

Those who fell victim to the scammers were instructed how to make the payment, including by purchasing general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards or wire transfers. Upon payment, the call centres would immediately turn to a network of “runners” based in the U.S. to liquidate and launder the fraudulently obtained funds, the department added, it said.

In his plea, Mr. Patel admitted to operating and funding several India-based call centres from which the fraud schemes were perpetrated, including the HGlobal call centre conglomerate.

Mr. Patel corresponded by email and WhatsApp messaging frequently with his co-defendants to exchange.

He also received monthly income and expense reports on his personal email from the call centres, and used his Indian cell phone number to access GPR cards through automated telephone systems on many occasions.

A co-defendant described Mr. Patel as “the top person in India and the boss for whom most of the other defendants worked” and the owner of multiple call centres.

Mr. Patel was arrested in India in 2016, but was later released, another co-defendant said.

Mr. Patel admitted that a reasonably foreseeable loss of more than $25 million but less than $65 million was attributable to him, based on the government’s evidence against him.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-national-pleads-guilty-to-operating-call-centres-to-scam-americans/article30535081.ece
17,2020/01/10,Ukraine president received data from U.S. on Iran plane crash,"The United States has given Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy important data ahead of a call later on Friday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the crash of a Ukrainian airliner in Iran, Ukraine's foreign minister said on Twitter.

Mr. Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko met U.S. representatives to receive the data, which will be processed by experts, Mr. Prystaiko said, without elaborating on the nature of the data or what it signified.

Mr. Zelenskiy said earlier the possibility that a missile downed the airliner, killing all on board, had not been ruled out but it had not been confirmed yet.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t7pzov/article30534704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRANPLANECRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukraine-president-received-data-from-us-on-iran-plane-crash/article30534705.ece
18,2020/01/10,"Iran denies missile hit plane, calls on West to share data","Iran on January 10 denied Western allegations a Ukrainian jetliner that crashed outside Tehran was brought down by an Iranian missile and called on the U.S. and Canada to share any information they have on the crash, which killed all 176 people on board.

Western leaders said the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by a surface-to-air missile near Tehran, just hours after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles at two U.S. bases in Iraq to avenge the killing of its top general in an American airstrike last week.

“What is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane,” Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran’s national aviation department, told a press conference.

“If they are really sure, they should come and show their findings to the world” in accordance with international standards, he added.

The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete.

The state-run IRNA news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Iran “has invited both Ukraine and the Boeing company to participate in the investigations.” The spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said it will also welcome experts from other countries’ whose citizens died in the crash.

Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations. It later invited the U.S. accident-investigating agency to take part in the investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board said late Thursday that it would “evaluate its level of participation”, but its role could be limited by U.S. sanctions on Iran. U.S. officials have also expressed concern about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.

Under rules set by a United Nations aviation organization, the NTSB is entitled to participate because the crash involved a Boeing 737-800 jet that was designed and built in the U.S.

There was no immediate comment from Boeing.

U.S., Canadian and British officials said Thursday it is “highly likely” that Iran shot down the Boeing 737 that crashed near Tehran late Tuesday. U.S. officials said the jetliner might have been mistakenly identified as a threat.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, said “we have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence”.

“The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,” he said. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered similar statements.

The U.S. officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “the missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet”.

In a Facebook post, he reiterated his call “on all international partners” — the U.S., Britain and Canada in particular — to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. He also announced plans to discuss the investigation with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later on Friday.

Iranian officials initially said the plane appeared to have crashed because of technical difficulties.

A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when the burning plane went down.

The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing 737, operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran early Wednesday.

Mr. Abedzadeh, the senior aviation official, had earlier said that by law there is “full coordination” between the country’s air defenses and the civil aviation system. He said it is “absolutely impossible” that the armed forces would shoot down a civilian plane.

Ukraine said Iranian authorities allowed Ukrainian investigators to examine fragments of the plane late Thursday.

“It is too early on in the investigation to reveal specific details,” the statement from the Ukraine President’s office said. It added that DNA is being collected from relatives of Ukrainians who died in the crash in order to identify the bodies.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aavzw7/article30528093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-CRASHSG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-denies-missile-hit-plane-calls-on-west-to-share-data/article30533450.ece
19,2020/01/10,Protest-hit Hong Kong sees surge in depression: study,"Nearly one in three adults in Hong Kong reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during months of often violent social unrest in the city, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal Friday.

Around one in 10 had symptoms of probable depression, figures comparable to those seen in areas of armed conflict or following terrorist attacks, the decade-long study led by researchers from the University of Hong Kong found.

Prevalence of PTSD symptoms was six times higher than after the last major pro-democracy “Occupy” protests in 2014, rising from about five percent in March 2015 to almost 32 percent in September-November 2019.

The increase corresponds to an additional 1.9 million adults with PTSD symptoms in the city of 7.4 million.

Up to 11 percent of adults reported symptoms of depression, from around two percent before the Occupy protests, and 6.5 percent in 2017, the study estimated.

“One in five adults now reports probable depression or suspected PTSD, which is comparable to those experiencing armed conflicts, large-scale disasters, or terrorist attacks,” the study said.

The researchers also found that heavy use of social media to follow socio-political events appeared to increase the risk of probable depression and suspected PTSD.

“Hong Kong is under-resourced to deal with this excess mental health burden,” said professor Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research.

The researchers used numerous surveys carried out on 18,000 people between 2009 and 2019 in what they said was the largest and longest study of the population-wide impact of social unrest on mental health in the world. They warned that their findings may underestimate the extent of mental health problems as they did not include under-18s, who make up a large proportion of protestors.

Hong Kong has been battered by seven months of unrest, with millions marching and frequent violent confrontations in which police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters have responded with petrol bombs.

“With social unrest rising around the world, including in major cities such as Barcelona, Delhi, Paris, and Santiago in 2019, the issue of how social unrest impacts population mental health is of great public-health importance,” said Michael Ni from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taap09/article30532651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10AFPHONGKONG-CHINA-POLITICS-CRIME-UNREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/protest-hit-hong-kong-sees-surge-in-depression-study/article30532652.ece
20,2020/01/10,Prince Harry and Meghan are ‘stepping out’. How will it work?,"Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have announced they will step back from senior roles in the royal family - a move that raises questions about how they will earn an income, who will pay for their security, and what their new positions will involve.

Exactly how they will combine private work and royal duties remains unclear. The couple in an initial statement said they hoped to become financially independent and set up a new charity, while continuing some royal duties.

Who pays?

Harry and Meghan said in a question-and-answer section of their new website https://sussexroyal.com that they are seeking financial independence from the monarchy's funding, known as the ”Sovereign Grant”. This is a government handout that covers the running costs of the royal household and travel expenses.

The couple said the grant was equivalent to 5% of their income towards running their official office. They did not say if they will give up the remaining 95 percent which comes from Prince Charles's centuries-old private estate.

By foregoing money from the taxpayer, the couple indicated they will seek some form of private income.

“They value the ability to earn a professional income, which in the current structure they are prohibited from doing,” the statement said. “For this reason they have made the choice to become members of the Royal Family with financial independence.”

Where will they live?

They said they now plan to divide their time between the United Kingdom and North America.

They will continue to base themselves at Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of the queen's Windsor Castle when in the United Kingdom. The property was recently renovated at a cost of 2.4 million pounds ($3.13 million) by taxpayers.

Meghan was born in Los Angeles and she grew up in Hollywood. Harry and Meghan spent the last six weeks of 2019 in Canada and their first official appearance of 2020 was a trip to Canada House in London, home of Canada's diplomatic mission to Britain.

Who pays for security?

The couple made clear that they expected the government to continue to finance their security costs as mandated by the Home Office, which is responsible for the security of the royal family. The cost of the security is never made public, but it is estimated to cost hundreds of thousands of pounds a year.

How will they earn money?

The couple's new website Sussex Royal does not outline how they intend to fund themselves in future. Some of the Queen's other grandchildren work, including Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, who work in business and the arts.

Last year, it was reported that Harry would be executive producer of a documentary on mental health with U.S. television mogul Oprah Winfrey for Apple's video streaming service.

Royal biographer Penny Junor suggested Meghan, who starred in TV legal drama “Suits”, might revive her acting career, given the demand and fees she could command.

Six months ago Harry and Meghan applied to the UK Intellectual Property Office to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for use on books, stationery, clothing such as pyjamas and socks, charity campaigns and the provision of training, sport and social care.

What about the media?

The couple announced they are to radically change media access to their official engagements, and will no longer participate in the traditional “royal rota” system, which is an agreement providing access for royal correspondents.

The royal rota system allows access to their engagements by accredited correspondents, who pool photographs and video, to ensure minimum interference with the engagement itself.

Now the couple said their intention is to speak directly to the public through social media, and they would deny automatic access to some royal correspondents.

This means that they could be the target of more paparazzi photographers, who will no longer worry about losing access to official events if they are already excluded.

What will happen to their titles?

The couple made no mention of giving up their royal titles. Instead, they stated on their website that other royal family members retain their titles while earning an income.

“There is precedent for this structure and it applies to other current members of the Royal Family who support the monarch and also have full time jobs external to their commitment to the monarchy,” the statement said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bpzhsg/article30532455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10BRITAINROYALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-harry-and-meghan-are-stepping-out-how-will-it-work/article30532456.ece

22,2020/01/10,"Pakistan epitomises ‘dark arts’, no takers for its ‘malware’: India at UNSC","In a hard-hitting response, India said Pakistan “epitomises the dark arts , but there are no takers for its “malware after Islamabad raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN Security Council.

One delegation that epitomises the dark arts has, yet again, displayed its wares by peddling falsehoods earlier today. These we dismiss with disdain, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said on Thursday.

“My simple response to Pakistan is even though it is late, neighbour, heal thyself of your malaise. There are no takers here for your malware, Akbaruddin said, addressing the UN Security Council open debate on ‘Maintenance of International Peace and Security Upholding the United Nations Charter.’

Mr. Akbaruddin’s strong response came after Pakistan’s envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir while addressing the Council during the open debate.

The Pakistani envoy also raised the abrogation of Article 370, communications lockdown in Kashmir and referred to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan after an aerial combat in February last year after New Delhi had conducted counter-terror operations in Pakistan’s Balakot.

Mr. Akram called on the Security Council and Secretary General Antonio Guterres to act decisively to prevent a disastrous war between Pakistan and India.

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two union territories.

Reacting sharply to India’s decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India’s high commissioner.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

In his statement to the Council, Mr. Akbaruddin said that it is increasingly acknowledged that the 15-nation Security Council faces crises of identity and legitimacy, as well as relevance and performance.

The globalisation of terror networks; the weaponisation of new technologies; the inability to counter those resorting to subversive statecraft are showing up the shortcomings of the Council.

Mr. Akbaruddin noted that in a world constantly in flux, the challenges to international peace and security are a step ahead of the systems designed to tackle them. It is evident now that fires are all around the horizon. To undertake a fair evaluation of the available mechanisms without belittling their importance, we need to ask ourselves — are they still fit for the purpose of implementing the fundamental principles of the Charter?

He underscored the need for the Council to be part of the political tool kit to address ongoing and future threats to global peace and security, emphasising that the Council should represent current global realities and be fit for purpose.

The answer to the crises the Council faces, lies in invoking and working through Charter provisions that provide for reform and change. We need a Council that is representative of current global realities, credible, and legitimate, rather than one that rests merely on the claim that it existed at the inception. The Council needs to be fit for purpose for the 21s?t? century.

Alluding to Mahatma Gandhi’s quote of ‘One must care about the world one will not see’, Mr. Akbaruddin said resilient organisations are those that are not resistant to change, or else current emergencies can turn into catastrophes, even while we continue our endless prevarication. Humanity, it is said, progresses when it collectively rises to its responsibility to the future. It is now time to do that.

The Indian envoy said there is a case to be made for innovations that enlarge the vision of global rule of law. It is possible that just as Generals often re-fight the last war, the drafters of the Charter responded to the factors and forces that led to World War II, without anticipating what we are now faced with.

Further he said notwithstanding all its imperfections, the UN Charter is still the main incarnation of the global spirit. Moving away from a formal system which is well understood, to one which is based on untested interpretations, may have unexpected consequences. Justice dispensed on the fly may come to be resented.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/31e0ej/article29475333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYEDAKBARUDDIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-epitomises-dark-arts-no-takers-for-its-malware-india-at-unsc/article30531375.ece

In an interview with the ABC TV affiliate in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said: “We're going to be signing on January 15th - I think it will be January 15th, but shortly thereafter, but I think January 15th - a big deal with China.”

Trump announced the Jan. 15 signing date in a tweet on Dec. 31.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Trump's comments.

The Phase 1 deal, struck last month, is expected to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of American farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country's negotiating team in Sino-U.S. trade talks, will sign the deal in Washington next week, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday.

25,2020/01/10,Trump boasts Iranian general’s death was ‘American justice’,"President Donald Trump used his first campaign election rally of 2020 to argue that he served up “American justice” by ordering a drone strike to take out Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, while jeering Democratic leaders for questioning his decision to carry out the attack without first consulting Congress.

Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday careened from mockery of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, to a suggestion that he should have won the Nobel Prize, a preview of the sharp-edged reelection campaign that he will wage.

The president made his comments shortly after the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution asserting that Mr. Trump must seek approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran.

Mr. Trump mocked Ms. Pelosi’s mental acuity and called Schiff a “pencil neck.” He also tagged Sen. Bernie Sanders as “Crazy Bernie” for raising objections to how he carried out the strike on Soleimani.

""We got a call. We heard where he was. He knew the way he was getting there,” Mr. Trump told cheering supporters in Toledo. “We didn’t have time to call up Nancy, who isn’t operating with a full deck.”

""They want us to tell them so they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media,” Mr. Trump added.

Last week’s killing of Soleimani brought long, simmering tensions between the U.S. and Iran to a boil. Iran, in retaliation, fired a barrage of missiles this week at two military bases in neighboring Iraq that house hundreds of U.S. troops. But with no casualties to U.S. or Iraqi troops, Mr. Trump said he had no plans to take further military action against Iran and would instead enact more sanctions against the Islamic Republic.

The Iran crisis, which momentarily overshadowed Mr. Trump’s looming impeachment trial, has also opened a new front in the 2020 presidential campaign for Mr. Trump, who in 2016 campaigned on a promise to end American involvement in “endless wars.”

Vice President Mike Pence, who joined Mr. Trump for the rally, said the President deserved credit for taking out a “dangerous terrorist” while managing to keep the engagement from escalating into an all-out war.

“And when American lives were threatened by the most dangerous terrorist in the world, President Donald Trump took action and Qassem Soleimani is gone,” Mr. Pence said. “And in the wake of that attack, Iran responded, but thanks to the professionalism of the military, we suffered no American casualties and Iran appears to be standing down. That’s what leadership looks like.”

Mr. Trump also sought to compare his response to the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to the 2012 attack on U.S. government facility in Benghazi. A U.S. ambassador to Libya, a foreign service officer and two CIA contractors were killed in the Benghazi attack, which led to a two-year Republican-led investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was not found to have committed wrongdoing.

No Americans were killed in the Baghdad assault. The protesters managed only to breach the edge of the sprawling embassy complex.

""This was the anti-Benghazi,” he said. “We got there very quickly. This is the exact opposite.”

Mr. Trump also turned to a topic that frequently rankles him- the fact that he has never won a Nobel Prize. Referencing the 2019 Nobel Prize winner, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Mr. Trump said that he himself deserved the honor instead.

""I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country,” Mr. Trump said. “I said, ‘What?’ Did I have something to do with it? Yeah. But, you know, that’s the way it is. As long as we know, it’s all that matters.”

Mr. Abiy was awarded the prize in October for his sweeping reforms and surprising embrace of a bitter rival.

Mr. Trump enters the election year flush with more than $100 million in campaign cash, a low unemployment rate, and an unsettled Democratic presidential field. Yet, polling shows he remains vulnerable.

In December, an AP-NORC poll showed Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 40%. There have not been more recent polls to gauge support for the president in the wake of the targeted killing of Soleimani, though opinions of Trump have changed little over the course of his presidency.

Mr. Trump has never fallen into historic lows for a president’s approval ratings, but Gallup polling shows his December rating registers lower than that of most recent presidents at the same point in their first terms. Notably, approval of Trump and former President Barack Obama in the December before their reelection bid is roughly the same.

But Obama’s approval rating never fell below 40% in Gallup polling, and he recovered slightly in the months leading up to his reelection to finish his first term with an average rating just below 50%. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has never been higher than 46% in Gallup polling.

For Mr. Trump to win reelection, securing Ohio’s 18 electoral votes will be critical. He won Ohio by 8 points in 2016, after Obama held the state in 2008 and 2012. The visit to Toledo marked Mr. Trump’s 15th appearance in Ohio as president.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v6kdf1/article30530951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-boasts-iranian-generals-death-was-american-justice/article30530952.ece
26,2020/01/10,Mueller probe witness considers child sex trafficking plea,"A key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is expected to plead guilty to charges of child sex trafficking and possessing child pornography.

A criminal information was filed Thursday in federal count in Alexandria against George Nader , a Lebanese-American businessman who worked to advance Saudi Arabia’s agenda to the Trump administration. An information is generally an indication of a looming guilty plea.

A hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday afternoon.

Nader was charged in June with possessing and transporting images of child pornography and bestiality on his cellphone. In July, prosecutors added an allegation that Nader transported a 14-year-old boy from Europe to Washington, D.C., in 2000 and engaged in sex acts with him.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Alexandria declined comment. Nader’s lawyers did not immediately return a phone call and emails seeking comment Thursday afternoon.

Nader’s name shows up more than 100 times in Mueller’s report. It details Nader’s efforts to serve as liaison between a Russian banker close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of President Donald Trump’s transition team.

Nader also served as an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, and in 2017 wired $2.5 million to a top Trump fundraiser, Elliott Broidy, through a company in Canada, reported in 2018. The goal was to persuade the U.S. to take a hard line against Qatar, a longtime American ally but now an adversary of the UAE.

Nader was previously convicted in the Czech Republic of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term in 2003.

Nader also pleaded guilty to a charge of transporting child-pornography images in Virginia in 1991.

The current investigation of Nader began in 2018 when images depicting child pornography and bestiality were found on his phone after it was confiscated under a search warrant connected to the Mueller probe.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qfj2oi/article30530923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPRUSSIAPROBEDONORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mueller-probe-witness-considers-child-sex-trafficking-plea/article30530924.ece
27,2020/01/10,“Get out”: Australians urged to flee as huge bushfires revitalise,"Australian authorities urged nearly a quarter of a million people to evacuate their homes on Friday and prepared military backup as soaring temperatures and erratic winds were expected to fan deadly bushfires across the east coast.

Temperatures were expected to shoot well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in several parts of the country on Friday, accompanied by high winds, threatening to inflame fires that have already left thousands of people homeless.

“If you can get out, you should get out, you shouldn't be in the remote and forested parts of our State,” Andrew Crisp, emergency management commissioner for the state of Victoria, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Emergency alert text messages had been sent to 240,000 people in Victoria state alone, telling them to leave, Mr. Crisp said. People in high-risk regions in New South Wales and South Australia states were also urged to think about leaving, but authorities had not provided numbers.

Twenty-seven people have been killed and thousands subjected to repeat evacuations as monster - and unpredictable - fires have scorched through more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres) of land, an area the size of South Korea.

John White, Mayor of East Gippsland, an area that was ravaged by fires on New Year's Eve, told Reuters that residents were on the move: “people aren't taking any chances.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had given instructions to the military so “that they are to stand ready to move and support immediately” as firefighters battle 150 blazes across the country.

Australia's wildfires have dwarfed other catastrophic blazes around the world. Combining 2019 fires in California, Brazil and Indonesia still amounts to less than half the burnt area in Australia.

Australia's government has maintained there is no direct link between climate change and the devastating bushfires, a stance that has prompted campaigners to plan worldwide protests for Friday.

“We don't want job destroying, economy destroying, economy wrecking targets and goals which won't change the fact that there are bushfires or anything like that in Australia,” Mr. Morrison told 2GB Radio, referring to calls for the government to commit to higher carbon emissions cuts.

Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis:

* There were 134 fires ablaze across New South Wales, with around 50 uncontained on Friday. All other fires were at the ”advice” level, the lowest alert rating.

* Victoria state had 16 fires, two of which were so severe that evacuation orders have been issued. One more fire was at an emergency level.

* In South Australia state, nine fires were ablaze, one of which was at a emergency level.

* Climate protests were planned for Friday in several cities, including Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, targeting the Australian government handling of the crisis and its position on climate change.

* Prime Minister Morrison said on Friday he was considering holding a wide-ranging national inquiry into the bushfires after the immediate crisis had passed.

* NSW authorities said just shy of 2,000 homes have been destroyed in the state, half of those in the past 10 days.

* Australian cricketer Shane Warne's prized “baggy green” cap raised more than A$1 million at an auction for bushfire relief efforts

* Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. The weather agency said there was no sign of that for months.

* Ecologists at the University of Sydney have estimated 1 billion animals have been killed or injured in the bushfires, potentially destroying ecosystems.

* Moody's Analytics said the cost of the fires could easily surpass that of deadly 2009 Black Saturday fires that destroyed 450,000 hectares (1.1 million acres)of land, which cost an estimated A$4.4 billion.

* Morrison has pledged A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.

* About 100 firefighters from the United States and Canada are helping with another 140 expected in coming weeks.

* The fires have emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide and produced harmful pollutants, the European Union's Copernicus monitoring programme said.

* Smoke has drifted across the Pacific, affecting cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yh48ca/article30477483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/get-out-australians-urged-to-flee-as-huge-bushfires-revitalise/article30530881.ece
28,2020/01/10,House approves measure to restrain Trump’s actions on Iran,"Reigniting a debate over who has the power to declare war, the Democratic-controlled House on Thursday approved a resolution asserting that President Donald Trump must seek approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran.

The war powers resolution is not binding on the president and would not require his signature. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nonetheless insisted it “has real teeth” because “it is a statement of the Congress of the United States.”

The measure will “protect American lives and values” by limiting Mr. Trump’s military actions, Ms. Pelosi said. “The administration must de-escalate and must prevent further violence.”

The White House called the resolution “ridiculous” and “completely misguided.”

The House passed the measure, 224-194, with just three Republicans voting in support. Eight Democrats opposed the measure.

A similar proposal by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., faces an uphill fight in the GOP-run Senate. Kaine’s efforts received a boost Thursday as Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, an ex-Marine, said he might support the war powers measure. Two other Republican senators said Wednesday they would back Kaine’s plan.

""We are members of a separate and distinct branch of government. It is our duty not to take anyone’s word for things as we are dealing with matters of life and death,” Young said, adding that he wished Trump administration officials had provided more intelligence information during a briefing Wednesday on a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general.

Ms. Pelosi, in announcing the House vote, called the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani “provocative and disproportionate.”

Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, denounced the Democratic measure as little more than “a press release designed to attack President Trump,” while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California called it a “meaningless vote” on a measure that will never be sent to the president or “limit his constitutional authority to defend the American people.”

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said, “This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies, and attempts to hinder the President’s authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats.”

The House vote came a day after the Trump administration briefed lawmakers on its actions in Iran. Democrats and several Republicans called the briefings inadequate, adding that officials did not provide enough details about why the attack was justified.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday that Soleimani “was traveling the region making plans to bring an attack against American personnel and American forces.” He said it was not possible to share full details of the intelligence with lawmakers.

""When it comes to intelligence we have to protect sources and methods, there’s only certain amount we can share with every member of Congress,” Mr. Pence said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “But those of us who have seen all the evidence know that there was a compelling case of imminent threat against American personnel.”

Mr. Trump said Thursday that he “had calls from numerous senators and numerous congressmen and women saying it was the greatest presentation they’ve ever had.”

Referring to criticism by GOP Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul, Mr. Trump said- “They want information that honestly I think is very hard to get. ... It really had to do with sources and information that we had that really should remain at a very high level.”

Lee, a conservative from Utah, said the briefing by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials was “probably the worst briefing I’ve seen, at least on a military issue,” in the nine years he’s served in the Senate.

Paul, of Kentucky, said administration officials justified killing Soleimani based on the 2002 authorization of force in Iraq. “That is absurd. That’s an insult,” he said.

Ms. Pelosi scheduled the House vote after Iran retaliated for the Soleimani killing by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. No casualties were reported.

""Congress hereby directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or military” unless Congress declares war on that country or enacts legislation authorizing use of force to prevent an attack on the U.S. and its forces, the five-page resolution states.

The resolution’s sponsor, freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said it is intended to “make clear that if the president wants to take us to war, he must get authorization from Congress.”

If loved ones are going to be sent to fight in a protracted war, “the president owes the American people a public conversation about why, and for what ends,” said Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and Pentagon official who served in Iraq.

Members of Congress have a constitutional responsibility to uphold in authorizing use of military force, Slotkin said, adding, “We are owed concrete, specific details on strategy.”

Mr. Trump did not consult with congressional leaders ahead of the attack that killed the Iranian general and afterward sent Congress a notification explaining the rationale, but kept it classified.

Congress has allowed its war powers role to erode since the passage of Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001 to fight terrorism after the 9/11 attacks, and passage of another AUMF for the invasion of Iraq in 2002.

Fallout from those votes deeply divided Congress and the nation, with many lawmakers, particularly Democrats, now saying they were mistakes. Yet Congress has been paralyzed on the question of whether to repeal or change those authorities.

The strikes by Iran had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and put the world’s attention on Mr. Trump as he weighed whether to respond with more military force.

Republicans have largely supported Mr. Trump’s actions, saying the president was well within his power to take out Iran’s architect of proxy operations against Americans in the Middle East. The U.S. considered Soleimani a terrorist.

Democrats were unconvinced that the threat posed by Soleimani was imminent or that other alternatives to the killing were pursued in good faith. By not disclosing many details of the threat, Mr. Trump was asking the American public to trust the very intelligence reports he has often disparaged, Democrats said.

Young told reporters Thursday that lawmakers “need to ensure that Congress is involved in future decision-making so we end up exactly where the president wants to end up, which is the avoidance of a major ground war in the Middle East.”

Three Republicans supported the measure- Reps. Matt Gaetz and Francis Rooney of Florida and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

The eight Democrats who opposed it were Reps. Anthony Brindisi and Max Rose of New York, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Ben McAdams of Utah and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.

Gaetz, one of Trump’s strongest supporters, said “killing Soleimani was the right decision, but engaging in another forever war in the Middle East would be the wrong decision.”

Rose, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, said the resolution “simply restates existing law and sends the message that war is imminent. I refuse to play politics with questions of war and peace and therefore will not support this resolution.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8sc5gu/article30446027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31IN-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/house-approves-measure-to-restrain-trumps-actions-on-iran/article30530862.ece
29,2020/01/10,Russian army announces ceasefire in Syria’s Idlib,"The Russian army announced Thursday that a ceasefire has begun in Syria’s Idlib, the last major opposition stronghold in the country, in accordance with a Russ-a-Turkey agreement.

From 1100 GMT “a ceasefire has been in place in the de-escalation zone of Idlib,” the Russian military’s Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said in a statement.

Despite a ceasefire announced in August 2019, the Syrian regime backed by Moscow has in recent weeks ramped up its attacks on the jihadist-held bastion of Idlib, in northwest Syria against rebels backed by Ankara, provoking a surge of displaced people heading towards Turkey.

In December alone some 284,000 people fled the bombardments and fighting, especially in southern Idlib, according to the United Nations.

Thursday“s announcement came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks in Istanbul with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The leaders used a joint statement to call for a truce “supported by the necessary measures to be taken for stabilising the situation on the ground” in Libya.

On Tuesday Turkey had called for Russia to stop the regime attacks on Idlib and respect the August ceasefire.

Syria’s war has killed more than 380,000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011.

30,2020/01/10,"63 ‘terrorists’, 25 others killed in Niger army base attack: defence ministry","Heavily armed assailants stormed a military base in Niger on Thursday killing 25 people and leading to fierce clashes that killed 63 “terrorists”, the defence ministry said, in an area where dozens died in a previous jihadist attack.

The raid near to the volatile frontier with Mali by attackers in vehicles and on motorbikes began in Chinegodar, in the western Tillaberi, at 01:00 pm (12H00 GMT), defence spokesman Colonel Souleymane Gazobi said on television.

“The response with the combined air support of the Niger air force and partners made it possible to strike and rout the enemy outside our boundaries,” he said. Partners often means U.S. drones in the Sahel, or French fighter planes or drones in the country.

He put the toll at 25 dead and six injured on the “friendly side” and on the “enemy side 63 terrorists neutralised“.

The attack happened in the same region Tillaberi, also bordering Burkina Faso, where 71 Niger soldiers were killed in a December attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, that saw hundreds of jihadists storm a camp near the border with Mali with artillery.

It was the deadliest on Niger’s military since Islamist extremist violence began to spill over from neighbouring Mali in 2015, and dealt a blow to efforts to roll back jihadism in the Sahel.

That attack spurred leaders of the G5 Sahel nations to call for closer cooperation and international support in the battle against the Islamist threat.

Militant violence has spread across the vast Sahel region, especially in Burkina Faso and Niger, having started when armed Islamists revolted in northern Mali in 2012.

Thousands of civilians have also died and more than a million have been forced to flee their homes since the jihadist revolt began.

Analysts note an escalation in the jihadists’ operational tactics, which seem to have become bolder and more complex in recent months.

Ranged against them are the impoverished armies of Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, plus a 4,500-man French force in the Sahel and the 13,000-man U.N. force in Mali, MINUSMA.

31,2020/01/10,Ukraine calls for 'evidence' in Iran plane crash probe,"Ukraine asked international partners to provide any evidence they may have to help investigators probing a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed in Iran, as U.S. media reported it was mistakenly shot down by a missile.

All 176 people on board died when Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Boeing 737NG went down on Wednesday, shortly after Tehran launched missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq in response to the killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

“If any country has information that can help conduct a transparent and objective investigation into the tragedy, we are ready to receive it and cooperate in further verification,” the Ukraine presidency said in an English-language statement.

“Ukraine is interested in finding the truth. Therefore, I ask all our international partners: if you have any evidence to assist the investigation, please provide it.”

Investigators are pursuing several leads following the crash of the Ukrainian passenger plane in Iran, including a surface-to-air missile strike, an act of terror and engine failure, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council (RNBO), told AFP earlier Thursday.

The council is tasked with coordinating the probe into the disaster, the first fatal crash involving Ukraine's biggest carrier UIA.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he had “suspicions” about the crash as unnamed officials told American media that Iranian air defence systems likely accidentally shot down the airliner.

33,2020/01/10,Analysis: Soleimani’s assassination could deepen India-Russia energy ties,"The drone assassination by the United States of General Qassem Soleimani — Iran’s spearhead to counter the Islamic State and to preserve its strategic space in its periphery — has been a turning point triggering a new spiral of hostility between Washington and Tehran.

Also read | Analysis: What is next in Iran-U.S. conflict?

After Soleimani’s killing outside Baghdad airport, Iran has declared its own version and variant of the Monroe doctrine in reverse. The Iranian leadership has made it plain that the armed forces of the U.S. have to vacate the region.

To make their intent that a long campaign to clear the Americans from the region has begun, the Iranians have made use of rare and exceptional symbolism, intended to trigger the historic imagination of the followers of Shia Islam in West Asia and beyond.

After Solemani’s assassination, a red flag was hoisted over the dome of Jamkaran Mosque — a rarity when annual mourning festival of Muharram is not being observed. Some analysts say that the hoisting of the red flag was meant to convey that a major battle will now commence as the blood of martyrs has been spilled.

It has been reported that that General Soleimani often prayed at the Jamkaran mosque, located in the holy city of Qom,140 kilometers south of Tehran.

Already the message from Iran is echoing in Shia strongholds in Lebanon, led by Hassan Nasrallah.

The Houthis in embattled Yemen are also fired up to seek an expulsion of the “American occupier” from the region.

In Iraq, The Iraqi Parliament has demanded that the government must “work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, airspace or water for any reason”.

An anti-American backlash is now bound to grip Shia strongholds in Bahrain, but more importantly in Saudi Arabia’s oil rich eastern province.

Despite the recent provocation of General Soleimani’s assassination, a full scale war between the U.S. and Shia alliance woven around Iran, impacting on the movement of oil and gas tankers along the Indian

Ocean shipping lanes is unlikely. The Americans are fully aware that that a full scale attack on Iran, is expected to trigger an all-out and unaffordable Iranian missile strikes against Israel.

Besides, after the assassination of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddhafi in October 2011, during the heat of the Arab Spring, the Russians and the Chinese decided not to allow any more “regime changes” in the region.

In order to protect the Eurasian core, both countries had decided that Syria, under Bashar al Assad and Iran under its current leadership will become the first and second defence lines of Eurasia.

Nevertheless, after Solemani’s assassination, a cycle of instability is likely to grip the energy rich Persian Gulf and its periphery for an unforeseeable future.

This will have major and multiple implications for India, including on its energy security. The Iranian General’s death has yet again delivered an unvarnished message to New Delhi that it has to urgently diversify its energy supply chain.

Yet, tapping new sources of oil and gas that do not transit the Indian Ocean are few. Exacerbating tensions with Pakistan has meant that transiting Central Asian oil and gas along a land corridor is not viable. India may thus have to sharpen its focus on tapping huge Russian energy sources buried under the permafrost of Siberia.

Last year, India and Russia had signed a five-year energy agreement that included joint development of oil and gas fields in Russia and India, as well as a long-term agreement for sourcing Russian crude oil.

The fallout of Soleimani’s assassination now means that implementation of that blue print must remain sharply on India’s energy radar.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g3t9v6/article30467686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQAIRPORTATTACKTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/soleimanis-assassination-could-deepen-india-russia-energy-ties/article30527639.ece
34,2020/01/10,Iran most likely brought down Ukraine airliner with anti-aircraft missiles: U.S. officials,"A Ukraine airliner that crashed in Iran, killing all 176 people aboard, was most likely brought down accidentally by Iranian anti-aircraft missiles, U.S. officials said on January 9.

According to satellite data, one U.S. official said, the Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737-800 bound for Kiev was airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected.

That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of the plane, the official said. Heat signature data then showed the plane on fire as it went down.

Iran's head of civil aviation was quoted by ISNA News Agency as saying that it was “impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane.”

Two U.S. officials said Washington believed the downing of the plane, which occurred at a time of rising tensions between Iran and the United States, was accidental.

The remaining slots went to providers like Russian search giant Yandex, Czech search player Seznam and France’s Qwant. Google will naturally be a search option on the set-up screen in every EU country.

On August 2, 2019, following the European Commission’s July 2018 Android decision, Google announced that it would implement a choice screen for general search providers on all new Android phones and tablets shipped into the European Economic Area (EEA) where the Google Search app is pre-installed.

The choice screen will appear during initial device set-up and will feature multiple search providers, including Google.

DuckDuckGo said in a statement that it believes a search choice screen “is an excellent way to meaningfully increase consumer choice if designed properly.”

“However, we still believe a pay-to-play auction with only four slots isn’t right because it means consumers won’t get all the choices they deserve and Google will profit at the expense of the competition,” it said in a statement given to CNBC.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/ehelin/article30532989.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETDUCKDUCKGO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/duckduckgo-big-winner-as-googles-default-search-engine-for-eu/article30532990.ece
36,2020/01/10,"Facebook Gaming grows 210%, Twitch still leads","Facebook gaming is fast eating into the market share of Amazon’s video live streaming service Twitch, registering 210% growth in monthly viewership (year-on-year) in December.

Facebook Gaming has grown to capture 8.5% market share compared to 3.1% a year earlier, according to data from StreamElements and Arsenal.gg.

Twitch is still the biggest player though, gaining 728 million hours of viewership. However, its market share dropped to 61% from 67.1%.

‘Just Chatting’ became Twitch’s most popular category for the first time while ‘xQc’ was Twitch’s most watched streamer in December.

“While most of the top 10 games are the usual suspects, two notable additions are Path of Exile and Escape from Tarkov,” said StreamElements in a statement on Thursday.

In November and December, ‘xQc’ managed to take the pole position, but if last year’s constantly changing guards are any indication of what the future holds, it could be anyone else’s game in the months ahead, it added.

YouTube Gaming was the second-biggest game streaming service after Twitch, with 27.9% share.

With the idea of expanding into the gaming universe and gaining a stronghold in the Cloud game streaming market, Facebook in December acquired Madrid-based video gaming start-up firm PlayGiga for about $78 million.

37,2020/01/10,Spotify launches new tool for podcast advertising,"Swedish music streaming company Spotify on Thursday launched what it calls the ‘Streaming Ad Insertion’ (SAI) at the ongoing CES 2020 here, a new proprietary podcast ad technology that powers Spotify Podcast Ads to insert more targeted advertising into podcasts in real time.

The SAI technology leverages streaming to deliver Spotify’s full digital suite of planning reporting and measurement capabilities for Spotify original and exclusive podcasts.

According to the company, this includes data such as actual ad impression, frequency (number of times a listener heard the ad), reach and anonymised audience insights (age, gender, device type). This is the first time this type of data is available for advertisers and podcast creators.

Advertisers generally have a sense for who they are reaching, based on survey data and the magazine’s target audience.

Total circulation measures the number of doorsteps that the issue hits, but there’s no precise data on how many readers actually opened the magazine, let alone reached or acted on the ad.

Until now, podcast advertising has experienced many of these same challenges because the medium is still largely downloaded via static Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds.

But the shift in consumption from downloads to streaming has opened the door for advances in data-driven podcast advertising, and the company is moving beyond these constraints to re-imagine what is possible for this uniquely powerful and intimate medium.

With this technology, Spotify is offering the intimacy, quality and efficacy of traditional podcast ads with the precision and transparency of modern-day digital marketing.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/vdjk1m/article30531916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETSPOTIFY,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/spotify-launches-new-tool-for-podcast-advertising/article30531917.ece
38,2020/01/10,This Japanese billionaire is giving away $9 million on Twitter,"Over 40 lakh people who retweeted Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa’s tweet are eagerly waiting to know the final 1,000 lucky ones who will share the $9 million bounty announced by him to know if money can bring happiness in their lives.

On New Year’s Eve, online shopping mogul Yusaku Maezawa posted a tweet to give away 1 billion yen (around $9 million) to the Twitter users, to see if money improves their happiness.

All they needed to do was to retweet his tweet before midnight on January 7. Each one of the 1,000 winners will get a million yen each (nearly $9,100).

“A lottery will determine the winners, and Maezawa will personally notify them in a direct message within two to three days,” reports the CNN.

In a YouTube video, Maezawa who is worth $2 billion called the contest a “serious social trial” to see what impact a million yen could have on a person’s life.

In January 2019, he did the same and distributed 100 million yen ($9,14,000) to 100 Twitter users.

39,2020/01/10,How social media services handle political ads,"Online platforms, including Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google, face growing pressure to stop carrying political ads that contain false or misleading claims ahead of the U.S. presidential election.

In the United States, the Communications Act prevents broadcast stations from rejecting or censoring ads from candidates for federal office once they have accepted advertising for that political race, although this does not apply to cable networks like CNN, or to social media sites, where leading presidential candidates are spending millions to target voters in the run-up to the November 2020 election.

The following is how social media platforms have decided to handle false or misleading claims in political ads:

FACEBOOK

Facebook exempts politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to run ads with false claims.

The policy has been attacked by regulators and lawmakers who say it could spread misinformation and cause voter suppression. Critics, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, have also run intentionally false Facebook ads to highlight the issue.

Facebook’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s stance, arguing that it does not want to stifle political speech, but he also said the company was considering ways to refine the policy.

Facebook does fact-check content from political groups. The company also says it fact-checks politicians if they share previously debunked content and does not allow this content in ads.

The company said on Thursday it was making some changes to its approach to political ads, including allowing users to turn off certain ad-targeting tools. In addition, it will also make more ad audience data publicly available.

The expanded ad audience data features will be rolled out in the first quarter of this year and Facebook plans to deploy the political ads control starting in the United States early this summer, eventually expanding this preference to more locations.

Another change will be to allow users to choose to stop seeing ads based on an advertiser’s ‘Custom Audience’ and that will apply to all types of advertising, not only political ads.

TWITTER

Twitter Inc has banned political ads. In November, it said this would include ads that reference a political candidate, party, election or legislation, among other limits.

The company also said it would not allow ads that advocate for a specific outcome on political or social causes.

“We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement last month.

Some lawmakers praised the ban but critics said Twitter’s decision would benefit incumbent and hurt less well-known candidates.

Officials from the Trump campaign, which is out-spending its Democratic rivals on Facebook and Google ads, called the ban “dumb” but also said it would have little effect on the president’s strategy.

The overall political ad spend for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections on Twitter was less than $3 million, Twitters Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said.

“Twitter, from an advertising perspective, is not a player at all. Facebook and Google are the giants in political ads,” said Steve Passwaiter, vice-president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar Media.

GOOGLE

Google said on Wednesday that it would limit audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level.

The change means political advertisers can no longer target ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations such as right-leaning, left-leaning or independent. Advertisers can still do contextual targeting, such as showing ads to users watching a certain video.

Google and its video-streaming service YouTube prohibit certain kinds of ads, such as misinformation about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace or incorrect claims that a public figure has died.

Google does not have a wholesale ban on politicians running false or misleading ads. In October, when former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign asked the company to take down a Trump campaign ad that it said contained false claims, a Google spokeswoman told Reuters it did not violate the site’s policies.

SNAP

Snap Inc allows political advertising unless the ads are misleading, deceptive or violate the terms of service on its disappearing message app Snapchat.

The company, which recently joined Facebook, Twitter and Google in launching a public database of its political ads, defines political ads as including election-related, advocacy and issue ads.

Snap does not ban “attack” ads in general, but its policy does prohibit attacks relating to a candidate's personal life.

TIKTOK

The Chinese-owned video app popular with U.S. teenagers does not permit political advertising on the platform.

In an October blog post, TikTok said the company wants to make sure the platform continues to feel “light-hearted and irreverent.”

“The nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,” wrote Blake Chandlee, TikToks vice-president of global business solutions.

The app, owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, has recently come under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers concerned that the company may be censoring politically sensitive content, and raising questions about how it stores personal data.

REDDIT

Social network Reddit allows ads related to political issues and ads from political candidates at the federal level, but not for State or local elections.

It also does not allow ads about political issues, elections or candidates outside of the United States.

The company says all political ads must abide by its policies that forbid “deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising” and that prohibit “content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural topics or views.”

LINKEDIN

LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft Corp, banned political ads last year. It defines political ads as including “ads advocating for or against a particular candidate or ballot proposition or otherwise intended to influence an election outcome.”

Search engine Bing, which is also owned by Microsoft, does not allow ads with political- or election-related content.

PINTEREST

Photo-sharing site Pinterest Inc also banned political campaign ads last year.

This includes advertising for political candidates, political action committees (PACs), legislation, or political issues with the intent to influence an election, according to the site’s ads policy.

“We want to create a positive, welcoming environment for our Pinners and political campaign ads are divisive by nature,” said Pinterest spokeswoman Jamie Favazza, who told Reuters the decision was also part of the company’s strategy to address misinformation.

TWITCH

A spokeswoman for Twitch told Reuters that the live-streaming gaming network does not allow political advertising.

The site does not strictly ban all issue-based advertising but the company considers whether an ad could be seen as “political” when it is reviewed, the spokeswoman said.

Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com Inc, is primarily a video-gaming platform but also has channels focused on sports, music and politics. In recent months, political candidates such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders have joined the platform ahead of the 2020 election.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/ey9v16/article30531731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETSOCIALMEDIAAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/how-social-media-services-handle-political-ads/article30531732.ece
40,2020/01/10,Facebook tweaks ad policy but still allows political lies in U.S. campaign 2020,"Facebook Inc announced limited changes on Thursday to its approach to political ads, including allowing users to turn off certain ad-targeting tools, but defied critics’ demands that it bar politicians from using its ads system to spread lies.

Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, the world’s biggest social network has vowed to curb political manipulation of its platform.

Facebook failed to counter Russian interference in the 2016 election and allowed misuse of user data by defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Now, it faces intense criticism of its relatively hands-off ads policies, especially after exempting politicians’ ads from fact-checking standards applied to other content.

Facebook said it and its photo-sharing app Instagram will soon have a tool enabling individual users to choose to see fewer political and social issue ads, and will make more ad audience data publicly available.

In contrast, Twitter Inc banned political ads in October, while Alphabet Inc’s Google said it would stop letting advertisers target election ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations. Online platforms Spotify, Pinterest and TikTok have also issued bans.

A spokesman for the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump, which has spent more on Facebook ads than any other candidate, said the company’s approach to political messages is better than those from Twitter and Google as it “encourages more Americans to be involved in the process.”

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, condemned the company on Twitter for “standing their ground on letting political figures lie to you.” She has called for Facebook’s break-up on anti-trust grounds.

In a blog post, Facebook’s director of product management Rob Leathern said the company considered imposing limits like Google’s, but decided against them as internal data indicated most ads run by U.S. presidential candidates are broadly targeted, at audiences larger than 2,50,000 people.

Leathern wrote that Facebook’s polices are based “on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all.”

Facebook will roll out the expanded audience data features in the first quarter and plans to deploy the political ads control starting in the United States this summer, eventually expanding this setting to more locations.

Vivian Schiller, a news executive who has joined former tech employees and investors advocating for changes around the companies’ handling of political advertising, took issue with Leathern’s stance.

“Allowing the targeting of political messages to narrow slivers of the electorate is the opposite of enabling public debate,” said Schiller, who briefly headed the news unit at Twitter in 2014. “It’s akin to shadow-boxing.”

She said that once Facebook users share advertisements on their own feeds, the “paid post” labelling vanishes along with disclosures of who funded the messages.

Another change Facebook is introducing will be to allow users to choose to stop seeing ads based on an advertiser’s ‘Custom Audience’ and that will apply to all types of advertising, not only political ads.

The Custom Audiences feature lets advertisers upload lists of personal data they maintain, like email addresses and phone numbers. Facebook then matches that information to user accounts and shows the advertiser’s content to those people.

However, Facebook will not give users a blanket option to turn off the feature, meaning they must opt out of ads for each advertiser one by one, a spokesman told Reuters.

The change will also not affect ad targeting via Facebook’s Lookalike Audiences tool, which uses the same uploads of personal data to direct ads at people with similar characteristics to those on the lists, the spokesman said.

Leathern said in the post the company would make new information publicly available about the audience size of political ads in its Ad Library, showing approximately how many people the advertisers aimed to reach.

The changes followed a New York Times report this week of an internal memo by senior Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, who told employees that the company had a duty not to tilt the scales against U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.

Bosworth, a close confidant of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently made his post public. He wrote that he believed Facebook was responsible for Trump’s election in 2016, but not because of misinformation or Trump’s work with Cambridge Analytica.

Rather, he said, the Trump campaign used Facebook’s advertising tools most effectively.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/zh2kgg/article30531440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETFACEBOOKAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-tweaks-ad-policy-but-still-allows-political-lies-in-us-campaign-2020/article30531441.ece
41,2020/01/10,Narpath Raman gets inside your head,"From management consultant to mentalist, Narpath Raman’s career path is interesting to trace. At 23, he quit his job to become a street performer in Bengaluru, inspired by the work of Derren Brown and David Blaine. Six years later, he has performed at numerous corporate shows, and has even stumped former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, into revealing his first crush. “That was an incredible experience,” says the Chennai native, who returns to the city on January 11 for his first big show here.

This is, however, his second attempt at performing here. “The last time was during the 2015 floods — obviously, no one could make it,” says Raman. The show is an important one for him, as it will be recorded (with his audience) to promote his work online and on social media. “I would love to do some local content, but the main focus will be on doing bits that will appeal to anyone, anywhere,” he says, when asked what one can expect at tonight’s event.

Mentalism is still in its nascent stages in India, he feels, and there has only been a slight improvement since he began. “I was going through a tough phase in life, including the death of a close family member. I have always been reticent and under-confident, but I was thoroughly fascinated by mentalism — practising it became a form of therapy,” says the self-taught artiste. He recalls being kicked out of cafés and malls, and being looked at with suspicion when he approached people of any gender. “The men thought I was trying to rob them, and the women thought I was trying to hit on them,” he laughs. And so he took to the streets, before building up the skill to perform at open mic shows and beyond.

Not a party trick

Raman is very clear about one thing. “I am not a mind reader. Although what I do might look like it, there is a science behind it. There are verbal and non-verbal cues, among other factors,” he explains. Could he “read” my mind over the phone? “I’m working on it; perhaps the next time we speak, I will be prepared for it,” he says.

While there is a whole gamut of scientific and behavioural tactics that he uses, Raman is quite spiritual in his approach to life. He believes in the law of attraction, and its power to make your ambitions come true. But that is not why the show is titled God’s Child 101. “I don’t believe in God, but I do believe that we are not here by chance. We say we are just one in almost eight billion people. But the fact that we are born human itself means we have a purpose,” he says, concluding the conversation on a philosophical note.

God’s Child 101 takes place on January 11 from 7 pm, at SOCO, Bamboo Bar, Savera Hotel.

42,2020/01/10,On the CAA and NRC protests and finding common ground,"The farm guard found this strange creature… a fat, furry, brinjal-like thing, which waddled, swam, had a chubby tail and a face ending in a rectangle. “Animals, be careful, stay away from it. It is dangerous. After all, it is not like the rest of you,” the farm guard announced, “So let’s keep it imprisoned in this corner, in detention, in this cage. That should keep the rest of you safe. Howzat?”

Shut away alone, the brinjal-like thing promptly lost hope. What could one do against many?

The farm guard pounded his chest, “I will protect all you animals against this one thing, this alien. And tomorrow, we will decide how best to get rid of it.”

The night would be long, thought the frightened alien, who had no idea that he was alien; he had always thought he was another animal.

As darkness spread and threatened to engulf the land, he heard a flutter of wings. The birds were always first responders, thanks to good tweeting. “Hello Almost-bird, we heard,” cried the hawks, parrots, sparrows, “You are like us. We all lay eggs. We will stay with you.”

“Oh, what a tight squeeze, brother with a beak!” The ducks squashed in through the bars of the cage. “It is a bill,” the creature explained. The ducks were amused: “Call it what you want, languages differ but you’ve got to admit you are like us.”

Some old-fashioned mooing announced the kind-eyed cows, who usually stayed far from controversy. Not this time. “You are a mammal, we are mammals. You are like us. We’ll stand solidly in your corner and just chew cud.”

The chameleon piped up, giving everyone quite a start. He was, you see, sitting on the fence, completely camouflaged, but the other animals had given him the courage to come out, be seen, be heard. “You have legs at the sides of your body, like lizards, like crocodiles. You are no alien. You are like us.”

The ruckus brought the dogs charging in, goofy-tailed and smoofy-eyed. “Your tail is rather impressive,” the Golden Retriever admitted, “Even though it can’t wag like mine. You are like us. Fear not, strange dog, with us to protect you, no one can harm you.”

The next morning, the farm guard brought his gun, worried that the entire farm looked deserted. He found all the animals in the detention corner. “There may be one of him,” explained the young bulls, horns lowered, non-violent but non-silent, “but there are many of us.”

“You attack the platypus because he’s different. But to us, he’s just like us.”

43,2020/01/10,Cartoons for a cause: hoardings to educate public on traffic rule violations,"The road that leads to the airport has acquired a set of new hoardings. Unlike the usual jewellery, clothing and property ads one is accustomed to seeing on the stretch, these are giant cartoon strips.

A move by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), the hoardings are a way to educate the public on violations and penalties.

Reaching out

As part of the first phase of the campaign, spearheaded by the Deputy Transport Commissioner, Ernakulam, M P Ajithkumar, 12 hoardings have been put up on the CIAL Road, starting from Athani. Each of them depicts the most commonly committed traffic violations in the city. The officials decided to use cartoon as a medium as they felt it would reach out to more people. “Cartoons communicate better. They appeal to all age groups,” says Najeeb K M, Assistant Motor Vehicles Inspector, who is part of the campaign. “The primary step is to get people to see the hoardings,” he says.

The 6 ft / 9 ft hoardings have been made in fabric and are placed strategically along the road. They contain cartoons with Malayalam text, but the department is working on having hoardings in English as well. An MVD official is a character that appears in all the hoardings, which display offences such as not wearing a seat belt, helmet, riding triple on a two-wheeler, using the mobile phone while driving, drunken driving and using a polluting vehicle.

telling number The number of road accidents in Kerala up to September 2019, is 30,784 (according to statistics from the Kerala Police published on the website of the MVD).

“A number of violations occur because people don’t know the law. However, ignorance is not an excuse. These hoardings aim to inform people about the rules,” Najeeb says.

Even motorists who are aware of rules are sometimes negligent. “Displaying the fine corresponding to each offence could lead to more responsible behaviour on the road,” he says.

people-friendly move A handful of police stations in Kochi has been declared child-friendly. Cartoon characters have been painted on the walls of the Central, Kadavanthra and Ernakulam North Police stations.

The campaign to create a friendly ambience in police stations started in 2018. Steps would be taken to make the police stations more people-friendly, says K Lalji, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ernakulam.

Artist and caricaturist Ibrahim Badusha, who has done the cartoons, is happy to be associated with the cause. “The officials told me the concept and we came up with a series of cartoons that captured the ideas we wanted to convey. Cartoons are not just meant for entertainment, they can be a powerful tool to create awareness for a cause such as this,” he says. Badusha, who prefers to be known as the “cartoon man”, says his work has generated interest on social media, with appreciation trickling in.

In later phases of the campaign, the MVD is planning to organise exhibitions and displays in public places such as malls, railway stations and bus depots. The team has made about 50 slides, showing common violations. Editing and designing was done by Jinu, a staff of Keltron. “Change may not happen overnight, but as people see these messages frequently, they would get embedded in their memory.” The department is planning to conduct such campaigns across the State. The number of road accidents are on the rise and awareness is one of the only solutions, says Najeeb. “Not every traffic violation ends in an accident, but every accident is the result of some violation.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/on6e4v/article30532232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpcartoonteamJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/society/cartoon-hoardings-to-educate-people-on-traffic-violations/article30532239.ece

“People must respect that he’s played non-stop in all formats of the game for a while.”

Yes Bank said the board was scheduled to discuss the fit and proper status of Mr. Agarwal at Friday’s board meeting but he resigned before the meeting started.

“In this respect [Mr. Agarwal’s fit and proper status], the bank had obtained legal opinions from eminent jurists. These opinions were to be considered by the nomination and remuneration committee of the board of the bank in their meetings scheduled for January 10, 2020.

46,2020/01/10,"Infosys net surges 23%, firm raises guidance","Infosy said its overall performance for the third quarter, ended December 31, was ‘satisfactory’ on multiple counts: broad-based growth, steady increase in client metrics and large deal wins worth $1.8 billion.

The firm has witnessed a 23% year-on-year rise in its net profit for the quarter. Net profit rose to ₹4,466 crore compared with the ₹3,610 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.

Total revenue for the third quarter grew by 7.9% to ₹23,092 crore, up from the ₹21,400 crore in the year-earlier period.

Operating profit up

Operating profit stood at ₹5,064 crore during the quarter, an increase of 4.8% year-on-year (YoY). The quarter saw its operating margin improving by 20 basis points to 21.9% compared with the previous quarter.

Infosys CEO and MD Salil Parekh said, “[The] Q3 results further underscore that we remain steadfast in our journey of sustained client relevance and deepening engagement with them, as they partner with us in navigating their next in the digital transformation era. For us, this has translated into double-digit growth year-to-date, leading to an increase in revenue guidance, accompanied by expanding operating margins.”

Infosys posted a cumulative revenue of ₹67,524 crore and an operating profit of ₹14,447 crore, a YoY growth of 10.4% and 1.3% respectively, in the last nine months of the current fiscal.

COO U.B. Pravin Rao said, “large deal wins continue to be robust with a growth of 56% so far this year.’’

Commenting on operating margins, CFO Nilanjan Roy said, “Operating margins improved further during the quarter, driven by relentless cost optimisation and operating leverage. Cash generation was extremely strong with cumulative free cash flow crossing $1.5 billion.

“Return on equity increased further to 25.9%, driven by margin expansion and increased shareholder payouts.” The firm revised its FY20 revenue outlook upwards to 10-10.5% in constant currency. Operating margin guidance was maintained in the 21-23% range.

In Q3, digital revenue accounted for 40.6% of the firm’s total revenue, against 38.3% in the previous quarter and 32.5% in the corresponding quarter a year ago.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/infosys-net-surges-23-firm-raises-guidance/article30537438.ece
47,2020/01/10,Worst auto sales decline in 2 decades,"With domestic vehicle sales continuing to decline in December by 13%, the auto industry recorded its worst-ever annual sales fall in two decades in 2019, as consumer sentiment remained subdued amid a slowdown in the economy.

According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Friday, in December 2019, the total vehicle wholesales stood at over 14.05 lakh units as against over 16.17 lakh units in the year-ago month. For the full year, vehicle manufacturers sold over 2.3 crore units across categories in 2019, a decline of 13.77% from over 2.67 crore vehicles sold in 2018.

Prior to 2019, the industry had witnessed a decline in annual sales only twice since SIAM started recording the data in 1997 — in 2007 when overall sales declined by 1.44%, and in 2008 when the sales fell 1.11%.

Challenges remain

SIAM president Rajan Wadhera said that while de-growth had been “lesser” in December, some challenges still remained for the industry. “Festive season positivity has not sustained. While we have seen some improvement, the consumer sentiment continues to remain low,” he added. “Economic growth remains an area of concern... the GDP growth forecast does not bear good news for the industry, especially for the commercial vehicles segment, which is clearly linked to it. If the economy grows at 6-7% in the Q1 of next fiscal, CVs should return to growth levels as seen 3-4 quarters back. Besides, low demand from rural areas continues to be a matter of concern,” Mr. Wadhera said.

In December 2019, passenger vehicle sales declined by 1.24% to over 2.35 lakh units, with car sales falling 8.4% to over 1.42 lakh units and those of vans dipping 53.6% to 8,408 units. However, utility vehicle sales grew 30% to 85,252 units. Mr. Wadhera said going forward, he expected UVs to continue growing on the back of new model launches, while car sales may “remain flattish”.

For the full year, PV sales declined by 12.75%, which too is the steepest decline in over two decades, to over 29.62 lakh units.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fhmf4d/article30537312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vehiclebw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/worst-auto-sales-decline-in-2-decades/article30537314.ece
48,2020/01/10,Engineering exports to be same as last year,"Engineering exports this financial year are expected to be almost the same as that of last year (2018-2019), according to Ravi Sehgal, chairman of EEPC India.

Mr. Sehgal, who was in Coimbatore on Thursday, told The Hindu that at the beginning of 2019-2020, the estimate was that engineering exports this fiscal would be about $85 billion. Between April and November 2019, the exports were down 1% compared to the same period the previous year. “Last financial year, it was $ 81 billion. This year, it is expected to be almost the same,” he said.

The U.S. and the EU are major destinations for engineering exports and China’s supplies have come down drastically due to several reasons such as pollution issues, high labour cost, anti-dumping duties, etc.

European clients had approached Indian companies in the beginning of this financial year as Chinese supplies reduced. But, India did not have adequate capacity.

“We have capacity shortages. We would have reached $90 billion [engineering exports] if [we had had] capacity,” he said.

Now that Indian exporters know that there is potential, they are investing. Most of the foundries are in the MSME sector and so, investments for capacity expansion do take time, he said. “India is still a preferred destination. We will see the effect in 2020.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/engineering-exports-to-be-same-as-last-year/article30537054.ece
49,2020/01/10,Broadcasters protest new tariff regime,"The latest tariff order on cable TV pricing from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) will trigger a massive disruption for the country’s broadcasting industry and lead to job losses as well as closure of smaller, niche channels, the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) said on Friday, questioning the regulator’s move.

On January 1 this year, TRAI unveiled a 33% cap on discounts that can be offered to cable subscribers opting for a channel bouquet and a pricing cap of ₹12 per channel to be included in a bouquet, down from ₹19 per channel in the current regime. The changes, that also include a restriction on the number of bouquets that can be offered, are slated to kick in from March 2020.

A new tariff regime for cable TV subscribers was introduced just last year by the TRAI with a view to improving choices and bringing down costs for TV viewers — though costs have not necessarily gone down. Customer costs may not go down even after TRAI’s fresh pricing norms, broadcasters reckon.

Viability of pay TV

N.P. Singh, MD and CEO, Sony Pictures Networks India, and president of the IBF, said the fresh changes to tariffs, introduced ‘in less than 12 months,’ will severely impair broadcasters’ ability to compete with other unregulated platforms and adversely affect the viability of the pay TV industry.

Uday Shankar, president of the Walt Disney Company Asia Pacific, and chairman of Star India and Walt Disney India, said the impact of the TRAI’s new diktat would be ‘dramatically disruptive’ in the short and long run, leading to closure of smaller niche channels over a couple of years, thus reducing choice for consumers.

Terming frequent changes in tariff policy ‘a trigger-happy regulatory approach,’ Mr. Shankar said the stated concern about lowering prices for consumers appears misleading as distributors were being allowed to charge ₹160 even for providing free channels.

“These changes are not in line with the stated intent of improving the Ease of Doing Business. Whether it will really benefit end consumers is also (arguable),” noted Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited.

Sudhanshu Vats, Group CEO, Viacom 18 Media, and IBF vice-president, compared the tariff order changes to a desire to ‘serve a standard Thali for all Indians’ in just the broadcasting sector. “We have grown at less than half the inflation rate since 2003, and therefore, the argument that prices are high is not borne out by data,” he said.

“We supported the New Tariff Order introduced in 2019 though industry was apprehensive of the magnitude of changes… over ₹1,000 crore was spent collectively just to inform consumers what the changes meant,” said Mr. Singh. Consumers and other stakeholders faced considerable inconvenience during the transition and nearly 15 million consumers subscribers have been lost in the process, he pointed out.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qfc6mf/article30537040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUDISHANTENNA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/broadcasters-protest-new-tariff-regime/article30537042.ece

Airtel, which had introduced voice-over Wi-Fi last month, said the service has crossed one million users.

The service enables customers to switch seamlessly from LTE to Wi-Fi-based calling when they are inside their homes or offices, thereby enhancing indoor voice calling experience for smartphone customers. There are no extra charges for making calls via Airtel Wi-Fi calling.

54,2020/01/10,SC stays NCLAT order reinstating Mistry as Tata Sons chairman,"The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as chairman of the multi-billion salt to software conglomerate Tata Sons.

A three-judge Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde, Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant issued formal notice to respondents, including Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd. and others, on appeals separately filed by Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd. and its chairman emeritus, Ratan Tata, among others, against the December 18 decision of the tribunal.

Chief Justice Bobde orally remarked that prima facie the NCLAT may have committed an “adjudication error” by ordering the reinstatement of Mr. Mistry.

“There was no such prayer for reinstatement made. This is an error, we feel, which permeates the whole order [of the NCLAT]... The tribunal was granted a prayer that was never made,” the CJI said. The court, however, agreed to hear detailed arguments on the aspect. It recorded in its order an assurance given by the Tata side that they “do not not intend to take any steps with regard to Article 75”.

The Article allows Tata Sons to “compulsorily purchase” shares of any shareholder. The NCLAT had also directed Tata Sons to not invoke Article 75 of the Articles of Association of Tata Sons against the Shapoorji Pallonji group, a minority shareholder. Mr. Mistry is a scion of the group.

The assurance from the Tata side, represented by lawyers led by senior advocate Harish Salve, to not invoke Article 75 was given after senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, for Shapoorji Pallonji, vociferously argued against the stay order. Mr. Sundaram instead sought status quo, saying that as a minority shareholder with shares worth crores, he was “completely in the dark” about what was happening within Tata Sons.

“We will protect you... so far nothing has diluted your shares,” the CJI responded.

The court posted the appeals after four weeks, saying there was no urgency in the issue.

Also Read NCLAT decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry a recipe for disaster, Tatas tell Supreme Court

“You [Mistry] have not been in the saddle for three years... what is the urgency now,” Chief Justice Bobde said.

The Tata Sons’ appeal said the NCLAT decision to bring Mr. Mistry back to the helm was a blow to corporate democracy and rights of the board of directors. Mr. Mistry’s tenure as chairman and director of Tata Sons expired in March 2017. The NCLAT decision to restore him to his “original position” for the “rest of his tenure” is contrary to company law, a recipe for disaster and sets a dangerous precedent in law, it submitted.

The company argued that a majority of the board of directors at Tata Sons had voted for Mr. Mistry’s replacement as chairman on October 24, 2016 after losing confidence in him. He was again removed as the director of Tata Sons on February 6, 2017 following the procedure that applied to corporate appointments.

In his separate appeal, Mr. Tata said the NCLAT verdict had virtually pulled down the governance and corporate structure painstakingly built by the founders of the Indian multinational conglomerate. Mr. Mistry had succeeded Mr. Tata as chairman. In his appeal, Mr. Tata blamed Mr. Mistry for his lack of leadership skills besides exhibiting a reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the chairman of Tata Sons.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tqcf1q/article24592458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MISTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sc-stays-nclat-order-restoring-cyrus-mistry-as-executive-chairman-of-tata-group/article30531780.ece
55,2020/01/10,India's oil demand growth set to overtake China by mid-2020s: IEA,"India's oil demand growth is set to overtake China by mid-2020s, priming the country for more refinery investment but making it more vulnerable to supply disruption in the Middle East, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.

India's oil demand is expected to reach 6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2024 from 4.4 million bpd in 2017, but its domestic production is expected to rise only marginally, making the country more reliant on crude imports and more vulnerable to supply disruption in the Middle East, the agency said.

China's demand is likely to be slighlty lower than that of India by the mid-2020s, as per IEA's China estimates given in November, but the gap would slowly become bigger thereafter.

“Indian economy is and will become even more exposed to risks of supply disruptions, geopolitical uncertainties and the volatility of oil prices,” the IEA said in a report on India's energy policies.

Brent crude prices topped $70 a barrel on rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, putting pressure on emerging markets such as India. Like the rest of Asia, India is highly dependent on Middle East oil supplies with Iraq being its largest crude supplier.

India, which ranks No. 3 in terms of global oil consumption after China and the United States, ships in over 80% of its oil needs, of which 65% is from the Middle East through the Strait of Hormuz, the IEA said.

The IEA, which coordinates release of strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) among developed countries in times of emergency, said it is important for India to expand its reserves.

REFINERY INVESTMENTS

India is the world's fourth largest oil refiner and a net exporter of refined fuel, mainly gasoline and diesel.

India has drawn plans to lift its refining capacity to about 8 million bpd by 2025 from the current about 5 million bpd.

The IEA, however, forecasts India's refining capacity to rise to 5.7 million bpd by 2024.

This would make “India a very attractive market for refinery investment,” IEA said.

Drawn to India's higher fuel demand potential, global oil majors like Saudi Aramco, BP, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co and Total are looking at investing in India's oil sector.

Saudi Aramco and ADNOC aim to own a 50% stake in a planned 1.2-million bpd refinery in western Maharashtra state, for which land is yet to be acquired.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/99kdff/article30531267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THINDIAOIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-oil-demand-growth-set-to-overtake-china-by-mid-2020s-iea/article30531268.ece

The two suspects in purported videos, in a sting done by India Today, states that they are ABVP volunteers and varsity students pursing Bachelors in French.

The ABVP has refuted the charges, saying both students who figured in the purported videos are not their members.

In the sting videos, the students are seen admitting that they were part of the violence outside the varsity’s Sabarmati hostel.

In one of the videos, another suspect is seen admitting that 20 more ABVP volunteers were part of the masked mob.

RTI activists Anjali Bhardwaj and Amrita Johri, who sought to know from the State Bank of India (SBI) the number of EBs their 29 authorised branches had sold since January 2, 2018, claimed that 23 branches had furnished the information

These 23 branches had revealed that 11,770 EBs worth ₹5,936.7 crore had been sold since January 2, 2018.

₹1 crore denomination

“Of the 11,770 bonds, 5,463 were of the denomination of ₹1 crore which means that 92% of the amount given through bonds was in the denomination of ₹1 crore. For 6 branches: Lucknow, Patna, Ranchi, Vishakhapatnam, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram, no information has been received till date,” the activists said in a statement.

“All the branches denied information on the names of persons who purchased bonds in the denomination of ₹1 crore stating that ‘The information sought by the applicant cannot be disclosed as it is in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of which is exempted under 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of RTI Act, 2005’… This is a violation of peoples’ right to know,” the activists said.

60,2020/01/10,SC ruling will restore information flow from J&K: Congress,"The Congress on Friday said that the Supreme Court’s ruling that dissent cannot be suppressed by imposition of prohibitory orders in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) had given a jolt to the Modi-led government.

Welcoming the judgment, former Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal termed the order ‘historic’ while former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said it was a “rebuff to the unconstitutional and arrogant stance of the Central government and the J&K administration on restrictions imposed there”.

Mr. Chidambaram also demanded that Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik step down from his position, owning up his actions as the former J&K Governor.

“The entire team in J&K that designed and executed the plan should be changed. A new set of administrators who respect the Constitution should be appointed. The former Governor of J&K, Mr. Satpal Malik, should own responsibility and resign from his present post of Governor, Goa,” Mr. Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.

At a press conference held at the Congress headquarters, Mr. Sibal said the top court’s observation that prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 cannot be used indefinitely to suppress freedom of speech and expression and difference of opinion was “path-breaking”.

“I would like to tell the Home Minister today to please listen to the voice of the people. Don’t just rain lathis (batons) on them,” Mr. Sibal said, adding that the top court’s order will restore free flow of information from the region.

“Why don’t you allow us to visit Jammu and Kashmir? Why do you not have faith in us or the people of India? If people from outside India have the right to visit Jammu and Kashmir, why not us? Do you consider us as perpetrators of violence?” the former Minister asked.

61,2020/01/10,JNU compromise deal back on the table,"The compromise formula currently under discussion between agitating students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and its Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar is the same as the agreement that was under discussion a month ago and led to the transfer of then Secretary of Higher Education R. Subrahmanyam.

On December 11, following talks between both sides, Higher Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had given the Vice-Chancellor an ultimatum to implement the agreement or resign, according to a senior government official. However, neither side implemented the terms of the agreement. On December 13, Mr. Subrahmanyam, who had been coordinating the talks, was transferred, and the students’ agitation resumed.

On Friday, current HRD Secretary Amit Khare separately met Dr. Kumar and the leaders of the students’ union in yet another attempt to broker peace in the two-and-a-half month long stand-off. The row, initially sparked by a hostel fee hike, has led to mass street protests and saw attacks against students and teachers on campus last weekend.

Following the discussions, Mr. Khare told reporters that as the JNU administration has met the basic demands of students on hostel fees, the latter should withdraw the agitation.

However, Mr. Khare was non-committal on the students’ demand for notification of their elected union, only saying that “while many other demands may be there, the basic demand has been met.”

On Friday, Dr. Kumar told the Ministry that he was “taking all steps to implement the decisions arrived at” in the December 11 agreement. However, action has only been taken on the issue of hostel fees.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh reserved the order on the plea and said it would pronounce the verdict on Saturday. The court asked where the difficulty lay in acknowledging the advocate.

63,2020/01/10,Plea against demolition of Kerala resorts rejected,"The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed appeals by Kapico Kerala Resorts Private Limited, against a Kerala High Court decision banning the construction of resorts and removal of structures on backwater islands on Vembanad lake in Alappuzha district of the State.

A three-judge Bench of Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian confirmed the High Court decision that the constructions violate coastal and environmental regulations. The 35-page apex court judgment was authored by Justice Ramasubramanian.

The case concerned the development of resorts on the two backwater islands of Vettila Thuruthu and Nediyathuruthu on the Vembanad. In 2013, the High Court had allowed petitions filed by conservationists, societies, trade unions, workers and traditional fishermen, and held that the action initiated by the authorities under the Land Conservancy Act for removal of encroachments should continue.

The court had then ordered the Centre or the coastal authorities to ensure that the encroachments are removed in three months.

The High Court had also decided that the project proponent for Nediyathuruthu, Kapico, and that for Vettila Thuruthu, Vaamika, should not carry out any further constructions. The court had also ordered the government to remove the unauthorised structures put by Vaamika and take action in regard to the unnumbered buildings on Vettila Thuruthu.

The High Court had later dismissed review petitions filed against the 2013 judgment and, instead, ordered the demolition of the unauthorised constructions.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plea-against-demolition-of-kerala-resorts-rejected/article30537192.ece

“The objective in making this intervention is to assist the court by offering expertise on State parties’ obligations under international law with regard to the prevention of racial discrimination against migrants, racial, ethnic and religious minorities, and populations otherwise perceived as ‘foreign.’ It is also to aid the court in upholding India’s obligations, in the spirit of an amicus curiae,” the application, represented by senior advocate C.U.

A Bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant issued notice to the Centre and others. The appeal, filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, has challenged the September 3 order, which said it was for Parliament and the State Legislature to enact laws and not the court.

It said the High Court had failed to appreciate that the right to clean air, drinking water, health, peaceful sleep, shelter, livelihood and education guaranteed under Articles 21 and 21A of the Constitution could not be secured for all citizens without controlling the population.

Plea to enact law

68,2020/01/10,Mentally ill undergo less cancer screening: study,"Despite the increased mortality from cancer among people with mental illness, this segment of population receives considerably less screening than the general population, says a new study published recently in The Lancet Psychiatry, a medical journal.

“Screening was significantly less frequent in people with any mental disease compared with the general population for any cancer,” stated the study titled ‘Disparities in cancer screening in people with mental illness across the world versus the general population.’

Specific approach

The study calls for a specific approach to assisting people with mental illness in undergoing appropriate screening, especially women with schizophrenia.

“Since people with mental illness are more likely to die from cancer, we assessed whether people with mental illness undergo less cancer screening compared with the general population,” the study notes.

The researchers say they reviewed and analysed literature on the issue without a language restriction and hand-searched the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews of observational studies from the inception of database until May 5, 2019.

Several studies

These also included all published studies on any type of cancer screening among patients with mental illness, as well as those that reported prevalence of cancer screening among patients or comparative measures for patients and the general population.

For this paper, 47 publications provided data from 46 samples, including 47,17,839 individuals (5,01,559 patients with mental illness and 42,16,280 controls).

Of these, 69.85% were women, for breast cancer screening.

69,2020/01/10,Section 144 not a tool to suppress opinion: SC,"The orders of restriction issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) could not be used as a tool to suppress legitimate expressions, opinions and grievances in a democracy, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday.

Referring to the submissions by petitioners that the police were still restricting the movement of people during the day in Jammu and Kashmir, the court said it was neither proper nor correct on the part of the State to resort to such acts. “If a government thinks there is a threat to law and order..., it must follow due procedure, taking into consideration the rights of citizens, and pass only appropriate and need-based restrictive orders,” it said.

The court noted that the orders issued under Section 144 in Jammu and Kashmir did not explain that restrictions were imposed in anticipation of a threat to law and order or to prevent loss of life and property. This was despite the fact that government had argued that the restrictions were imposed because of the erstwhile State’s history of cross-border terrorism and infiltration and other security issues. Divergent views and disapproval of government action could not lead to imposition of Section 144, the court said.

The power was meant to be used only in case of public emergency or in the interest of public safety. Magistrates could not apply a strait-jacket formula without assessing the objective and material facts. Restrictions could not be excessive in nature or duration, it said.

On the contention whether Section 144 could be invoked against the public in general or against specific groups or persons, the court referred to the Madhu Limaye judgment that a general order could be passed if the number of persons was so large that a distinction could not be made without risk.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z1y248/article30537111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-NOWGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/section-144-not-a-tool-to-suppress-opinion-sc/article30537112.ece
70,2020/01/10,SC rejects govt stand on total Net blockage in Jammu and Kashmir,"The Supreme Court on Friday rejected the argument of the Jammu and Kashmir government that it opted for a blanket suspension of Internet services in the Valley because it lacked the technology to allow selective online access.

“If such a contention is accepted, the government would have a free pass to put a complete Internet blockage every time. Such complete blocking/prohibition perpetually cannot be accepted by this court,” the court said.

However, it noted that there was “ample merit” in the government’s argument that Internet could be used to propagate terrorism in J&K, thereby challenging the sovereignty and integrity of the nation.

But the court made it a point to observe that peace in J&K should be achieved without “excessively burdening” the fundamental right of free speech. It held that a restriction imposed on fundamental rights without appropriate justification was disproportionate. The goal behind a restriction should be legitimate. The degree and scope of a restriction should be proportionate what was actually necessary to combat an emergency.

The authorities ought to opt for a lesser intrusive mechanism if the same the goal could be attained through that. The State should resort to the least restrictive measure while taking into consideration the facts and circumstances.

The petition also sought directions for preservation and retrieval of all material/ evidences available with WhatsApp INC., Google INC. and Apple INC. pertaining to relevant data of WhatsApp groups ‘Unity Against Left’ and ‘Friends of RSS’ including messages, pictures, videos and phone numbers of the members, in connection with the violence at JNU.

The petition has been listed for hearing before Justice Brijesh Sethi on January 13.

The petition, filed by Ameet Parameswaran, Atul Sood and Shukla Vinayak Sawant, seeks necessary directions to the Delhi Police Commissioner and Delhi government.

Filed through advocates Abhik Chimni, Maanav Kumar and Roshni Naamboodiry, it sought a direction to the Delhi Police to retrieve all CCTV footage of JNU campus.

On January 5, a mob of masked men stormed the campus and targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods by hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings.

Three FIRs have been registered at Vasant Kunj (north) police station in the incident.

The plea claimed it was evident that a significant amount of data, information, evidence and material pertaining to the said incident of violence, including persons with their registered phone numbers responsible for the same, was communicated through WhatsApp’s platform, and its data back-up is an important evidence in respect of the incidents of violence.

“In order to ensure that the relevant evidence may be preserved, JNU teachers association (JNUTA) has sent requests/ representations to respondent nos. 1 (Police Commissioner), 3 (WhatsApp) and 4 (Google), asking that all these materials be safely retrieved for investigation purposes.

“In these representations, JNUTA has cited relevant provisions of the respondent no.3’s Terms of Use, Information Technology Act, 2000, Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011 and other applicable laws. The petitioner no.2 has also sent similar request/representation to the respondent no.3,” the plea said.

However, the police has neither responded to such requests placed by one of the petitioners and JNUTA nor has it reached out to them, or other informants, despite clear and cogent material provided to the investigating agency along with the written representations, it claimed.

The plea said the petitioners apprehend that in the absence of a direction from the court or the police commissioner, the relevant evidence may not be properly preserved.

It claimed that as per the knowledge of the petitioners as well as news reports, the police has not yet retrieved CCTV footage, which is crucial evidence.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p7p15q/article30535070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNUVIOLENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-campus-violence-3-jnu-professors-move-hc-with-pil-to-preserve-data-cctv-footage-evidence/article30536332.ece
72,2020/01/10,SC has no views on if ‘access to Internet’ is a fundamental right,"The Supreme Court on Friday declined to express any views on whether “access to Internet” is a fundamental right.

In its 130-page judgment directing the government to “forthwith” review its orders suspending Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, the court merely confined itself to declaring that the freedoms of speech, expression and conducting business on the Internet are fundamental rights integral to Article 19 of the Constitution and subject to reasonable restrictions.

“None of the counsels have argued for declaring the right to access the Internet as a fundamental right and therefore we are not expressing any view on the same,” Justice Ramana, who authored the verdict, wrote.

The judgment, however, makes a reference to how even one of the fathers of the Internet, Vinton G. Cerf, has argued that Internet cannot be elevated to the status of a human right.

“He argued that while the Internet is very important, however, it cannot be elevated to the status of a human right. Technology, in his view, is an enabler of rights and not a right in and of itself,” Justice Ramana wrote.

The court clarified that the right to free speech and expression includes the right to disseminate information as far and wide as possible. The State cannot restrict or deny free speech on the Internet because the medium has a huge impact and can circulate information across a wide range. The fundamental right of free speech and expression, with the advent of technology, includes speech and expression over different media. Law has to recognise the relevance of Internet.

“Expression through the Internet has gained contemporary relevance. It is one of the major means of information diffusion. Therefore, the freedom of speech and expression through the medium of internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a)...” the court noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bpite3/article30536064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXSUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-has-no-views-on-if-access-to-internet-is-a-fundamental-right/article30536065.ece

“The DMA headed by Gen Bipin Rawat will have two Joint Secretaries, 13 Deputy Secretaries, 25 Under Secretaries and 22 Section officers,” a defence source said.

The Rules of Business have been approved by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and would be notified as a gazette, another official said.

The training policy, most of the training establishments and cadre management of the Services will be under the purview of the DMA, another official said, adding that defence diplomacy of the neighbourhood countries would also be under the CDS.

Similarly, deputations to the training establishments such as the National Defence Academy (NDA), the Indian Military Academy (IMA), the Officers Training Academy (OTA) and the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) would also be under the CDS. “Cadre review of Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) and Other Ranks (OR) will be looked after by the CDS,” the official said.

Two studies on the cadre review of officers and JCOs and ORs were carried out by the Army when Gen. Rawat was its chief and they were awaiting necessary approvals from the government for implementation.

He welcomed the Supreme Court order on Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir, saying it will restore free flow of information from the region and termed as “path-breaking” its observation that prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 cannot be used indefinitely to suppress freedom of speech and expression and difference of opinion.

“I want to ask the prime minister that why do you have so much affection with foreigners and why not with the people of India. At least, you should be more transparent and open with the people of India,” Sibal told a press conference.

“Why don’t you allow us to visit Jammu and Kashmir? Why you do not have faith in us or the people of India? If people from outside India have the right to visit Jammu and Kashmir, why not us? Do you consider us as perpetrators of violence?” he asked.

Mr. Sibal also sought to know from Home Minister Amit Shah as to what was the emergency on August 4, 2019, that Internet service suspended was from August 5 “without any reason”.

In a significant judgment with implications on basic freedoms beyond Kashmir, the Supreme Court on Friday said internet access is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution and asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to review within a week all curbs in the union territory.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana and also comprising Justices B R Gavai and R Subhash Reddy, asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to immediately restore internet services in institutions providing essential services like hospitals and educational places.

“This is a very important order. It is a historic verdict that has been pronounced by a 3-judge Supreme Court bench and this will ensure free flow of information from Kashmir. It is historic because the people of India were concerned about the Jammu and Kashmir situation as no one knows about it,” Mr. Sibal said.

He said the apex court has said there was doubt in public minds about the situation in Kashmir as Section 144 was in force throughout the region with Internet shut and communication down.

The Congress leader wondered why prohibitory order was not imposed in Jawaharlal Nehru University where violence happened inside the campus and the police stood outside. He termed “shameful” the actions of Delhi police in the JNU violence incident.

He said the apex court has said that suspension can be utilised temporarily only and any order suspending Internet issued under the Suspension Rules, must adhere to the principle of proportionality and must not extend beyond necessary duration.

“Repetitive orders under Section 144 CrPC would be an abuse of power,” Mr. Sibal said citing the court order and added that while exercising the power a magistrate is duty bound to balance the rights and restrictions based on the principles of proportionality and thereafter apply the least intrusive measure.

“The power under Section 144 CrPC cannot be used to suppress legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights,” he said.

Not a single arrest has been made so far by the police and they have been accused of standing around when the masked mob made good their escape from the campus on Sunday night after the attack.

Joy Tirkey, DCP (Crime) and head of the special investigation team formed to investigate the violence, released pictures of the ‘suspects’ that they had allegedly obtained from mobile recordings.

He targeted four Left groups as being responsible for the violence but did not mention the ABVP (Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad) even once. Earlier, the police had described the violence as a “clash” between two groups.

Both Mr. Tirkey and Mandeep Randhawa, Delhi police spokesman, erred publicly in describing the Students Federation of India as Students “Front” of India on more than one occasion.

After the media briefing, Mr. Tirkey immediately rushed towards his car and refused to take questions. At the briefing, he ‘identified’ the students groups and unions that attacked the Periyar Hostel and server room but did not reveal the name of the groups involved in the attack on teachers and inside the Sabarmati Hostel.

All the photos released by police were in daylight while Sabarmati was attacked after sunset. The police did not throw any light on the masked miscreants photographed at Sabarmati.

Mr. Tirkey said, “A scuffle on January 5 was triggered when a group of students vandalised CIS room and damaged the server, resulting in delay in the registration process. Another group of students when opposed the act, got in the fight but it was timely intervened by security guards and they were dispersed.”

He said that at 3.45 p.m., a group of students attacked a room in Periyar. After this, a WhatsApp group (Unity Against Left) was formed at 5 p.m.

A large group of miscreants attacked teachers and students gathered at Sabarmati T-point for a peace meeting. The mob also attacked specific rooms in Sabarmati.

“We have also identified the administrator of the Whatsapp Group among the nine suspects. The investigation is yet to be concluded. We are identifying more suspects,” he said.

Mr. Tirkey stated that they have recorded the statement of security guards and hostel wardens to corroborate with the sequence of the incident. “No CCTV of the incident is available because CCTVs in JNU campus are connected to the server room through wifi. The server room was damaged on January 3.” .

However, when asked about the role of outsiders involved in the attack, he did not give a direct response but mentioned that it was difficult for an outsider to gain entry into the campus. “Only guests verified by the resident of the JNU get entry. We are scanning visitor records from the register and also verifying people seen in the mobile videos shot during the attack,” he said.

Pakistan and China on Monday launched a major drill in the North Arabian Sea with an aim to increase inter-operability and strategic cooperation between their two navies.

The properties include a Mumbai flat, some seized cash and assets valued at Rs.74.54 crore held in the name of Mr. Kochhar's company Nupower Renewables Private Limited [earlier known as NuPower Renewables Limited (NRL)] and its subsidiaries, including Windfarm Projects, located in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

The ED alleges that Ms. Kochhar and her family acquired the apartment in Mumbai, owned by one of the Videocon Group companies, by taking over that company through her family trust at a nominal price by creating book entries.

The ED probe is based on an FIR registered by the CBI to probe allegations of quid pro quo in sanctioning loans amounting to Rs.1,875 crore to the companies of Videocon Group chief Venugopal Dhoot.

It was alleged that Mr. Dhoot paid ₹64 crore to NRL. The amount, paid out of a loan of Rs.300 crore sanctioned to Videocon International Electronics Limited, was transferred by Videocon Industries Limited on September 8, 2009, just one day after the disbursement, the ED said.

The ED had recorded the statements of Ms. Kochhar, Mr. Dhoot and several others involved in the case. In March last, it conducted searches in Mumbai and Aurangabad.

According to the agencies, during Ms. Kochhar's tenure, the bank sanctioned six high-value loans to various Videocon Group companies between June 2009 and October 2011.

As on April 26, 2012, the outstanding against the loan accounts were adjusted as another term loan of Rs.1,730 crore that was sanctioned under the refinance of domestic debt. The accounts were declared non-performing assets in June 2017.

80,2020/01/10,"Post-violence trauma taking a toll on our minds, but our spirits remain unbroken: JNU students","She considered JNU one of the safest campuses for women, but now Charukeshi Bhatt, pursuing her masters in Political Science from the university, feels insecure and disturbed in the wake of the violence unleashed by a masked mob on Sunday.

The 24-year-old Varanasi native says the horrific incident has “hit the psyche” of students, affecting their daily lives and interrupting career plans.

“I consider JNU as one of the best campuses in the country as far as the safety of women is concerned. Prior to the attack, I would feel free and safe to roam around here alone at any given time, day or night. But now, I generally ask a male friend to accompany me if I am stepping out at night in the campus,” she said.

On Sunday, a mob of masked young people stormed the JNU campus in south Delhi and systematically targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods, hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings. They also attacked a women’s hostel.

“However liberal the women of JNU may be considered, who step out fearlessly otherwise, the trauma of the violence is taking a toll on our minds. We feel disturbed,” she said.

The young student said she completed her Bachelor’s in Political Science from Delhi University’s Miranda House in 2018 before joining the Jawaharlal Nehru University and both the campuses have “taught me to live boldly and fearlessly“.

An uneasy lull prevailed on the campus on Friday as very few people were seen in the university streets and eating joints, otherwise brimming with students.

The unease at the university’s Sabarmati Hostel, which bore a heavy brunt of the mob violence, was palpable as a few students were seen leaving the campus fearing for their safety on Thursday evening as well.

Shards of broken glass window panes lay swept on the main entrance of the residential facility, while inside the popular hostel’s mess, a stark silence welcomed visitors.

No readers were seen at newspapers’ podiums and graffiti scrawled on walls and pillars described the incident as a “Black Sunday 2020“.

“Jan-5-2020 JNU will never forget” read another graffiti, screaming in bold red, as students passed by in silence.

While the atmosphere inside the sprawling campus remained in the grip of uneasy calm, outside the main gate (the North Gate of the JNU) a posse of police personnel kept a tight vigil to prevent any untoward incident.

Many students attacked by the mob on that fateful evening have temporarily shifted to rooms of their friends, saying “the memories of the violence has left a deep scar on the psyche“.

“Many of my friends who came running into my room on the first floor of the hostel that evening, while being chased by a feral mob, later jumped off the balcony to save their lives. I jumped into the balcony of a neighbour’s room and he sheltered me. The attackers banged the door but we had bolted it from inside,” recalled a male PhD student who did not wish to be identified.

His room still lay ransacked with shards of glass scattered on the ground as a gloomy air hung around it.

“I have shifted to a friend’s room in the campus. Memories of the attack send shiver down our spine,” he said.

Jyoti Kumari, another student who resides in the Sabarmati Hostel, recounted the “horrific evening” when she had seen “JNU girls in grip of abject fear“.

“This was not to just commit violence, to damage and vandalise property, but to terrorise us into submission. I was there when the mob attacked our hostel, who were armed with shovels and other sharp objects. As I was shooting a video to capture their act, one of the attackers threw a stone at me, injuring my hand,” she said.

“But we will not relent and continue to fight against what is wrong and unjust,” she said.

On the Baba Gang Nath Marg, students had to face hardship in hiring cabs or auto-rickshaws as barricades put up on both ends of the road, a little ahead of the North Gate, forced people to walk on foot for long before taking any public transport.

Adding to their woes, several cab and auto-rickshaw drivers are not willing to take commuters to the JNU campus or pick them up from the varsity premises after the Incident took place.

A woman student said the “atmosphere of fear” on the campus is “still palpable”.

“The whole episode was done to further vitiate the atmosphere of JNU because we are a thinking campus and we raise voice against what is wrong and unjust. Many politicians mock us, saying ‘we should study and not agitate’ My question is, have they left an environment that is conducive for education in any central university. We saw what happened in Jamia Islamia or AMU before that,” she said.

Ms. Bhatt said the violence inflicted by the mob wanted to instil fear among the students and on Wednesday night the library was totally deserted, “something I have never seen in JNU“.

“One of my classmates who had an internship opportunity in France, declined to take it up, in solidarity with the fellow students. Imagine his mental condition,” she said.

“Though the incident has disturbed us, they cannot break the spirit of JNU,” Ms. Bhatt added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ok8c3z/article30534421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNUSTUDENTSPROTESTFEEHIKECP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/post-violence-trauma-taking-a-toll-on-our-minds-but-our-spirits-remain-unbroken-jnu-students/article30534422.ece
81,2020/01/10,Nirbhaya case: Delhi court dismisses NGO plea to persuade death row convicts to donate organs,"A Delhi court on Friday dismissed an NGO’s plea for a meeting with four death row convicts in the sensational 2012 Nirbhaya Gang rape and murder case to persuade them to donate their organs.

Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora dismissed the application “being devoid of any merit”.

The court had ordered on January 7 that the four convicts — Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) — be hanged on January 22 at 7 a.m. in Tihar jail.

“Having given my thoughtful consideration and having perused the material on record, I am of the view that applicant has no locus to meet the convicts and jail authorities cannot be directed to facilitate the meeting,” the judge said, dismissing the petition.

The court also noted, “As per record available two of the four have moved petitions before SC.”

The petition, filed by an NGO, RACO, said, “The applicant is requesting for a meeting with the convicts along with a group comprising of experts from various fields including psychiatrist, spiritual leader, lawyer and the undersigned, to lead expert consultations with the hope that we would acknowledge remorse to these convicts regarding the heinous crime committed by them.”

“We intend to motivate them to donate their organs for social welfare,” said advocate Shivam Sharma, appearing for the petitioner.

The review petitions by the convicts against the 2017 verdict of the Supreme Court have been dismissed by the top court for the heinous crime committed by them seven years ago when the nation had come out on streets demanding exemplary punishment to them.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail here.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

Subramanian and DGP Dilbag Singh.

The team arrived in the Kashmir valley on Thursday where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as military top brass even as the government rejected criticism that it a “guided tour”.

U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster was among the Delhi-based envoys who spent around seven hours in Srinagar. Last October, some members of the European Parliament had visited Srinagar but envoys had so far not been allowed to visit the valley.

The official team led by Chief Secretary and DGP arrived this morning and briefed the team on various aspects of the security situation post abrogation of Article 370 and carving out two UTs, officials said.

It was followed by the meeting with various various delegations including West Pakistan refugees, Valmiki Samaj and representatives of Gujjars and lawyers, they said.

Financial commissioner, Health Atul Dulloo briefed the team about the health facilities created by the government and gave a overview of the sector.

The meeting is presently on with delegations, they said.

The team is scheduled to visit the biggest Kashmiri migrant camp at Jagati on the outskirts of Jammu city late this afternoon and will interact with them.

The envoys flew to Jammu, the winter capital of the newly carved out union territory, last evening. Lt Goveror G C Murmu hosted a dinner and interacted with them.

Earlier, they were flown in a chartered aircraft which landed at the technical airport here. They were taken directly to the army cantonment for a briefing by top military brass, officials said here.

This time there was no hartal call and shops and business establishments were functioning and civilian traffic was seen on the roads unlike the October visit of the delegation of Members of European Parliament, which was organised by a private NGO.

The delegation, accompanied by Secretary (West) of Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup, was briefed by a team of top army officers led by Lt Gen K J S Dhillon, who heads the strategically-located XV corps in Kashmir, they said.

The envoys, who are here as part of the government’s diplomatic outreach to rebut Pakistan’s propaganda on the Kashmir issue, would also be a part of a reception hosted by Lt Governor G.C. Murmu in the evening at Jammu.

Besides the U.S., the delegation includes diplomats from Bangladesh, Vietnam, Norway, Maldives, South Korea, Morocco, and Nigeria. They would return to Delhi on Friday.

Brazil and Uzbekistan’s envoys Andre Aranha Correa do Lago and Farhod Arziev were also scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir. However, they backed out because of their preoccupation here.

Mr. Gandhi’s comments come a day after Mr. Modi met economists, private equity and venture capitalists, business leaders and agri experts at Niti Aayog and called for focussed efforts from all stakeholders to achieve the target of nearly doubling the size of the Indian economy to $5 trillion by 2024.

90,2020/01/10,"SC: review ‘forthwith’ orders curbing basic rights, free movement in J&K","The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the government to “forthwith” review any existing orders that restrict basic rights and free movement in Jammu and Kashmir.

The court upheld the freedoms of free speech, expression and trade or business on the Internet as fundamental rights to be constitutionally protected. It, however, refused to express any views on whether the very access to Internet is a fundamental right or not.

The top court directed the government to review orders suspending Internet services in the erstwhile State instantly. Any order suspending Internet found to violate the law should be revoked at once, it ordered.

It further instructed the government to consider restoring government websites, localised/limited e-banking facilities, hospitals services and other essential services in areas in the Union Territory, where it was otherwise not thinking to do so immediately.

Ripping into the veil of secrecy shrouding the months’ long restrictions imposed across J&K, a three-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana on Friday made it mandatory for the government to publish each and every one of its orders that crippled the fundamental freedoms of over seven million Kashmiri people, including the suspension of the telecom and Internet services in the Valley since August 5 following the abrogation of special status to the erstwhile State under Article 370.

‘Publish orders’

Publication of these orders would now enable affected persons to challenge their legality in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court or before any other appropriate forum.

Justice Ramana, who wrote the verdict, said the court had no intention to delve into the political propriety of what the government did in J&K. “Democratic forces” would be the judge of that. The court said it merely sought to balance citizens' liberty and their security.

Though liberty and security were often portrayed to be at loggerheads, the court said, the government cannot recourse to blanket use of the “power under Section 144 CrPC [for issuing restrictions] as a tool to prevent the legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights”.

Repetitive orders under Section 144 CrPC was an abuse of power, Justice Ramana observed.

Raising the freedom of free speech and expression on the Internet as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the court said the State cannot cite the extensive reach and impact of the Internet as a medium in order to restrict this right.

“Freedom of speech and expression includes the right to disseminate information to as wide a section of the population as is possible,” Justice Ramana said.

Petitioners like Kashmir Times editor Anuradha Bhasin and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had said the government's shutdown of Internet and telecom services had cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world.

Holding trade, occupation or commerce dependent on the Internet as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g), the court said that in a globalised Indian economy, right of trade through Internet fostered consumerism and availability of choice. The past months, according to the petitioners, had seen small businesses which banked on the Internet fail in the Valley, leaving many in dire straits. Even medical care seems to have suffered during the lockdown.

“Suspending Internet services indefinitely is impermissible under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services [Public Emergency or Public Service] Rules, 2017. Suspension could be utilised for temporary duration only,” the court held. A ""complete and broad"" suspension of telecom and Internet services should be resorted to only as a drastic measure in an ""unavoidable"" situation.

The court pointed out that the government was able to continue with the suspension of Internet services because the 2017 Rules did not define word “temporary”. No time-limit was prescribed in the Rules. The court asked the legislature to repair this lacuna. Till then, any order of Internet suspension under the Rules would be reviewed within a week of its issuance.

The court rejected the government's reluctance to produce all its orders restricting free movement and communication. The government had initially claimed privilege only to later hand over a few sample orders to the court.

“The State should take a proactive approach in ensuring that all the relevant orders are placed before the court, unless there is some specific ground of privilege or countervailing public interest to be balanced, which must be specifically claimed by the State on affidavit,” the judgment held.

Restrictions are to be imposed in an emergency. ""The restriction must be proportionate to the concern,"" the court said. The objective of a restriction must be legitimate rather than cavalier.

Authorities must necessarily consider an alternative and least restrictive mechanism before opting to restrict rights. Every decision to impose restriction should be backed by sufficient material and amenable to judicial review.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/91farp/article30531477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/review-suspension-of-internet-in-jk-supreme-court/article30531478.ece

Mr. Tripathy later visited the crime spot here in the afternoon. “Efforts are on to nab the assailants,” he told journalists before leaving to pay his last respects to the slain police officer, whose body was buried with police honours around 3.30 p.m.

Though it was initially stated that the police officer was shot dead by the occupants of a car when he checked the vehicle, CCTV footage collected from the spot showed that the assailants, who came to the Padanthaalumoodu check-post on foot, entered the check-post around 9.25 p.m. and opened fire at Wilson at point-blank range. The officer sustained bullet injuries in the head, chest and the leg and died on the spot.

“It categorically proves that the assailants had intentionally killed the police officer,” an officer privy to the ongoing investigation said.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka police with the help of their Tamil Nadu counterparts, had nabbed a person from Ambasamudram and two others from Tenkasi in connection with a case registered in Bengaluru.

An officer said, “The killing of Wilson is an obvious attempt to send strong signals to the Tamil Nadu Police as few of their accomplices have been nabbed. A police team recently searched the houses of Shameem and Thoufique and grilled their family members to get more information about the duo. So it’s an attempt to threaten the police force,” the police officer suspected.

Meanwhile, a special team from Kanniyakumari district searched the house of S. Al Kabir, 28, at Vazhukkodai in Tirunelveli Town around 4 a.m. on Thursday and questioned his wife Nilofer for a while as Kabir, who is running a car seat stitching unit, was not at home. She told the police that Kabir, who left the home two days ago, had not returned.

“Since Kabir reportedly has links with the trio nabbed by the Karnataka police, we are looking for him,” the police said.

SSI Wilson from Paruththivilai near Marthandam had returned to work only on New Year’s day after a two month medical absence following an accident in October 2019. “Since he was due to retire from service in May, he was posted at the check-post,” sources in the police said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dok8mz/article30529490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09janTVLassaiGV06V87SL3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tn-kerala-hunt-for-suspected-islamic-ultras/article30531069.ece
93,2020/01/10,Nepal expresses concern after India places restriction on palm oil import targeting Malaysia,"Nepal and Indonesia said they were studying India’s decision to restrict import of palm oil products, which understandably is aimed at Malaysia that recently has criticised India’s actions in Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. The diplomatic comments poured in as the Commerce Ministry sources said the restriction of palm oil is not meant for a single country but aimed at the product itself.

“The status of relationship between any two countries is something that they would look before they get into trading. Of course that [political relationship] happens to be a factor,” said official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar indicating that the products were placed in the “restricted category” by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry because of the recent tension between India and Malaysia. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed in recent weeks has repeatedly criticised Indian decisions regarding Kashmir, the CAA and the NRC.

India imports approximately 30% of palm oil, part of the vegetable oil requirement, from Malaysia. Nepal too in recent years has emerged as a major regional refiner and supplier in South Asia.

Adding to the unfolding official policy, a source in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said, “Restrictions can’t be targeted on a single country. It’s a restriction on a product that is being imposed.” This approach of restricting the product itself drew diplomatic reactions from Nepali and Indonesian sources who pointed out that they were “studying the impact” of Wednesday’s notification that restricts palm oil and palmolein imports.

Mr. Kumar also emphasised that the restriction was “product specific” and not “country specific” but the officials were yet to provide the explanation of why a measure meant for Malaysia appeared to affect imports from Nepal and also Indonesia and how the concerns could be addressed. In response, a Nepali official source said they expect India would ensure exemption for their export of palm oil products to India.

“Under the bilateral agreement with India, we enjoy the privilege of exporting goods that receive value addition in Nepali territory and we hope this will be looked into by India while deciding on the status of palm oil,” said the source.

Mr. Kumar pointed out that India-Malaysia ties were “very good” in the past and hinted at the larger diplomatic context of restricting palm oil imports saying, “We have told them that they should keep in mind the sensitivities that we have. Unfortunately, we keep on getting similar sentiments coming out from them and we do hope that at some stage they will realise that this is not the appropriate thing to do.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nepal-expresses-concern-after-india-places-restriction-on-palm-oil-import-targeting-malaysia/article30528412.ece
94,2020/01/10,Meditech companies seek streamlining of customs duties,"While NITI Aayog is now working on a tentative list of medical devices that have the most potential for export, to help the domestic manufacturing industry, with China being the biggest competitor in the field, a group of medical technology (meditech) companies have appealed to the Union Health Ministry to cut the high customs duties on medical devices immediately.

They say that the high customs duty is also having an adverse impact on quality of healthcare accessed by Indian patients here.

“High customs duties have an adverse impact, which contradicts the government’s efforts to provide low cost healthcare available to the masses. This is particularly concerning since more than 70% of the demand for medical devices is being met by global innovators,” said Sanjay Bhutani of Medical Technology Association of India (MTAI), which represents the global medical device and equipment industry in the country.

Lower elsewhere

Advocating the need for tax cuts, the group said that the customs duty regime on most medical devices in the neighbouring countries of Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan was lower than in India, and the differential in duties could lead to the smuggling of low bulk-high value devices.

“The result will not only be the loss of revenue for the government, but also patients will be beset with products that are are not backed with adequate legal and service guarantees,” added the group.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/meditech-companies-seek-streamlining-of-customs-duties/article30528579.ece
95,2020/01/10,U.P. suspends police official after objectionable video,"Days after an objectionable video of Gautam Buddh Nagar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Vaibhav Krishna came to light, the IPS officer has been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government. Mr. Krishna had described the video as “morphed” and a move to “malign” his image. He filed an FIR and called it a move by his rivals to deflect attention from a “secret” report on rampant corruption in postings that he had submitted to the Chief Minister’s Office and the Director-General of Police.

In a simultaneous action, the five IPS officers named in the report have been removed from field postings and an SIT probe has been ordered.

Forensic test

Official sources said the video was sent to the forensic lab in Gujarat and a preliminary report found it to be authentic. The inquiry report also found him guilty of violating the service rules as he leaked the secret report to the media. Mr. Krishna also made news when he allegedly sent police officials to Meerut to detain a senior journalist to know the source of the videos. A departmental inquiry has been ordered against him.

The leaked report detailed an alleged nexus between police officials and journalists to influence transfer postings and cases. The report was published after four journalists were arrested by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police for alleged publication of fake news about police officials.

Among the 14 IPS officers transferred by the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday are Himanshu Kumar, Ajaypal Sharma, Rajiv Narayan Mishra, Sudhir Kumar Singh and Ganesh Saha, whose names were mentioned in the report submitted by Mr. Krishna.

Fighting corruption

An official release said there was zero tolerance against corruption and a three-member SIT had been constituted to investigate the matter and has been asked to submit the report within 15 days.

The allegations of exchange of money for plum postings sullied the “clean” image projected by the Yogi Adityanath government and gave an opportunity to the opposition to take on the government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-suspends-police-official-after-objectionable-video/article30528120.ece
96,2020/01/10,"Nirbhaya case: After Vinay Kumar Sharma, Mukesh Kumar moves curative plea in SC","A second curative petition against the death sentence awarded to the convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case was filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday.

The petition was filed on behalf of death row convict Mukesh Kumar, one of the four men sentenced to death in the case.

Earlier in the day, Vinay Kumar Sharma had filed a curative petition in the apex court.

A curative petition is the last legal remedy available to a convict.

On Tuesday, a Delhi court issued death warrants against Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and said they will be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail.

In his curative plea, Vinay said his young age has been erroneously rejected as a mitigating circumstance.

“The petitioner’s socio-economic circumstances, number of family dependants including ailing parents, good conduct in jail and probability of reformation have not been adequately considered leading to gross miscarriage of justice,” the plea said.

It said the court’s judgment has relied on factors such as “collective conscience of society” and “public opinion” in deciding the sentence to be imposed on him and others.

“The impugned judgment is bad in law as subsequent judgments of apex court have definitely changed the law on death sentence in India allowing several convicts similarly placed as him to have their death sentence commuted to life imprisonment,” the plea said.

It further said that after pronouncement of the apex court’s judgment in 2017 there have been as many as 17 cases involving rape and murder in which various three-judge benches of the top court have commuted the death sentence.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

On July 9, 2018 , the apex court had dismissed the review pleas filed by the other three convicts in the case, saying no grounds have been made out by them for review of the 2017 verdict.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail here.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The top court in its 2017 verdict had upheld the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/wvc5xz/article30509498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/de07saurabhniG366UT1G66jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-after-vinay-kumar-sharma-mukesh-kumar-moves-curative-plea-in-sc/article30528674.ece

Addressing the participants of the dharna, SFI city secretary L.J. Naidu condemned the attack on JNU students, who were demonstrating peacefully for their rights. He demanded stringent action against those who had indulged in the attack.

The Delhi police, security staff of the university remaining silent spectators even as the JNU students were attacked giving rise to the suspicion that they had the backing of the government, he alleged and demanded action against the V-C, who failed to stop the attack.

The police, instead of initiating action against the accused, had booked 22 cases against JNU Students Union president Aishe Ghosh, who was severely injured in the attack. He demanded action on those who were responsible for the attack.

99,2020/01/10,Roundtable bats for three capitals,"The Uttarandhra Adhyayana Vedika on Friday said that the establishment of three capitals – Visakhapatnam (Executive), Amaravati (Legislative) and Kurnool (Judicial) would lead to decentralisation of administration and benefit all sections of society.

At a roundtable organised at Sompeta in the district, the vedika passed a resolution in favour of establishing three capitals, and urged the government to make it a reality.

Former MLA P. Sairaj and former Vice-Chancellor H. Lajapathi Rai observed that Srikakulam district would be the immediate beneficiary with the establishment of the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam.

They said that migration of people from the backward district could be checked if employment opportunities were created in the north Andhra region.

‘Vizag well connected’

“Amaravati may be at equal distance from all the regions. But that should not be the sole criterion for making it a capital. Chennai, Bengaluru, and Bhubaneswar are far off from many places in their respective States. Therefore, making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital will not be a problem as it is well connected,” said Dr. Lajapathi Rai.

Mr. Sairaj said that the north Andhra region was the worst-hit in the last seven decades. It would stand to gain only if Visakhaptanm was made the Executive capital.

Former ZPTC member Nimmana Das, Tekkali Intellectuals’ Forum president G. Venkata Reddy, Samskara Bharati chairman Devaraj, and advocate V.

100,2020/01/10,Drop three capitals plan: Lokesh,"TDP national general secretary N. Lokesh has urged the YSRCP government to not go ahead with its three capitals move in the larger interests of the State.

Taking part in relay hunger strike launched by the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti at the Addanki Bus Stand Centre here on Friday, Mr. Lokesh said that the TDP government had plumped for Amaravati as the capital only after the Assembly adopted a resolution to that effect unanimously and obtaining environment and other clearances from the Union government.

Mr. Lokesh opined that it was not proper on the part of the YSRCP, which had backed the move then, to act as per its whims and fancies, particularly after huge sums had been spent on developing the capital.

People would lose faith in the administration if there was no continuity in policies on larger issues concerning the State, he observed.

People from different walks of life, who included lawyers, doctors, and chartered accounts, joined the relay fast led by JAC chairman and Indian People’s Theatre Association honorary State president Nalluri Venkateswarlu demanding that the government give up its three capitals move.

“We will intensify our agitation to the grass roots if the government remains indifferent to our demand,” he cautioned.

‘An insult to farmers’

The government’s move was an insult to the farmers who had parted with their land, said TDP State president K. Kala Venkata Rao.

It was unfortunate that the government was trying to suppress the protests being staged in a democratic and peaceful manner by using police force, said JAC convener Alla Venkateswara Rao.

102,2020/01/10,Schools and colleges abuzz with Sankranti revelry,"The rich colourful traditions of the harvest festival – Sankranti – were brought alive at schools and colleges as the festival was organised at the respective campuses on Friday.

The traditions like ‘colourful muggulu’, ‘Bhogi mantalu’ (bonfire), ‘Bhogipallu’ and ‘bommala koluvu’ provided a visual treat. Traditions like Gangireddulu (decorated bulls), performing feats to the tunes of their trainer, and ‘Haridasu’, which are fast disappearing in urban areas, caught the fancy of the city folk.

Festive look

The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Public School premises adorned a festive look with ‘muggulu’ and ‘bommala koluvu’. A rangoli contest was conducted in which girl students and their mothers participated to draw colourful patterns on the ground.

The children, dressed in traditional attire, participated in various games organised on the occasion.

Teachers and parents showered their blessings on the tiny tots by pouring ‘Bhogi pallu’ on their heads

The children enjoyed performing ‘Gobbemma Patalu’, ‘Haridasu Keertanalu’, ‘Soddimmalu sodi’, ‘Puliveshalu’ and many more.

The main motto of celebration in the school is to bring the younger generation closer to the Indian culture and tradition and to promote peace, harmony and brotherhood. Principal Shimpy Kumari judged the contestants and presented prizes and certificates to the winners.

Sankranti was celebrated in a traditional day at IIAM B School campus on Friday. The students, faculty and staff members together made the traditional day a very brilliant and colourful event. The Sankranti bonfire (bhogi) was lit by college secretary SP Ravindra and Meenakshi Anantram, founder and CEO of Razzmatazz, followed by the blessings of Haridasulu and a formal gathering also took place.

Ms. Meenakshi Anantram, who participated as a chief guest, appreciated the enthusiasm of the students for their beautiful rangoli arts, mehendi designs and for preparing traditional foods. She also threw light on the importance of celebrating Sankranti and the bonfire, that we shall throw all our negatives into the fire and absorb the warmth of good things to come in future. Mr. Ravindra emphasised on the importance of culture and values for the ‘future managers’ and opined that participation in such events would provide them a proper perspective.

N. Ramanachalam, convenor of the reception committee, told the media here on Friday that the main issues and problems faced by the insurance sector will be highlighted in the conference.

He said that the present policies of the Union government are harmful to all PSUs, especially the LIC and the GIC. He said that the association, which was formed in 1951, had fought for the nationalisation of insurance sector.

At that time the sector was in private hands, subsequently in 1956 the sector was nationalised and the LIC and the GIC had been performing extremely well since then.

However, the government is bringing in foreign capital through the FDI route.

FDI limit

The FDI limit in life insurance segment has been hiked to 51% and in the next session of Parliament a bill is likely to be introduced to hike it further to 74%.

The association opposed the bill, similarly, he said that the government is also toying with the idea of listing the LIC and the GIC by going public through an IPO. The association also opposes the move, he said.

He said the freeze in recruitment should be lifted and class 3 and 4 employees should be recruited in both the PSUs.

The issue of pending wage revision would also be discussed in the conference.

The union also opposes the proposed reforms to labour laws, as they will take away many of the rights of the workers.

K.V. Ramana, former Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University and member of the reception committee, said that the government should not introduce any bill which will harm the interests of the LIC and the GIC. Both PSUs are performing exceedingly well.

105,2020/01/10,Sunil’s next film on corporate colleges,"Film director Sunil Kumar Reddy has always focussed on contemporary issues be it displacement and rehabilitation or migration. Even his trilogy on crime dealt with drugs and how it impacts youth.

His latest film ‘Welcome to Tihar College’ deals with corporate college culture and how students are facing problems in the rat race to become doctors or engineers.

Speaking to The Hindu, Sunil said that the shoot is over and the film is in the post production stage and it is likely to be released during summer holidays.

Speaking about his new project, the director says that the film mainly focusses on the faulty education policy. “What is the use of education if we are not able to produce good doctors and engineers and for that matter good citizens,” he says.

The story goes beyond the evils of corporate college education and talks about the need for good education.

“The film depicts the life of present day youth with a lot of humour and youthful energy, and at the same time deals with their issues and numerous dilemmas that they face,” says Sunil.

Scenic locales

The film also touches upon the stress faced by the students and incidents of suicide due to the rat race.

Extensively shot in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Paderu, the cinematography is handled by Sabu James, who is also editing the film.

For Sunil, this is his 20th project. He has so far done two Malayalam films, one Tamil and 17 Telugu.

Awards galore

He has received five Nandi awards so far, which include best children film for ‘Hero’ and ‘Chance,’ best film for ‘Sonta Vooru’ and best director and best dialogue for ‘Gangaputurlu’.

Since he is a journalist-turned-film maker, Sunil approaches every film with a journalist’s eye and does considerable research before embarking on a project.

Spread in hundreds of acres, the flower that blooms in winter in the Rampachodavarm Agency in East Godavari district, is a major tourist attraction.

Thousands of visitors, mostly nature lovers and photographers, reach the hilltop area by two-wheelers and cabs to spend a night in the reserve forest.

Forest staff are not posted at night, given the risks involved in deploying them in the forest.

Waterfalls

The grassland, about 45 km from Maredumilli town, has another attraction in the form of waterfalls.

In mid-December, this correspondent had accompanied Member Secretary (AP Biodiversity Board) P.V. Chalapathi Rao, during the latter’s visit to the Gudisa grassland and observed groups of tourists making campfires after collecting firewood from the trees.

Many of them had even pitched tents to make their stay comfortable.

“This is not the way to promote the Gudisa grassland. The activities of visitors which include preparation of food in stoves pose a threat to the unique grassland,” Mr. Chalapathi Rao told The Hindu.

A forest staff told The Hindu that a majority of tourists visit the grassland to enjoy the campfire and have a drink or two after an exhilarating bike ride in the forest.

Checkpost on the cards

Another forest staff on condition of anonymity said: “The Forest Department has chalked out plans to set up a checkpost down the hill at Vollangi, banning the night stay apart from charging an exorbitant price to gain entry into the grassland.” However, the plan is yet to take off.

Further, the government schools will be provided with better infrastructure under the ‘Nadu-Nedu’ scheme,” said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.

He also gave away the cheques to the beneficiaries, and school bags provided by Nandi Foundation.

110,2020/01/10,‘Naidu trying to protect land bought through insider trading’,"YSR Congress Party spokesman and Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath on Thursday accused TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu of launching a tirade against the plan of making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital of the State.

“Mr. Naidu is spitting venom against the proposals for decentralised development. His protest at Benz Circle in Vijayawada was a desperate attempt to divert attention of people from growing popularity of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Mr. Amarnath told the media here.

The MLA wondered why Mr. Naidu had so much animosity towards Visakhapatnam and North Andhra region. “The TDP chief was trying to gain political mileage by projecting that all the farmers are up in arms against setting up Executive capital in Visakhapatnam,” he alleged.

The people of North Andhra region never opposed any projects planned for the development of the State. “Mr. Naidu is instigating farmers to protect the land bought by him and his associates by resorting to insider trading before zeroing in on Amaravati as the State capital. He had dumped the reports of Sri Krishna Commission and Sivaramakrishnan Commission with ulterior motives,” Mr. Amarnath said.

The YSRCP leader said the government would launch a probe into the “corrupt deeds committed by Mr. Naidu during his five-year rule”.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/75rn4y/article30527870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VZ3GUDIVADAAMARNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-trying-to-protect-land-bought-through-insider-trading/article30527871.ece
111,2020/01/10,"Left parties slam proposed tie-up of RINL, POSCO","Left parties on Thursday decried a proposal by Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. to give prime land owned by the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant to South Korean steel major POSCO for a joint venture between the two.

Leaders from the Left parties said they would embark on an agitation if the State Government allowed the proposal to materialise.

Talks of a joint venture are already in progress between POSCO and RINL. The Left parties found fault with Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy’s reported statement that the proposal was under the consideration of the Central Government.

The leaders also highlighted a statement made by Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan who during a recent visit to the city reportedly said that VSP had no future if it did not accept the joint venture proposal by POSCO.

At separate press conferences, CPI(M) State Secretariat member Ch. Narsinga Rao and CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said on Thursday that a layout had been prepared with 2,768 acres by the RINL management for allotment to POSCO for setting up a high-grade steel plant to cater to the needs of the automobile industry.

Leaders of CPI and CPI(M) said that though POSCO had dropped its proposal for a 10 million tonne steel plant in Odisha following stiff opposition from people who would be displaced by the project, the Centre was keen that RINL lands be gifted to POSCO for the joint venture proposal.

Stating that as per the detailed project report, 26,000 acres was acquired for VSP to have a total production of 16 million tonnes, they said the Centre should allow the company to expand in phases to its full rated capacity from the present 7.3 million tonne per annum by arranging loans from banks and financial institutions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/left-parties-slam-proposed-tie-up-of-rinl-posco/article30527788.ece

Dharmavaram Deputy Superintendent of Police S. Ramakanth said that the three girls were friends, and two of them were in a relationship with a man named Mahesh, whom they met through Facebook. “However, the two girls did not know that they were in a relationship with the same person,” he said.

A few days ago, the third girl had asked for a loan of ₹20,000 from one of her friends, who asked Mahesh to lend the money. Later, one of the girls realised that Mahesh was also in a relationship with her friend. The three girls then decided to cut off all contact with Mahesh, who reportedly operated several fake accounts on Facebook.

After the girls cut off all contact with Mahesh, he reportedly got angered and began demanding his money back and allegedly sent threatening messages to the girls.

The girls, unable to handle the alleged harassment, purchased sleeping pills. On Wednesday night, the girls left their houses and messaged their families that they would commit suicide. The family members then alerted the police, who launched a search for the girls.

The police during their search went to the Anantapur bus stand, where they found the three girls. When questioned, the girls told the police that they had consumed sleeping pills. Later, the police rushed them to a local private hospital and got them treated.

The girls have since been handed over to their parents. Police also registered a complaint against Mahesh after a complaint from one of the girls and placed him under arrest.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-girls-attempt-to-end-life-saved-by-police/article30527544.ece

“Each and every stone of Hampi speaks of the glory of the Vijayanagar Empire. As a foreign traveller wrote in his travelogue, Vijayanagar was like heaven on earth. Art, architect, music and literature flourished and reached their peak during the Vijayanagar rule. Hampi still stands as a symbol of that glorious tradition. Monuments of Hampi have earned the World Heritage Site tag and they attract a large number of tourists from across the world. We all have to join hands to protect these historical monuments,” Mr. Yediyurappa said, while addressing the large crowd.

Reiterating his government’s commitment to ensuring welfare of the people, the Chief Minister said that the government had effectively taken up relief and rehabilitation of flood victims. He also expressed his desire to initiate pro-farmer initiatives, including offering scientific minimum support prices to farm produces.

120,2020/01/10,‘Changes to Prevention of Corruption Act does not apply to the prosecuted’,"The High Court of Karnataka has held that the amendments made to the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, making it mandatory to take prior sanctions, both to conduct investigation as well as prosecution, of even retired public servants is “prospective” in nature.

The benefit of the amendments, which were notified on July 26, 2018, is not available to retired public servants who were already prosecuted as per the earlier provisions of the Act, which did not prescribe requirement of prior sanction for prosecuting retired public servant as mandatory, the court said in two separate judgments.

The court passed the verdicts while dismissing petitions filed by retired public servants, who were investigated and prosecuted by the CBI, the Lokayukta police or the ACB. The petitioners had filed applications before the respective jurisdictional courts claiming that the amended provisions of Section 17A (prior sanction for investigation) and Section 19 (prior sanction for prosecution) are applicable “retrospectively” and hence the prosecution against them cannot be continued as there was no prior sanction obtained for investigation or their prosecution.

Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar, while dismissing a petition filed by T.N. Bettaswamaiah, retired engineer who was prosecuted for possessing assets disproportionate to his known source of income, said that amended provisions can’t be interpreted as “retrospective.”

“A statute, which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities, shall be construed to be prospective in operation unless otherwise provided either expressly or by necessary implication. A careful reading of Section 17A as also Section 19 do not contain any express provision to show that they are retrospective in nature nor it is discernible by application,” the court said.

Pointing out that apex court had laid down that anti-corruption law has to be interpreted in such a fashion as to strengthen fight against corruption and where two constructions are eminently reasonable, the courts have to accept the one that seeks to eradicate corruption, the court said.

Justice B.A. Patil held that non-applicability of amended provisions to the petitioners would not amount to violation of Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) as they were prosecuted applying the provisions of the PC Act.

Referring to the apex court’s verdicts and the notification has enforced the amendments with effect from July 26, 2018, the xourt said that “it is not open to the court by way of interpretation to give retrospective effect to such provision.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/changes-to-prevention-of-corruption-act-does-not-apply-to-the-prosecuted/article30537232.ece
121,2020/01/10,Govt. claim on child pornography ‘shocking’: HC,"The High Court of Karnataka has termed as “shocking” the State government’s claim that there are ‘no victims of child pornography’ in children’s homes as mentioned in a report by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in September 2018.

The court also wondered how the State government could come to this conclusion without registering a FIR and conducting any investigation even after the Ministry’s report.

The Ministry’s report, on analysis of date of mapping and review exercise of childcare institutions under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, had specifically stated that there are 113 victims of child pornography in State’s children’s homes.

Cautioning that the court may not hesitate to summon the top police officer of the State to seek explanation on the casual approach on serious offences against children, a Division Bench questioned whether the State government could discard the report without inquiry.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by Bachpan Bachao Andolan and a plea initiated suo motu by the High Court based on the apex court direction to monitoring implementation of the Act. The State government claimed that no such offence reported in the report had taken place after the court, during earlier hearing, directed the submitting of status of investigations carried out in the cases of 113 victims of child pornography as indicated in the Ministry’s report.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-claim-on-child-pornography-shocking-hc/article30537229.ece
122,2020/01/10,"Bommai defends police action, asks HDK to submit evidence to investigators","Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday defended the police action in Mangaluru against anti-CAA agitators which left two dead last month. This came in the wake of a press conference held by former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who alleged that violence in the coastal city was acerbated by the police themselves and released a bunch of videos to defend the claim.

“The police also have video evidence that shows the violence was both pre-meditated and orchestrated. They had to resort to firing when the mob tried to break into the police armoury. If they had gained access to the armoury, there would have been more damage,” the Home Minister said.

Mr. Bommai also accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of trying to instigate violence at a time Mangaluru has returned to normality. “As a former Chief Minister, he should act responsibly. There is an inquiry ordered into the incident and if he has any evidence, he must submit it to those leading the probe. Making it public might stir trouble again,” he said.

‘Disclose source’

Meanwhile, BJP State general secretary Shobha Karandlaje launched a counter-attack on Mr. Kumaraswamy, accusing him of releasing a “fake” CD to mislead the ongoing probe into the Mangaluru violence. She urged him to disclose the source of the CD.

Addressing a press conference, Ms. Karandlaje alleged that Mr. Kumaraswamy had demoralised the police force by accusing them of instigating the violence. She also sought to know if the CD was prepared by some “anti-national and pseudo-secular forces”.

“This kind of Kashmir-type attack on the police by masked goons is a new phenomenon in Karnataka. Kumaraswamy should have stood by the police, who do not have any political affiliations.

The administration had denied permission for the event citing opposition from some groups and Minister of Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi to the choice of activist and writer Kalkuli Vittal Heggade as sammelan president.

As many participants reached Sringeri on Friday morning, they witnessed a bandh-like situation in the town. In response to a call given by an organisation called ‘Save Sahitya Parishat’, which opposed Mr. Heggade, many shops and hotels were shut. Around 400 policemen were deployed across the town.

The organisers of the sammelan, who had planned a procession, cancelled it as the police had denied permission. The police had also not allowed the organisers to put up sound system.

Former Minister Kimmane Ratnakar and Sringeri MLA T.D. Raje Gowda objected to the restrictions imposed by the police. Mr. Ratnakar maintained that the programme had been organised on the premises of a private property and there was no need for permission. The sound system was eventually made available. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Ratnakar said he had been an advocate for many years and was be ready to face the consequences if the police filed a case against him.

The police let the audience enter the premises only after checking their pockets and belongings, to avoid any protest during the programme. However, protesters arrived in groups raising slogans against the event. The police took five persons into custody. A few minutes later, another group arrived at the entrance raising slogans.

JD(S) MLC S.L. Boje Gowda, in his speech, took objection to the police restrictions. He called those protesting against the sammelan “anti-nationals”. “We want to conduct the programme peacefully and we should be allowed to do so,” he said. However, intermittent disturbances from the protesters continued till the end of the inaugural ceremony.

Kum. Veerabhadrappa, in his keynote address, criticised Mr. Ravi for his efforts to stop the event. He also took exception to the Minister’s statement referring to Mr. Heggade as a “naxal supporter”. “Whoever speaks in favour of the poor are called naxals. This is a bad trend,” he said. The Sringeri MLA said Mr. Ravi, being Minister in-charge of the district, should have taken responsibility to conduct the event rather than abet disruption, he said.

Kundur Ashok, district president of the sahitya parishat, said literature had the capacity to bring people of all castes, religions and ideologies together. Mr. Heggade, before presenting his prepared speech, said he planned to file a defamation case against Mr. Ravi for making baseless allegations.

The district sammelan has been in the eye of the storm with Mr. Ravi and right-wing groups opposing the choice of Mr. Heggade. Kannada Sahitya Parishat, which gives ₹5 lakh for conducting district sammelans, did not release the amount citing objections from the Minister.

126,2020/01/10,"Do not demoralise police, advises Shettar","Reacting to the video clips purportedly pertaining to the Mangaluru violence released by the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar has said that there should not be any effort to demoralise the police at this critical juncture.

Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi on Friday, Mr. Shettar said that the Home Minister had already said that he would look into the visuals released by the former Chief Minister. So, he would not like to make any comment on the issue without first-hand knowledge of what was seen in the visuals. “I would request the Opposition to not bring in politics into the issue and politicise it,” he said.

On the Mahadayi issue, he said that he would request the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to first have a discussion with Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council S.R. Patil who attended a meeting of elected representatives on the issue in Hubballi.

“Let us not get into politics and I would request Mr. Siddaramaiah too not to politicise the issue. Our objective is to find a solution through concerted efforts,” he said.

Regarding reports about some Ministers being dropped in a likely Cabinet reshuffle, he said that it was left to the discretion of the Chief Minister and that he [B.S. Yediyurappa] would take a decision on it. He, however, said that reports about senior Ministers being dropped from the Cabinet were just rumours and nothing else.

On the demand for reservation for Veerashaiva-Lingayat leaders in the Cabinet as the community members had supported the party in large numbers, he said that he would not like to comment on it as the Chief Minister was supposed to look into any such demand.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/do-not-demoralise-police-advises-shettar/article30535998.ece
127,2020/01/10,‘Set up development authorityfor Basavanabagewadi’,"Demanding that the government set up an authority for the development of Basavanabagewadi, the birthplace of the 12th Century social reformer Basaveshwara, various seers have said that they would meet Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa before the budget to press for their demand.

Informing this at a press conference here on Friday, Siddarama Swamy of Masibnal Mutt said that Basavanabagewadi was included in the Kudalasangama Development Authority for development of areas where Basaveshwara lived.

“The funds being allocated to the Kudalasangama Development Authority is helping more in the development of areas near Kudalasangama in Bagalkot district but very limited amount is being spent in Basavanabagewadi which is the birthplace of Basaveshwara. Thus, we demand the government to de-link the taluk from the Kudalasangama Development Authority and set up an independent authority for Basavanabagewadi,” he said.

The seer said that besides Basavanabagewadi, other villages such as Ingaleshwara, Deginal, and Shivanagi should be developed where other great saints, including Hadpad Appanna, Madiwala Machideva and Noolina Chandayya, were born.

“Even those villages carry great significance as these saints who guided society were born there. These villages could be developed only when we have an independent development authority,” the seer said.

He said that these villages do not have good roads and other basic facilities.

He said that in the first seek of February, the delegation would meet the Chief Minister in support of their demands. Accusing the previous government of not meeting the demand despite several pleas, he hoped that at least this government would consider their demand.

130,2020/01/10,First-year students of Karnataka govt. degree colleges to get free laptops on Sunday,"The State government has decided to give free laptops to over a lakh students of first grade government colleges from Sunday.

131,2020/01/10,Mangaluru firing: HDK releases 35 video clips to challenge police,"Alleging that the violence in Mangaluru during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest last month was triggered by police high-handedness, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Friday demanded that a House Committee be set up to probe the matter. The December 19 violence had left two dead in police firing.

The JD(S) leader released 35 video clips challenging the Mangaluru police’s version of the sequence of events and showing them “harassing” and rounding up bystanders and students not part of the protest. Mr. Kumaraswamy said that the Mangaluru City Police Commissioner, P.S. Harsha, and other senior police officers should be immediately suspended. “They should be held responsible for the violence. I will table all the videos in the Legislative Assembly for discussion,” he said.

‘No provocation’

Mr. Kumaraswamy alleged that police fired without any provocation, even before any law and order problem or the Commissioner’s order. “The police did not lathi-charge those who were shouting slogans, but beat up innocent bystanders. They even beat journalists, despite them showing their ID cards,” he said.

He also pointed to discrepancies in the narratives of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Mr. Harsha on why the police opened fire. “While the Chief Minister claimed that the police station was attacked, the police claimed the protesters were near a shop. The police station has a 360-degree camera. Did the camera not capture the alleged attack?” he asked, demanding the release of this footage.

Terming the police version a “cock and bull story”, he said, “The police now say that protesters held meetings two days prior to the incident and conspired to instigate violence. If they knew about it, why did they not arrest them?”

Chastising the government for withholding the compensation announced for the victims’ kin and also planning to seize properties of the protesters, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, “Your BJP workers protested in Hubballi when Jagadish Shettar was not made Minister. They also set fire to buses. Why did you not think of seizing their properties then?”

‘Edited version’

Mr. Kumarswamy disputed the footage released by the police and said it was only an edited version. “The police video shows an autorickshaw transporting sacks of stones, projecting that the violence was well-planned. But the fact is that that auto was transporting debris from some under-construction building,” he said, releasing a set of video clips related to it.

“Former Supreme Court judge Gopal Gowda was not allowed by the police to hold a Janata Adalat in Mangaluru. A senior journalist, who was part of the Janata Adalat team, was also denied permission to speak to presspersons in a hotel room. Why are you turning Mangaluru into Kashmir?” he asked.

Questioning why violence had erupted only in Mangaluru when protests against CAA were held across the State, he said, “This was clearly a police-sponsored violence. The two deaths were murders by the State government,” he said.

What the clips show

The 26.06-minute video with 35 clips shows students and other bystanders, including journalists, being beaten by the police, purportedly without any provocation.

One of the video clips shows a senior police officer asking his colleague to aim at the protesters’ private parts. There are also clips showing the police beating up street vendors, people waiting for buses, and students. The police are seen forcibly downing the shutters of many shops, firing teargas shells and apparently getting ready to fire even before the Police Commissioner’s order.

Some clips also show stone-pelting by protesters and tyres being burnt. Another clip shows a Muslim youth trying to bring the situation under control.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mvvj48/article30035807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HDK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kumaraswamy-demands-legislature-house-panel-probe-into-mangaluru-violence/article30532660.ece
132,2020/01/10,Writer Bhyrappa accuses Congress of pursuing vote-bank politics over CAA,"Kannada littérateur and Saraswati Samman winner S.L. Bhyrappa has accused the Congress and other Opposition parties of pursuing “vote-bank politics” over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and “misleading” the country on the issue.

Speaking to presspersons at his residence in the city on Friday, Mr. Bhyrappa said the Congress was adopting the “divide and rule policy of the British”, who had created a rift between Hindus and Muslims during the freedom struggle. Mr. Bhyrappa accused former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of following the British policy of dividing the Hindu society on caste basis and consolidating Muslim votes.

“The Congress allowed and encouraged the illegal migration of Muslims from the then East Pakistan into Assam. This did not stop even after the creation of Bangladesh, and even the Left parties which ruled West Bengal for 23 years allowed illegal migration to their State, from where the migrants dispersed to the rest of India,” Mr. Bhyrappa alleged. He claimed that the enactment of CAA had rattled the Congress and Left parties, whom he held responsible for the current stir across the nation. On Muslims being left out of CAA, Mr. Bhyrappa said there were many Muslim-majority countries “where they [Muslim migrants] can go to”.

Describing Mr. Modi as a “strongman who had taught Pakistan a lesson” through surgical strikes, Mr. Bhyrappa said this had won public applause and rattled the Congress, which fears he will win the next elections as well.

On the current protests at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Mr. Bhyrappa said the university has a history of strikes “abetted” by the Left. “There exists a set of students espousing the Left ideology in all universities, and they always indulge in strikes. Students should seek better library facilities, upgrade of laboratory etc. and demand the freedom to question professors in the classrooms, not engage in strikes as the university is being funded using the money of taxpayers,” Mr. Bhyrappa said. His views were endorsed by writer and retired professor Pradhan Gurudutt, who was also present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pgwhj/article30532545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bhyrappa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/writer-bhyrappa-accuses-congress-of-pursuing-vote-bank-politics-on-caa/article30532546.ece

TruJet will introduce a flight connecting Mysuru, Belagavi and Kolhapur, Maharashtra, according to R. Manjunath, director of Mysuru airport.

The flight will depart from Belagavi at 9.35 a.m. and land in Mysuru at 11 a.m. In the return direction, it will depart from Mysuru at 11.20 a.m. and arrive in Belagavi at 12.45 p.m. The same flight will then take off at 1.05 p.m. and reach Kolhapur at 1.35 p.m.

Mr. Manjunath said the flight from Mysuru to Belagavi is under the regional connectivity scheme of the Government of India. Though TruJet will operate from Belagavi to Mysuru and back, the same aircraft will fly to Kolhapur as well and hence the city can claim to have two more destinations covered by air.

134,2020/01/10,Online petition launched in Mysuru over Film City project,"An online petition was launched by stakeholders in the tourism industry here on Thursday following the apparent move to shift the ‘Film City’ project from Mysuru to Bengaluru.

Confusion over the fate of the proposed project in Mysuru has left many stakeholders perturbed, and they are now demanding that the project be retained in Mysuru without creating any further ambiguity.

The stakeholders have urged the government to keep the project here given Mysuru’s potential as a popular destination and its many other strengths. The ‘Film City in Mysuru’ campaign comes after the apparent announcement by Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan that the project would come up on the outskirts of Bengaluru.

Mysuru Travels Association honorary president B.S. Prashanth, who has launched the online petition, said there are plans to take a delegation of stakeholders to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and apprise him of the need for setting up the Film City in Mysuru. “The uncertainty over the project has become a worry for the industry, which was hoping to cash in on the facility for tourism promotion. The government must take a firm stand and start work on the project at the earliest in Mysuru,” he said.

When Siddaramaiah was Chief Minister, he had announced the project and set aside 100 acres of land in Varuna constituency. However, after the coalition government under H.D. Kumaraswamy took over, there were moves to shift the project to Ramanagaram. Eventually, on the insistence of Mr. Siddaramaiah, the project was retained in Mysuru.

With talks to shift the project yet again from Mysuru, the stakeholders are planning to mobilise support from various quarters in the days ahead and ensure that the project takes off in Mysuru itself. The Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association has also opposed the move to shift the project from Mysuru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/online-petition-launched-in-mysuru-over-film-city-project/article30527890.ece

The Principal Civil Judge of Hassan pronounced the judgment on January 4 and ordered issuance of summons to the accused — Ravi Kumar, director of HIMS, Sheela G. Nayak of KVG Medical College at Sullia, M.S. Dhananjaya, K.S. Gangadhar, Rache Gowda (all former directors of HIMS), and Aruna, former director of the Department of Medical Education. Mohan Raj C.V., a resident of Hassan, had filed a petition accusing Dr. Ravi Kumar of creating false records showing his experience as an assistant professor and associate professor at KVG Medical College between 2001 and 2006. He maintained that during that time, Mr. Ravi Kumar was running a clinic in the city.

The court subsequently ordered an investigation by the Hassan police, who filed a B-report suggesting that there was no evidence to file a charge-sheet. The complainant filed a petition contesting the B-report. The court took cognizance of the accused after recording a sworn statement of the complainant. The accused challenged the same before the High Court, which directed the Hassan court to reconsider the B-report of the police.

“Understanding the country does not mean knowing its geography or climate. It is to know its people, their culture, social, economic and other aspects of their life,” he said.

He was speaking at a reading session of the Constitution at the Zilla Panchayat.

The Constitution is like the mother of all laws and rules and regulations in the country. “In a way, understanding the Constitution is like understanding our mother,” he said.

“However, a mere understanding is not enough. We need to adopt it and lead our lives by its principles,” he added.

He spoke at length about events in ancient and medieval history that shaped the Indian nation in modern times. He described the shift from a police State to a welfare State and the evolution of the nation State into a socialist and secular republic.

The Constitution is built on the principles of Buddha’s Dhamma, Gandhi’s Ahimsa, Ambedkar’s and Basaveshwara’s equality. It provides a wide variety of enforceable rights under Fundamental Rights for individuals and guides the policy-making process under the Directive Principles of State Policy, he said. He spoke of the unshakeable character of the basic structure of the Constitution that includes doctrines of separation of powers, federalism, secularism and the promise of equality and freedom.

Principal District and Sessions Judge R.J. Satish Singh urged young people to understand the principles of the Constitution and spread awareness about them among others.

The Minister said farmers in the State should be able to turn agricultural produce into value-added products. “Every farmer must become an entrepreneur. We should be able to convert at least 50% of crops into value-added products,” he added.

140,2020/01/10,Indians start leaving Iraq,"With fears of a war between Iran and the United States looming large in West Asia following the assassination of Iran’s top military commander Qassem Soleimani, many Indians are leaving Iraq, Iran’s neighbouring country which had come under attack from both the U.S. and Iran.

Ashraf Nocholi, a resident of Kannur, returned home on Friday. Anticipating problems, his company sent him back to ensure his safety, he said.

“There are issues between the people and the government in Iraq. However, life is still normal, though news of escalating tension between the U.S. and Iran is being reported,” he said.

About 30 Indians were working with him in a multinational oil company at Basra in Iraq, said Ashraf, an IT engineer for the past six years. All had returned home. Other companies too were sending back foreign employees, he added.

Hopeful

Ashraf said they were hoping that the situation would not worsen and they would be able to return to Iraq. The company had asked them to wait for a few months, but if the situation worsened, it may take more time for them to return to work, he added.

He said their projects were on the verge of completion. However, many were forced to return to their countries without completing them.

If tension escalated between the U.S. and Iran, it might affect Iraq, and more Indians might return. Though the situation was not as bad as was being reported in the media, there was fear, especially after Iran launched ballistic missiles at an airbase in Iraq’s Anbar province and a military facility in Erbil on Wednesday, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/indians-start-leaving-iraq/article30537689.ece
141,2020/01/10,Police on the hunt for SSI’s killers,"The Kerala Police are probing the local links of the two ‘radicalised’ youth wanted in connection with the fatal ‘terror attack’ on Tamil Nadu special sub-inspector (SSI) of police, Wilson, 56, at the Kaliyikavila border check-post here late Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has announced ₹1 crore to be given to the kin of the inspector. They are also aiding the Q-branch of the T.N. Police to secure the custody of the fugitives.

Local investigators, quoting their counterparts in Tamil Nadu, said the youths had no past with the officer they gunned down. A senior officer termed the mafia-style hit-and-run operation under cover of darkness a ‘domestic terror incident.’ The National Investigation Agency had probed the main suspect Abdul Shameem of Thuckalay in connection with the murder of a Hindu religious leader in Chennai in 2014. Shameem’s associate Thoufiq of Ilangkadai in Nagercoil had come under the police scanner for his suspected role in the attempt to murder a BJP leader in Nagercoil in 2016.

Suspected reasons

Investigators said the youths appeared scarred by the experience of being arrested, incarcerated, their homes searched, and relatives questioned. They had possibly sought revenge. The lone unarmed officer in the check-post presented a soft target, offering an opportunity to send a message to the law enforcement. Moreover, the police suspect that the recent arrest of some of their associates was the immediate provocation for the killing. Investigators said the youths had relatives in Thiruvananthapuram and visited them often. The prospect that a gunman could target officers on duty has alarmed State law enforcement.

The intelligence has upped the ante in its fight to thwart home-grown terror plots. The National Investigation Agency has also evinced interest in the case. Security agencies are attempting to retrace the digital trail of the suspects on the Internet to determine what provoked their actions and whether they owed allegiance to some online radical group.

142,2020/01/10,Child dies of suspected H1N1 in Kozhikode,"In a suspected case of H1NI influenza, a two-year-old child died at the Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH) functioning on the campus of Government Medical College, Kozhikode, on Friday.

However, the cause of death has not been confirmed yet. The throat swabs of the victim — Kenzabivi — of Irnigal , near Payyoli, in the district have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, and Manipal Institute of Virology for confirmation, IMCH deputy superintendent K. Mohandas Nair said.

Four members of the family of the victim were also undergoing treatment for similar symptoms such as mild fever. The nasal swab and nasopharynx samples have also been sent for tests.

Earlier, seven students of Anayamkunnu Government Higher Secondary School at Mukkom were diagnosed with H1N1. This was after 163 students and 13 teachers of the school had developed fever and their blood samples were sent for examination. Most of them had high fever, cough, and throat pain. The Manipal Institute of Virology confirmed the cases.

Meanwhile, the Health Department has said that there is no cause for panic as steps are being taken to curtail the spread of the disease. Facilities for diagnosis have been stepped up at the Anayamkunnu Government Higher Secondary School and Karassery Primary Health Centre, V. Jayasree, District Medical Officer, said.

Control room

She said that a control room attached to the Mukkom Community Health Centre had collected the data of all the students and teachers. Parents and teachers have been advised that those having fever should get treatment at the Karassery Primary Helath Centre and Mukkom Community Heath Centre. People can also get advice from the call centre at Mukkom (0495 2297260).

As part of precautionary measures, squads have been formed for each of the 18 wards of the local body to visit households and distribute pamphlets about H1N1, Dr. Jayasree said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/child-dies-of-suspected-h1n1-in-kozhikode/article30537653.ece
143,2020/01/10,Uphill task awaits authorities on Nediyathuruthu island,"A humongous task awaits the State government on Nediyathuruthu island in Vembanad Lake where it will have to pull down the illegally constructed cottages of Kapico Kerala Resorts Private Limited as ordered by the court.

A Rapid Environmental Impact Assessment Report on the demolition of the resort, prepared by Environmental Engineers and Consultants Ltd., New Delhi, earlier for the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, Kerala, had flagged the the possibility of the hazardous materials, including lead and asbestos, reaching the waters during demolition.

The 54 cottages were built over a period of seven years from 2006. The Hindu had extensively reported on the violations of Coastal Regulation Zone rules in the construction of the resort and the legal battle fought in various courts and other agencies, including the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority.

According to the rapid study, the ecology of the lake could be seriously affected if vessels carrying the hazardous and toxic waste capsize. During the demolition of the nearly 2,500 RCC (rubble-cement-concrete) subsurface piles, other sub-surface structures, and retaining walls, the lake waters will surge from all sides and it may hit the island hard, it said.

Hazardous waste

The possibility of inert and hazardous waste falling into the lake during the demolition and transportation was a major challenge.

The demolition of subsurface structures would involve major environmental and ecological aspects, especially regarding the restoration of the island’s soil and the protection of the environment/ecology of the lake.

The air quality of the region could be hit by the emission of fugitive dust.

The turbidity level of the lake waters would increase exponentially if the demolition debris and other sediments reached the lake, it was warned.

The report has cautioned against demolishing the superstructure alone and abandoning the subsurface structures as the land would get submerged over a period, exposing the RCC pillars and other subsurface structures.

The submerged RCC pillars, which is part of the National Waterways, can cause major water transport accidents, it said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ard8lm/article30537648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-KAPICOrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uphill-task-awaits-authorities-on-nediyathuruthu-island/article30537649.ece

147,2020/01/10,₹1 lakh crore investments expected: CM,"The two-day Global Investors Meet ASCEND 2020 Kerala has elicited investor assurances worth approximately ₹1 lakh crore for 138 projects, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

Of this, ₹66,900 crore is for logistics parks from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, while Kerala Infrastructure Fund Management Limited (KIFML) would invest ₹8,110 crore for six projects. Investors have committed another ₹32,008 crore. These total ₹98,708 crore.

Another ₹2,000 crore investment is expected from entrepreneurs who did not attend the meet. Principal Secretary (Industries and NoRKA) K. Ellangovan would meet those among them who were willing to invest, he said, while making key announcements at the valedictory of the meet.

Hitherto, Kerala was not in the forefront of attracting investments. The government's plan was to make it one among the top five investor-friendly States. The investor meet helped to better identify concerns of entrepreneurs who were keen to set foot in the State. It was with this in mind that relevant rules and laws were being amended. Moreover, the government had taken serious note of the negative attitude of a few officials towards investors. All this had enhanced investor trust in the State.

From now on, investors could directly approach the government for anything ranging from the village office to the Chief Minister's Office. There was no need of middlemen.

The government has taken serious note of the need to hone the skills of youth, to make them employable for emerging sectors. For this, reform of syllabus and other course material has been taken up with universities. Kerala needed to regain the top position that it enjoyed, be it export of fishes or coconut and coir production.

On their part, investors must ensure that they adhere to relevant rules regarding construction of structures and environmental norms.

Referring to mega infra projects, Mr. Vijayan said that emphasis should be laid on the ₹66,405 crore Silverline rail corridor that would link Thiruvananthapuram with Kasaragod, widening of highways and commissioning of the Kovalam-Kasaragod waterway.

148,2020/01/10,Milma venturing into veggie cultivation,"Think Milma, think milk. Nothing new in that. Soon, you will also be able to add pesticide-free veggies to the list. And possibly, in the near future, even honey and eggs!

The Thiruvananthapuram regional union of Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) is foraying into the cultivation of pesticide-free vegetables. Christened ‘Haritha Milma’, the initiative will enable consumers buy safe and clean vegetables along with milk from Milma outlets.

Farmer collective

For cultivating the vegetables, Milma aims to create farmer collectives under its dairy cooperatives in Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Kollam and Alappuzha, the four districts which fall under its jurisdiction, Kallada Ramesh, chairman, Milma Thiruvananthapuram regional union, said.

Milma will supply the farmers with technical expertise and high-quality seeds sourced from the ICAR-Indian Institute of Horticulture Research. A collective of not less than ten farmers can grow vegetables on own land or land taken on lease.

11 villages

In the first stage, Milma plans to launch the vegetable cultivation project in 11 villages this month.

The vegetables will be sold via existing Milma outlets and special ‘Haritha Milma’ shops.

Diversification aside, the initiative is also aimed at enhancing the income of dairy farmers and ensuring their financial security.

Moreover, Milma also hopes to play a leading role in the maintenance of public health by ensuring adequate availability of good quality vegetables, Mr. Ramesh said.

The Thiruvananthapuram union was also exploring the possibility of venturing into apiculture and layer poultry farming, Mr. Ramesh said.

In fact, the Thiruvananthapuram union planned to diversify even further and market more agricultural and non-agricultural products soon, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/milma-venturing-into-veggie-cultivation/article30536088.ece
149,2020/01/10,Muthoot stir: HC calls for conciliatory talks,"The Kerala High Court on Friday ordered the Labour Commissioner to hold a conciliation meeting in Kochi to thrash out the difference between the striking employees of Muthoot Finance Ltd. and its management.

Justice A. Muhamed Musthaque also directed the police to provide protection to the employees of various branches of the company who are willing to work. The court appointed High Court lawyer Liji J. Vadakkedam as observer at the meeting.

The court said the present dispute arose in the context of a decision taken by the management to close down 44 branches in different part of the State. As a result of the closure of the branches, 164 employees had been terminated from service. The case of the Managing Director (MD) was that with help of the CITU and others, obstruction was being caused to the employees who were willing to attend duties.

The Judge observed that the court could not ignore the cause raised by the employees. The petitioner was one of the largest companies in financial business. They were having 3,000 branches all over the contry and more than 2,500 were working in the State. The company shall not turn a Nelson's eye to the employees working under them.

A congenial atmosphere should be created in the company where the employees could ventilate their grievances. If the petitioner was compelled to close the branches because they were financially unviable, it was open for the management to find out an alternative to accommodate such employees.

Anyway, it was only possible when there was a platform to thrash out the differences. In such circumstances, it was appropriate that the Labour Commissioner initiated a conciliation, the court said.

The court passed the order on a petition filed by George Alexander, Managing Director of the company, seeking police protection for the employees willing to work in as many as 568 branches of the company.

Government Pleader P.P. Thajudeen submitted that though the Labour Commissioner had called conciliation meeting twice, the MD had refused to attend the meeting. The police were providing adequate protection as ordered by the court to ensure law and order.

When the petition came up, the MD had agreed to appear before the Labour Commissioner at the meeting. Besides, it was agreed before the court that the authorised representatives of the company as well as the Non-Banking and Private Finance Employees Association and CITU would appear before the Labour Commissioner.

The court directed the branch managers of the company to give details of the employees who were willing to attend the duties to the police station concerned for providing police protection to the employees. The police were also directed to ensure that no untoward incident occurred and employees who were willing to attend duties were not prevented from doing so.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/muthoot-stir-hc-calls-for-conciliatory-talks/article30535992.ece

Though the Supreme Court had formed a nine-judge Bench for hearing the case on January 13, it has not elicited the response of the board and also not issued any notice so far.

Hence, there is no compelling circumstance for the board to take a stance on the issue at present.

151,2020/01/10,Maradu demolition: How the saga unfolded over 13 years,"The Maradu demolition saga began 13 years ago when the Maradu panchayat issued show cause notices to five builders including H2O Holy Faith, Alfa Serene, Golden Kayaloram and Jain Coral Cove for violating the Coastal Regulation Zone norms, Floor Area Ration and other building rules. One builder chose not to construct the apartment after the notice.

The builders moved the Kerala High Court challenging the stay order. The single Judge allowed the writ petition filed by the builders.

The local body then went in appeal to the Division Bench. The Division Bench dismissed the appeal filed by the municipality stating that the builders could not be take to task.

The Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority approached the Division Bench with the review petition.

The Division Bench rejected the review petition filed by the Authority.

Later, the Authority moved a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court against the Kerala High Court order.

On May 8, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the apartments for violating the provisions of the CRZ. The review petitions filed by the residents were also rejected by the apex court.

The Supreme Court order came as a rude shock to the residents. Several political parties and organisations rallied behind the residents and staged protest marches. The Supreme Court refused to entertain another batch of review petitions filed by the residents and ordered the State government to execute the order.

The Kerala government dilly-dallied on the implementation of the court order, which invited the wrath of the apex court. The court directed that the buildings shall be pulled down by before September 20. It also directed the Chief Secretary to appear before it.

The Chief Secretary tendered unconditional apology and submitted the timeline for the demolition.

On September 24, 2019, the Maradu municipality issued notices to the residents of these apartments to move out of their homes.

The State government also appointed Snehil Kumar Singh, the Fort Kochi RDO, as the special officer for implementing the demolition works.

Later the flat dwellers were asked to vacate their homes. The administration snapped the power supply lines to the buildings after the residents refused to move out. As the pressure increased, the residents began the eviction and the buildings were taken into custody by the Maradu municipal authorities.

Edifice Engineering, Mumbai, and Vijay Steel, Chennai, were picked up for demolishing the Maradu apartments.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ordered ₹25 lakh compensation for all the apartment owners as interim compensation and appointed a committee led by a former judge of the Kerala High Court to oversee the disbursement of the compensation. The court also ordered that the bank accounts of the builders shall be frozen.

The Crime Branch of the Kerala police booked cases against the builders and arrested the directors of the company. Later, the directors were released on bail.

The Maradu municipality has fixed January 11 and 12 as the dates for pulling down the apartments.

Meanwhile, residents in the neighbourhood of the flats, especially Alfa Serene, raised an alarm over cracks developed in their houses as pre-demolition works gained momentum. This prompted the district administration to insure nearby houses for damages suffered from the demolition work.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/67el0z/article30531970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARADUTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maradu-demolition-how-the-saga-unfolded-over-13-years/article30531971.ece

The court made it clear that candidates from the PSC rank list only should be engaged on daily wages as conductors and drivers.

Minister for Women and Child Development K.K. Shylaja, in a statement here on Thursday, said the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development had recognised Sarana Balyam as a novel project and selected it for the innovation grant.

154,2020/01/10,"All issues involving Shane resolved, says Mohanlal","The issues between actor Shane Nigam and the Kerala Film Producers’ Association have been resolved, said Mohanlal, noted actor and president of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA), here on Thursday.

Shane will complete the dubbing of the movie Ullasam, he said, after an executive meeting of AMMA here. The producers’ association had earlier said that it would not cooperate with Shane unless he completed the dubbing of Ullasam.

Shane had informed the executive committee of AMMA that he would abide by its decision to resolve the differences between him and the producers that began in October last year. The actor had alleged that he had received death threats from Joby George, producer of his movie Veyil, for changing his hairstyle for the movie Qurbani.

The controversy escalated in November when the producers banned him after he stirred up a controversy by shaving off his hair and beard, thus disrupting the shooting of Veyil.

Earlier on Thursday, the Kerala Film Producers Association alleged that Shane was making false statements on his agreed salary for Ullasam. The association had asked the actor to complete the dubbing for Ullasam before January 6. However, he refused to turn up stating that the producer had paid only a share of his salary.

“As per the agreement signed two years ago, Shane was given a salary of ₹25 lakh for Ullasam. He is now asking for ₹45 lakh claiming that his salary has gone up. This cannot be accepted,” said B. Rakesh, treasurer of the producers association here on Thursday.

However, M. Renjith, president of the Film Producers Association, said any talks on resolving the issue can resume only after Shane completed the dubbing for Ullasam. “We had already conveyed our position to AMMA,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/all-issues-involving-shane-resolved-says-mohanlal/article30527709.ece
155,2020/01/10,HC asks Collector to take over church soon,"The Kerala High Court on Thursday expressed strong displeasure over the non-implementation of its order directing the Ernakulam District Collector to take over the Kothamangalam Marthoman Cheriyapally, its precincts and all movable properties.

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar ordered the State government to give effect to the directive immediately. The court said if the order was not implemented before January 23, the next date of hearing, he would order the Collector to appear in person before the court.

The court passed the order when a contempt of court petition filed by Fr. Thomas Paul Ramban against the Collector came up for hearing. The court had also ordered that if the Collector was satisfied, after the takeover, that the situation was conducive for the petitioner, who is the vicar of the church (who owes allegiance to the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and its constitution), to conduct religious ceremonies, the church, its premises and movable property shall be handed over to the petitioner.

Shortage of force

In an affidavit, Collector S. Suhas submitted that the delay in implementing the order was due to shortage of police force. In fact, there were 1,800 families under the church. Of these, only 20 families belonged to the Orthodox faction and the rest were from the Patriarch/Jacobite faction.

The Jacobites were collectively opposing the move to hand over the church to the petitioner. The administration had requested the District Police Chief to provide enough police force for implementing the court order.

Immolation bid feared

However, the District Police Chief replied that he could not spare more police force as a large number of the personnel were on duty at Sabarimala and some busy controlling protest marches against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Besides, some personnel were deployed at Puthuvypeen where an agitation against an IOC plant was on. If there was not enough police force, there was every possibility of the Patriarch faction causing obstruction to the implementation of the order. Moreover, there were chances of immolation attempts on the church premises.

The Revenue Divisional Officer, appointed as receiver, was also on duty at Sabarimala. The Collector said he was committed to implementing the order according to the scheme being chalked out by the district administration, taking into account the law and order situation in the area.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-asks-collector-totake-over-church-soon/article30527660.ece

The business community has to be insulated from the ordeal of shuttling from one government office to the other, said V.K. Mathews, founder and executive chairman of th IBS Group.

Vice Chairman of the State Planning Board V.K. Ramachandran said the government was committed to sustainable investment that generated sound income and employment.

CMD of LuLu Group International M.A. Yusuffali said Kerala must market its immense potential, rather than exaggerate issues such as the spread of Nipah virus, which affected its exports of vegetables and fruits.

“Setting up big industries is tough, due to high population density. But strengths like IT and tourism must be optimally tapped,” he said.

Founder of ESAF Group K. Paul Thomas, who is also Chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Kerala State Council, said Keralites had commendable integrity.

158,2020/01/10,There is nip in the air in Munnar but...,"Munnar is witnessing a delayed winter with the temperature starting to dip after more than a week compared to the normal of below zero degree Celsius experienced in the first week of January.

The change in the seasonal cycle is most evident in Munnar as the four seasons are clearly distinguishable there.

According to tourism stakeholders, tourists who came to Munnar expecting the normal cyclical change in season were upset at missing the sub-zero temperature and frost. However, hoteliers are expecting sub-zero temperature in a week’s time.

An official of a hotel group in Munnar said as the monsoon was delayed it was normal that winter too was delayed. “Usually, the temperature starts to fall by December and may hit a low in the first week of January,” he said.

The lowest temperature recorded on Friday at Chenduvarai was 4°C, Nallathanny 5°C, and Sevenmalai 5°C. No incidence of frost had been reported from Munnar so far.

The temperature in Munnar had dipped to -3°C on January 6, 2019 at Chenduvarai, Chittuvarai, and Lakkad.

However, in 2018, frost was reported at the end of January and Chenduvarai, Lakshmi, and Nallathanni experienced -2°C on December 28, 2017.

“Usually the temperature drops to below zero degree Celsius during the first week of January. However, Munnar is experiencing moderate temperature of around 10°C from the beginning of January,” said an official of the Munnar Hotels and Restaurants Association.

He said the clear sky was providing a panoramic view, making the season attractive to tourists.

Subject of study

Jijo Jayaraj, who had studied environmental changes in Munnar as part of a research project, said there was a notable difference in day and night temperatures in Munnar. This change was more evident now.

“However, a change in the cyclical season was experienced in the past too as the lowest temperature was experienced during the end of the calender year than the beginning of it,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/isk6t7/article30527555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvmuunar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/there-is-nip-in-the-air-in-munnar-but/article30527553.ece
159,2020/01/10,Alex Lehmann’s 'Blue Jay': A tale of deflected soulmates,"A man bumps into a woman. They go for a coffee. They walk around a cold and quiet town. Nobody else seems to exist there but them. Almost as if every street, pond and house were designed solely for the two to absent-mindedly walk past. A store owner gives them free beer. They get tipsy. They roleplay as a middle-aged married couple. They giggle. They listen to old tapes. They dance. They feel.

But this isn’t Before Sunrise. It’s after the sunset. Somewhere between dusk and twilight, it’s a flash of the dawn that could have been. They are not the divine-sounding, destiny-dating Jesse and Celine. They are Jim and Amanda – modest, earthly names. They aren’t pretty strangers in Vienna. They are something rarer in the chance-meeting universe: Former high-school sweethearts. Ex-lovers reunited by the familiarity of their small Californian hometown. The town that had once christened them “the famous lovebirds”.

Working through memories

Alex Lehmann’s Blue Jay (2016) is about the aftermath of deflected soulmates. It’s about old flames lost in a young memory and old memories fanning the flames of fate. His mother’s death brings him back from the wilderness; her sister’s pregnancy brings her back from civilization. Jim (Mark Duplass) has a scraggly beard, the kind that makes him look like the popular college jock who evolved into a man-childish drifter. He fills his nervous silences with mawkish grins. Jim is the sort of mediocre loner who would grow into someone like Ray Romano’s Andy from Alex Lehmann’s next, Paddleton (2019) – a socially lumbersome and overbearing chap whose best and only friend is his dying neighbour (Duplass). Amanda (Sarah Paulson) has a perpetual, almost creepy smile plastered onto her face, evoking the rooted denial of a star cheerleader who overcompensated for their failed relationship by marrying a rich divorcee 30 years older than them. She wears the mask of stability, but tries hard not to sound like a domestic stereotype whose step-children are only slightly younger than her.

Everyone thought they would end up together. Yet here they are, familiar strangers at the crossroads of time, meeting as though they were on a first date and simultaneously revisioning their lost history in the hope of pinpointing the moment their future ended. Here they are, former heartthrobs slowly wondering why they are the subject of a movie named after a local coffee shop selling bad coffee rather than of lofty love stories called Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, La La Land or even High School Musical.

When the moment comes, the man collapses in tears and clutches her knees, apologetic for his bitter words but also performatively venting as if he were dead sure that his manner of meltdown might inspire famous actors like Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson to recreate this moment in a high-profile divorce story. She recoils like she seems to know that the monochromatic frames of their movie is the closest they will come to being the timeless lovers of Cold War. Once the reason for their breakup is revealed, Jim and Amanda react like tragics who deserved a chance to star in their own Blue Valentine. When the moment comes, the two explode like characters who missed a shot at their own flawed narrative.

Thin red line

The thing about an Alex Lehmann film is that it uses the rhythm of awkward nothingness to lull the viewer into a false sense of satisfaction. The actors make us cringe at their stark everydayness. You expect Jim and Amanda to turn closure into a physical expression. You are conditioned to expect the chemistry, the kiss, but not the fallout of falling back in. The buildup is indie – black-and-white images, nostalgic chats, the lovely melancholy of the scene in which they listen to tapes of their teenage selves pretending to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary – but the emotional crescendo is very much mainstream. In the end, Lehmann turns the obvious into an epiphany. When they enact the anniversary scene “just for fun,” you sense how much they miss the boy and the girl who dreamed of a happy ending. You understand that residual feelings are more of a privilege than a bane, if only to locate the thin red line between “what if” and “what for”.

On another day, Jim might have walked out of the supermarket without being spotted by his ex only to paint his mid-life crisis as a portrait of urban isolation. On another night, Amanda might have slept with her ex and left him a resolutionary letter. But Amanda hasn’t cried in years – perhaps she is looking for someone who can drive her to tears. And Jim hasn’t laughed in ages. Together, they reclaim the cinema of serendipity and turn fate into an act of faith.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q18572/article30536825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BM-PG4-Film-column,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/alex-lehmanns-blue-jay-a-tale-of-deflected-soulmates/article30536826.ece
160,2020/01/10,Controversial scenes to be removed from Rajinikanth’s ‘Darbar’,"Lyca Productions, the makers of Rajinikanth’s latest film Darbar directed by AR Murugadoss, has announced that they will be removing controversial dialogues in the film, which were deemed to reference VK Sasikala, the jailed former AIADMK general secretary.

Darbar, which released on January 9, has two scenes where characters speak of prison inmates being allowed to go out and shop. The dialogues are not mouthed by Rajinikanth in either scene, though the actor is present in the shot.

Following the film’s release, Sasikala’s advocate, N Raja Senthoor Pandian, took objection to the comment about “shopping”, and threatened to sue the producers, Rajinikanth, Murugadoss, and fisheries Minister D Jayakumar (for his later remarks with reference to the particular scene), if the said scene was not removed. Senthoor Pandian made his statement in a phone conversation aired on Jaya Plus channel.

On Friday, Lyca Production released a statement on Twitter that read: “In our Darbar film, particular words and dialogues having references to prisoners or inmates going out of jail or prison during their imprisonment term was only included with an intention of providing an entertainment to the audience and is not intended to refer to any specific individual or to offend anyone.”

“However, since some of those particular words seemed to have hurt some people, we have hereby decided to remove the same from the film,” the statement adds.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5920xv/article30535271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPRajinikanth-Darbar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/controversial-scenes-to-be-removed-from-rajinikanths-darbar/article30535272.ece
161,2020/01/10,'Half Widow' does not fall into the Bollywood trap of the formula Kashmir film,"Set in 1999, a few years into the violence and the heavy militarisation of the Valley, Danish Renzu’s Half Widow is the story of Neela, a young, newly-wed Kashmiri woman whose husband, Khalid, is picked up from their home one night during dinner by men dressed in Indian army uniforms.

Films about Kashmir are not new but a film made by a Kashmiri filmmaker, shot entirely in Kashmir, with an entirely Kashmiri cast and in the Urdu-Kashmiri language, sets it apart. Romance, tragedy, melodrama — it has it all and yet, it does not proclaim love on a dancing shikara as in Kashmir ki Kali or splatter blood all over the snow as in Haider; it does not give terror a heavy soundtrack as in Mission Kashmir. It even stands apart from the very authentic Laila Majnu, because it doesn’t fall into the trap of the formulaic ‘Bollywoodisation’ of Kashmir. Half Widow, which had a limited theatre release in India on January 6, joins the league of independent films such as Musa Syed’s Valley of Saints, Aamir Bashir’s Harud, and Aijaz Khan’s Hamid — where Kashmiri actors portray Kashmiri protagonists.

The first image in Half Widow is of a Kashmiri woman sitting by a desk, penning the story of her life. It is a part-musical, as the bard Noor Mohammad is present at every stage of her life, narrating the goings-on through songs much like the writer herself. In the past few years, we’ve seen many strong Kashmiri women in the public space, but on screen, the Kashmiri woman with a voice and a story to tell remains an exception. Here, the Kashmiri woman rejects the media and decides to be the narrator of her story.

Human beings

A still from Valley of Saints.

The Srinagar and Kashmir that exist in the film’s universe are the Srinagar and Kashmir that exist in my memory as well. Renzu takes us into the hearts and homes of Kashmiris through this film. We walk the restless streets with Neela. And Neela is not an idealised Kashmiri beauty — she is a human being first. She is played by Neelofar Hamid, who started her career with local television and is known for Valley of Saints, and has emerged as an exceptional performer.

It would have been easy to fall into the trap of victimhood, but Neela rises and takes steps to reclaim her freedom in her own way. She goes to police stations, prints flyers and joins the weekly protests. When she loses her brother Zakir (Shahnawaz Bhat) to the same forces, she first decides to drown herself, then prays, then steals into the jail in the middle of the night to find her brother. She also gets jealous of the woman in Zakir’s life.

At first, it is strange that the only two women in the house (Neela and Zakir’s wife Zynab) don’t speak a word to each other for most part of the film; but when they do get talking, it is a turning point in both their lives and they speak of being family for each other.

Lost Kashmiriyat

A still from Hamid.

Bhat, who plays Zakir shines in his vulnerability. Known for playing Rafiq in Aamir Bashir’s Harud (2009), he plays a Kashmiri boy again but this time, he transforms from a helpless boy into a pillar of strength. Bhat has matured tremendously as an actor.

Mir Sarwar, who plays Neela’s husband Khalid, portrays a papier-mache artist and embodies a quiet patience. The chemistry between Khalid and Neela is a defining moment in the film. The feelings are expressed without words. The romance plays out across the landscape and seasons of the Valley, quietly, as if they are trying to hide their happiness from the world. The beauty of this film is that even though it is shot through Renzu’s eyes, the words and poetry are by Sunayana Kachroo, a Kashmiri Pandit poet.

Renzu and Kachroo’s friendship — leading to this collaboration — is a testament to the lost Kashmiriyat. The Kashmiri songs, the poems, the Lal Ded verses used in the narration, beloved by Kashmiris who grew up listening to them, add an element of Sufism, which is reflective of the Kashmiri storytelling tradition. The film does more than show the tragic lives of the Valley’s half-widows. It shows a way for them to reclaim their lives and forge new destinies.

162,2020/01/10,Bong Joon-ho to create limited series on ‘Parasite’ for HBO,"South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho is in negotiations with HBO for a limited series based on Parasite, which has emerged as one of the most talked-about movies of the year.

The film is also an award season darling since winning the Palme d’Or in Cannes last May. It won the best foreign language Golden Globe and is expected to earn multiple nominations at the Oscars besides picking up trophies from critics bodies, including the top honour from the National Society of Film Critics.

A series on the movie was hotly pursued by top streamers, including Netflix but Bong decided to go with HBO as it has a strong track record in limited series, according to Deadline.

Succession executive producer Adam McKay and Bong will adapt the movie for a TV series.

Directed by Bong and written by Bong and Han Jin Won, Parasite stars Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun and Chang Hyae Jin.

The film tells the story of two families from different sides of the class divide where members of a poor family scheme and manage to get to work in a wealthy household.

Parasite, which critics have found hard to slot into a genre, has become a global phenomenon, grossing USD 130M worldwide so far.

It is Bong’s seventh feature film following on from Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), Memories of Murder (2003), The Host (2006), Mother (2009), Snowpiercer (2013), and Okja (2017).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jj757z/article30534453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2020FILMINDEPENDENTSPIRITAWARDSNOMINEEBRUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bong-joon-ho-to-create-limited-series-on-parasite-for-hbo/article30534454.ece
163,2020/01/10,Mohinder Amarnath’s advice to Saqib Saleem for ‘83’: ‘Stay calm and focus on the game’,"Saqib Saleem has shared the piece of advice offered to him by former cricketer Mohinder Amarnath before he started shooting for 83. In the Kabir Khan directorial, Saqib Saleem plays the all-rounder, who was also known as Jimmy.

Talking about Mohinder Amarnath’s advice, the actor shared: “The most valuable piece of advice which Jimmy sir gave me is to be calm and focus on the game. There was something in the way he said which has stayed with me.”

He added: “I’ll make sure that I inculcate his advice in my day to day life.”

Saqib also revealed that he is usually hyper by nature but has become calmer as a person after essaying Amarnath’s character.

“A character that you play does something to you personally and when I was playing Jimmy, it made me calmer as a human being. Because that is how Jimmy sir is. If I had to get him right, I had to get that Zen-like attitude. The calm resilience to play him, that was the difficult part, because I am usually very hyper. So, I had to start meditation just to calm myself down,” he shared.

The actor then recalled his experience of meeting the all-rounder of Kapil Dev’s 1983 world cup winning team while prepping for the film.

He said: “I had heard stories about Jimmy Sir from my father. It was a dream come true for me to play such a legend and live his iconic moments on the big screen. He would come and spend some time with all of us. We had gone to Dharamshala in the beginning for a 10-day workshop. Over there I got to train with him and spent a lot of time together. It was amazing to meet him!”

Directed by Kabir Khan, 83 stars Ranveer Singh in the role of Kapil Dev while Saqib Saleem, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Harrdy Sandhu, Ammy Virk, Jiiva, Sahil Khattar, Chirag Patil, Adinath Kothare and others constitute the rest of the cricketers in his World Cup winning team.

165,2020/01/10,'Chhapaak' not screened in Aligarh as Hindutva outfit puts up posters,"After a Hindutva organisation put up posters on hoardings in front of theatres, Deepika Padukone-starrer Chhapaak was not screened in theatres across Aligarh on Friday.

The posters in big font with ‘chetavani’ (caution) written on top said that those who would try to screen the movie should get their “insurance” done. “Na dekhunga, na dekhnedunga [won’t watch, won’t allow anybody to watch],” it declared.

The poster further criticised Ms. Padukone for showing concern for only one side affected by violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University on January 5.

With the names and photos of Pankaj Pandit and Deepak Sharma of Akhand Bharat Hindu Sena printed at the bottom, the poster said Ms. Padukone had thrown acid on the face of nationalism.

Anil Samania, Circle Officer III, Aligarh, told reporters that security had been provided to the theatres. “But theatre owners have decided against screening the film. If they decide to screen, we will provide security,” he said.

Aligarh has four prominent theatres and at least two, Meenakshi and Great Value Mall, had displayed posters of the film. However, according to local sources, they were replaced with Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, the other big release of the week.

Samajwadi Party members protested against the move. Ranjeet Chaudhary, district president, Chhatra Sabha, the student wing of the party, said: “The film is about an acid attack victim. On one hand, this government talks of beti bachao, beti padhao, but when Deepika Padukone went to show solidarity with student leader Aishe Ghosh who was beaten up during violence at JNU, she is being targeted,” he said.

In Muzaffarnagar, Bajrang Dal members disrupted the screening of the film at Carnival Cinemas in the heart of the city. Local sources said the members of the right-wing organisation tore the posters of the film and raised slogans against Ms Padukone.

166,2020/01/10,"‘St. Louis Superman’, an Oscar-shortlisted documentary by two Indian-Americans","Smriti Mundhra and Sami Khan are Indian-American filmmaker friends who have often exchanged ideas and shared common experiences, including making films in India. Mundhra co-directed the documentary A Suitable Girl (2017) and Khan made the narrative feature Khoya (2015). And they often discussed collaborating on a film. That opportunity came when Mundhra was approached by Al Jazeera’s producer Poh Si Teng to make a 30-minute documentary.

Mundhra was already contemplating working on a film based on the life and work of African-American activist-turned-politician Bruce Franks Jr. And she asked Khan to come on board as a co-director. Their film St. Louis Superman recently made it into the Oscar shortlist for best documentary (short subject).

In 2016, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement across the U.S., Franks, 34, a Democrat, was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives where most of his colleagues were white Republicans.

His city — St. Louis — had the highest murder rate in the country. The Black Lives Matter movement, and also the killing of his nine-year-old brother, motivated Franks to get a bill passed unanimously on youth violence as a public health epidemic. He suffered depression and anxiety over the course of his term and resigned after three years.

St. Louis Superman is an intimate portrayal of a charismatic man, a father and rap artist who worked tirelessly for his community. Los Angeles-based Mundhra and Khan, who lives in New York, spoke over the phone about the making of this remarkable film. Edited excerpts:

How do two people, in this case, friends, direct a film together? Did you argue a lot?

Mundhra: We’ve had a few arguments, but I have wanted to work with Sami for a while now because I have always respected his artistic sensibility and his integrity as a storyteller. Co-directing is a very natural instinct for a documentary. Documentaries are a dialogue between the subject and the filmmaker, the editor and the cinematographer.

It lends itself much more to collaboration. Sami and I knew our roles at any given time. Sami shot most of the film and he had a very close relationship with Bruce. He lived with Bruce while we were shooting. In such collaborations, you can have a sort of yin and yang balance between two filmmakers, where one could have closer access to the subject while the other is observing from a distance.

Khan: You work with someone because you want to learn from that person. You don’t want to collaborate with someone who has skills similar to yours. Smriti found Bruce’s story and had a vision for the film. During the shoot, if I was capturing a moment, Smriti was thinking of the bigger picture.

Sami, how did you end up staying with Bruce?

Khan: In films such as this, you need an intimacy that can’t be faked or forced. I’ve found that the way to build a bond with the subjects in documentaries is to live with them. We were telling Bruce’s story with him. It’s not a story we are telling about him. So we were immersed in his life to get the daily rhythms.

Still from ‘St. Louis Superman’

Bruce’s use of rap to convey his thoughts is fascinating. How did you capture that?

Mundhra: That’s a huge part of his life. So many moments in the film came about from the intimacy we developed with Bruce. We orchestrated none of the magical moments in the film, be it his conversation with his son in the opening scene or the rap battle. We couldn’t have scripted it better in terms of what he says and what he is up against. You can’t get those moments on camera without being there all the time and yet not being intrusive. Sami is gifted at that. Bruce says we felt like family, making home videos.

Bruce is charismatic, yet by the end it is revealed that the pressures of the job and of carrying the emotional burden of the black community lead him to depression. How did he change and evolve?

Khan: He’s such an empathetic person. But in the course of making the film and beyond, we saw him understand that he also needed to take care of himself. He can’t be there just for other people, even though he has the incredible ability to inspire. As filmmakers, it was important for us to show him balance it out.

We didn’t want to lie to the audience and show a feel-good story about an African-American politician who magically connects across races. We wanted to show the dark side too. The personal trauma that Bruce has been through takes a toll on him. The tensions, the hope and the darkness are something we worked hard to show and we talked to Bruce to get it right.

What did he expect from the film?

Mundhra: I don’t think he knew quite what to expect. A year ago, on Christmas Eve, he texted saying he needed to see the film, that he needed some context for his life and purpose. We sent him a link. He got back saying he was sobbing from the first minute. He loved it. He didn’t ask for any changes.

It’s not like we hid our intentions while shooting. It was a very collaborative process. The first thing we asked him when we started was this: ‘If you had 30 minutes to tell people your story, what would you want to say?’ And that was our touchstone as we made the film and figured out the story and the arc.

He told us that until he watched the film, he hadn’t realised the sum total of who he was and the work he was doing.

Still from ‘St. Louis Superman’

You are both Indian-Americans with privileged backgrounds, education and upbringing. With this film, you threw yourselves into a very working class, African-American world. Did you know this world before?

Khan: My father is a physician, my mom is a housewife, but both came from very modest backgrounds. I grew up in a working class, blue-collar town in Canada and I can easily code switch. You have different parts to your life. Your friends are from working class backgrounds. You are a certain way with your Indian aunties and uncles. And when you study at a place like Columbia University, you learn to behave in a certain way.

Mundhra: I come from an upper-middle-class background. (Her late father Jagmohan Mundra was a filmmaker.) Sami and I can’t pretend we have first-hand experience with the problems Bruce and a lot of people in his community deal with. We could have crafted the narrative from our perspective, which would have made a lot of us and white people feel good about the world. But we wanted to use our privilege, access and skills to amplify a story that deserved to be narrated. Our approach to filmmaking comes from a place of humility, a desire to learn about other communities and check preconceived notions.

167,2020/01/10,Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland in ‘Don’t Look Now’: Intimacy in grief,"It’s one of the most famous sex scenes in a mainstream film of its time, graphic enough to raise the possibility of an X-rating, realistic enough to spark whispers that the participants — two A-grade actors — might really have “done it”. In Nicolas Roeg’s eerie 1973 masterwork Don’t Look Now, Laura (Julie Christie) and John (Donald Sutherland) are in Venice, a few months after the tragic death of their little daughter. Their relationship has been frayed by grief, but now it looks like things may be coming back together. As they loll in bed, she tells him he has toothpaste on his mouth; she wipes it off, they move into tentative foreplay.

Then, in a montage lasting four minutes, they make love. But it isn’t a glamorous, vaseline-on-lens scene — it feels gritty, lived in. Christie and Sutherland are attractive people, but the bodies we see are imperfect. (“Those lumps are coming back on the side of your waist,” she had told him in the bathroom earlier.) As they writhe in awkward positions, sucking on each other’s fingers and toes, their movements suggest both familiarity (they have been married many years) and trepidation (they are doing this after a long time, and the very act must carry a reminder of pain; this is how the now-dead daughter was conceived). But the sense of renewal, and the hunger on display, are unquestionably erotic.

Though I first watched the film long ago, I only recently read the Daphne Du Maurier short story it was (very faithfully) adapted from. It’s a fine, suspenseful tale of grief and the supernatural, but look how fleeting the equivalent passage is: Now, he thought afterwards, now at last is the moment to make love, and he went back into the bedroom, and she understood, and opened her arms and smiled. Such blessed relief after all those weeks of restraint.

Different mediums

While the point made is the same — two people picking up the pieces, rekindling intimacy — the effect is very different. On the face of it the screen version is more elaborate (and explicit) than the page version. But it’s equally true that what is clearly spelt out in those sentences — John’s yearning — has to be conjectured in the film through the traces of wary hopefulness in Sutherland’s eyes, and the subtle ways in which Christie responds.

Those who deem literature innately superior to cinema often cite the former’s advantages over the latter: when reading a book, it is so often said, you can exercise your imagination (or “direct” your own story) in a way that a movie won’t allow. There are some obvious rejoinders to this idea, one being that the printed text, no matter how evocative, can’t show you a great actor giving a great performance, or a skilled cinematographer or editor using light and time, respectively, to heighten a narrative’s emotional effect. R.K. Narayan may tell us, in elegant prose, about Rosie’s mesmerising snake dance, but he can’t convey everything that Waheeda Rehman’s performance or S.D. Burman’s music can. Which is simply a way of saying: these are two very different mediums, and direct comparisons are silly.

Visual cues

Don’t Look Now does many notable things with its visual scheme. Take its vivid use of red as a marker (the daughter was wearing a bright red raincoat when she drowned), with the viewer’s eye always drawn straight to the colour. I was reminded of this while watching Anurag Kashyap’s short film in the new anthology Ghost Stories. Such cinematic choices have no equivalent on paper — unless you count a graphic novel such as Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s The Killing Joke, which does something similar.

But returning to the sex scene, there is also the way in which it is rapidly cut with shots of Laura and John getting ready for dinner (something that happens after they have made love). This toying with chronology isn’t gimmickry for its own sake; it is thematically relevant to the central mystery of the film — which is encapsulated in a key image (a shot of Laura on a boat) that we see twice, at two separate points in time. The love scene is essential not just to our understanding of the characters and their emotions, but also as a suggestion of how the past, present and future are forever informing each other.

168,2020/01/10,This Malayalam mockumentary short film takes a satiric look at the status of economy,"Perhaps, there’s no shortcut to success. But there may be one to getting rich — win a lottery. Short film Naaleyaanu Naaleyaanu Naale, written and directed by Hari Mohan M, is a satiric take on unemployment and economic hiccups in the country narrated in the form of a mockumentary.

The short, released on YouTube recently, follows an unnamed 28-year-old “graduate” who purchases a lottery ticket on his way to meeting his three friends, all unemployed, and zooms in on their candid conversations as they discuss how their lives will turn around if only they won the raffle.

The lottery taker is hopeful of winning one soon as he’s now riding the luck of “shukra disha” and hence expects a favourable “astronomical surgical strike.” Even as one thinks it’s an “optimistic” idea to try one’s luck, another is more discouraging, pointing out it’s a waste of money. However, after much wishful thinking, they all go back to their ordinary, carefree lives at the end of the day.

Despite the gravity of the matter they discuss, the naive youth are only largely concerned about fulfilling their rather unrealistic dreams and fantasies. For instance, frustrated at not having a proper “pitch” to play cricket, one says he will build a stadium when they win a lottery. In line with the docu-comedy format, we have “experts” chipping in with their take on the matter. So there is a Professor of Economics from “WhatsApp University” who equates competitive exams with taking lottery as “both are dependent on luck”. The social satire element perhaps finds the best expression in the line “Probably, the only thing that can save the country now is the finance minister winning a lottery.”

Hari says he chose the mockumentary format to address the themes as he felt the framework fits within a shoestring budget. “Also, I like the format and it’s a suitable medium to convey humour. Even elements of absurdism can be incorporated as they would work as satire. There’s also the novelty factor since there aren’t many mockumentary short films in Malayalam,” says Hari, who worked as assistant cinematographer in Lal Jose-directed 41 and upcoming King Fish. Ajai Thampy, Arjun Krishna, Achuth Giri, Akash Raveendran, Aadith Hari and Shyam Raveendran are among the cast in the short.

The doctor-turned-aspiring-filmmaker was inspired to come up with the meta-narrative script after discovering that a cousin of his was in the habit of buying lottery tickets. “This person was unemployed for a couple of years after doing engineering. Later, I learnt that he was trying his luck. That was news to me as I was under the impression it was mostly the elderly who had the habit. This gave me the idea,” he says.

169,2020/01/10,‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’ movie review: Between fervour and fatigue,"There is a condition called period drama/historical fatigue and I must admit that I am suffering a wee bit from it. Little then to get excited about yet another Hindi film that aims to make Indians proud of who we are by taking us back to the past, right to the end of the 17th century, when we used to be the “sone ki chidiya”, till “baahari taaqat” (the foreign invaders) came and split us apart. “Hum apni hi dharti par gunehgaar ho gaye (We turned guilty in our own motherland),” says a voiceover at the start of the film. However, the fictionalised account (there are disclaimers aplenty) of the life of Tanaji Malusare, one of Maratha emperor Shivaji's bravest generals, has a comic-book, swashbuckler touch that manages to work; partially if not entirely.

It’s 1670. Tanhaji (Ajay Devgn) is busy preparing for the wedding of his son Rayba when he has to leave it all aside to go on a mission for Shivaji (Sharad Kelkar) to recapture Kondhana fort for the Marathas from the Mughals. It’s part of Aurangzeb’s plan to use the strategic fort as the base for Mughal expansion into South India and the fort is in control of his Rajput officer Udaybhan Rathod (Saif Ali Khan).

Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior Director: Om Raut

Starring: Ajay Devgn, Kajol, Saif Ali Khan, Sharad Kelkar

Storyline: Fictionalised account of the life of Tanaji Malusare, Shivaji’s military leader, who recaptured the Kondhana fort for the Marathas from the Mughals

Run time: 131 minutes

Things kick off well what with the flying entry of Devgn. Soon it all becomes about one battle set piece after another or song-and-dance extravaganzas, all enhanced by 3D and played to booming, militaristic soundtrack, the particularly rousing Ghamand Kar. There is much play on the bhagwa (ochre/saffron) colour, some scheming dissenters within the Maratha army, human chess games between Aurangzeb and Shah of Iran but the dreaded Islamophobia is contained, though not entirely done away with.

A certain ennui begins to set in, in the middle, despite the grand scale and execution. However, things do come to a head effectively again in the climactic sequence. The scaling of the steep hill fort of Kondhana, Tanhaji’s kinetic combat with Udaybhan and that last strike at victory. It does work itself to some kind of collective catharsis and adrenaline rush.

The hero and villain sit on convenient extremes. Devgn is suitably efficient as the one who can’t do anything wrong. But Udaybhan (Saif) gets interpreted a la Alauddin Khilji, perhaps just because of his association with Aurangzeb. Saif Ali Khan plays the manic, unhinged character who’d chop off an elephant’s trunk without so much as blinking and eats crocodile meat. There’s a hint of backstory about class politics coming in the way of his love for a girl called Kamal (Neha Sharma) now widow in his captivity. It may have given a good context to his villainy, but the thread is left hanging. Sharad Kelkar makes for a handsome and dignified Shivaji, as we have known him through our dives into history books as well as the Amar Chitra Kathas. And the women — Shivaji’s mother Rajmata Jijabai (Padmavati Rao) and Tanhaji’s wife Savitri (Kajol) — expectedly, have almost no role to play other than being the keeper of the male conscience.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ybef3d/article30532488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tanhaji-trailertalk-trs,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tanhaji-the-unsung-warrior-movie-review-between-fervour-and-fatigue/article30532489.ece
170,2020/01/10,Congress leader seeks tax-free status for ‘Chhapaak’ in Maharashtra,"Congress leader Sanjay Dutt on Friday appealed to the MaharashtraVikas Aghadi (MVA) government to declare Bollywood film ‘Chhapaak’, based on the real life story of an acid attack survivor, tax-free in the State.

The Deepika Padukone-starrer film, directed by Meghna Gulzar, hit the theatres on Friday.

Mr. Dutt, an AICC secretary, said the film inspires and conveys a positive message to change the society’s outlook against such survivors and highlights their agony, struggle and triumph against all odds.

Given the film’s positive message and content, the MVA government should provide it tax-free status in the State, the former MLC said.

The Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on Thursday declared the film tax-free in the two States.

If a movie is declared tax-free it means that the State has waived the entertainment levy imposed on it, thereby bring down the ticket rates and encouraging more people to watch it.

Ms. Padukone visited the JNU campus in Delhi on Tuesday to express solidarity with students who were attacked by armed assailants on Sunday night, but did not address the gathering.

After her JNU visit, many appreciated her “silent solidarity” with students, but some others criticised her for “supporting Leftists”, saying it was a promotional stunt ahead of her film’s release.

A section of BJP leaders also criticised the 34-year- old actress over her JNU visit.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/p00qf2/article30526268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chhapaak02,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/congress-leader-seeks-tax-free-status-for-chhapaak-in-maharashtra/article30531721.ece

The girl has entered the India Book of Records as the youngest to perform Silambam. She demonstrated her skills before a select audience and the performance showcased the flexibility of her body and the skills she had developed in just one-and-a-half years.

Dheveesha has been a keen observer of the martial art, practised by the trainees right in front of her.

Close observation

Mr. Rao says she learnt the art form quickly as she watched the trainees closely for months. “In a few months of training, I was able to identify her skills, and groomed her,” he said.

Mr. Rao said he is a 7th-generation trainer. The OMS School of Silambam in Sathuvachari, Vellore, plays a vital role in kindling trainees’ innate skills, and it has expandedover the years. The students’ victory lies on their own performances and dedication, said Mr. Rao. The institution takes pride in its students’ successes, he added. Currently, about 80 students are being trained at the institution.

Mr. Rao has plans to ready his students for the Guinness Book of Records, and of course, Dheveesha will be among them.

To a question by N. Ram, Chairman, The Hindu Group of Publications, on the fraternity shared by the two actors at a recent event, Mr. Haasan said he would try to convince his friend Mr. Rajinikanth.

“He is proudly a Tamilian now... I want him to invest in Tamil Nadu. That’s what I’ll try to convince him [to do]. He is of that mindset,” he said at a conversation organised on Thursday by Algebra - The Arts and Ideas Club.

Mr. Haasan said he almost stepped into politics when he made Hey Ram. He said the signs he saw at that time about the country reaching the political situation it is in today prompted him to make that movie.

“Today, making that film will be difficult,” he said. On how the country went to the present phase of divisive politics, he said democracy was not infallible and constant vigil was needed to keep it healthy.

Dravidian politics

On the domination of Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Haasan said it emerged as it was the need of the hour. “But it later became ‘their’ [certain parties’] need,” he said. Stating that Dravidian politics is the mainstay of Tamil Nadu and there was no need to change that, he, however, said there was a need to take it in the right direction.

Sudheendra Kulkarni, socio-political activist, who was formerly with BJP, spoke on the need to overthrow the present BJP regime, in a separate conversation with Mr. Ram during the event.

He said the present dispensation led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah was very different from the one led by the late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

‘Sinister attempt’

He said there was a sinister attempt now to consolidate the Hindu vote bank and make India a Hindu Rashtra in the long run.

Mr. Kulkarni said there was a move to mould the BJP on the vision of V.D. Savarkar, which was different from that of M.S. Golwalkar and Deendayal Upadhyaya.

He said there was a need to make a section of the legacy of BJP and RSS as an ally in the fight against the present extremist version of Hindutva. “There is a need to engage the Hindus who voted for Mr. Modi. The [political] left must also change its strategy in engaging them,” he said.

‘Some good things’

He said that even in these ‘dark times’ there were some very good things happening as part of the opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“I strongly urge the minorities not to believe in rumours spread with a political motive. Minorities need not have even an iota of fear or doubt,” Mr. Palaniswami said, referring to the debates in the House on the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The AIADMK governments under former Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa and the one under him had been bastions of the minorities, he said. “I would like to assert that this government, in the paths taken by the two leaders, will continue to be bastion for the minorities,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

Although the AIADMK government got several awards in appreciation of its governance, Opposition parties undermined them stating that the government’s days were numbered, he said.

‘Obstructionist tactics’

The Chief Minister took a dig at the Opposition for obstructing the government by going to court and staging protests in the event of natural disaster, drinking water scarcity, local body polls, among others. “They are not cooperating in development activities or any constructive work,” Mr. Palaniswami said. His party would throw out, with people’s support, those obstructing the party and its government.

Mr. Palaniswami’s assurance to the minorities came during his reply to the debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the House, on the last day of the Assembly session on Thursday.

All the four days of the Assembly session witnessed debates on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In his reply, the Chief Minister underlined the achievements of his government much of what had been highlighted in the Governor’s address to the House on Monday last.

183,2020/01/10,"‘Ministers, bureaucrats were peeved over idol theft probe’","A few Ministers, bureaucrats, police officers and officials of the Hindu Religous and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department were peeved over the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe idol theft cases in the State and there were many attempts to derail the investigations, A. G. Ponn Manickavel, retired Inspector General of Police and former Special Officer of Idol Wing-CID, has told the Madras High Court.

In a counter affidavit filed before Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan, who were seized of a case accusing him of having misled the court, he recalled that it was the High Court in July 2017 which had ordered that all pending idol theft-related cases in the State as well as those to be booked in future be investigated by a SIT led by him when he was serving as the Inspector General of Police, Idol Wing-CID.

Even after his retirement on November 30, 2018, the court appointed him as a Special Officer for a period of one year to continue the investigation.

Since he was not allowed to perform effectively post retirement, he filed a contempt of court petition against former Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan, former Home Secretary Niranjan Mardi, former Director-General of Police T.K. Rajendran and incumbent ADGP Abhay Kumar Singh.

Pointing out that the contempt petition was still pending in the High Court, the former IGP said the present public interest litigation petition filed against him by S. Sekaran, who claimed to be a “press reporter,” was nothing but gross abuse of the process of the court.

“The PIL petitioner is liable to be prosecuted and punished for gross criminal contempt... The petition has been filed to help high profile accused and not in public interest.

“I submit that a few Ministers, HR&CE officials, bureaucrats, police officials and others are peeved by the formation of a SIT to inquire into idol theft cases. There have been many attempts to derail the investigation by the SIT,” the counter affidavit filed through his counsel V. Selvaraj read.

In his affidavit, the PIL petitioner accused Mr. Manickavel of having submitted false data regarding his track record to get himself appointed as Special Officer.

While Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneeselvam moved the resolution, DMK deputy leader Duraimurugan made a request for continuing the reservation for Ango-Indian community. At present, one member of the Anglo-Indian community is nominated to the Legislative Assembly though the member cannot vote in the House.

Mr. Panneerselvam said many political parties, including the BSP, the SP, the BJP, the DMK and the AIADMK had pressed for continuation of the nomination of Ango-Indians (in Parliament and some Assemblies) and met Law Minister Ravi Sankar Prasad and made a request for this. “He agreed to consider the request,”he said.

Treasurer of TPCC Gudur Narayana Reddy said here on Friday that ruling TRS was indulging in unethical practices to weaken the Opposition parties. Alleging that Chief Minister and TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao had brought disrepute to Telangana by violating and insulting the Constitution repeatedly during the last six years, he said TRS had legitimised the culture of horse-trading in electoral politics.

In the his first term, Mr. Chandrashekhar had forced defection of 25 MLAs, MLCs and MPs of the Opposition parties, particularly those of the Congress. In the second term, he had engineered defection of 12 MLAs to deprive the Congress party of the status of main Opposition party, Mr. Narayana Reddy alleged.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-of-luring-party-candidates-congress/article30537810.ece
186,2020/01/10,"Plastic ban likely to increase pressure on forests, TS official","A senior official of Telangana government on Friday said ban on use of plastics may put undue pressure on forests.

Suggesting a balanced approach, Special Chief Secretary to the Environment, Forests, Science and Technology Department Rajeshwar Tiwari underscored the need for reduction in consumption of plastics.

A complete ban may put undue pressure on forests, he said, addressing a conference on recycling and sustainability of packaging materials organised here by Hyderabad chapter of the Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP).

Seeking to highlight how plastics were not a problem as much as their disposal, he said while 60% of the plastics get recycled, the balance posed a threat. Thus, reduction in use of plastics was important.

The government is open to discussions and suggestions, he said, urging packaging industry to work with the government on the issue.

A committee of officials has been constituted by Telangana government to study and submit a report on effectiveness of a ban on single use of plastic in various States and the alternatives. It has been asked to suggest measures to promote production of alternatives to plastics and industrial incentives for the manufacturers.

According to a release on the conference, Aurobindo Pharma Director Madan Mohan Reddy, who was the special guest, said government has an important role in educating and creating awareness of the issue as in spite of a hue and cry people continued to use plastic bags.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/q9map7/article30538003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11BAMBOOPRODUCTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/plastic-ban-likely-to-increase-pressure-on-forests-ts-official/article30537278.ece
187,2020/01/10,"‘Friend’ kills woman, surrenders","A ‘friend’ turned out to be the killer of a 24-year-old woman when he slit her throat with a knife after inviting her to his room for a conversation in Hanamkonda on Friday.

The body of M. Harathi, who bled to death, was found lying on the floor of a rented room of the alleged killer Md. Shahid in Chaitanyapuri of Kazipet. “After slitting her throat, Shahid went to Warangal central prison to surrender himself but was sent to Subedari police station,” Warangal Police Commissioner V. Ravinder said.

Shahid was taken into custody and being interrogated to ascertain the motive behind the gory killing. “Shahid claimed that he was in love with the woman for the past six months but got agitated on learning that she was seeing another person,” the Commissioner told The Hindu.

The accused knew the victim since intermediate days. Even the victim’s family members knew him and treated him as family friend. “Shahid used to visit Harathi’s home now and then but her family members never suspected his intentions,” the Commissioner said based on preliminary inquiries.

The victim’s family members said Harathi and Shahid were classmates while pursuing degree programme. While Harathi completed MBA, Shahid was preparing for competitive examinations.

On Friday, he asked Harathi to meet him at his rented house in Ramnagar. “She left home around 2:30 pm saying she is going to meet a friend,” the victim’s mother said. The unsuspecting woman went to his room trusting him only to be killed in his hands, the mother said.

“It is still unbelievable that he killed my daughter. He is known to our family for several years and is a trusted friend of my daughter,” Harathi’s father Pratap said. Having married off his elder daughter, Mr. Pratap was looking for alliances for Harathi.

188,2020/01/10,Uttam demands special Assembly session on CAA,"Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda Member of Parliament N. Uttam Kumar Reddy demanded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao clarify as to why he was hesitating to announce that he would not implement Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register in Telangana and convene a special session of the Assembly to discuss the issue.

Participating in a live interaction with Congress party workers on a social media platform on Friday, Mr. Reddy said Congress party had been demanding a special session of the Assembly to pass a resolution rejecting CAA and NRC but there was no response from the government. When the chief ministers of several States including Kerala, Odisha, Bihar, Punjab and West Bengal could announce that they would not support the new legislations, he sought to know why Mr. Rao was not making his stand clear.

In the same breathe, Mr. Reddy wanted AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi to explain Mr. Rao's silence on CAA and NRC. He sought to know why MIM was maintaining silence on the issue knowing well that Mr. Rao’s Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had been supporting the BJP-led government at the Centre in many of its decisions.

Turning to municipal elections, the TPCC president alleged that the TRS government was neglecting municipalities, corporations and the defeat of the ruling party in the urban local bodies’ elections could perhaps wake Mr. Rao from his slumber of municipalities neglect.

Stating that the TRS government did not develop a single municipality or corporation during the last six years, the Congress leaders said even the existing roads were damaged in the name of Mission Bhagiratha and other programmes.

Neither Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao nor his son and Municipal Administration Minister K. Tarakarama Rao paid any attention on providing basic civic amenities in the ULBs across the State, the TPCC chief said.

Nearly 40% of the State's population was living in municipal areas but they were deprived of proper drinking water, better roads, quality electricity supply and others.

The TPCC president said the forthcoming municipal elections were the best opportunity to teach TRS a fitting lesson for its failures.

189,2020/01/10,Hyderabad turns into a sea of Tricolour,"The cry against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, National Register of Citizens, and National Population Register grew shriller with tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of the city, and demanding that the legislations be repealed.

Protesters rallied around the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen-backed United Muslim Action Committee’s call for a Tiranga Rally and converged at the Eidgah Miralam. All streets leading to National Highway – 44, the route of the rally, were chock-a-block with thousands of Tricolour.

Soon after Friday prayers, protesters began to march towards Shastripuram and raised slogans in support of democracy, justice and equality. Slogans against the Bharatiya Janata Party, Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were also raised. Three large Tricolours engulfed the thoroughfare, one ordered by residents of Bahadurpura, a whopping 160 ft in length.

Thousands of protesters reached Shastripuram, against the backdrop of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi’s house where a public meeting was organised. Mr Owaisi was surrounded by a phalanx of religious leaders, politicians and social activists which included Sandhya from Progressive Organisation of Women, Hamid Mohammed Khan and Maulana Jafar Pasha.

Speaking at the public meeting, Mr Owaisi opposed the CAA, NRC and NPR. Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that the people of Hyderabad and Telangana showed him that they reject the three stipulations.

Addressing the public, he said, “Do you oppose the CAA? Do you oppose the NRC? Do you oppose the NPR? Do you want to keep India secular? Do you want to protect Ambedkar’s and India’s Constitution?” The crowd responded with a resounding ‘yes’.

“We yet again demand that the Centre repeals the CAA, stop NPR work, and NRC work never be taken up,” he added.

Mr Owaisi also waded into the cordon and search controversy in which police were reportedly seeking Aadhaar cards from residents. He said, “If people from the government or police come to your neighbourhoods, and ask you for Aadhaar cards, will you show them or won’t you? Will you show your kaaghaz (documents). You shouldn’t. You should say, I am an Indian citizen. We hope that the government and police do not indulge in this behaviour.”

The process of synchronisation of the solar power plant with the grid was completed on Friday afternoon. It’s the first phase of the 10 MW solar plant planned on the thermal project campus as part of the company plans to complete the 220 MW solar power plants in its areas by August-end this year.

Singareni has become the first coal company in the country to diversify its operations and foray into both thermal and solar power generation. “It’s another milestone reached by the 130-year-old coal company,” Chairman and Managing Director of the Company Sridhar said.

He added that the company had planned to establish a total of 300 MW solar power plants in 5 areas of the company last year and construction of the first phase of plants was nearing completion. They had plans to make 220 MW solar power available to the power utilities in the State by August-end.

The power plant on the thermal power project premises was connected to the grid with the help of a 33 KV transmission line. The remaining 5 MW of the solar power plant on the thermal project premises would be completed and synchronised with the grid by February-end. Construction of the solar power plants of SCCL was given to BHEL and Adani Group companies.

The company officials said the 2×600 MW thermal power project was already catering to the 20% energy needs of Telangana from thermal projects. Establishing another 800 MW unit was also in the process of execution.

192,2020/01/10,Sabitha Indra Reddy among seven to get summons from CBI court,"The CBI special court here on Friday issued summons to seven persons, including Telangana Cabinet Minister for School Education P. Sabitha Indra Reddy, to appear before it on January 17 in the quid pro quo cases involving Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy and Penna Cements.

The CBI court principal special judge B.V. Madhusudan Rao passed an order to issue to summons to them, after taking cognizance of the supplementary charge-sheet filed by CBI authorities in Penna Cements case. Along with Ms. Sabitha Indra Reddy, YSRCP MLA from AP Dharmana Prasada Rao, IAS officer Y. Srilakshmi, retired IAS officers Samuel and V.D. Rajagopal, Anantapur District Revenue Officer Sudarshan Reddy and Tahsildar M. Yellamma were shown as accused in the second charge-sheet.

While Mr. Prasada Rao was Revenue Minister, Ms. Sabitha Indra Reddy was Minister for Mines and Geology in the Cabinet of Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy’s father late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. The supplementary charge-sheet was filed in year 2016. However, the accused had challenged its validity. Arguments had been going on whether the special court can take cognizance of the supplementary charge-sheet.

‘Official favours’

On Friday, the CBI court special judge took cognizance of it and instructed that summons be served to the seven accused for appearance before it on January 17. The CBI had accused Mr. Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy of doing favours to Penna Cements owner P. Prathap Reddy like land allotment and leasing of limestone mines during his father’s tenure as united AP’s Chief Minister.

As part of the quid pro quo, Mr. Prathap Reddy invested ₹ 68 crore in some companies Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy had floated, the CBI said in the charge-sheet. The accused challenged the supplementary charge-sheet stating it had no fresh content or evidence compared to the first one filed earlier and hence not legally valid.

They contended that the CBI court had already taken cognizance of the first charge-sheet and commenced the trial. Ms. Sabitha Indra Reddy is the first Telangana Cabinet Minister to get entangled in a criminal case trial. She was with the Congress party till 2019.Though she lost to TRS candidate in Maheshwaram in 2014, won from the same constituency in 2019 on Congress party ticket.

193,2020/01/10,Collecting five-year tuition fee for MBBS illegal: HC,"Collection of tuition fee for five years from students pursuing M.B.B.S. course in private medical colleges despite the course duration being four-and-a-half years is illegal, the Telangana High Court declared.

Under the A.P. Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act-1983, action can be initiated against private medical colleges collecting fees for five years for M.B.B.S. course, the HC said in a judgment. A division bench of Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice K. Lakshman delivered this verdict after hearing a writ petition filed by a student Dundigalla Padmateja of Hanamkonda in Warangal district.

While the M.B.B.S. course was of four-and-a-half year duration, private medical colleges were collecting fee for five years and this was illegal, the student said in the petition. After hearing contentions of the government, private medical colleges and the petitioner, the bench held even the action of Telangana Admission and Fee Regulation Committee (TAFRC) recommending collection of five years fee for M.B.B.S. course was illegal.

The bench made it clear that private colleges should collect year-wise fee for four years. For the remaining six months period, half the yearly fee only should be collected, the verdict said. “It was unfortunate that rules framed under GO MS No. 6 of Higher Education did not provide an opportunity either to students or parents association before the TAFRC decides upon the contentions of private medical colleges association”, the bench observed.

This deprives students and parents of any scope to protect their interests over fee fixation. “Neither the State government nor TAFRC seem to be bothered about this serious omission in the rules”, the bench noted.

The TAFRC contended that, in the combined state of A.P. and new state of Telangana, fee was being collected for five years. Supporting the TAFRC’s recommendation for collection of fee for five years, the government filed an affidavit stating that medical colleges would not charge extra for medicos who have to undergo classes for six more months due to securing less than 35% marks in internal assessment or those failing in final examination.

“It appears the government is assuming that all students are likely to fail and would require an additional six months of study. This presumption is wholly without any basis..”, the bench said in the verdict.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/collecting-five-year-tuition-fee-for-mbbs-illegal-hc/article30536540.ece
194,2020/01/10,TSCSC to liquidate food credit outstanding with SBI,"The Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (TSCSCL) has agreed in principle to liquidate the food credit advances it availed from the public sector lender State Bank of India.

The Corporation, however, did not specify the date by which the process will be completed. The Corporation reportedly gave this assurance to the Food Credit Standing Committee (FCSC) of the SBI, which convened a high level meeting of the civil supplies corporations of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh here on Thursday.

The meeting follows a letter addressed by the SBI to the State government last month asking the latter to bestow personal attention and arrange for liquidation of the food credit accounts due by the State government. The SBI said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its guidelines, had asked the banks to treat these loans as potential non-performing loans.

Inadequate cover

The RBI, according to senior officials, gave the direction as it opined that the stock of food grains against which these loans were extended were not adequate to cover the value of the loan. The SBI said, in its letter, that while the interest in respect of the FC accounts was being serviced from time to time, it was observed that the position of stocks and outstanding was running almost static for the past few years. “The position revealed is not satisfactory as the account is overdue for liquidation now,” the SBI said.

The State officials who attended the FCSC meeting said that though they were ready to liquidate the FC account, they needed to take the concurrence of the State government before communicating the schedule of repayment.

Bank’s assurance

The SBI, it is learnt, had insisted that the TS Civil Supplies Corporation clear the outstanding before the end of the financial year so that it can avail new loans.

In the process, it had assured that the bank was prepared to complete the formalities and sanction new loans within a week if the Corporation was prepared to liquidate the outstanding. The officials of the two States are also understood to have agreed to apportion the subsidy released by the Centre from time to time in line with the norms set at the time of de-merger of the erstwhile civil supplies corporation in the united State.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tscsc-to-liquidate-food-credit-outstanding-with-sbi/article30536416.ece

Form-A should be submitted to the designated authorities, district collector and district election authority or returning officer concerned, before the closure of last date for filing of nominations. “It (non-submission) shall not be ground for rejection of nomination by the returning officers,” the SEC said.

While Form-A is related to political parties authorising a party functionary to set up candidates, the party president or general secretary could directly set up the candidate and send details to the returning officers concerned in Form-B.

The SEC expressed concern that staff in district collectorates were not accepting Form-A submitted by the political parties and wherever they were accepted, copies of these forms with endorsement were not being sent to the returning officers concerned. These copies should reach the returning officers concerned before the expiry of last date for withdrawal of nominations.

SEC secretary M. Ashok Kumar said it had also come to the notice of the Commission that authorities were insisting on submission of both Form-A and Form-B which was not in consonance with the instructions issued by the SEC.

203,2020/01/10,Migrant Telangana workers caught in U.S.-Iran crossfire,"Tens of thousands of migrant workers from the State, especially from the undivided districts of Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Adilabad, have been reportedly stranded in Iraq without work and food for days together. They suffer the worst of the bomb attacks and crossfire between Iranian and American armies in the wake of the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani on Sunday.

The Iran-US unrest increased the woes of Telangana workers following the missile attacks on an Iraqi airbase at Bardarash, 50 km from Erbil, the largest populated city in the Iraqi Kurdistan, where the US forces are based. About 10,000 workers from the State are reported to be working in Erbil and 100 in Bardarash.

The migrant workers, who were already in dire straits owing to invalid visa and shutdown of a number of factories are at their wits’ end, not knowing what to do. “They are spending sleepless nights on streets, unable to get enough food. They are escaping from the Iraqi police, staying with their Telugu acquaintances,” said E. Dakshina Moorthy, who just returned from Erbil on a 15-day company leave.

“About 80% of workers from Telangana in Erbil have no proper documents. Deceived by agents and their lawyers in Iraq, they arrived in the Gulf country, borrowing money at high interest rates. If they continue to stay in Iraq they would be imprisoned and imposed hefty penalties. If they want to go back home, they have to pay $ 500 for a month of stay,” said Mr Moorthy, who is also Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association representative in Erbil.

204,2020/01/10,IOC details rules on political protests at Olympics,"No taking a knee at the Olympics. No hand gestures with political meaning. No disrespect at medal ceremonies.

The International Olympic Committee published guidelines on Thursday, specifying which types of athlete protests will not be allowed at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

Athletes are prohibited by the Olympic Charter’s Rule 50 from taking a political stand in the field of play, like the raised fists by American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Games.

Today’s Olympians now know more about which acts of divisive disruption will lead to disciplinary action in Tokyo. They can still express political opinions in official media settings or on social media accounts.

“We needed clarity and they wanted clarity on the rules,” said Kirsty Coventry, chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission, which oversaw the new three-page document. “The majority of athletes feel it is very important that we respect each other as athletes.” Ms. Coventry, an Olympic gold medalist in swimming, is now Zimbabwe’s sports minister.

Athletes who break protest rules at the July 24-Aug. 9 Tokyo Games face three rounds of disciplinary action, by the IOC, a sport’s governing body and a national Olympic body.

The new guidelines come after two American athletes were reprimanded by the U.S. Olympic Committee for medal podium protests at the Pan-American Games in August in Lima, Peru. Fencer Race Imboden kneeled and hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised a fist in protest. Both were put on probation for 12 months, a period that covers the Tokyo Olympics.

Other protests in 2019 included swimmers from Australia and Britain refusing to join world championship gold medalist Sun Yang on the podium because the Chinese star has been implicated in doping violations.

A political gesture at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics went unpunished in the men’s marathon. Silver medalist Feyisa Lilesa crossed his wrists at the finish line to show support with freedom-seeking protesters in his home region of Ethiopia.

“It is a fundamental principle that sport is neutral and must be separate from political, religious or any other type of interference,” the IOC document states, urging “the focus for the field of play and related ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes’ performance.”

A meeting Thursday between the IOC executive board and athletes’ panel also discussed the charter’s Rule 40, which strictly limits an athletes ability to promote their sponsors during official Olympic Games periods.

German athletes working outside the IOC system won concessions last year in a ruling that has led to Olympic bodies in the United States, Australia and Canada to offer a better deal to their athletes.

In the German case, a federal cartel agency sided against the IOC’s argument that retaining exclusive rights for its top-tier sponsors protected the value of deals that help fund sports and athletes globally. Still, Coventry said the IOC panel had an open door policy” and welcomed approaches from independent athlete groups who wanted to challenge the system.

Separately, IOC President Thomas Bach declined to comment on the whereabouts of a historic Olympic document that sold for $8.8 million at auction in New York a month ago. The IOC is expected to try to ensure it is displayed at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

“At this moment at least we have not enough solid information which we could share,” Mr. Bach said at a news conference.

The 14-page document is the 1892 manifesto written by French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin to launch the modern Olympics.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/u2rzt2/article30531642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10REUIOC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/ioc-details-rules-on-political-protests-at-olympics/article30531624.ece

206,2020/01/10,Shamji Vishram: A leaf from the rough book,"On Republic Day 2001, when Shamji Vishram and his community of weavers were preparing to celebrate with song and dance, an earthquake struck, destroying Bhujodi village in Bhuj, Gujarat.

To see his house and nearby surroundings turn topsy-turvy in over two minutes left this weaver, one of the most articulate ones in his village, in tears. What was even more disheartening and difficult to reconcile was the grim fact that his favourite loom where spinning yarn on a charkha and conducting meaningful workshops for village’s teenagers and women were his primary activities simply disappeared.

“Two hundred and fifty looms existed before the quake. After the devastation, only 70 survived,” says Shamji. Weaving, once a flourishing way of life, almost came to a standstill.

It pushed those who remained in the trade to begin using synthetic wool to bring down the cost of their products. Shamji worked hard at changing this, after travelling across Kutch to identify traditional products and their uses. New products were recreated for urban centres. In 2005 he received the National Award from then President Pratibha Patil.

This week, the 45-year-old weaver will be in Delhi, conducting a spinning and embroidery workshop at a four day long exhibition Desi Oon, organised by Khamir, an organisation that came up after the earthquake rocked Gujarat with a mission to preserve the crafts, heritage, and culture of the Kutch region. Excerpts from a conversation.

What is the tradition of using indigenous wool?

The Rabari, a pastoral community that also lives in the jungles, wore clothes made from indigenous wool. They wore all white - shawls, dhoti, turban, blankets. Women wore black outfits – ghagras with mirrorwork and blouses that were heavily embroidered. Now only a few members of this community wear traditional clothes. These outfits kept them warm in chilly weather. Similarly the Ahirs, farmers who walk long distances with their cows and buffaloes, wore multi coloured blankets.

How have you used this wool for an urban audience?

I have worked with desiwool from the Kutchi sheep that has coarse hair not found anywhere else. With this, I made carpets, bedcovers, jackets and stoles. Since Dilliwalas prefer softer shawls, I blended cotton and silk with desiwool. For the jackets, 40% is cotton, while 60% is wool. The Kutchi sheep wool is bought from the Maldhari community. Products have been designed on the basis of my understanding of the Delhi market. I also experimented with hand-stitched garments by engaging women into the process. So, kurtas and kaftans were made by mixing cotton and wool.

Tell us how yarn gets converted into fabric?

We treat the yarn first to make it soft, then dye it with natural dyes. Then we do warping and sizing process. After that we carry out joining of warp with loom before weaving. We also treat the woven fabric to make it softer. Embroidery or tie dye work is done after that to finish piece. Overall it is a lengthy and time consuming process involving various skills.

Can you attribute the reason for desi wool’s decline?

By and large, desi wool was unacceptable to city goers as it was coarse, bulkier. People’s lifestyle started changing. They yearned for feather light material. To fulfil that requirement, weavers resorted to using acrylic material. Only for the past two years, weavers have gone back to the traditional routine by making clothes with 100 per cent handwoven indigenous wool.

At Bikaner House, January 10th – 13th, 11. a.m.- 1 p.m.; 2 p.m. - 5 p.m. are timing of the workshop conducted by the master weaver

207,2020/01/10,Good neighbours: Ayalkaar exhibition at Gallery White,"What do artists Ankush Safaya, Kim Kyoungae, N Divya, Sachin Karne and Sonatina Mendes have in common? Not their artworks, since Safaya is an abstract artist, Kyoungae works with figurative symbolism, Karne and Mendes use objects to explore culture, and Divya turns to garments to express herself as a Diaspora woman artist.

They are, in fact, connected through friendships and the city of Baroda (all of them studied there). And beyond the common ground of the exhibition, Ayalkaar (Malayalam for neighbours), curated by Rekha Rodwittiya, it is also a coming together facilitated by a homegrown love.

The collective mind

Over the years, Rodwittiya has mentored younger artists and opened The Collective Studio to interactions and production. “My studio has been the hub where all these relationships have taken root, around a groaning dining table laden with food, over cups of endless chai and coffee, while watching films together and amid the clamour of passionate voices that hold the conviction of shared beliefs,” says the artist.

This practice — which was also an introduction to the world of art through Rodiwttiya’s network of acquaintances and friends — has its roots in the culture inherent to the Baroda art scene, given that the artist-curator studied at the Maharaja Sayajirao University’s Faculty of Fine Arts. As a theorist from MSU’s Art History department (and mentored by Rodwittiya), I wonder if Ayalkaar, with the underlying socio-political theme of the title and the works, takes a stand. “In today’s political climate, where diversity isn’t necessarily viewed as servicing a purpose within the prevailing majoritarian stake-hold, this simple act of compiling five seemingly disparate artists, yet fleshing the connections that hold them in harmony, becomes the focus,” she says. Simply put, diversity becomes the feature of unity among them — each of their works hinging on the idea of preciousness, of friendships — in stark contrast to the current political scenario.

Meet the artists

Ankush Safaya: With minimum tools, the former electronics engineer uses pencil indents upon various surfaces with precision to resonate stillness. The abstract nature of his work — which evokes the worn-out stones of a pavement, the cracks of a dilapidated building, or the scuffmarks of tools — allows for multiple interpretations.

Kim Kyoungae’s Menopause Diaries - Conversation at the threshold, with menstrual blood, tissue, acrylic colour, butter paper and thread

Kim Kyoungae: Born and raised in South Korea, she came to India many years ago because she believed it to be more conducive to who she knew herself to be. Her paintings explore her life through a poetic prism, where her personal realities act as membranes through which to distil meaning. She grapples with a world where belonging isn’t about self-identity.

N Divya’s Untitled - watercolour on paper

N Divya: Growing up in Oman, steeped in the sentiments of the Diaspora, she internalised her realities as a coping mechanism. Painting became a method of self-reflection. In this particular piece, she uses a dress — European in design but with an Indian pattern — to talk about the layered notion of identity.

Sonatina Mendes’ Untitled 1 - watercolour on paper

Sachin Karne and Sonatina Mendes: While Maharashtra-based Karne’s work is marked by gigantic landscapes of wastelands and intimately-painted territories of private reflections, Mendes, who hails from a Goan Catholic family, views the world as a place of objects. She positions objects with great detail — tableaus of life that she then becomes the caretaker of. “There are various ways of dreaming a particular dream, as there are various paths to a given destination,” she says, indicating how working at The Collective Studio was one of the paths.

208,2020/01/10,Actor-storyteller Swaraj Singh to regale the Hyderabad audience with a bouquet of stories,"Swaraj Singh remembers himself as a “curious child” who was interested in the arts — acting, dance and music — in school days. So it wasn’t surprising when the Jamshedpur-bred lad enrolled in an acting course with Actor Prepares in Mumbai when he had to make a career choice. “I wanted to be a part of Hindi cinema. Not the mainstream cinema, but the ones that are more artistic and give actors scope to perform,” he says. He looked up to actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Irrfan Khan and Manoj Bajpayee.

For the last six years, Swaraj has been actively pursuing theatre as advised by a few well wishers and has been enjoying the challenges and experiences of facing a live audience. He has been a part of more than 100 performances and some of them have been staged in Hyderabad too. “But this is the first time I will be visiting Hyderabad for a storytelling session,” he says, referring to ‘Stories with Swaraj Singh’ presented by Kalakaksh at Moonshine Project this weekend.

His storytelling sessions usually range between 70 and 90 minutes. Each story narration is about seven to eight minutes and other artistes take the stage in between. The extension of his creative abilities from enacting the script that other playwrights have written to writing his own stories happened when storyteller Mehak Mirza Prabhu attended one of his plays, a powerful story of an acid attack victim, and felt Swaraj too could be a storyteller. “She felt I had the potential to write my own content and narrate it, and encouraged me,” he recalls.

Swaraj had his first storytelling session in August 2018 and presented his first story titled Bhookh, turning the lens on childhood hunger. “The story was received well and has travelled places; I even narrated it to the inmates of Tihar jail. A few NGOs also approached me, since they liked the story’s idea of not wasting food,” says Swaraj.

Swaraj penned more stories, with a conscious effort to make them socially relevant. Bhookh and Hinglish are his most popular ones. In Hyderabad, he will narrate these along with a few more titles that aren’t available in his online videos.

Swaraj’s own journey from the time he enrolled in Actor Prepares in Mumbai went through a tumultuous time after he lost his father in 2014, had to return to his hometown to be beside his mother, and eventually returned months later to Mumbai to realise that he had lost touch with acting and his confidence levels had dipped. “I took up all kinds of jobs to keep me going. I was a trainer at a gym, worked as a bouncer and had a stint at a call centre before I picked up the pieces gradually,” she shares.

He looks back at his journey with pride: “I enjoy making people laugh, cry and go through a roller coaster of emotions during the narration. I’ve lost count of how many storytelling sessions I’ve had last year. Most of these events happen over the weekend and at least three out of four weekends I am booked.”

‘Stories with Swaraj Singh’ will be at Moonshine Project, Hyderabad, on January 11; 6 p.m. Tickets on insider.in and bookmyshow.com",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ttkia6/article30533646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Swaraj-Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/actor-storyteller-swaraj-singh-to-regale-the-hyderabad-audience-with-a-bouquet-of-stories/article30533647.ece

210,2020/01/10,Farmers suspend stir over land acquisition,"Farmers at Nindar village, 20 km from here, on Friday suspended their four-day-long unusual agitation, during which they dug pits and trenches and buried themselves chest-deep in the mud with the demand for fair compensation for their land acquired for a housing project. The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has assured them of finding a solution to the issue.

The JDA has acquired 1,350 bighas of land at Nindar in several stages since 2010 for a plush housing project, despite the land owners refusing to accept compensation. While the compensation has been offered at the rates prevailing in 2010, the farmers alleged that the JDA's survey was faulty and the compensation was much below the market prices.

‘Unfair compensation’

The Nindar Bachao Yuva Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, which has lauched the ‘Zameen Samadhi Satyagraha’, has demanded that the State government give compensation as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, which came into force on January 1, 2014. “Applying the 2010 District Lease Committee rates in 2020 is unfair,” Samiti convener Nagendra Singh Shekhawat said.

Mahesh Joshi, government chief whip in the State Assembly, visited the site of agitation on Friday and assured the farmers of “sympathetic consideration” of their demand. Mr. Shekhawat said the Satyagraha site would be protected during negotiations with the JDA officers and the agitation revived if a satisfactory solution was not offered.

Several women had also buried themselves chest-deep before the protest was suspended.

Farmers of the village had first resorted to this unique form of protest in 2017 when the JDA had started getting possession of the acquired land. The agitation had generated immense public sympathy and forced the then BJP government to hold talks with the farmers.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m2icin/article30537588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10FARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/farmers-suspend-stir-over-land-acquisition/article30537589.ece

212,2020/01/10,Husband arrested for murder of wife and son in Jaipur,"Police on Friday claimed to have solved the sensational case of murder of a 30-year-old woman at her Unique Tower residential apartment in Pratap Nagar here earlier this week, after which her two-year-old son was also found dead near the building. The woman's husband is alleged to have conspired for the double murder through a contract killer.

Strained ties

According to the police, Rohit Tiwari — a manger with Indian Oil Corporation — had strained relations with his wife, Shweta, and he wanted to get rid of her and start a new family by marrying someone else. He allegedly hired a contract killer, Saurabh Chaudhary, who happened to be the brother-in-law of his friend, to kill both his wife and son.

Jaipur Police Commissioner Anand Srivastava said both Rohit and Saurabh had been arrested and the role of Rohit's friend was being probed.

As part of the conspiracy, Rohit allegedly sent Saurabh to his flat on January 7 when he was at his office at Sanganer International Airport, where he was posted as the fuel in-charge.

The contract killer, who gained entry into the house as an acquaintance, allegedly hit Shweta on the head with a pestle and slit her throat with a knife. He allegedly kidnapped her son, Shriyam, and later killed him as well before dumping his body in the bushes near the apartment building.

Mr. Srivastava said Rohit had paid ₹20,000 to Saurabh as advance for the double murder. Saurabh also took Shweta’s mobile phone and put her sim card in a new phone to send ransom messages to Rohit in order to mislead the police.

The couple and their son had shifted from New Delhi to Jaipur one-and-a-half years ago and were staying in Unique Tower's flat on rent.

Shweta's body, lying in a pool of blood, was first noticed by the maid who came to the flat in the evening and found the entrance door open.

214,2020/01/10,No screening of Padukone’s film in Aligarh,"After a Hindutva organisation put posters on hoardings in front of theatres, Deepika Padukone-starrer Chhapaak was not screened in theatres across Aligarh on Friday.

The posters written in big font with chetavani (caution) written on top said that those who would try to screen Chhapaak should get their “insurance” done. “Na dekhunga, na dekhnedunga” (won’t watch, won’t allow anybody to watch) it declared. The poster further criticised Ms. Padukone for showing concern for only one side affected by violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University on January 5.

With names and photos of Pankaj Pandit and Deepak Sharma of Akhand Bharat Hindu Sena printed at the bottom, the poster said Ms. Padukone had thrown acid on the face of nationalism.

Anil Samania, Circle Officer III, Aligarh, told reporters that security was provided to the theatres. “But theatre owners have decided against screening the film. If they decide to screen, we will provide security,” he said.

Aligarh has four prominent theatres and at least two, Meenakshi and Great Value Mall had put posters of the film. However, according to local sources, they were replaced with Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.

SP protest

Samajwadi Party members protested against the move. Ranjeet Chaudhary, district president, Chhatra Sabha, the student wing of the party, said, “The film is about an acid attack victim. On one hand this government talks of ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’, but when Ms. Padukone went to show solidarity with student leader Aishe Ghosh who was beaten during violence at JNU, she is being targeted,” he said.

In Muzaffarnagar, Bajrang Dal members disrupted the screening of the film at Carnival Cinemas in the heart of the city. Local sources said members of the right-wing organisation tore posters of the film and raised slogans against Ms. Padukone. In Noida, SP members alleged that the police didn’t allow them to watch the film at Spice Mall in Sector 25.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-screening-of-padukones-film-in-aligarh/article30537560.ece

217,2020/01/10,Over two dozen AMU students booked for ‘inappropriate slogans’,"Over two dozen unidentified students of Aligarh Muslim University were booked on Thursday for allegedly raising inappropriate slogans against U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The students had formed a human chain in solidarity with JNU students and teachers who were attacked by masked men on Sunday.

Anil Kumar, SHO, Civil Lines, said 25-30 unnamed students have been booked under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion). He said the police had collected video evidence.

A student requesting anonymity said the slogans were generic and didn’t make any personal comment on any political figure.

In another development, citing a Allahabad High Court ruling, the university authorities have issued notices that disallow any protest within 100 metres of the Administrative Block and Vice Chancellor’s lodge. It effectively means the university administration doesn’t want students to protest at the university gate.

“From a protest against the CAA and NRC, it is becoming a protest against the VC and the Registrar. We could see the involvement of vested interests among students. The students could protest at Duck Point, the designated spot for such protests,” said an official source. Duck Point is situated near the canteen and is well inside the campus. A section of teachers who are protesting against the CAA assemble at this spot.

‘Assessing situation’

Student leaders said they are assessing the situation and would take a call on how to take the protests forward. “Right now, we are protesting at Bab-e-Syed, but there is no sit-in protest right now,” said a student who is actively involved in the protest.

218,2020/01/10,Altaf Bukhari shakes up politics in Kahsmir,"Altaf Bukhari, 60, Kashmir Valley’s top businessman with just five years of experience in politics, has triggered a churning, with over 13 leaders quitting the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and the National Conference (NC) fearing an “attempt to change the goal post for the regional parties”.

Four leaders, including former MLA Yawar Mir, resigned from the PDP, a day after the party expelled nine leaders for their decision to meet a team of 15 ambassadors and diplomats, as part of a delegation led by Mr. Bukhari, and submit to the Lt. Governor a memorandum seeking statehood and domicile laws.

There is a growing international pressure to restore a genuine political process in Kashmir, and Mr. Bukhari has emerged as a leader to voice the new demands and fashion new mainstream politics. His approach will pressure the other parties to re-frame their goals.

Also Read 26 political detainees released in Kashmir

Sources said the jailed PDP president, Mehbooba Mufti, has ordered action against all “those compromising on the party’s position on Article 370 and 35A”.

“Those who were expelled or resigned are just a bunch of opportunists who enjoyed the power when the PDP was ruling Jammu and Kashmir. It will not deter the party from pursuing its rightful agenda,” a senior leader told The Hindu.

Mr. Bukhari, the richest candidate in the 2014 Assembly election with assets worth ₹84 crore, was sidelined by the PDP for negotiating with the BJP without Ms. Mufti’s approval in 2016. Eventually expelled, Mr. Bukhari became the first leader in the Valley to meet European Union parliamentarians in Delhi in October and 15 Ambassadors on January 9. Departing from the regional parties’ demands for greater autonomy and self-rule, Mr. Bukhari has set a new goal: statehood and domicile laws. Even PDP patron Muzaffar Hussain Baig’s nephew Javaid Baig, a former MLA, has decided to back Mr. Bukhari. “There was a dire need for the politicians like him to begin the process of reconciliation so as to secure statehood and guarantees for land and job rights. Restoration of Article 370 is impossible, and we need to revisit our stand,” said Mr. Baigh.

Sources said Mr. Bukhari would likely float his own party, with a few PDP and NC leaders ready to join him.

“Mr. Bukhari’s politics is a dangerous departure for the regional politics. From ‘azaadi’, autonomy and self-rule, Mr. Bukhari has lowered the goal to reservation in jobs and new laws for land sale to outsiders,” a senior NC leader said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mew5ho/article30537427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-ALTAF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/altaf-bukhari-shakes-up-politics-in-kahsmir/article30537428.ece
219,2020/01/10,26 political detainees released in Kashmir,"The J&K administration released 26 political detainees on Friday, coinciding with the tour of the 15-member foreign envoys, including the U.S. Ambassador, to Jammu.

A government spokesman said the administration revoked the detention of 26 persons detained under J&K Public Safety Act (PSA), 1978.

Those released include scores of lower-rung political activists mainly held in the government clampdown on August 5 and two senior lawyers, Nazir Ahmad Ronga, 65, and Abdul Salam Rather, 71.

However, members of the separatist Hurriyat and JKLF remain in custody, as does the president of the Kashmir High Court Bar Association Mian Qayoom.

Friday’s release is the first major decision on detentions since the August 5 clampdown by the Centre. It comes a day after several Valley-based political leaders raised the issue with the visiting 15-member envoys’ team in Srinagar and sought their intervention to put pressure on the Centre.

Meanwhile, the visiting ambassadors and the diplomats were briefed by a high-level team led by Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subramanian and DGP Dilbag Singh in Jammu, where they shared their assessment of the situation post August 5 and “measures under way to tackle militancy and restore peace”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/26-political-detainees-released-in-kashmir/article30537414.ece
220,2020/01/10,‘Firms gain from illegal coal mining in Meghalaya’,"Illegal coal mining in Meghalaya has come as a boon to cement factories and captive power plants as they allegedly did not have to pay royalty, taxes and other statutory levies, a report by an independent committee of the National Green Tribunal said.

The panel has recommended legal action against the cement factories and power plants that allegedly evaded paying an amount of over ₹423 crore as royalty and VAT/GST on the illegally mined coal used by them.

The NGT had banned unscientific and unsafe rat-hole mining of coal in Meghalaya in 2014 though it intermittently allowed transportation of already mined coal from time to time.

Rat-hole mining involves digging of narrow tunnels, usually 3-4 feet high, for workers to enter and extract coal.

The horizontal tunnels are often termed “rat-holes”, as each just about fits one person.

“Illegal rat-hole coal mining in the State of Meghalaya came as a boon to these cement manufacturing plants and thermal power plants as it virtually exempted them from payment of royalty, taxes and other statutory levies payable on more than two-third of the coal consumed by them,” the committee, headed by former High Court judge Brojendra Prasad Katakey, said in the report submitted to the NGT last month.

Appointed in August last year, the committee is backed by a representative from the Dhanbad-based Indian School of Mines and the Central Pollution Control Board.

“No royalty, taxes and any other statutory levies have been paid to the State of Meghalaya on the illegally mined coal utilised by these cement plants and thermal plants during the audit period, resulting in a huge loss to the State exchequer,” said the report.

The panel has recommended that the State government, the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board initiate legal action against each of the cement factories and the thermal power plants who used illegally mined local coal after a ban on rat-hole coal mining since April 2014.

The recommendations were made after the committee found out that the cement companies and power subsidiaries had purchased illegally mined coal in the name of “slate”, a non-fuel mineral, to circumvent the ban imposed by the NGT on illegal rat-hole coal mining, the report said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2ljdyk/article30537331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MeghalayaCoalMines,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/firms-gain-from-illegal-coal-mining-in-meghalaya/article30537317.ece
221,2020/01/10,Assam-specific CAA rules sought,"Amid protests in Assam over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma met with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday, asking for specific additions to the rules being framed for the Act.

According to government sources, the two Assam politicians said the rules for CAA should have a clearly delineated provision for furnishing of documents for proof that applicants have been present in India since before the cut-off date of December 31, 2014 as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise that had been undertaken in the State had the cut-off date of 1971.

Exercising caution

Mr. Sonowal had, in fact, written to Mr. Shah, to incorporate suggestions for rules being framed for CAA.

Significantly, the Union Home Ministry too is said to be treading cautiously on the framing of rules and remains firm on provision of documentary proof of entry into India before the cut-off date of 31st December 31, 2014.

No information is as yet available on just what documents would be acceptable as proof of entry.

Assam suffering

It is also being deliberated whether or not Assam-specific rules can be incorporated.

The State has been on the boil since the passage of the CAA, with protesters stating that it reversed all the gains of the Assam Accord of 1985 and the NRC exercise that was conducted under the supervision of the Supreme Court.

The resolution, moved by Gujarat’s Minister of the State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja, was passed by a majority vote after a two-hour-long heated discussion that saw the independent legislator and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani calling it a “black day” in the history of Gujarat’s Assembly.

“Since CM Vijay Rupani himself was born in Burma and then came to India; he should not support CAA, which is discriminatory and violates the constitutional principles of secularism and pluralism,” Mr. Mevani later told reporters outside the Assembly, after the resolution was passed in the house.

The resolution congratulated Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah for their “bold and historic decision” to bring in the bill and ensure its passage in Parliament and make it a law to provide citizenship to the persecuted religious minorities of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The notices were pasted on Thursday.

The court had recently declared Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatima and son Abdullah Azam as absconders in three cases. In case they fail to appear before the court by January 24, their properties will be attached.

The district administration also made a public announcement about the Khan family being declared absconders.

The exercise, known as “munadi” in the official parlance, is part of Section 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and is used when a warrant against an accused cannot be executed.

Additional district government counsel Ram Avtar Saini said that the court had directed the police to comply with the proclamation notice against Azam Khan and others in the matter.

Earlier, the court had issued non-bailable warrants against the Khans after they had failed to present themselves before it.

Additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kamboj had proclaimed them ‘absconder’ invoking Section 82 of CrPC.

Rampur’s Circle Officer Satyajit Gupta said: “Azam Khan and his family members against whom the non-bailable warrants were issued by the court, failed to appear before it. Therefore in compliance of Section 82 of CrPc, apart from the munadi, the proclamation notice was put up on the wall of his house as well.”

The case against the Khans related to the alleged forged birth certificate of Abdullah Azam, whose election from the Suar Assembly constituency was recently annulled by the Allahabad high court.

In two other cases, they have been asked to appear on January 20.

On January 3, 2019, BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged a complaint alleging that Azam Khan and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates — one from Lucknow and another from Rampur.

Following the complaint, the Ganj kotwali police registered an FIR against the three under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Four of his accomplices, who were staying with him at the guest house have also been arrested, a senior Goa Crime Branch official said on Thursday.

The accused, Sunil Singh, was nabbed after Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant alerted the police about him.

Mr. Singh stayed at the State guest house here for almost 12 days before being caught on Tuesday. He had even sought an appointment with the Chief Minister, the official said.

“He had shown his designation as Minister of Cooperation from the Uttar Pradesh government, and was also provided a personal security officer from the Goa Police,” the official said.

After his behaviour was found to be suspicious, Mr. Sawant brought it to the notice of the Goa Police.

“I asked the Crime Branch to arrest the person. He had produced forged letters and e-mails to claim that he was a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government,” Mr. Sawant told reporters here.

The accused also met Goa Cooperation Minister Govind Gawade in the ministerial block here last week and discussed various issues related to the department.

When asked about it, Mr. Gawade said, “I was told that he was a State guest and a minister in the UP Cabinet. I didn’t meet him for much time. He was with me for 10 minutes.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article14453693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20bg_bgnag_Cabi+21Bg_HandCuff.eps.j.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/man-posing-as-up-minister-stays-at-goa-guest-house-arrested/article30530758.ece
233,2020/01/10,U.P. govt. suspends Noida SSP over objectionable video,"Days after an objectionable video of Gautambuddha Nagar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Vaibhav Krishna came to light, the IPS officer has been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government.

Mr. Krishna had described the video as “morphed” and a move to “malign” his image. He filed an FIR and called it a move by his rivals to deflect attention from a “secret” report on rampant corruption in postings that he had submitted to the Chief Minister’s Office and the Director General of Police.

In a simultaneous action, five IPS officers named in the report have been removed from field postings and an SIT probe has been ordered.

Official sources said the video was sent to the forensic lab in Gujarat and a preliminary report found it to be authentic. The inquiry report also found him guilty of violating the service rules as he leaked the secret report to the media. Mr. Krishna also made news when he allegedly sent police officers to Meerut to detain a senior journalist to know the source of the video. A departmental inquiry has been ordered against him.

‘Police-scribe nexus’

The leaked report detailed an alleged nexus between police officers and journalists to influence transfer postings and cases. The report was published after four journalists were arrested by the Gautambuddha Nagar police for alleged publication of fake news about police officers.

Among the 14 IPS officers transferred by the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday are Himanshu Kumar, Ajaypal Sharma, Rajiv Narayan Mishra, Sudhir Kumar Singh and Ganesh Saha, whose names were mentioned in the report submitted by Mr. Krishna.

Fighting corruption

An official release said there was zero tolerance against corruption and a three-member Special Investigation Team has been constituted to investigate the matter and submit the report within 15 days.

234,2020/01/10,Activists protest felling of trees for road widening in Berhampur,"Environmental activists in Odisha’s Berhampur are protesting against indiscriminate cutting of trees for widening of two roads, despite past directive of authorities to transplant mature trees.

Since Wednesday, activists from different organisations, including Berhampur Sabuja Bahini (BSB), Anchalika Vikash Parishad (AVP) and Mahatma Helping Hand, have started regular vigil to protect the remaining trees from getting cut. In August 2019, similar protests by green activists had saved 188 mature trees from getting cut from MKCG medical college campus in the city for road widening work.

At present, mature trees are being cut for widening of roads connecting Mango Market to old Berhampur area via Andhapasara road and the stretch from Mango market to sub-registrar office square.

Due to persuasion of BSB, office of superintending engineer of Roads and Buildings for southern circle, through a letter on July 19, had directed all its executive engineers concerned to limit cutting of trees during road construction or widening and transplantation of trees wherever possible.

The green activists alleged that despite the directive, 37 mature trees were cut down during past few days for widening of the two roads. “To save the rest of the mature trees, we started documenting all of them through special numbering on their trunks and photographs,” said BSB president Sibaram Panigrahy. There are 105 trees that face the danger of being cut down, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/activists-protest-felling-of-trees-for-road-widening-in-berhampur/article30528510.ece

Non-concrete roofs of a number of houses in Naihati were blown off and glass panels of many buildings, including the municipality in Chinsurah, were shattered due to the impact of the explosion.

The blast occurred when police were trying to defuse materials seized from a firecracker factory in Naihati. At least two policemen were injured in the blast.

Videos of the explosion showed an enormous cloud of smoke rising several metres over the surface, triggering panic among people who came out their homes in both districts. “We will investigate why the impact of the explosion was so high. Huge quantity of explosives were seized and the bomb disposal squad was trying to dispose them of,” said Barrackpore Police Commissioner Manoj Verma said. The materials were seized following an explosion in the firecrackers manufacturing unit at Naihati killed four workers on Janaury 3.

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeted videos of the explosion saying it “leaves nothing to imagination”. “It calls for a thorough probe in view of its seriousness, intensity and damage caused. Only expert investigation can unearth issues involved. This ominous development should be an eye-opener for law enforcing and regulatory regime in State,” Mr Dhankhar said.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she had sent the local MLA to take stock of the situation. “If there are any cracks because of the explosion we will provide compensation to the people,” she said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/explosion-in-naihati-rocks-both-banks-of-hooghly-2-policemen-hurt/article30528486.ece
236,2020/01/10,Protests planned against PM Modi’s Kolkata visit over the weekend,"Multiple civil society groups, social organisations, human rights platforms and cultural bodies in Kolkata have planned a demonstration under a common slogan on Saturday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the city.

There will be posters and banners urging the Prime Minister “to go back.” An elaborate ‘civil disobedience movement’, branded as “no NRC, no NPR, no CAA campaign,” has been planned. Mr. Modi is expected to attend four programmes in the city over the weekend.

From early Saturday morning, the groups will mobilise people from the city and suburbs to march to two points. At Kaikhali traffic crossing near the airport, the objective will be to stop the Prime Minister from entering the city, the organisers said. However, it is not yet clear if Mr. Modi will be flown into the city from the airport in an Army copter or taken by road all the way to his first programme venue in Dalhousie Square. He is expected to visit Belur Math founded by Swami Vivekananda on Saturday evening.

The anti-NRC groups will also assemble near Raj Bhavan . “We appeal to participants to carry only the national flag and not the flag of any political party,” said Prasenjit Bose, a key organiser.

Meanwhile, protests continued in parts of Kolkata on Thursday. At one anti-NRC, CAA programme, research scholars from various universities and independent institutes demanded “creation of awareness to examine the connection of government exercises [like NRC and CAA] with the day-to-day issues” of the people. The group, Democratic Research Scholars’ Organisation, said more than 100 scholar representatives participated in the programme. In the city’s central Park Circus area, more than 500 people, mostly elderly Muslim women, resorted to a sit-in demonstration.

237,2020/01/10,Will review industrial subsidies in Vidarbha: Ajit Pawar,"Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will review the subsidies given to select industries in Vidarbha over the last five years. Vidarbha, a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and its leadership, receives an annual power subsidy of ₹1,200 crore and another ₹1,000 crore in textile subsidy. All of these will be under “reconsideration”, the Finance Minister told The Hindu.

Mr. Pawar, who has reviewed the State’s finances after assuming charge, said some financial discipline has to be introduced in the spendings, especially the undue subsidy doled out by the previous BJP regime. He said. “The previous government doled out a lot of benefits to industries, especially in Vidarbha. It is our responsibility to check how many industries benefited from these subsidies and how many new industries came up owing to these measures. We will also check if some of these industries actually existed.”

The State currently has a subsidy burden of ₹22,136 crore, which is a big chunk of annual revenue expenditure of ₹2,82,630 crore. The Finance Minister said prudence and discipline is the need of the hour. The State is looking at rationalisation of expenditure, at the same time increasing taxes as a way forward to come out of its debt trap, he said. Maharashtra currently has a debt of ₹4,72,000 crore. “As of now I have not passed any orders, but going by the review of State finances so far, there is no way forward but to cut spend,” he said.

Senior officials said the government is looking at rationalising administrative expenses including salary paid to nearly nine lakh employees and five lakh teachers who are on the State’s payroll. The salary burden on the government is around ₹1,14,249 crore, with pensions accounting for ₹36,368 crore. The interest on borrowings is ballooning at ₹34,207 crore. “The Finance Minister has said we must look at how money on salaries can be saved by streamlining biometric facilities and reducing leakages in various subsidies,” said a senior official of the finance department.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7vmwc0/article30528462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bmsubsidycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-review-industrial-subsidies-in-vidarbha-ajit-pawar/article30528463.ece
238,2020/01/10,"Easy to torch houses, hard to ensure people have food to eat, says Uddhav Thackeray","“It is easy to torch houses but hard to ensure people have food to eat,” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said in Aurangabad on Thursday after inaugurating an Advantage Maharashtra Expo-2020. Mr. Thackeray also said that instead of complaining about economic slowdown, Maharashtra will fight it.

Accompanied by Industries Minister Subhash Desai and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, the Chief Minister, who is on a two-day tour of Aurangabad and Jalna districts, said, “The people of this State deal with a lot of serious issues.”

After referring to the incidents of violence across the country, Mr. Thackeray reiterated his commitment towards farmers and also said his government would ensure that not a single industry goes out of the State. “We are committed to creating economic growth in the State by assimilating agriculture and industry and acting as a catalyst between the two sectors. If we keep complaining about the economic slowdown, we won’t be able to fight it. We will fight it,” he said.

Food processing park

At the four-day expo, organised by the Marathwada Association for Small Scale Industries and Agriculture (MASSIA), 450 entrepreneurs will be showcasing their products. The expo features stalls from automobile, engineering, agriculture, animation, IT, electronics, trading, infrastructure and other sectors.

The Chief Minister announced a new food processing park in Aurangabad’s Bidkin and also reviewed various projects of Osmanabad district. He also announced a new skill development centre in the State to create skilled manpower to meet the increasing demand of industries.

“A food processing park will be established in DMIC (Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor) over 500 acres, of which 100 acres will be reserved for women entrepreneurs,” the Chief Minister said.

Industry Minister Subhash Desai said three Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) areas (industrial colonies) will be established in Marathwada, and 1,018 hectares of land will be acquired for this.

The new MIDC areas will come up in Shendra, Nanded and Osmanabad, he said.

“Sixteen companies have decided to invest ₹8,360 crore in Marathwada,” Mr. Desai added.

Sunik Kirdak, convener of the exhibition, said the government should help the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector by cutting red tape. “We don’t want red carpet treatment but don’t spread thorns in the path of MSMEs. We request you to provide space for the factories which are currently operating from rented premises,” Mr. Kirdak said.

The president of MASSIA Dyandeo Rajale demanded that the Aurangabad-Pune highway should be expanded.

239,2020/01/10,Not keen to be Kolhapur’s guardian minister: Balasaheb Thorat,"A day after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray released names of guardian ministers for all districts, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) chief and State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat has expressed unwillingness to take up his responsibility as Kolhapur’s guardian minister.

Sources said Mr. Thorat would have been comfortable had he been assigned Ahmednagar which is his sphere of influence. Two ministers from Kolhapur district — senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif, and Satej ‘Bunty’ Patil of Congress, who is Minister of State for Home — have been allotted Ahmednagar and Bhandara districts respectively.

“I am not personally keen on accepting it. I am already holding two major posts [Revenue Minister and MPCC chief] which require my complete attention. I will speak to the Chief Minister about it and urge him to consider a Congress Minister who has not been given any guardian responsibility…as I am senior, I feel younger people must be given a chance,” said Mr. Thorat, adding that he would be writing to Mr. Thackeray to reconsider his appointment.

Given their strong influence in Kolhapur, both Mr. Mushrif, an oft-elected MLA from the Kagal constituency, and Mr. Patil, an MLC and a tall leader in the district’s cooperative sector, were in the running for the post here.

Three ministers, all from the NCP, have been made guardian ministers in their respective constituencies in the five ‘sugar belt’ districts in western Maharashtra — Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar (Pune), Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil (Sangli) and Cooperation Minister Balasaheb Patil (Satara).

“In addition to getting the Revenue portfolio as well as being MPCC chief, Mr. Thorat would naturally have been keen on guardianship of Ahmednagar, where he would have consolidated his position against his nemesis, ex-Congressman-turned BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil,” said an analyst.

However, a section within the Congress feels that Mr. Thorat ought to step down as MPCC chief and make way for a ‘new face’ to galvanise the Congress rank-and-file across the State, and western Maharashtra in particular, ahead of the crucial 2022 civic body polls.

“Mr. Thorat’s politics has mainly been restricted to Ahmednagar district. He lacks the necessary organisational experience needed to resuscitate moribund party organisations. Moreover, the post of an MPCC chief is a full-time job requiring a leader’s undivided attention,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity.

He further observed that the scenario was ripe for a change in the MPCC leadership as the party had performed well in the Zilla Parishad polls.

“This is the right time for the Congress to cash in on this success by getting someone senior like [former Chief Minister] Prithviraj Chavan, who has not been assigned any responsibility, to helm the MPCC,” said a city-based political observer.

However, yet another section of Congress leaders feel that Mr. Thorat’s ‘rejection’ of his appointment as Kolhapur’s guardian minister is symptomatic of the resentment brewing within the party and smacks of opportunism and self-interest.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/t5hyas/article30528434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMBALASAHEBTHORAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/not-keen-to-be-kolhapurs-guardian-minister-balasaheb-thorat/article30528435.ece
240,2020/01/10,Withdraw PPP model for govt. hospitals in Rajasthan: JSA,"The Rajasthan Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) has demanded immediate withdrawal of the NITI Aayog’s plan to link private medical colleges with the government district hospitals, in which the private entities can convert half of the hospital beds into paid beds.

The JSA urged Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to reject the public-private partnership policy formulated by NITI Aayog for the health sector.

The JSA, which functions as a Statewide network of organisations working on health rights, said the NITI Aayog’s proposal amounted to an “unnecessary intrusion” of the Union government with a “very regressive” model to commercialise the already small public health system. The PPP model, if executed, would further reduce access to public health institutions, it said.

JSA convener Narendra Gupta said it was ironic that the NITI Aayog was “so brazenly” admitting that the government lacked in resources and finances to meet the basic health needs of common citizens.

“This despite the fact that only 25% of non-hospitalised and 45% of hospitalised patients seek health care from public health institutions,” he said.

A NITI Aayog draft policy document has stated that the PPP model was being proposed for offering district hospitals to private entities to set up medical colleges in view of limited resources available with the Union and State governments. The document also states that this model is based on the PPP arrangements operative in Gujarat and Karnataka and has been developed on the basis of “international best practices”.

An investigation by JSA has revealed that there was no PPP model operative in Karnataka and only one such arrangement was functional in Gujarat, involving the Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhuj, under a corporate social responsibility project.

Letter to CM Gehlot

In a letter to the CM, signed by Dr. Gupta, health activist Chhaya Pancholi and civil rights activist Kavita Srivastava, the JSA said that no consultations with the State governments were carried out by NITI Aayog before formulating the PPP model. The JSA requested Mr. Gehlot to reject the proposal with a message to NITI Aayog to desist from formulating such models in future.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7byu6y/article30528316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09-GEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/withdraw-ppp-model-for-govt-hospitals-in-rajasthan-jsa/article30528317.ece

“Five fire tenders were pressed into service. No loss of life or injuries have been reported. All the patients were safely evacuated,” said Kamlesh Mishra, Fire Safety Officer, Noida.

Mr Mishra told The Hindu there were 243 patients in the hospital out of which 43 were in the critical unit. They were shifted to nearby private hospitals and the government hospital.

Situated in Sector 24, ESI hospital is a seven-storey building.

‘Fire caused by sparks’

Mr Mishra said the hospital authorities had listed the time of the fire as 9.15 a.m. “We got the call at 9.40 a.m. The fire started from the basement in the battery bank. Prima facie, it seems the fire was caused by sparking in one of the battery’s terminal. It caused dark and dense smoke which causes suffocation. When we reached the spot, the building was filled with smoke,” he said.

Mr. Mishra pointed out the hospital lacked fire safety features.

“Fire safety equipment was not present on every floor and those which were there were not functioning properly. It was difficult to provide an outlet to the thick smoke. The fire was put out in half-an-hour but it took us more than three hours to get rid off the smoke.”

“Cabinet has approved setting up of seven fast-track courts, with the creation of 70 posts to manage them, for dealing exclusively with the rape cases. Four of these courts will be set up in Ludhiana and one each at Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ferozepur.

He was addressing Punjab Youth Congress members and workers at the installation ceremony of the youth wing’s newly-elected office-bearers, including its president Barinder Singh Dhillon here.

Capt. Amarinder said the Congress was the only party that could provide secular, democratic rule in the country. “The Congress fought for India’s independence and the Constitution was framed on the Preamble of a socialist secular democratic republic,” he pointed out, adding that though the various Articles of the Constitution had since undergone many amendments, the Preamble has remained untouched.

“The Preamble cannot be allowed to be tinkered with,” said Capt. Amarinder, hitting out at the current attempts by the BJP to divide the nation. “What prevails today is not Lok Raj but goonda raj. We all know what happened with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh,” he said, underlining the need for youth to take the lead in saving the country.

JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said deterrent action would have followed had a leader from his party made such a statement.

The State unit of the BJP distanced itself from the views expressed by Mr. Paswan, a former Union Minister.

“The people of Bihar now want to see a BJP leader as the Chief Minister... We are in a position to form a government in the State on our own, though we shall abide by whatever decision Narendra Modi and Sushil Modi (Deputy CM and BJP leader) take,” Mr. Paswan had told reporters on Wednesday.

The BJP quickly went into damage control, insisting Mr. Paswan’s view was his own and not the party’s official stand.

“Had a member of the JD(U) been guilty of repeatedly violating coalition dharma in this manner, he would have faced the consequences for sure. I hope the BJP takes note of leaders who keep shooting their mouths off despite Amit Shah’s intervention and act against them,” Mr. Prasad said in a statement.

Mr. Shah, the party president and Union Home Minister, has said in more than a couple of TV interviews in the recent past that Mr. Kumar, serving his third consecutive term as the Chief Minister, will be the NDA’s face in the Assembly polls.

I chose some challenging subjects like ‘Lakuma Swanthanam’, a story of Lakuma Devi a courtesan in the court of Komaragiri Reddy, a rare and big production that gave me lot of satisfaction,” says Alekhya who’s a top-ranking artiste of Doordarshan and a panel member of ICCR.

Giving a brief of her career as dancer, Alekhya says she began learning dance asa child under the late Deen Dayal Sharan and later under the tutelage of Uma Rama Rao. She did her post graduation in Culture and Archaeology. “I took the subjects like ‘Nagarjuna sagaram’ of C Narayana Reddy and many other poetic works of other authors as my themes for Kuchipudi dance. I took Kuchipudi to International audience especially of Europe, USA, Canada and Middle East.”

Another production that was much talked about was ‘Maheswari –Mahakali’ of the poet Balantrapu Rajani Kantha Rao Though this was originally choreographed by Alekhya’s guru Uma Rama Rao, the way we notice some exorbitant niceties and nuances and mood changing skills could be achieved only by the performer. This gave scope to the artiste to go for extreme emotional display. No dance of her goes sans this number that speaks of Alekhya’s talent.

Alekhya simialrly created ballets based on the compositions of Thyagaraja, Annamacharya, Sreenadha and Narayana Teertha and on rare subjects like 'Bhakti Movement in Dance’, conscious of not repeating the same subject.

From her dance institute ‘Trishna’, Alekhya trained many young dancers and she groomed herself into a good teacher, researcher and choreographer. Her Lec-Dems are always looked forward to and, with them, she keeps the spirit, passion and tradition of dance alive.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/f59yws/article30535279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf10alekhya-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30535281.ece
247,2020/01/10,A dance team from Bahrain presents ‘Meluha’,"Meluha, a land of peace and love, is all set to come alive on Sunday at Ganesham. Meluha, a dance drama conceptualised, scripted, choreographed and directed by Vidya Sreekumar, is based on the mythological tale of Shiva and Sati.

The dance piece begins with Nandi recollecting his first encounter with Shiva and leading him to Meluha, a Utopian land. Here, Shiva meets Sati. When Sati dies due to mischief caused by the Nagas, Shiva becomes inconsolable.

And while the last scene of the dance depicts Shiva leaving Meluha with Nandi upon Sati’s death, the story does not end there. “Shiva goes through several more personal transformations. Nandi who observes Shiva’s journey from a common man into a Mahadev, becomes a religious scholar who preaches the aspects of Shiva’s life and philosophy,” says Vidya, who runs Nadana, a dance school in Bahrain.

The dance drama has 32 artistes, most of them students of Vidya’s dance institute performing on stage. Five of them are dance teachers in Bahrain. Meluha has several dance forms, right from Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi to folk dance and contemporary.

“The choice of dance style has been adapted to suit the characters, the emotions and the scenes in Meluha. While the Devi’s steps are graceful, Shiva’s is more masculine. Some characters, like that of the king for example do not have any dance steps as it does not gel with the character,” says Achu Arun Raj, the creative director of the show. Jojo, who plays Dharapati, a Naga, a grey character in the piece, was given training in rope dance by city-based Vijith Vikram, a former student of Daksha Seth.

Vidya admits that the title of the dance drama is inspired by Amish Tripathi’s book series titled The Immortals of Meluha: “I have always liked the depth of love between Shiva and Sati. It took so many years for Shiva to heal from Sati’s death. I have always been fascinated by his agony and pain upon losing Sati.” And while the title might have been inspired by Amish’s series, it was the line Shivoham, Shivoham in Adi Shankaracharya’s Nirvana shatakam that led Vidya to bring Shiva to life. “I started imagining Shiva as a regular person like you and me.”

A student of Kalamandalam Balan and Rekha Ajith for Bharatanatyam and Pallavi Krishnan for Mohiniyattam, Vidya recalls accompanying her Mohiniyattam guru to various shows. “I was fascinated by creative works and the grandeur of the pieces once staged. Never did I imagine that one day, I too would be doing the same,” says the 35-year-old, who has choreographed dance dramas Panchali Swayamvaram, Radhayam and Usha Parinayam in Bahrain.

Cast and crew Meluha has music by Palakkad KL Sreeram with lyrics in Sanskrit by LR Sambath. Smitha Vinod, Neethu Janardhanan, Ashbin Anil, Malavika Sureshkumar, Soorya Prakash, Lekshmi Sree and Jebin Marianelson don the lead roles. The dance drama has been produced by Vinod Das.

Her last work, Kamala: A Ballad of Celestial Love was staged across West Asia and in Thiruvananthapuram. When pointed out that her characters are inspired by Indian mythologies, Vidya says: “That is because the characters and their tales are still relevant in today’s world. You can relate to them.”

Meluha will be staged at Tagore Theatre on January 11, 6.45 pm as the grand finale of the Soorya Festival.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/j8zj7f/article30534128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvmSmitha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/a-dance-team-from-bahrain-presents-meluha/article30534129.ece
248,2020/01/10,Tiruppur City Police to introduce ‘beat system’ to effectively reach the public,"As part of efforts toward community policing, the Tiruppur City Police is set to roll out a dedicated beat system to maximise its reach among the public.

Commissioner of Police Sanjay Kumar said that the beat system will be officially launched by next week, although the preparatory works have been underway since November 2019. Under this system, Tiruppur city will be divided into 22 beats, with two police constables working in shifts for each beat.

“The constables must have at least 200 contacts on their phones from their [respective] beats,” Mr. Kumar said. The constables were advised to build these contacts from the public residing within the beat and form a dedicated WhatsApp group. “Through this, whatever message we send will reach at least 4,400 people,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

Even at the preparatory stage, the response from the public has been positive, with the public offering tip-offs (particularly in ganja cases) and even suggestions through the WhatsApp groups, he said. “This will be the backbone of the policing system,” Mr. Kumar said, with the public functioning as the “extended hands” of the police. “Since we are taking action immediately, we have also [been] able to double the confidence among the public about the police,” Mr. Kumar said.

Regarding crime in 2019, Mr. Kumar said that out of 27 murder cases registered in Tiruppur city last year, 26 have been solved and the accused were remanded in judicial custody. The number of property theft cases decreased by 17% in 2019 in comparison to the previous year, with 252 out of 277 cases being solved and property worth ₹1,51,84,870 being recovered and handed over to the complainants, he said.

Tiruppur city police also seized 118 kg of ganja and 2,322 kg of banned tobacco products in 2019. Mr. Kumar noted that there had been a decrease of 9% in the reporting of crimes against women in comparison with 2018, with convictions in four cases at the Tiruppur Mahila Court. A total of 21 accused arrested for various crimes were detained under the Goondas Act in Tiruppur city last year, according to Mr. Kumar.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tiruppur-city-police-to-introduce-beat-system-to-effectively-reach-the-public/article30533293.ece

Main function

The main function of the cell is to monitor elements distorting communal harmony, besides those engaged in anti-national and terrorism related activities.

The cell is headed by a woman inspector. Six personnel will work under the inspector in the five subdivisions of the rural police namely Perur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karumathampatty, Pollachi and Valparai.

Periyanaickenpalayam subdivision alone, under which communally sensitive Mettupalayam falls, has two officers working for the SIC.

The provision for an SIC was sanctioned by the Director General of Police J.K Tripathy after superintendent of police Sujit Kumar sought the same when the former had come to Coimbatore in July last year.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rural-police-form-special-intelligence-cell/article30527447.ece
250,2020/01/10,"108 ambulances handled 8,905 pregnancy-related cases in 2019","Emergency response services provider GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute) which operates 108 ambulances in collaboration with Tamil Nadu Health Department handled 8,905 pregnancy-related cases in Coimbatore in 2019.

As per the statistics provided by GVK EMRI, its crew of 39 ambulances in Coimbatore handled a total number of 55,423 emergencies in 2019.

As in the past, road traffic accident cases made up a major share of the total number of emergencies with 10, 013 cases. Other emergency cases like fever, acute ailments, poisoning, assault and animal attack etc., constituted rest of the emergencies handled in the year.

“Though the general perception is that 108 ambulances are for accident cases, we attend a wide range of emergencies. The ambulances are equipped with facilities for safe transport of pregnant women and the emergency medial technicians are trained to take care of such cases. Delivery kit is available in every ambulance,” said S. Selvamuthukumar, GVK EMRI’s programme manger for Coimbatore, the Nilgiris and Tiruppur.

The crew has attended safe deliveries on moving ambulances in several cases.

At present, GVK EMRI's fleet of 39 vehicles in Coimbatore comprises 28 basic life support ambulances, two advanced life support ambulances, two neonatal ambulances, three two-wheeler ambulances and four four-wheel drive (4X4) ambulances. All the ambulances are fitted with GPS for accurate tracking and positioning. Of the 176-member crew, 90 are emergency medical technicians and 86 ambulance pilots.

The average response time of the ambulances was reduced from 12.4 minutes in the first half of 2019 to 14 minutes, mainly due to blocks on arterial roads due to construction works.

The response time denotes the time taken by an ambulance to reach the place of emergency after receiving the alert about the emergency from the centralised call centre.

Mr. Selvamuthukumar said that GVK EMRI will soon introduce feeder ambulance service in Coimbatore. They will serve as feeders to normal ambulances to pick patients from hilly and difficult terrains and narrow roads. In addition, mountain rescue stretchers will be provided to the ambulances placed at villages overall state for medial evacuations in extreme environment .

On Tuesday, GVK EMRI and 104 Health Advice Helpline Services gave awareness and first aid training to 30 employees of the power house at Manampathy near Valparai on different types of injuries, snake bite, choking, seizure, burns, sprains and heart attack.

251,2020/01/10,"‘Right mindset, goal-setting vital for facing examinations’","Having the right mindset and setting well-defined goals are essential for school students preparing to face the public examinations, said B. Sampath Kumar, Manager – Training and Development, Only Success Leadership Academy, here on Wednesday.

He was speaking at ‘I Love Exams’ workshop organised by The Hindu in association with Adithya Institutions, Dr. Krishnasamy IAS Academy and Rotary Club of Coimbatore. Mr. Kumar also insisted that students must create daily and weekly study timetables.

Nearly 980 students and 60 teachers in and around Coimbatore city participated in the workshop held at the Adithya Convention Centre, Saravanampatti.

The day-long workshop was held from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

K. Krishnasamy, founder of Dr. Krishnasamy IAS Academy, participated in the workshop and offered advice to the students on dealing with stress and anxiety while preparing for the examinations.

M.N. Manohar, president of Rotary Club of Coimbatore, said that his organisation has initiated projects for school students under the ‘Responsible India Project'’.

252,2020/01/10,Industries get a support with cluster projects,"For the manufacturing sector in Coimbatore, with most of the units in the micro, small and medium-scale sector, cluster programmes have helped bring in the required resources and enabled the industries scale up in terms of volume and quality. After a gap of nearly a decade, the district is all set to get a couple of more clusters - for jewellery and coir units. On the drawing board is a cluster proposal for the valve sector, too.

One of the earliest clusters in the country, implemented for the MSME sector, is for the wet grinder making units in Coimbatore.

President of the COWMA Cluster Services M. Raja said that the cluster, which was implemented in 2006, is relevant even now and the common facilities set up under the project to make stampings and copper wires continue to be used by the industry. “The cluster has benefited with the project as many units were able to grow and be competitive,” he said.

According to a diagnostic study done then about the wet grinder cluster in Coimbatore, the programme could help the units with better technology, create new markets for the products, and enable the industries tap export potential. “We wanted to do product improvement. However, a scheme by the State Government to supply wet grinders free of cost affected the market. Only now is the market picking up. We continue to work on product development,” he said.

“We used to buy stampings for the motor and copper wire from the north Indian sellers then. They determined the price. With financial support extended under the project, we set up modern facilities in Coimbatore to make these products. Even now, we make better quality stampings and copper wires,” he said.

Jayakumar Ramdass, president of Coimbatore Industrial Infrastructure Association (COINDIA), clusters can be vertical or horizontal depending on the profile of the participating units. “It need not be a government initiative. A group of industries can come together to share knowledge, discuss challenges and arrive at solutions. We had three clusters at SIEMA to share knowledge and the government supported it,” he said.

Cluster projects are needed in places that have manufacturing facilities. Not all units can invest in technology or machinery and common facilities can be created for these units through the projects.

The member industries will not have financial burden, such as repayment of loans, while using the facilities and can thus improve quality, he adds.

Cluster programme for a sector should be planned for 10 years. The leadership of the cluster is critical as it involves a lot of time to make the project successful, he says. “Every cluster member of COINDIA has scaled up.” The association has submitted a ₹10 crore proposal to scale up the cluster, he said.

B. Karthigaivasan, General Manager of District Industries Centre, Coimbatore, says cluster proposals are studied in details by officials in the State and Central Governments before these are approved. Diagnostic study and detailed project reports are prepared and only then is the project given a final shape. Further, the aim of a cluster is to make the common facilities sustainable in five years. The participating units should be able to make the facilities profitable so that the infrastructure is upgraded regularly to meet the changing needs. There are several schemes with the Government that provide financial support to clusters even if it does not involve creation of common facilities, he said.

An exporter in the engineering sector said most of the manufacturing activities in the country is in the MSME sector and these are mostly family owned.

The units need support to improve technology and build capacities. Cluster programmes do help the MSMEs in adopting better technology.

The Government should look at bringing in international expertise and knowledge to these clusters by involving international organisations.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pr47yx/article30527430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB10-KK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/industries-get-a-support-with-cluster-projects/article30527431.ece

Addressing mediapersons, he cited Article 8 of the Constitution, which deals with the rights of citizenship “of certain persons of Indian origin residing outside India”. “It is the duty of the State government to insist on dual citizenship,” Mr. Veeramani said.

The DK leader accused the Central government of attempting to “brazenly implement the RSS agenda” through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens. He condemned the lack of arrests by the police following the mob attack at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

255,2020/01/10,Residents demand action against quarry,"Residents of Ellampalayam and villages nearby demanded that the district administration should take action against a quarry functioning in their area.

The villagers alleged that the quarry indulged in indiscriminate mining. Groundwater level had been affected and it had caused significant air and water pollution in the area.

The villagers said that over five crushers were being operated in the area round the clock. Due to lack of sufficient water, agriculture had severely been affected.

P.Ramesh of the village said that the quarry had been functioning there for over 10 years and the problems intensified only in the last couple of years. Due to shortage of river sand for construction, intensive mining was done in the area to meet demands for M-Sand and P-Sand.

The villagers alleged that because of the use of explosives beyond permissible limit, cracks had appeared in their houses. “The dust from the quarry spreads over the crops. Despite holding talks with quarry operators, there has not been any change in their approach. There are houses within 300 m of the quarry,” the villager said.

256,2020/01/10,Dwindling number of migratory birds at Nanjarayan tank worries birders,"As Nanjarayan tank sees the annual visit of migratory birds, nature enthusiasts and bird watchers express concern over the apparent reduction in the number of species of birds over the years.

According to K. Ravindran, president of Nature Society of Tiruppur, a total of 79 species were recorded as on December 31, 2019. “The maximum number of species we have recorded is 147,” he said. Some of these birds that visit the tank, including Bar-headed geese from Russia and Mongolian regions, cannot be found anywhere else in Tiruppur, Coimbatore and Erode districts, Mr. Ravindran claimed.

The 440-acre Nanjarayan tank, which is also known as Sarkar Periyapalayam reservoir, is located in the outskirts of Tiruppur city near Koolipalayam. Mr. Ravindran said that the Public Works Department (PWD) officials carried out desilting works in the tank in 2015 and set up a sewage treatment plant to treat polluted water from River Nallar. These developmental activities led to the depletion of mudflats (sediment deposits) and water pollution in the tank, making it less conducive for the migratory birds. “The Nanjarayan tank is at least 800 years old,” he said, noting that birds have been visiting this tank for centuries.

Duck varieties such as Northern Shovelers, Garganey, Northern Pintails and Common Teal were spotted in December. Other birds spotted at the tank include Marsh Sandpiper, Common Greenshank, Green Sandpiper, Kentish Plover, Temminck’s Stints and Black-tailed Godwits, Mr. Ravindran said. The period of visit for the migratory birds is between October and March, with the ‘peak season’ being December to February.

Environmentalist and coordinator of NGO ‘Plastic-Free Tiruppur’ R. Nanthakumar said that the lack of adequate trees around the tank might also be a reason for the dip in the number of migratory birds. “The seemai karuvelam (Prosopis juliflora) trees around the tank were removed before other trees that were planted could grow,” he said.

When contacted, an official from the Forest Department said that a proposal to convert Nanjarayan tank into a bird conservation reserve was sent to the State government. “We are awaiting the consideration and allocation of funds from the government,” the official said. The forest official added that the Forest Department will officially enumerate the number of birds in Nanjarayan tank by the end of January.

Regarding the sewage treatment plant, a PWD official said that the plant has a capacity of 1.5 MLD (millions of litre per day) and it is yet to become operational. “We have written to the State government asking for funds for its operation,” the PWD official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/6gzf7e/article30527389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09BAR-HEADEDGEESE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dwindling-number-of-migratory-birds-at-nanjarayan-tank-worries-birders/article30527390.ece
257,2020/01/10,Ranji Trophy | Heavyweights face off in crunch match,"A Tamil Nadu-Mumbai match in Ranji Trophy is considered one of the marquee clashes in Indian domestic cricket. Come Saturday, yet another such clash is upon us at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium here.

The teams are far from where they would want to be after two defeats and not a lot of points on the board in the race for a place in the knockouts.

The home team comes into the game with just four points from as many games and needs to win almost all the remaining four games to progress.

A good thing, though, for TN is that the team is almost at full strength with the return of R. Ashwin, Dinesh Karthik, Abhinav Mukund and B. Indrajith, playing his first match for the State in nearly 10 months after shoulder surgery. Speaking on Friday, coach D. Vasu said the team had made a turn-around in its last game against UP in Kanpur taking the first innings lead in a close low-scoring encounter and is ready to go for the kill.

“We have to go for outright wins in every game, otherwise, we have no chance of qualifying.”

Following defeats in its last two games (vs Railways and Karnataka), things have gotten tougher for Mumbai with key players, including in-form skipper Suryakumar Yadav and Ajinkya Rahane, missing due to National duties, while Prithvi Shaw injured his shoulder in the last game.

Senior players like Aditya Tare, who leads the side in Suryakumar’s absence, and Siddhesh Lad have struggled to get runs and would need to step up, given that it’s a young team.

The way forward

Tare said, “We have our backs against the wall. The only way forward is to play aggressive and positive cricket. For all the young players to come and play in the situation, it is going to test our character.”

While Mumbai is better placed with one win and five games in hand, the home team will hold a slight edge thanks to the return of senior players.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/r4o3ty/article30537251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11TN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-heavyweights-face-off-in-crunch-match/article30537252.ece
258,2020/01/10,West Indies vs Ireland | Thrilling win for Windies,"Sheldon Cottrell blasted a six off the penultimate ball to give the West Indies a thrilling one-wicket victory over Ireland in the second One-Day International at Kensington Oval on Thursday.

Cottrell, best known for his fast bowling where wickets are celebrated with a flamboyant military salute, carted Mark Adair over cover for the winning runs as the home side lived on their nerves to finish on 242 for nine.

Victory gave the West Indies a 2-0 lead in the three-game series after winning the opener at the same ground on Tuesday by five wickets.

Despite Cottrell’s headline-stealing flourish, it was fellow tail-ender Hayden Walsh who was the team’s saviour.

In just his seventh one-dayer, Walsh, who started his international career last year playing for the United States, finished undefeated on 46.

“We are relieved about the win, we all put in the effort,” said West Indies Man of the Match Alzarri Joseph who took four wickets for the second game in a row as well as hitting a valuable 16 runs in a ninth-wicket stand with Walsh.

“We wanted to bat sensibly and get to the score.

“The win means a lot to everyone, but it’s not finished, we have one game to go.” West Indies had been cruising at 140 for three at one stage in pursuit of a 238-run target.

However, a brief rain delay played havoc with its composure and three quick wickets fell for just eight runs.

Nicholas Pooran (52) and skipper Kieron Pollard (40) were dismissed without adding to their scores following the interruption having put on 64 for the fourth wicket.

Pooran made his runs off 44 balls with six fours as the higly-rated left-hander completed a sixth ODI half-century.

He was clean-bowled by off-spinner Simi Singh with the score on 140.

Pollard played a captain’s role, making 40 off 32 balls with two boundaries and four giant sixes.

The 32-year-old fell to a fine caught-and-bowled by Barry McCarthy for the addition of two further runs.

Khary Pierre (18), in only his third ODI, helped Walsh steady the ship in a 52-run partnership for the eighth wicket.

Earlier, opening batsman Paul Stirling top-scored with 63 as Ireland put up a challenging 237 for nine off 50 overs on a wearing pitch.

Stirling hit seven boundaries and one six as he claimed his 24th ODI half-century.

Pace bowler Joseph finished with four for 32, identical figures from the first game, and also took two catches.

He claimed the wickets of Stirling as well as the dangerous Kevin O’Brien (31) in an impressive spell.

The third and final game is Sunday in Grenada.

The scores: Ireland 237/9 in 50 overs (P. Stirling 63, S. Singh 34, A. Joseph 4/32, Cottrell 3/51) lost to West Indies 242/9 in 49.5 overs (N. Pooran 52, H. Walsh 46 n.o., K. Pollard 40; S.

Chasing 132 in the final played at the Barabati Stadium, opener Shafali smashed 89 from just 45 balls, with 15 fours and 2 sixes, as India-C crossed the line with 28 balls to spare.

Earlier, India-B posted 131 for six in its allotted 20 overs after electing to bat. Pooja Vastakar’s late cameo (43 not out, 22 balls) helped the team put up a respectable total. Vastrakar provided the much-needed impetus to the stuttering innings. She hit three fours and as many sixes.

Manali Dakshini was the pick of the bowlers for India-C as she returned with figures of three for 15 while Dayalan Hemalatha and Rajeshwari Gaekwad scalped one wicket each.

India C, led by Veda Krishnamurthy, didn’t have any hiccups as the 15-year-old Shafali from Haryana made light work of the total.

You have guys like (Jasprit) Bumrah who can move the ball… you have the consistency of (Ravindra) Jadeja, (Yuzvendra) Chahal, Kuldeep (Yadav), so you can’t take the challenges lightly. You have to be prepared with your own gameplan to take them on,” Finch said on Friday.

“At the end of the day, it’s international cricket, you can’t take anything lightly. You can’t put more emphasis on one over the other, otherwise you can find yourself coming up pretty short,” the captain said.

The last ODI series against India had also made Finch realise that in India the players need to really stick to the basics.

“A lot of the time you can get caught up in worrying about things that aren’t all that relevant. At the end of the day, all you have to do is stick to the basics. We have seen that in these conditions,” Finch said.

“The pleasing thing from the last tour was how we were able to come back from 0-2 down to win 3-2. That made a really big statement. Once you get behind in the series, you don’t give up, you keep chipping in one game at a time and try to get back in to the series bit by bit,” he said.

Coming to India on the back of Test series wins against Pakistan and New Zealand, Finch said: “One big challenge is to continue winning and keep improving, especially in the away conditions.

“Most teams in the world are now comfortable playing at home. For us, to go away and continue to win and challenge the best teams in the world on a regular basis is really important,” Finch said.

Focus on Agar

With spin likely to play a key role, Australia is also pinning its hopes on left-arm spinner Ashton Agar.

“The package that he brings with his batting and left-arm spin is going to be really important. He is someone we are hoping can fill the role of an all-rounder more often.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/m05771/article30537126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11OZ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-vs-india-the-aussies-arrive-with-a-set-strategy/article30537127.ece
261,2020/01/10,India vs Australia | Finch eager to see Bumrah-Labuschagne duel,"Australia captain Aaron Finch expects an exciting contest between Jasprit Bumrah and Marnus Labuschagne during the three-match ODI tour of India.

“Yes that (contest) is going to be exciting. The improvement we have seen in Marcus’ game over the last 12 months has been huge and that has been reflected in his scores and the impact that he is having in Tests,” Finch said on Friday.

Exciting player

The in-form Labuschagne is set to make his ODI debut. The 25-year-old Labuschagne recently moved up to third spot in the ICC Test batsman rankings.

“He takes enough time to refresh and recharge his batteries, because playing here can be tough. He will be ready to go and no doubt. He is an exciting player, one who just keeps getting the job done all the time,” Finch said.

The Australia captain was also all praise for Bumrah — who returned to the Indian team for the T20I series against Sri Lanka after nearly six months.

“He (Bumrah) is obviously a fantastic bowler and someone who, when you are not playing against him, you love watching bowl. He is fast and aggressive and his execution is pretty spot-on. More and more guys face him, the more exposure you get, the more you start to understand how he bowls,” Finch said.

While the focus is on the Bumrah-Labuschagne battle, Australia’s senior assistant coach Andrew McDonald — who is in-charge of the team for the India series — is also looking forward to a good show by Josh Hazlewood, who is back in the side after an injury.

Shaping up well

McDonald said Hazlewood was shaping up well after the hamstring injury. He had played a couple of BBL games for Sydney Sixes and come through “really well”.

“If you look at Hazlewood’s ODI record over a period of time, it is outstanding. He comes back in and we have got some other quicks there…” the coach said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5mz5pz/article30537105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11LABU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-australia-finch-eager-to-see-bumrah-labuschagne-duel/article30537106.ece
262,2020/01/10,"IND vs SL third T20I: Rahul, Dhawan and bowlers deliver","India’s middle-order ensured that the solid foundation laid by K.L. Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan didn’t go waste as Kohli’s men overwhelmed Sri Lanka by 78 runs in the final T20I and seal a 2-0 in the three-match series here on Friday.

Despite a stutter in the middle, when it lost four wickets in 13 balls, India dominated right from the start after being asked to bat first.

With the hosts making three changes — Manish Pandey, Sanju Samson and Yuzvendra Chahal coming in for Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant and Kuldeep Yadav — Rahul and Dhawan had to fire at the top. And the duo did just that once Dhawan was given a reprieve by Dasun Shanaka at deep square-leg when he was on one.

Rahul got going with a cover drive and a punch off Angelo Mathews’ gentle medium-pace in the second over before sweeping Dhananjaya de Silva over the square-leg fence in the fourth.

Exquisite strokes

Having raced past his partner, Rahul was soon joined by Dhawan, whose extraordinary whip off Lasith Malinga’s final ball of the fifth over was truly breathtaking; so was Kohli’s straight six off Mathews in the 17th over.

Between those two shots came Sri Lanka’s best passage of play. At 97 for no loss in the 11th over, and with Rahul and Dhawan in no mood to relent, Pandey and Samson were in danger of getting an opportunity to bat.

However, the two Sri Lankan wrist-spinners — chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan and leggie Wanindu Hasaranga — struck at regular intervals as India slipped to 122 for four in the 13th over.

Dhawan swept Sandakan straight to deep mid-wicket, giving Samson a chance to emerge from the dugout. The Kerala stylist stroked the first ball he faced over long-off for a six, but was trapped in front off the next — a googly from Hasaranga. Sandakan then surprised Rahul with a wrong ’un and wicketkeeper Kusal Perera whipped the bails off. Two deliveries later, Shreyas Iyer offered a return catch to Sandakan after hitting his first ball for four.

Kohli resurrected the innings with a 42-run partnership off 28 balls with Pandey before misjudging a second run and falling short of the crease. Pandey and Shardul then ensured India crossed the 200-run mark, the latter employing the long handle yet again.

Falling apart

Once India put on a gargantuan 201 for six — above-par even on a flat deck at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium — the fate of the Sri Lankans was all but sealed. The visitors couldn’t really give the 34,000-odd turnout a thrilling finish as the top-order departed in no time.

It was left to the experienced Mathews and the energetic Dhananjaya de Silva to repair the innings after the Indian pace triuo of Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini had reduced the team to 26 for four.

Mathews was severe on Washington, hammering the bowler for sixes before holing out to long-on off the same bowler with Pandey taking a superb running catch. Dhananjaya went on to complete a half-century — his second in T20Is — but that was not enough on a day when the islanders were thoroughly outclassed.

263,2020/01/10,Chris Gayle finds Pakistan one of the safest places in world,"Big-hitting West Indies batsman Chris Gayle has endorsed Pakistan as “one of the safest places” in the world, weeks after Test cricket returned to the country after a decade.

No Test-playing nation had visited Pakistan since the 2009 terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus near Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.

Last month, it was the Sri Lankan national team, albeit a weakened one, that became the first elite side team to tour the country since that attack almost a decade ago.

When Gayle was asked if Pakistan is a safe country for cricket during the Bangladesh Premier League, he responded, “Pakistan is one of the safest places right now in the world. They say you will get presidential security so you are in good hands. I mean we are in good hands too in Bangladesh, right?”

Gayle is currently playing for Chattogram Challengers in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).

Sri Lanka’s visit prompted an optimistic Pakistan Cricket Board to invite Bangladesh for three T20Is and two Tests.

The BCB, however, is yet to take a call on the tour after their proposal of playing half the matches of the series in Bangladesh was turned down.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/iiozs6/article27704166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHRISGAYLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gayle-finds-pakistan-one-of-the-safest-places-in-world/article30533279.ece
264,2020/01/10,1-year-old undergoes rare liver transplant surgery in Gurugram hospital,"A 14-hour rare liver graft transplant surgery was performed on a one-year-old girl from Saudi Arabia at Artemis Hospital in Sector 51 here. Baby Fatima (name changed) underwent the living donor liver transplant, where only 1 out of 8 portions of the liver was used to provide a new liver to her.

The surgery called Monosegment (Segment 3) living donor liver transplant is the first such case reported in Delhi-NCR, in which mono-segmented liver graft has been used, the hospital said.

“Apart from this, the use of bovine jugular vein in liver transplant has been reported for the first time in the world, to provide an inflow of blood to the newly transplanted liver as the baby was born with absence of bile ducts and under developed portal vein,” said a statement issued by the hospital.

Managing the child during such a long surgery was a tedious and tricky task for the doctors.

Born as the third child to her parents, Fatima suffered from unusually prolonged and deep jaundice for months after her birth. Doctors in Saudi Arabia diagnosed her with a rare disease called biliary atresia which is found in 1 in 16,000 live births. The developments of bile ducts in such children are absent.

265,2020/01/10,Locals seek withdrawal of controversial land Bill,"A few local residents held a silent protest in front of Town Hall in Civil Lines here on Thursday seeking the withdrawal of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) Amendment Bill, 2019.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was attending a grievance redressal meeting inside the Town Hall at that time.

“We are here to convey to our Chief Minister that we have elected this government to work for the welfare of the citizens. The PLPA Amendment Bill 2019 passed in the State assembly in February 2019 goes against the interests of the citizens and it needs to be withdrawn in the next Assembly session,” said Sarika Verma, a protester.

The protesters sought the protection of the forests. They were holding placards, some of which read: “Protectors becoming Destroyers. Aravali Bachao”, “Hamare Jungle Se Buri Nazar Hatao ” and “Pragati=Van (Development is equal to forests)”.

The Supreme Court had put a stay on the PLPA Amendment Bill on March 1, 2019, after the Haryana State Assembly had cleared it in February last year but a reply to an RTI application last month revealed that the Haryana Governor subsequently gave his approval to controversial bill which seeks to open 33% of the forest cover in the State for real estate development.

The protesters said Haryana already has the lowest forest cover in the country, a mere 3.59% and if the bill was notified by the government, then 60,000 acres of Aravallis in south Haryana and 10,000 acres in the Shivaliks would be concretised. Since another 50,000 acres of the Aravallis are not even protected under any forest law, it is feared that the entire Aravallis would be destroyed if this Bill was notified.

‘Violation of SC order’

Vaishali Chandra Rana, another protester, said: “The government is currently in violation of the Supreme Court orders. Instead of demolishing the illegal constructions on PLPA protected Aravallis, the government is trying to legalise them by opening our forests for the builder mafia through this Amendment Bill. This Bill comes into force from November 1, 1966, the date of formation of the Haryana, thus nullifying all actions under the Punjab Land Preservation Act since 1966 making the Act totally redundant in Haryana.”

Anuradha Prasad Dhawan said the Aravallis are the lungs of the National Capital Region and “act as natural barriers protecting us from the sandstorms coming in from the Thar”. If the Aravallis were destroyed, NCR cities would turn into a dust bowl, she added.

Prem Singh Tanwar and Rajbir Singh, both from villages in the Gwal Pahadi area, said: “A lot of illegal encroachments have come upon the Aravalli forest areas and water bodies. How will the groundwater get recharged with all these illegal constructions coming up? We have complained to the authorities but nothing has been done.”

“Aravalli forests cover less than 10% of Gurugram and south Haryana and less than 2% of the entire State. As citizens, we demand that the PLPA Amendment Bill is withdrawn and the Aravallis is protected under law so we can leave this natural heritage for our future generations,” said Neelam Ahluwalia.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jj0qe5/article30535480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09FOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/locals-seek-withdrawal-of-controversial-land-bill/article30535482.ece

Additional Chief Additional Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja framed the charges against the politician under section 499 and 500 (related to criminal defamation) of Indian Penal Code.

The court accepted the arguments advanced by advocate Vijay Aggarwal, the counsel for Zee Media, that there was enough evidence against Ms. Moitra to put her on trial.

The offence of defamation provides a simple imprisonment which may extent up to two years.

The court had on December 17 granted bail to the politician on a personal bond of ₹20,000, after she appeared before it in pursuance to the summons issued against her.

The court had earlier asked the parties whether there was possibility of settlement between the parties.

The suggestion was, however, denied by Moitra who said they had a “substantive” case separately going on in another court.

Zee News filed a defamation complaint against Moitra for allegedly making statements against the channel to the media.

The alleged defamatory statements against the channel were made by the MP while she was speaking to reporters on allegations against her.

Prior to that, Ms. Moitra had filed a criminal defamation complaint against Zee News and its editor-in-chief, Sudhir Chaudhary, in connection with a show aired by it on one of her speeches delivered in Parliament.

The application, in the form of a handwritten letter, was mentioned before a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar which declined to give any relief.

The letter, written by Tushar Sehdev and Raman Kalra, said the route from Delhi to U.P., Delhi to Uttarakhand, Delhi to Noida hospitals, Ashram and Badarpur is unavailable due to this protest as the roads around Shaheen Bagh are blocked and vehicles are being diverted to the DND flyway.

The letter claimed that lakhs of people are suffering because of the road closure and it is also an issue for people facing emergencies.

It claimed that protesters have put barricades and heavy stones on the sides of the roads and are not allowing even pedestrians to pass.

It alleged that the protesters have damaged road dividers and other public properties installed on the roads which iscausing loss to the government exchequer.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the CPCB to carry out the study with the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.

Pyrolysis is a method of recycling old tyres through a thermochemical treatment under high temperature to produce industrial oil and other matters.

The directions came after the apex pollution control body informed the tribunal that according to an action taken report from respective State pollution control boards, currently there are 678 tyre pyrolysis units in 19 States.

272,2020/01/10,Court asks bank to recover car loan from defaulter,"In an ex-parte judgment, a Delhi court has allowed a public sector bank to recover a car loan of ₹5.65 lakh from a borrower.

The borrower had taken a loan of ₹6 lakh from the bank to buy a car by hypothecating the vehicle to it. However, after paying a few EMIs, he stopped repayment.

The bank filed a recover suit after the borrower took no note of the legal notice served on him. The court issued a notice to the borrower on taking cognisance of the case.

Lakshmi was in news a few months ago when she was allegedly taken away by the mahout before Delhi police rescued her and took to a forest shelter.

Jagadesh Kumar had on Tuesday said: “Let the police investigate into it, let the facts come to the front and then we will know what exactly happened. We must not add additional versions of what is going around and cause further confusion.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-forms-panel-to-look-into-violence/article30528474.ece
275,2020/01/10,Police got order from ‘above’ to let violence happen: CM,"AAP national convener and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, in an allusion to JNU without naming the university, alleged that the Delhi Police got “orders from above” to let violence happen and let the attackers escape and then only enter the campus.

“Whatever cycle of events happening now is not the Delhi Police’s fault... If constables are told ‘let violence happen, do not enter inside, stay outside’. How can they go inside? They will be suspended,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a press conference.

“They [police] get order from above, ‘let violence happen and after that let them escape and then only enter inside’. So they do that,” he said.

There have been allegations that the police waited outside the gates of JNU, while a masked mob attacked students and teachers on Sunday night.

Delhi Police is under the ambit of the Lt. Governor, who is appointed by the Central government, and is not under the Delhi government.

The Chief Minister said that the Delhi Police is functioning along the same lines of the BJP-run municipal corporations. “There are 90% chances that the complaint will not be filed by the police in case of an emergency. You all have witnessed the attitude of Delhi Police in the last few days when the law and order situation in the State was grave,” he added.

Delhi Police’s reaction

When asked for a comment, additional PRO of Delhi Police, Anil Mittal said: “Delhi Police has all along been a professional force and handles situations professionally as per its legal mandate. It is absolutely incorrect to say that it acts under any pressure and also to suggest that complaints are not registered at police stations. There is a well established mechanism to address complaints, including women help desks and public facilitation officers.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sblj1h/article30528472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-got-order-from-above-to-let-violence-happen-cm/article30528473.ece
276,2020/01/10,AQI inches closer to ‘satisfactory’,"The overall air quality of the city was in the lower end of “poor” category on Thursday, only a few notches above “satisfactory” level, according to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

“The high surface winds and ventilation are likely to continue for the next two days. The AQI is forecast to be at the higher end of poor to lower end of very poor category on Friday,” said SAFAR.

On Thursday, the average level of PM 2.5 — deadly respirable particles — was (78.9 ug/m3) more than the safe limit (60ug/m3) as per Indian standards, in Delhi and NCR at 9 p.m., according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But the level is more than three times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) set by the WHO.

The city’s AQI on Thursday was 203, down from Wednesday’s 266, according to the 4 p.m. bulletin of the CPCB, which is the average of the last 24 hours.

“The SAFAR model suggests marginal deterioration in air quality and in the “very poor” category by January 11. Further deterioration towards the middle of the “very poor” category is expected by January 12,” SAFAR said.

Friday’s top three air pollution hotspots are likely to be Vinobapuri, Vasundhara and Sahibabad, according to SAFAR.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aqi-inches-closer-to-satisfactory/article30528469.ece
277,2020/01/10,"Students contest V-C’s statement, call it a bid to put pressure on them","Contesting the Vice-Chancellor’s statement that 3,300 students had made payments for online registrations in the current semester, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), present on the campus on Thursday, argued that it was an attempt to put pressure on the student community.

All the students The Hindu met said that they were boycotting the registrations in support of the students’ union which was holding demonstrations at the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).

“Only a few students who are with the ABVP have registered themselves to get into the V-C’s good books,” alleged Durlabh Sahoo, a PhD student at the School of International Studies

“The V-C is inflating the numbers by adding those who have paid their hostel fees,” he said. Others such as Mohamed Arif, an MPhil Urdu scholar, claimed that an internal student survey had shown that only about 1,100 students had registered.

Durlabh argued that the V-C was attempting to put pressure on the student community through such statements so that those who were boycotting registrations stop doing so out of fear of adverse consequences.

Confusion prevails

“We get calls from students, who have gone back home, every day asking us whether registrations have started. There is so much confusion,” said Sibtin Raza, an MA student, who said that he was still on the campus for the same reason.

“We don’t know about our exams either. If registrations take place, then exams will be called at any time. So we are constantly preparing for exams,” he added.

Commenting on the effect of the entire imbroglio on studies, students such as Vinod Kumar, a PhD scholar at the School of International Studies (SIS), said that students were studying themselves.

However, concerns over the increased fees remain among students. Sachidananda Naiq, a PhD Sanskrit scholar who said that he is politically “leaned towards” the ABVP, lamented that if various utility charges were imposed, then the programme would be unaffordable for him.

“I am considering to take up a part time job to supplement my income. But to do a job and to carry on my research would be very hard,” he said.

Students here said that there was no clarity on what kind of increase would take place. ""They had only removed the medical charge, but we are worried whether they will add other utility charges later on. There are rumours that the fees will be hiked by 10% every semester after that,” said Durlabh.

Students said that while the campus was calm now there was an apprehension that it had become unsafe for students with some taking safety precautions.

Arif, a resident of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh said: “One of the reasons why I haven’t gone home is because there is a fear that someone might attack me there.. but my family says I am not safe here either.” He now sleeps with the lights on at night.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-contest-v-cs-statement-call-it-a-bid-to-put-pressure-on-them/article30528468.ece
278,2020/01/10,‘JNU’s character has changed since current V-C took charge’,"Scores of students from JNU assembled outside the HRD Ministry since late afternoon on Thursday, demanding JNU Vice-Chancellor’s resignation and safe university spaces. Thousands, including ordinary citizens, students and professors from various universities, participated in the march.

Stating that the “character of JNU has changed since the current V-C’s joining, Sana Khan, a Ph.D scholar in the university said: “When I joined JNU 10 years ago for my M.A. course, JNU was a space where one could have debates and students from various classes mingled with each other. It was a place which helped us break stereotypes. Suddenly the entire character of the university has changed with the V-C bringing in all kinds of restrictions.”

JNU student Sohini Dasgupta, who was seen carrying a blank poster, said: “We have so much to say that it cannot fit in one poster. While the fee hike should be revoked completely, the V-C should immediately step down. This is an issue which is affecting thousands of students. If students don’t speak up, then who will?”

‘Political agenda’

Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar said: “The Home Minister keeps referring to the “tukde tukde gang”. I want to tell him that I own the term proudly. Desh ko todne ka jo sapna hain unka, uska tukde tukde kadenge hum desh ko bachakar. Besides this, the V-C has to be removed. Despite being the head of the institution, he has not met any of the injured faculty members and students. It is clear that he has come here with a political agenda.”

Saket Sonkar, another JNU student added, “The administration with the V-C being the head has completely failed the students. He has not done anything to restore normalcy. Until and unless they rollback this manual and pass a new resolution in a democratic manner we will continue protesting.”

Leaders join students

Several political leaders and activists also addressed the gathering.

CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said, “No resignation, he (V-C) has to be removed. For three hours he allowed rampage inside the campus despite the police being outside. They were only called when it was over. This can only mean that the V-C is also complicit in the incident.”

Activist Anjali Bharadwaj said, “This government does not believe in any form of dialogue. People are fighting against CAA, NRC and V-C, opposing the violence across the campuses. But what we are seeing is a non-responsive government unwilling to take on board opinion, which is critical in a democracy.”

DCP’s contention

Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said: “A gathering of JNU students and teachers marched from Mandi House to MHRD, Shastri Bhawan via Rajendra Prasad Road. A delegation of nine persons, including teachers, went to meet JS, MHRD. The gathering remained peaceful till they were in the meeting.”

“However, when the delegation came out after the meeting, one of the student leaders provoked the gathering to move towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. They stopped the normal traffic at Rajendra Prasad Road and some of them tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhavan,” he said.

“They were prevented from doing so. In the process, 11 people were detained and they were subsequently released,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/x726fd/article30528456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnus-character-has-changed-since-current-v-c-took-charge/article30528458.ece

Two of them were out on bail in a Hindu Munnani leader K.P. Suresh Kumar’s murder case, they said.

DCP (Special Cell) P.S. Kushwah said the accused have been identified as Khaja Moideen (52), Syed Ali Navas (32) and Abdul Samad (28), all from Tamil Nadu. The police said they received a tip-off about the trio who had allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS. “We were informed that they had entered east U.P through Nepal and might move towards Delhi-NCR to carry out a terror strike,” Mr. Kushwah said, adding that it was learnt that the persons were sent to Delhi by their foreign-based handlers.

The police said they were also informed that the accused had taken a room on rent and procured arms and ammunition. A trap was then laid near Wazirabad Bridge and the three men were nabbed from the spot.

“Moideen has links with ISIS. After being released on conditional bail in the murder case of Suresh, he made planned to revive the ISIS network in India through his co-associates,” Mr. Kushwah said.

285,2020/01/10,Tiwari flags off mega bike rally against JNU violence,"Bharatiya Janata Party State chief Manoj Tiwari flagged-off a mega bike rally from the party’s office here on Thursday against recent violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University.

He said the JNU incident was the “misuse” of the youth by opposition parties to “push their agenda”.

Rally diverted due to stir

The “Vijay Abhiyan Sankalp Rally” was scheduled to pass through Mandi House, Kashmiri Gate and Britannia Chowk but was, however, diverted to bypass Mandi House owing to a march by students and teachers in the area, said Delhi BJP media relations head Neelkant Bakshi.

BJP MPs Harsh Vardhan, Gautam Gambhir, Parvesh Verma and Meenakshi Lekhi took part in different legs of the rally, which Mr. Tiwari termed “historic and perhaps the biggest bike rally in the Capital so far”.

“This rally was against the rumour being spread among the youth over Citizenship (Amendment) Act and their misuse by political parties,” Mr. Tiwari, who had BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel as his pillion rider, said. “When the zeal and power of youth decide to maintain the unity and integrity of the country then no one can damage it. But, the frustrated opposition parties are trying to push the youth into anarchy for its electoral gain,” he added. Mr. Goel said the rally had signalled “the political farewell” of the Kejriwal government in Delhi.

“When such a large number of youth give their political support then it becomes clear that the Kejriwal government is an obstruction to the development of Delhi. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the works will progress at double speed in Delhi and I am confident that BJP will form a government here,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tiwari-flags-off-mega-bike-rally-against-jnu-violence/article30528247.ece

288,2020/01/10,"CM compares work done by Delhi govt., civic bodies","AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday presented a report — BJP’s civic bodies model vs govt. model —, saying the BJP has turned the city into “garbage capital of India”.

Mr. Kejriwal said there are two models of governance in front of the people of Delhi. “I hope that the people will cast their votes based on the good governance model of AAP in Delhi,” he said.

“Delhi’s children say that MCD’s full form is ‘Most Corrupt Department’,” he said. The BJP’s “biggest gift” to Delhi is the landfill in Ghazipur, he added.

“There are open garbage dumping grounds and heaps of waste in every nook and corner of the city. This is a matter of shame for Delhi, which secures the bottom position in the BJP’s Swachh Bharat Mission. The Centre in December 2019 had rated Delhi’s civic bodies at bottom 10 of the 49 largest cities for cleanliness,” he said.

The report also compares the work done by AAP and BJP in education, health among other sectors. “The garbage and waste mountain in Ghazipuris expected to cross the height of the Taj Mahal. According to the Supreme Court, the landfill will have to be marked with red lights to warn airplanes,” he added.

He said data shows that only 17 of the 230 engineers in the north civic body do not have a chargesheet filed against them.

Full statehood

“People of Delhi want full statehood so that there is only one government in the city. It is not Kejriwal’s demand,” he said when asked why “full statehood” is not a main agenda for the party.

“Today people have chosen us, tomorrow it could be some other party, in the next five years or 10 years... Whichever party people chose, in democracy, all powers should be with them, which is not there today.

BJP State chief Manoj Tiwari and south Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri addressed a joint press conference where they sought to place “questions being asked by the people of Delhi” to Mr. Kejriwal, seeking to expose the “claims” of AAP through the exhibition of videos and tweets illustrating broken roads, waterlogging, roadside filth and schoolchildren “endangering their lives while crossing open drain”.

“Even after five years, he is avoiding talking about the achievements of his government and running away from the people. This is a jhadu government not a government that performs. In order to cover reality, Kejriwal talks about irrelevant things but does not talk about water supply, DTC buses, pollution, lack of colleges, flyovers and roads,” Mr. Tiwari said.

He said the government has to pay ₹7,712 crore to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, ₹1,938 crore to the East body and ₹3,763 crore to the North body.

In order to paralyze the civic bodies out of “political malice”, the Kejriwal government had not been releasing funds to the civic bodies due to which the people of Delhi are not being provided several “amenities”, he alleged.

‘One question daily’

“Has Kejriwal admitted that he has no answer to the questions being raised against his government? Out of the questions being raised by the people, we will ask him one question per day,” Mr. Tiwari said.

“Today’s question is why has Kejriwal concealed ₹20,000 crore due to the civic bodies like a thief?

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said there were some “specific imputations” in the statement which were not appropriate.

The court also refused to endorse a draft statement placed before it on behalf of the AAP convener. It remarked that there cannot be an endorsement from the court on what one can say.

Next hearing

The court, however, did not pass any order in the case. The counsel appearing for Mr. Kejriwal sought an adjournment in the post-lunch session. The court will hear the case on April 24 next.

Mr. Kejriwal had challenged the Election Commission’s two orders of 2017, one censuring him for his remarks with a warning that a repeat of the same would lead to action against him and his party and the second directing lodging of an FIR against him for his comments. The Chief Minister, had during a series of rallies in Goa during 2017 elections, asked voters to “accept money from the Congress and BJP candidates but vote for AAP”.

292,2020/01/10,"Krishna, virtue personified","Noted spiritual orator Samavedam Shanmukha Sarma delivered a series of discourses for over a week on ‘Bharathamlo Bhagavatham’ at an programme conducted jointly by TTD’s Hindu Dharma Prachara Parishat (HDPP) and the Tirupati branch of Rushi Peetham Satsangam, at Mahati auditorium in Tirupati recently.

Dwelling mostly on ‘Moola Bharatham’, the original text of Veda Vyasa, and taking excerpts from various Telugu texts written by Nannaya, Thikkana and also from Pothana’s Bhagavatham, Shanmukha Sarma called Sri Krishna as the embodiment of righteousness. Quoting the most-referred one-liner, he said: “Where there is Krishna, there is righteousness and wherever there is righteousness, there is success”. He also hailed him as the personification of all the virtuous qualities desirable in every human. His discourse covered all the 18 ‘Parvas’ of Mahabharata.

Shanmukha Sarma interpreted Mahabharata not as a religious text, but a compendium of life skills suited to all people, all countries and all situations. It is the biggest guide on administration, politics, statecraft, devotion, knowledge, law and justice, philosophy, humanities and so on. Mahabharata gave birth to several sub-texts on values and virtues such as Bhagavad Gita, Viduraneeti, Yakshaprasna etc. and is hence a source of inspiration for the western world, which seeks to learn from India’s spiritual past”, he said.

The orator called the puranas Mahabharata and Bhagavatha as ‘slices of history’ and not mere voluminous books of stories written by men, as perceived by some sections of society.

The orator and his spouse were felicitated at the end of the week by the elite of Tirupati, littérateurs, spiritualists and his ardent fans spread across the Telugu states.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/72rezg/article30535363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Samavedam-Shanmukha-Sarma,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30535364.ece
293,2020/01/10,High strung on gayaki,"When violinist Dr. N. Rajam began playing raag Bageshri Kanada at Bandra's Balgandharva Rangmandir last week, there was pin-drop silence. For the next 45 minutes, the audience heard her with studied concentration, occasionally uttering a 'wah' and clapping after tabla exponent Yogesh Samsi's passages.

Next, a short Banarasi thumri in Khamaj was followed by a soulful Bhairavi. Needless to say, a rousing standing ovation was given. Once again, the 'singing violin', as the instrumentalist is often called, had stirred hearts.

Rajam was performing at Khiraj, a concert held in memory of late sitar maestro Ustad Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan, where she was given the Jafferkhani Samman award. In her typically modest manner, she said, ""The presenter said many good things about me, though I don't know whether I deserve that praise."" Khan's son Zunain Halim Khan began the evening with raags Champakali and Hameer.

At 81, Rajam continues to delight audiences with her sheer artistry and command. Steeped in the Hindustani 'gayaki ang', she creates magic with every phrase. Like the tone of her instrument, there's a distinct warmth in her persona. I met her as she entered the premises, and she immediately said, ""It's been such a long time. How have you been?""

I first heard Rajam perform when I was a month short of my 14th birthday, at a day-long festival in New Delhi in 1977. I don't remember what raag she played but I do recollect I was thrilled to see the audience’s reaction. More important, the music moved me, and I always looked forward to her concerts.

Over the years, I have attended many. Two of my favourite ones were when she played raag Gorakh Kalyan with her daughter Sangeeta Shankar at the Nehru Centre in the late 1990s, and when she rendered raags Bairagi Bhairav and Devgiri Bilawal at the Pratah Swar morning concert four years ago.

The most memorable moment, of course, was interviewing her at her Thane residence around two decades ago. Ever hospitable, she offered me a glass of water before heading over to prepare hot dosas for us. Over fresh coffee, she said, ""The interview will always happen. Hope you liked the dosa.""

I regularly play Rajam's recordings. Last year, the two-volume Glittering Treasures, featuring tabla great Ustad Zakir Hussain, was made available on streaming platforms. The first part has an elaborate Bageshri Kanada, and the second has shorter pieces including the beautiful raag Nilambari, 'Janki Nath Sahaay' in Maanj Khamaj, 'Na Manoongi' in Khamaj and 'Payoji Maine' in Mishra Pahadi.

Besides her daughter, her grand-daughters Ragini and Nandini Shankar are carrying the tradition forward. Rajam’s next performance is along with her daughter Sangeeta at the St. Xavier's Indian Music Group Janfest on January 26.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/5qrk08/article30536931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMPG5RAJAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/high-strung-on-gayaki/article30536932.ece
294,2020/01/10,C Narayana Reddi: Changing contours of Telugu film lyrics,"What brought public recognition to the Telugu film song as literature, week after week? The column ‘Saragamala’ (so named by Malladi Ramakrishna Sastri) carried by Andhra Patrika weekly edited by S Radhakrishna, almost 55 years ago. Till then there was no such column in any language in India evaluating the literary content of the film song. Reviews of films in magazines praised songs now and then, but cursorily.

The early Telugu talkies — Bhaktha Prahlada (1932) onwards — relied mostly on popular stage dramas and used their song-verse-tune-dialogue for ready popularity. When contractual stipulations came in the way, the tune was retained (it was then thought to be free from copyright) and lyrics, slightly modified. A famous author, Chilakamarthi Lakshminarasimham, changed the song from the drama Sakkubai, Ataladukora by Daita Gopalam, into Pata pada rara. The tune carried the day.

By mid-30s, new music was being created for Telugu films by a stalwart, BNR (Bhimavarapu Narasimha Rao) and public appreciation for his tunes in Malapilla (1938) and Raithubidda (1939) was a catalyst. The lyrics were by contemporary writers and the most popular, by late Basavaraju Apparao. The full-fledged Telugu film song was born. Gollavade nallapillavade and Venumanohara ganamu from Malapilla, with simple words lingered on a million tongues. Many gifted writers like Balijepalli Lakshmikantham, Samudrala Senior, Arudra, Malladi Ramakrishna Sastri, Samudrala Junior, Anisetty and Athreya came on to the scene and lit up the songs on screen with choice words and thoughts.

The Telugu film lyric took on new contours with the entry of Dasarathi and C Narayana Reddi. As the book under consideration for evaluation — the first of five volumes released — is about the latter, all further remarks will be about his prolific output.

At a time when different writers were asked to write songs for one film, .C.Na.Re was particular that his debut would be by writing all the songs in a film. N T Rama Rao obliged him by entrusting him with Gulebakavali Katha (1962) and C.Na.Re repaid him by illuminating every situation with a lyric that fused meaning, sound and easy accessibility into a delightful package. Joseph and (Velury) Krishnamurthy experienced in being a part of film song orchestra, made music-directors, did a superlative job. The tunes, orchestral arrangement, and the vocal colouring they got from Ghantasala, P Susheela, S Janaki, P Leela and Pithapuram, were flawless.

Kalala Alalapai Telenu Manasu Mallepoovai had everyone wafting on jasmined breeze. My favourite, the dance song Madana sundara na dora reminded me of a verse from Nandi Timmana’s Parijathapaharanam by following the prosody of magameela nagajalu tegageelukonu valu with giligintha lidayintha pulakintha ledemi.

I must mention three for their exquisite integration into the warp and weft of the screenplay. Nee peru talachina chalu (Ekaveera, 1962) integrates devotion to god Krishna and the love for the hero. Na peru selayeru (Anubandhalu, 63) the song that gave double entendre a silver lining. And Ennallo vechina udayam . . . inka telavarademi, ee cheekati vidipodemi (Manchi Mitrulu, 1969) sung by two childhood friends, about to meet after many years of separation.

Now for the short-comings of the book (not the lyrics).

1.The two songs from Anubandhalu, Ee reyi and Na peru selayeru were sung by L R Eswari and not by Jamuna Rani as given.

2.The male voice in Oho cheliya’ from Anuragam (63) was B Gopalam’s and not Ghantasala’s.

3.The verse Bhupati jampithin used in Bhama Vijayam (’67) was written before C.Na.Re was born, for the Kasi Majili Kathalu series by Madhira Subbanna Dikshitulu (1868-1928)

4.Verses are haphazardly displayed. The proper way is to divide the lines as per prosody, which should be identified. Utpalamala, Seesam. Ataveladi etc.

5.The songs also should be displayed by the prosody, when the writer incorporated ‘dwiteeyakshara prasa’, the second letter consonance.

7.A song from Kalisochina Adrushtam (’68) has bits in Tamil, Marathi and Bengali. Did C.Na.Re write them? If not, the individuals should have been named.

295,2020/01/10,Turning a new leaf,"Two familiar names in the classical music circuit, Alumuri Gopala Krishna and Mahidhara Seeta Rama Sarma, known more so for their curation of music events than singing exploits, came together for brief solo vocal concerts organised by Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram at Saptaparni recently. Among the last few Carnatic concerts hosted in the city before the dawn of 2020, the event’s purpose was to facilitate opportunities to those singers, who had a strong musical foundation and yet were focused on being the face behind concerts. Both Gopala Krishna and Seeta Rama Sarma chose simplistically tuned numbers to present their musical exploits across a two-hour event.

Musical role Mahidhara Seeta Rama Sarma (top) Alamuri Gopala Krishna in concert By arrangement

The first half of the briskly-paced event saw Gopala Krishna take up a host of compositions mostly written by Annamayya, Ramadasu and Thyagaraja. The Ganesha Pancharatnam Mudakkaratta modakam was an ideal start to a concert whose lineup largely dwelled on the bhakti rasa. Neevokkada ve naku chalu, Araginchi kurchunna among the many Annamayya kirtanas composed by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy and Balakrishna Prasad kept the concert ticking along neatly, although the singing attained momentum mostly with Thyagaraja’s Nanuganna talli in Deshaadi ragam.

The second half of his concert featured songs on Lord Rama with handpicked kirtanas of Ramadasu and Thyagaraja. Abbabba debbalaku talavemira took the rasika through all the turmoil that Ramadasu would have undergone at the prison in Golconda, while the innate melodic quotient in the other works of the poet including Rama Sita Rama, Rama Rama Anarada Raghupati were literally music to the ears. Gopala Krishna’s bhava in the numbers was very much in place but it appeared that the vocalist was in his shell, slightly apprehensive about exploring his singing strengths fully. This certainly affected the clarity in his diction, although his intentions were sincere.

Mahidhara Seeta Rama Sarma

Mahidhara Seeta Rama Sarma fared better than his other vocalist counterpart — an earthy yet authoritative voice, he was helped by the confidence in his abilities on the stage despite the lack of sophistication in the singing.

The music connoisseur played upon his strengths and his knowledge within the Annamayya kirtana space in the event, also focusing on the works that his late musician friend Sattiraju Venumadhav had composed for the Annamayya Padamandakini project. Athivaro Sri Venkatagiri meeda was one such rare kirtana, vibrantly set in the Nata ragam that presented the firmness of Seeta Rama Sarma’s voice and set the tone for the latter part of his concert.

But for a reasonably well-sung Marugelara in Jayanthasree ragam, Sri Ramula divyasmarana and Sree Rama nee namamentha (both works of Ramadasu), all his other renditions comprised Annamayya’s works set to tune by composers Sobharaju, Balakrishna Prasad, Nageswara Naidu and Sattiraju Venumadhav. The singer excelled more in the fast-paced compositions with a strong hook than the leisurely ones set on a melodic base — the likes of Eethade Muktidova, Kadiri Narasimhudu proved it. The latter song was memorable also for the instrumental flourish that the percussionists brought about by TP Balasubramaniam on the mridangam and Jayakumar Acharya on the tabla. The Sattiraju Venumadhav-composed Annamayya kirtana Kalada inthatidaata was straight from the heart and a worthy inclusion in his song lineup.

Although the event wasn’t an attempt to be a conventional kacheri, the absence of a musical flourish was apparent through the duration.

However, when viewed from the perspective that the attempt encouraged singers who weren’t a regular at the concert stage, the purpose of the event was fulfilled. The sight of a budding mridangam artiste Abhiram Alamuri being an accompanist to his father Gopala Krishna on the stage was a memorable one. Violinist K L N Murthy’s instrumentation lent the right aesthetics to the singing.

The wise words of veena exponent Ayyagari Syamasundaram at the event that being a listener is the best foundation that an artist could ever ask for, ended the evening on a thoughtful note.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30535120.ece
296,2020/01/10,SOTA Resonance 2020: Musical riches from the West,"In a city where the awareness and taste for Western classical music are yet to reach maturity, concerts often carry the burden of being enriching and educative at the same time. The third edition of SOTA’s prestigious annual music series Resonance 2020 was a much-needed, rewarding step on that front. Transporting music enthusiasts to an era of classicists like Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn, and informing its audience of all the flourishes that have helped their compositions stand the test of time, a winter evening at The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace was a conversation starter, full of musical warmth.

The introductory performance of Beethoven’s Razumovsky String quartet C major, Op. 59, No. 3 attained more significance in a year that would mark the legend’s 250th birth anniversary. The opening movement of the piece, i.e. Andante con moto - Allegro vivace surprised on several levels for its wavy musical texture. By the moment you adapted to the rather sombre, atmospheric beginning, the pacy Allegro vivace segment worked beautifully as an antithesis, exploring ideas of timelessness and enthusiasm at the same time.

The later movement, Andante con moto quasi allegretto, was rather obvious in its exploration of melancholy and yet wasn’t characterised by the heaviness you would associate with the same emotion. Instead, the section warmed you with its beautiful melody that almost felt weightless. The dominant use of viola and violin created a soothing effect before the piece progressed onto its later movements, Menuetto: Grazioso and Allegro Molto.

The Menuetto: Grazioso was a fine successor of its earlier movements in the piece, with a moderate yet an intriguing fusion of joy and drama. The culmination bore an air of mystery before leading you to a blistering finale.

The finale (Allegro Molto) was fitting in every sense of the word, with all its energy performed in breathless speed by the musicians. It felt like all the characters in a gripping novel had returned at once to establish their identity - the ending had a dash of joy, darkness and strength. The gamut of emotions a listener experienced through the piece was enough to make him wait for Felix Mendelssohn’s Octet In E Flat, Op.20 with bated breath.

Best of eight

In what was Mendelssohn’s personal favourite and hailed as his career-best work by several critics (which he had composed at 16 for his master Eduard Rietz), the piece was very meticulous in making the best use of the individualistic abilities of the eight instrumentalists (the instruments being violins, violas and cellos). Performed in a musical style prevalent in the romanticism-era spearheaded by Beethoven, the beauty of the rendition lies in how it captured the lightness of the composition and its organic flow quite effortlessly.

The Allegro moderato, ma con fuoco movement, classically dominated by the violin, felt more like a gracefully packaged mix of musical nudges, with an exuberant spirit and also trying to convey something heartfelt. The Andante segment, underplayed in its rendition was thoughtful too, though lacking the joie de vivre of its predecessor. The pacy Scherzo portion, reportedly inspired by the lines from the German legend Goethe’s poem Walpurgisnachtstraum, had a breezy quality to it, with subtle musical references to nature, indicating a deeper quest.

The musicians had reserved their best for the energetic ending with the Presto movement though - defined by its striking modulation and the cyclical structure where the composer revisits his previous movements in the piece at once. It’s so intricately put together and yet has a free-spirited vibe to it. Musicians across the globe including violinists Mari Lee, Julia Glenn, Ling Ling Huang, Aylin Amtmann, viola players Riina Piriirila, Yitong Guo and cello players Sarah Rommel, Han Bin Yoon, Aylin Amtmann were successful in introducing the musical riches of the West, staying true to the form through the evening.

Timothy Marthand played the perfect host at the event, being the bridge between the musician and the audience, putting together the essence of the compositions that the audience may not have been able to express. The event wasn’t without an element of surprise as Canadian opera singer Lauren Pearl Eberwein and Rosie Moon (double bass) gave a glimpse of their abilities too. Music, enthusiastic conversations with a sip of coffee made for a delectable combo indeed!",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gjm93o/article30535017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf10resonancejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30535018.ece
297,2020/01/10,Dr L Subramaniam: Bowing to the father,"It is a relaxed evening for Dr L Subramaniam. The calmness is palpable as we meet the violin maestro a day before the presentation of Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival (LGMF) in Hyderabad. The reasons for his state of contentment are many — LGMF is in its 29th edition and has become a stage for a wide range of international artistes to perform; this year LGMF celebrates 150th birth year of Mahatma Gandhi with a musical titled ‘Tribute to Mahatma.’His children Ambi and Bindu are clear on where they want to be in music and he sees a spark of talent in his eight-year-old granddaughter Mahati.

He shares that she was just three when she expressed a wish to sing in an open air concert! “I was getting ready to perform in Chicago and Mahati said, ‘Thata, I want to sing.’ When I informed the organiser, he said ‘it is your audience; As long as they like it, go on.’ She was not at all nervous on stage,” he recollects with a smile. Since then, little Mahati has been the new member from the family participating in concerts. Besides music, the thata-pethi duo also enjoy playing badminton. “Both of us win matches,” informs Mahati diplomatically as the grandfather has a hearty laugh.

LGMF’s growth has been phenomenal. What started as a son’s musical tribute to his father (V Lakshminarayana) has evolved into a global musical movement connecting musicians across different cultures and countries. The violin virtuoso admits he never envisaged LGMF’s journey. “After my father’s death, I stopped playing and Viji (his late wife) mentioned why don’t we start a festival in his memory,” he recalls. The first concert had none other than MS Subbulakshmi lighting the lamp and singing a prayer. From then on LGMF had seen legends like Bismillah Khan and Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna gracing the stage. Considering himself fortunate, he says, “It is truly my father’s blessings. It is not just the musical greats who readily agreed to be a part of it,friends like AVM Sarvanan voluntarily made video films of the concerts and gave as a gift. We have everything documented, including MS Subbulakshmi’s prayer song.”

One of the reasons for making LGMF a global festival was to change westerners’ perception towards Indian classical music. “For the West, classical music meant only western classical music and everything else was folk and ethnic; Indian music means ‘one sits down and plays ethnic music.’

By arrangement By arrangement

Wife Kavita Krishnamurthy joins the conversation and the couple recall warm memories from their two previous LGMF presentations held in Hyderabad. “In ‘Visions of India’ at Chowmahalla Palace, we had different styles of music symbolising India. In the second concert at Necklace Road, we had a harp player too on stage. The crowd was huge and it took two hours for us to get out of the place.” Kavita says, adding she loves performing in Hyderabad where listeners are open to different genres. For her, Chowmahallah Palace signifies the secular quality of Hyderabad. “The Visions of India concert was planned so that midway, we would stop for a few minutes for the azaan. It was this adjustment that highlights the secular significance, the fantastic ambience and the beautiful blending of the the old and new in Hyderabad.”

Third generation steps in

Bindu Subramaniam | Photo Credit: By arrangement

Ambi and Bindu Subramaniam have started a band ‘SubraMania’ that blends western components with Indian classical music. While Bindu has studied song writing in Berklee College and is a song writer, the youngsters are part of Thayir Sadam that collaborate with other artists. With varied musical interests, their house reverberates with different kinds of music. The four musicians in their house visualise the same musical piece in four different ways. Ambi calls this a creative zone with different ideas, a guide to know what works and what doesn’t. “The beauty is one doesn’t necessarily have to arrive at a consensus. We have learnt everything from appa. As long as you are in a space where everyone respects each other, you are also contributing in different ways,” he says and remarks, “Thinking of the same thing is not contributing.”

Being compared to the father, the bar is set high for these two youngsters. Is there pressure? “In this family, mediocrity is not an option and it is a kind of encouragement for us to constantly work hard,” shares Bindu. Interestingly the three siblings (Ambi, Bindu and their elder brother Narayana) started off learning Carnatic and western music (voice and violin). It has manifested differently in them. “It is important to find your own authentic voice and form of expression. It is a challenge that we do to be anything other than a diluted version of yourself.”

Every kind of music is welcomed in the family and this encouragement has opened the siblings to experiment and create their own identity. Says Bindu, “My parents never said ‘this music is not good’. My dad might not appreciate me listening to rap at 2 in the morning but never said this is wrong. ‘Whatever kind of music, do it well.’ If you want to be a pop musician, that is not the excuse to not work hard at that.”

Under the guidance of their father, the duo have also created SaPa (Subramaniam Arts of Performing Arts), a systematic introduction of music education to children. Says Kavita, “A lot is being done in the field of education. Subramaniam’s father (V Lakshminarayana) was a great teacher and he also taught them. Now Ambi and Bindu carry forward the legacy of music education with SaPa. It is an attempt to ensure music reaches every school child.”

Dr Subramaniam (did his MBBS from Madras Medical College) informs that many schools have introduced this music education and he looks forward to bring this education to Telangana.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/friday-review-telangana/article30534843.ece
298,2020/01/10,‘The Agam Story’ documents the journey of rock band Agam,"“Someone taking time out to create a story about our journey is very touching. It brings out 10 years of meaningful existence of the team,” says Harish Sivaramakrishnan with a laugh. Frontman and lead vocalist of progressive Carnatic rock band Agam, he is talking about The Agam Story, a ‘rockumentary’ on the band directed by Vinu Janardanan.

The 23-minute-long documentary encapsulates the journey and music of the band, setting it against a concert of Agam held in the city recently.

“The narrative is built around how they connect with audience during a live show. As Harish says in the documentary, it is more like an addiction. They have been instrumental in making the young and the old groove to Carnatic kritis and ragas,” says Vinu.

It also introduces members of the band, who reminisce about their journey, bonding with each other and their compositions. “As a vocalist, I generally get a lot more attention than others whereas they also need to be seen and heard,” Harish says. In the seven-member band, except for one, all others have regular jobs. “It is rare to find professionals balancing their passion and profession,” Vinu adds.

A former mediaperson, Vinu is the co-writer of the National Award-winning documentary on Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, Chembai — My Discovery of a Legend, and scriptwriter of the short film, Rabbit Hole.

Sumesh Lal, who is credited with rebranding Malayalam indie music, is the executive producer. “We had done a documentary on Mother Jane a decade ago in connection with the release of their album. It was more like a travelogue in which they also talked about the genesis of their songs. This project gives an insight into the band and its members, now that they have made a place for themselves in the music industry,” says Sumesh.

299,2020/01/10,Mollywood lyricist Joe Paul on why his poetry is beyond borders,"Sitting in his home in suburban Dallas, Texas, Joe Paul has been penning some of Malayalam cinema’s most treasured songs of late. The imagery-rich ‘Parayuvaan’ from Ishq and soulful ‘Madhu Pole’ from Dear Comrade, are just two of Joe’s songs that hit the top of the charts last year.

Geographical limitations clearly are not a problem for this wordsmith. “Until recently, there was this misconception among music directors that the lyricist needs to be physically present in Kerala or at least in the vicinity, presumably to know its pulse. That mindset has changed.

Nowadays, they don’t seem to be that bothered by distance. For instance, during the recording of ‘Parayuvaan,’ Jakes Bejoy, Ishq’s music director, was in his studio in Chennai, Sid Sriram, the singer, was in California and I was in Dallas and all of us were working real time on group chat on the phone! Dear Comrade was also recorded pretty much the same way,” says Joe, over the phone.

“The only problem with being so far away from Kerala is that I am unable to physically go knock on the doors of music directors asking for an opportunity to work with them,” he adds.

Surely, with the phenomenal musical success of both Ishq and Dear Comrade and — to a lesser extent — his other works of 2019 — Manoharam, Porinchu Mariam Jose and Kalki — there’s no need for him to keep asking for chances...? “Unfortunately, unless you are an established lyricist, it doesn’t work that way. It’s still very much about networking. Out of sight is out of mind. Therefore, you need a steady flow of work and to get that you have to keep your name in the spotlight and hound music directors in the process!” says Joe, with a laugh.

Poet at heart

The lyricist, born and brought up in Kochi, actually studied at the College of Horticulture in Thrissur and is also a management graduate. He now works as an HR consultant in Dallas but he’s a poet at heart. In fact, he has been penning his thoughts into poems since he was in class six or so.

“My older brother, Jibesh, used to write humourous poems and get many laughs when he recited them for family functions. I started writing poems out of jealousy! He stopped and I just continued with it,” he says. “All this while, though, my dream has been to see my name on screen when the credits roll. The thrill of seeing it there is indescribable; it’s what drives me to write more,” he adds.

Before Mollywood came calling more than a decade after he first set out to become a lyricist, he put his creative skills to write, sing and compose a number of Christian devotional albums and songs, collaborating with a few like-minded United States-based friends. He eventually got a toehold in the industry in 2015 with Rasputin and You Too Brutus. That was followed by another dry spell, until Queen (2018) happened. While the film itself didn’t do particularly well at the box office, its music (recall the songs ‘Saare’ and ‘Lal Anthem,’ and so on) hit a chord with music buffs, especially youngsters.

“The struggle is real but perseverance pays. I took a shot in the dark when I approached its director Dijo Jose Anthony online and luckily he put me in touch with Jakes Bejoy and he in turn took a liking to my work,” explains Joe.

Joe and Jakes also worked together in Ranam and Swathanthriyam Ardharathriyil that same year. “Jakes is a meticulous taskmaster and a perfectionist as well. He gives you every last detail of the situation and really makes you think about each word, even each intonation. He is really keen on how the lyrics sound as well. For example, if a word ends with the Malayalam ‘th’ and the next one begins with the same alphabet, then he will make you change to an appropriate synonym to maintain the flow of the song. Working with music directors like him is a blessing,” says Joe, adding that he also likes to take his time with the lyrics.

“Sometimes, the words flow like a breeze, often, though, I have to satisfying my own exacting standards! And that's no easy task. I enjoy writing love songs the most and I think that’s what I am best at.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/aqvfc5/article30532826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvmJoe,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/mollywood-lyricist-joe-paul-on-why-his-poetry-is-beyond-borders/article30532827.ece

A graduate from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Shilpa Ananth is a vocalist and singer-songwriter whose music bears a distinct Indianness not just in the melodies, but also in her ability to weave in Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi verses. Sample songs like ‘Pogathe’ and ‘Enge Nee’ but also her latest single ‘Align’, which will be off her forthcoming EP Reproduction. As part of her debut India tour, she’s performing alongside pianist Aman Mahajan, drummer Rohit P.S. and bassist Drew of the Drew. With the exception of Drew who has also worked as a recording engineer on her songs, Shilpa says about recruiting a local band, “I’ve heard a lot about Aman from different friends who are great musicians, whose judgement I trust. He was also my senior at Berklee, and is pretty well known in the music community. So I reached out to him first, and then he connected me with Rohit PS. Coincidentally, my good friend and incredible guitar player, Bhrigu Sahni (another Berklee alum) connected me with Anurag Naidu. In this particular industry, you can’t get through without help, and I’m so grateful for all the people that came into my life at the right time with the right advice and connection.”

301,2020/01/10,Actor Revathy talks about the joys of kayaking,"Last week actor Revathy and her six-year-old daughter Mahi, participated in the Kochi Muziris Paddle 2019, a 40 km, two-day trip that combined kayaking and heritage exploration. The Paddle, which had 60 participants, concluded on January 5. She speaks to MetroPlus about the challenges, and why she did it.

What made you sign up, and did you enjoy the experience?

I have been planning it for a while but things did not work out until this year. It was very tough to paddle 20 km a day and I did take help to be towed a couple of times a day to keep up with the group.

What stands out with the Jellyfish team is their enthusiasm, their support and the safety regime they follow. This was extremely important for me as I was with a six-year-old and I am a first time, long distance kayaker.

At the end of Day 1, as we were reaching Shravanam Greens, the wind was strong and I was battling with it to direct my kayak towards docking it. Sandy Robson, the event’s leader, came beside my kayak and shouted a few moves, which I followed. With her instructions it was easy to manoeuvre my kayak to the exact spot I wanted to despite the wind. It made me realise the need to be trained or maybe practice to actually enjoy the experience.

Tell us about your association with kayaking.

I tried kayaking for the first time at Jellyfish, Kozhikode, a couple of years ago. I heard about this event from a friend. I like adventure sports, it’s my time away from my usual profession. I spent a couple of hours at Jellyfish and after that kayaked a couple of times in Chennai. I am still a novice at kayaking, I would definitely like to continue and get better at it.

Was it a memorable mother-daughter trip?

Mahi loves water and so I have always tried to do things with her around water. She enjoys company and that is good when coming for such events. Rayn, Kaushiq Thodikodika’s (founder of Jellyfish) son and she hit it off well when they met the day before the event. Fifteen year-old Rayn was our team leader as we were split into groups making it easier to keep tabs on people and their safety.

Rayn played music on his kayak to keep our spirits high, including several of Mahi’s requests. Things like this made her part of the event.

As a mother-daughter team, I enjoyed it though it was tough at times to paddle a double sit-in kayak with her. She paddled every time she felt like it and that was enough in my opinion. I just wanted to expose her to such sports and would definitely like her to take up a sport as I feel the discipline and safety it teaches is invaluable.

Why kayaking?

Because I love water and so does Mahi. It’s safe and we can explore places going down waterways anywhere in the world.

Do the two of you do other sporting activities together?

Not yet as she is still young. We go swimming and body boarding once in a while in Chennai. Anything to do with water seems to be our favourite.

I was not a sports person, I was more into classical dance, which also requires a lot of discipline. Being an army officer’s daughter, I feel a certain amount of discipline is necessary to keep ourselves healthy and active. It also helps in the jobs we do, be it regular office work or the creative arts.

I was a little out of it for a while in my life and my daughter’s presence has got me back on track.

Was heritage exploration and sightseeing an important part of the journey for you, or was this just about kayaking?

This trip was only kayaking as I was getting the hang of it and the distance was exhausting. This time I decided to conserve my energy and did not do much sightseeing. Hope to do so next time.

I think waterways are a great way to sightsee. It is away from the everyday hustle bustle. Water somehow soothes us to a point where one feels relaxed. This will also help in slowly cleaning up the waterways that Kerala has been gifted.

What are your current film projects? And what else is keeping you busy?

I am acting in two projects in Telugu, Itlu Amma (means ‘yours amma’, as in signing off a letter), directed by Umamaheshwar Rao and Major directed by Sashi Kiran. I have been acting in a television serial, Azhagu, for the last two years. I am also working on a script to be made in Hindi. I hope to start it soon and get back into directing films.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/eaq5bl/article30534595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpRevathyJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/actor-revathy-and-daughter-mahi-go-on-a-kayaking-trip/article30534597.ece
302,2020/01/10,Demolition of apartments to redraw landscape of Maradu in 24 hours,"In a day, H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene, the two illegal structures that were built in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone norms, will be reduced to rubble, changing the urban landscape of Maradu Municipality forever.

A trial run of the demolition, minus explosion, will be held on Friday morning to ensure that safety and recovery operations, including the entry of fire tenders and ambulances to the site, are performed as planned, said Snehil Kumar Singh, the Fort Kochi RDO in charge of the demolition.

The demolition of the buildings was warranted following a Supreme Court order. The apex court had issued an ultimatum to the State Government on May 8 last year to raze the buildings and had summoned Chief Secretary Tom Jose for non-compliance with its order.

On Saturday, a series of blasts will be triggered at the buildings from a distance at 11 a.m. and 11.05 a.m. H2O Holy Faith, the 68-metre-tall apartment built in 16 floors, will end up as a heap of rubble, which may measure up to 16 metres. The demolition is expected to be completed in 5.6 seconds.

Buildings inspected

After completing the groundwork for the demolition, including loading of explosives and connecting them to detonators, a team of experts led by Joe Brinkman of Jet Demolition, South Africa, the technology partner of Edifice Engineering, Mumbai, carried out detailed inspections at the buildings to ensure that the structures come down as planned.

Red flags were erected along the boundary of the exclusion zone, which has been fixed as 200 metres from the boundary of the holdings where the apartments were built. Preparations for the demolition were reviewed at a meeting convened by the Chief Secretary on Thursday evening. The technical committee will meet at Maradu municipal office on Friday at 11 a.m. to review the preparations.

When detonated, H2O Holy Faith, the first building to be demolished, will come down forward a bit in its downward movement to fall on its side in the form of a waterfall. The heap of rubble may reach up to the front gate of the complex but not beyond the point, said Uttkarsh Mehta of Edifice Engineering.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uku4y5/article30528597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09KI-SKYVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/demolition-of-apartments-to-redraw-landscape-of-maradu-in-24-hours/article30528599.ece
303,2020/01/10,District rides ‘high’ on drugs,"Ganja and nitrazepam tablets dominated the substance abuse scene in the district last year going by the data collated by the Excise Department.

The Excise seized 202.17 kilograms of ganja in the calendar year of 2019, which marked a steep increase from 164.52 kilograms seized in the previous year.

More phenomenal, however, was the increase in seizure of nitrazepam tablets, which rose from 1,167 in 2018 to 2,318 in 2019 making it the most popular and accessible drug among substance abusers.

Ganja continues to pour in from States likes Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal whereas nitrazepam tablets, a prescription drug for treating anxiety and insomnia and is hard to secure over the counter without prescriptions from medical shops in the State, are being smuggled in bulk quantities from neighbouring States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and sold here for profits many folds.

“Easy to smuggle in and consume is what makes nitrazepam tablets such a hit among substance abusers,” said enforcement officials. This theory perhaps reflected in the fall in demand for buprenorphine ampules the seizure of which fell from 701 in 2018 to a mere 12 last year. Unlike nitrazepam tablets, these ampules need to be injected, which is far more troublesome than simply swallowing a pill.

Marginal fall in cases

Surprisingly, the number of cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act has registered a marginal fall from 922 in 2018 to 890 last year. This, however, was no reasons for euphoria as senior officials attributed it to slack enforcement owing to demoralisation that had set in among the ranks after four enforcement officials at Aluva were shunted out of the district after they were implicated in an incident in which they were accused of planting drugs to arrest three engineers from a hotel near the Kochi airport.

The dip in cases was particularly palpable in the second half of the year when the incident was reported.

If the lowest number of cases registered in a month in the first half of the year was 69, in August it dropped to 58 cases and to 33 in November.

Though premium psychotropic substances continued to be smuggled into the district, their volumes were very low. For instance, LSD seizure registered a marginal increase from 0.24 grams in 2018 to 2.30 grams whereas MDMA fell from over 31.09 kilograms to 71.66 grams during the same period.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/u5hu0b/article30528552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvki-drugREVcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/district-rides-high-on-drugs/article30528553.ece
304,2020/01/10,‘Survival of modern societies can’t be at the cost of natural environment’,"“Maradu fiasco is a reminder that the survival of modern societies cannot ignore the natural environment. It is also a reminder that citizens cannot remain oblivious to the law,” says noted earth scientist Kusala Rajendran, Professor at the Centre for Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Excerpts from an e-mail interview.

On the demolition of the apartment buildings at Maradu

The image of my village near Vaikom, fringed by backwaters, sprawling paddy fields, coconut plantations, and wetlands is a nostalgic memory. Rains those days were pretty regular, and they changed the looks of the village, but it rarely washed away homes. The landscapes have changed, perhaps with accelerated pace in recent years. Today, the monsoon is also about floods in the lowlands and landslides in the highlands. Climate change adds unpredictable dimensions to the problem. At the centre of it all is human society. The rise and fall of the luxurious flats at Maradu symbolise a lot about the changing aspirations of people and the consequences.

On blatant violation of norms

As the thundering blasting echoes in the area, the neighbours remain worried, sleepless, and pondering. How did this flat come up here in the first place? Why were the rules flouted while giving permission? And, why did people buy the flats, knowing about the violations? From my interactions with friends and relatives living around Kochi, I gather that many who bought the flats were aware of the violations but presumed that ultimately it would be overlooked and pardoned. The perception that ‘rules are for fools’ must have prevailed; the fact that many such violations have passed the scrutiny, ratifying that belief.

Demolition and its impact

The next issue is about how do we deal with demolition? Demolition of huge structures is not commonly discussed in India, but it seems to be a challenging issue widely discussed by the civil engineering community. Implosion, often used for demolition of large structures in urban areas, is considered more efficient. It is about using explosives to knock out a building’s primary vertical supports, and the building collapses onto itself from the inside out. The whole process is executed in stages after surveying the area and analysis of the blueprint of the structure in question. It also follows plans for disposal of debris, safety measures etc. Then there is the ‘green approach’, which removes the materials and segregates them for reuse or recycling. Among several other factors, the demolition experts also consider how to dispose of the debris. In view of future requirements, it is prudent to develop expertise in ‘demolition engineering’ with minimal impact to the environment.

Lessons to be learnt from Maradu

The ghosts of Maradu are here to stay. For lawmakers, builders and buyers alike, it is important to be aware of the consequences of violations. Next time a waterfront or hill slope is encroached upon, hopefully the echoes from Maradu will resound. Regardless of what techniques are used and how efficient the demolition process is going to emerge, there are some important lessons from the Maradu experience. Firstly, it is a reminder that survival of modern societies cannot ignore the natural environment. It is also a reminder that citizens cannot remain oblivious to the law.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uirqrc/article30528549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-KUSALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/survival-of-modern-societies-cant-be-at-the-cost-of-natural-environment/article30528550.ece
305,2020/01/10,Maradu impact: demand for waterfront property plummets,"Gone are the days when builders paid a premium price for beautiful waterfront land parcels in Ernakulam.

The shock reverberations of the Maradu controversy continue to impact the prospects of the realty sector in the commercial capital of Kerala. According to estimates prepared by the Kochi chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations (CREDAI), the demand for attractive waterfront land parcels has hit an all-time low in the aftermath of the Supreme Court directive to demolish four apartment buildings at Maradu.

“No builder is showing interest in waterfront land parcels for setting up residential apartment complexes after the Maradu fiasco. Why should one get into trouble by spending from his own pocket for such a poor business move in these times?” asked Ravi Jacob, president, CREDAI, Kochi.

Maintaining that the Maradu episode has also hit the confidence levels of officials of various local bodies, Mr. Jacob said no one was signing papers pertaining to real estate projects, fearing that they might land in the soup later. “There is an overall erosion of confidence among bureaucrats,” he added.

Meanwhile, buyer sentiment remains sluggish as people do not close deals and continue to be hesitant to acquire apartments. Real estate representatives pointed out that buyers were also doubtful of the government’s position on various policy matters related to the real estate sector.

“Despite our repeated requests, the government is yet to recall the anti-industry provisions under the amended Kerala Municipality and Panchayat Building Rules. The square feet rate will go up by ₹1,000 to ₹1,200 if the authorities fail to drop the amendments. The realty sector will not be able to undertake new projects in such a scenario,” they said.

Builders are of the view that they may have to work on a plan to boost buyer confidence after the demolition of the apartments. “It may take a few days more as images of the Maradu implosion will now remain for at least 10 days,” they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tgc9gg/article30528516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-WATERFRONT-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-impact-demand-for-waterfront-property-plummets/article30528517.ece
306,2020/01/10,Health Department gears up to tackle emergencies during demolition,"The Health Department is ready with a ground plan to handle emergency situations that can arise during the implosion of the illegal apartment complexes at Maradu on Saturday and Sunday.

A rapid response team will be stationed near each building. The team of trained doctors, nurses, and technical hands from the District General Hospital and the Thripunithura Taluk Hospital will be assisted by teams from Lakeshore Hospital, P.S. Mission Hospital, Nair’s Hospital, and Welcare Hospital on both days.

Besides the above precautions, the Health authorities will keep ambulance services, available on 108, on standby. Since the Maradu implosion is a first-of-its-kind operation, the contingency plans include evacuation of officials and personnel on duty from near the site in case of an emergency, said Additional District Medical Officer S. Sreedevi.

Four ambulances will be deployed on the first day, two at each site, while an additional ambulance will be deployed on the second day. The locations of the ambulances will be finalised after the drill on Friday, according to a senior Health official.

Those in and around the area of implosion are advised to wear good quality masks as dust generated by the implosion could cause serious health hazards.

Once the dust rises into the atmosphere, the direction of wind could play a crucial role in aggravating or dissipating the situation.

As many as eight fire tenders will be stationed in the vicinity — four each at the two sites. The Fire Department has been instructed to keep them 200 metres away from the sites. They are expected to reach the sites once the control room gives orders two minutes after the implosion for spraying water at the debris.

Regional fire officer Shiju K.K. said there could be visibility problems arising out of the dust generated by the implosion. Fire tenders will also be available in case of electricity or LPG-related accidents. Though electrical lines will be switched off, there will be inverters that will be running, said Mr. Shiju. Officials believe that the implosion will have negligible impact on the 100 MLD plant of the Kerala Water Authority at Maradu as it is over 350 metres away from the site. However, pumping will be suspended for two hours in the vicinity as a precautionary measure.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mwjzuu/article30528489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/health-department-gears-up-to-tackle-emergencies-during-demolition/article30528490.ece
307,2020/01/10,"Implosion will cause no damage to nearby structures, High Court told","The State Government on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that the technical committee appointed by the Government to monitor the demolition of the apartment complexes at Maradu was of the view that the demolition would cause no damage to nearby structures.

The government further submitted that the petitioners’ claim that controlled implosion of the apartments would damage nearby buildings was entirely false and unscientific. Controlled implosion will lead to the collapse of the apartments vertically downward and will in no way affect nearby structures. Besides, the Government had taken an insurance coverage of ₹10 crore and ₹50 crore for Golden Kayaloram and Alfa Serene apartments respectively, the court was told.

The submissions were made when a petition filed by those living near the Maradu apartments, seeking a directive to assess the current market value of houses and other structures within 200-metre radius of the structures came up for hearing. A petition by the managing director of Heera Construction Company, which owns an apartment complex next to Golden Kayaloram, seeking an insurance coverage of ₹125 crore, also came up for hearing. He further submitted that the authorities had not taken proper steps to cover the risk of the building.

308,2020/01/10,"Maradu plans cannot go awry, assures demolition man","If the Maradu demolition plans go awry, the apartment complexes could crash onto nearby structures including houses and a bridge that runs through the area.

When asked about the probability of such a mishap, demolition experts said they did not anticipate such an eventuality and assured that the structures would come down as planned.

“We are sure that the building will come down as planned, and there is not even 0.01% probability for any such mishaps,” said Uttkarsh Mehta, partner of Edifice Engineering, which has been contracted to bring down H2O Holy Faith in association with Jet Demolition, the technology partner.

In the worst-case scenario, the building could tilt and fall on its side against the demolition plans. However, no such incidents have taken place during the three decades of demolition work undertaken by the company, said Mr. Mehta.

There is no question of partial demolition happening and parts of the building remaining over the earth considering the quantity of explosives loaded into the structure. Enough quantities of explosive materials have been loaded, and the building will come down when blasted, he added.

Evacuation

Meanwhile, the evacuation of Maradu residents will begin on Saturday morning and will be completed before 9 a.m. Though there are around 500 people from as many as 133 families residing near Alfa Serene and H2O Holy faith, nearly half of the population have already moved out of their homes. Five buses have been arranged for shifting the remaining residents to rescue camps. The list of bed-ridden residents who may have to be extended support for relocation is being prepared, civic authorities of Maradu said.

IIT team arrives

Armed with accelerometers, geophones, and strain gauges, a team of civil engineering experts from the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras began preparations for assessing the impact of the demolition.

Accelerometers and geophones are used to measure the vibration emanating from the ground. The hitting of the concrete parts of the building on the ground will set off vibrations which need to be assessed, and the gadgets will record them, said J.S. Dhanya, a member of the IIT expert team.

Strain gauge will be pasted to the Kundannoor bridge that runs next to H2O Holy Faith to find out whether the structural elements of the bridge, including its columns and beams, are deformed when the load hits the ground, Dr. Dhanya said.

The team has identified as many as 10 spots where the gadgets will be fixed. The IIT team is led by A. Boominathan, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering. It also has Subhadeep Banerjee and Ramon Varghese as members. Data generated by the team will be used to assess the impact of the demolition, which will be crucial in fixing the liability and compensation for damage caused by the process.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mrd7ow/article30528350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-EXPERTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-plans-cannot-go-awry-assures-demolition-man/article30528351.ece
309,2020/01/10,Foolproof security in Kolkata for PM Modi’s visit,"The West Bengal administration has planned foolproof security arrangements to counter any untoward incident during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to the city starting Saturday evening.

The Intelligence Branch had submitted a report to the State stating that as many as three organisations are planning to hold large-scale gatherings at the airport, on the roads and show black flags to the Prime Minister

According to a senior official of the State government, the authorities have planned to “sanitise” the route slated to be taken by the Prime Minister’s convoy to take to reach the city from the airport keeping in mind the possibility of protesters against CAA and NRC showing black flags and putting up blockades.

The official said the roadmap was planned considering that Mr. Modi is scheduled to arrive at a time when light will not be favourable to fly him to the city in a helicopter.

“We have planned foolproof arrangements for the scheduled visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There will be barricades along the edges of the roads from the airport to the city on Saturday evening. There will be an extra security cover alongside these roads to keep a check on threats of protesters putting up blockades or displaying black flags to the PM,” the official said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/ksubgh/article30534572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOLKATAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/foolproof-security-in-kolkata-for-pm-modis-visit/article30534465.ece
310,2020/01/10,Protests planned against Modi’s Kolkata visit,"Multiple civil society groups, social organisations, human rights platforms and cultural bodies have planned a demonstration on Saturday under a common slogan. There will be posters and banners urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi “to go back.” An elaborate civil disobedience movement, branded as “no NRC, no NPR, no CAA campaign,” has been planned. Mr. Modi is expected to attend four programmes in the city over the weekend.

From early Saturday morning, the groups — organised mainly by a joint anti-citizenship law platform — will mobilise people from the city and suburbs to march to two points.

At Kaikhali traffic crossing near the airport, the objective will be to stop the Prime Minister from entering the city, the organisers said. However, it is not yet clear if Mr. Modi will be flown into the city from the airport in the Army’s copters or driven by road all the way to his first programme venue in Dalhousie Square. He is expected to visit Belur Math founded by Swami Vivekananda on Saturday evening.

The anti-NRC groups will also assemble near the Raj Bhavan in the city’s central area and the organisers have appealed to the activists to participate without any flags. “We appeal to participants to carry only the national flag and not the flag of any political party,” said Prasenjit Bose, a key organiser.

Meanwhile, protests continued in parts of the city on Thursday. At one of the anti-NRC, CAA programmes, research scholars of various universities and independent institutes demanded “creation of awareness to examine the connection of government exercises [like the NRC and the CAA] with the day-to-day issues” of the people. The group, Democratic Research Scholars’ Organisation, said more than 100 scholar representative participated in the programme. In the city’s central Park Circus area, more than 500 people, mostly elderly Muslim women, resorted to a sit-in demonstration. Student groups also participated in the protests that have been continuing for the last three days.

“It is not just a demonstration by Muslim women. All other communities, particularly from the majority community, have gathered here,” said a political science student of Rabindra Bharati University. Scores of national flags were on display in the Park Circus ground venue, described by the media as “Kolkata's Shaheen Bagh.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/protests-planned-against-modis-kolkata-visit/article30528346.ece
311,2020/01/10,Explosion in Naihati rocks both banks of Hooghly,"A massive explosion in West Bengal’s Naihati on Thursday rocked both banks of river Ganga in the North 24 Parganas and the Hooghly district.

Non-concrete roofs of a number houses in Naihati were blown off due to the impact of the explosion whereas glass panels of a number of houses including the municipality in Chinsurah came crashing down on the other side of the river.

The explosion occurred when the police were trying to diffuse material seized from a fire cracker factory in Naihati. According to police, the material was recovered from the factory. At least two police personnel who were trying to diffuse the explosive sustained injuries.

An enormous mushroom cloud was seen in videos of the explosion triggering panic among people who came out of their homes in both the districts. “Why was the impact of the explosion so high, we will investigate. A huge quantity of explosives was seized and the bomb disposal squad was trying to dispose them off,” Barrackpore Police Commissioner Manoj Verma said. The material was seized following an explosion in the cracker manufacturing unit on Janaury 3, killing four workers.

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeted videos of the explosion saying “it leaves nothing to imagination”.

“It calls for a thorough probe in view of its seriousness, intensity and damage caused. Only expert investigation can unearth the issues involved. This ominous development should be an eye-opener for law enforcing and regulatory regime in the State,” Mr. Dhankhar said.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she had sent the local MLA to Naihati to take stock of the situation. “If there are any cracks because of the explosion, we will provide compensation to the people,” she said

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh demanded probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Md. Salim said Ms. Banerjee was trying to fool people by describing places where crude bombs were made as cracker factories.

Experts blamed the lack of expertise and callousness of the police for the explosion. “What kind of explosive is there who knows? Two officers of CID who have done a short course on explosives were present and I think they had no expertise to determine what they were trying to diffuse,” Salil Bhattacharya, a retired police officer said. According to reports, the police had been diffusing explosives over the last few days and each time they did it was resulting in a loud explosion.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/explosion-in-naihati-rocks-both-banks-of-hooghly/article30528018.ece

Ms. Tehlan inaugurated the Prodezza event which was followed by an interactive talk session. She encouraged the audience to follow their passion and never settle for less.

This was followed by a performance by Rahul Subramanian. He left the crowd in splits with his humorous take on middle class struggles. The prime attraction of the day was a talk by filmmaker Anand Patwardhan. His recent documentary Reason was screened on the occasion.

‘Advaya’, a tech summit consisting of a series of lectures on topics like Artificial Intelligence and Ethical Hacking was conducted. Preliminary rounds of sports events such as Fury (Basketball), Rabona (Football), Strike and Pocket (Carroms) and Strike 3 (Volleyball) were also held.

314,2020/01/10,Stakeholders bat for more Emirates flights,"Concerns have been raised about the delay on the part of Dubai-based Emirates to resume the operation of wide-bodied aircraft from Calicut International Airport even as Air India is getting ready to resume the operation of jumbo jets from February 17.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had given No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the airline companies last July. This was after they had submitted reports on compatibility study and safety assessment for the purpose. At present, only Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) is operating wide-bodied aircraft after it secured the DGCA’s approval in December 2018.

Sources said that Emirates had been demanding additional seats after the airline shifted a flight service to Bengaluru from Thiruvananthapuram. “We have been urging the Ministry of Civil Aviation to sort out the issue for the benefit of air passengers of Malabar,” C.E. Chakkunny, president of Malabar Development Council and member of the Airport Advisory Committee, said.

He said that allowing additional flights for Emirates to operate from Calicut airport would benefit people from Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts as they had to depend on other connection flights or other airports.

However, many believe that the airline company is violating the bilateral air services agreement between India and UAE even after securing the approval of DGCA to operate flights from Calicut.

Emirates has been transferring flights to other points of call in India instead of recommencing the service at Calicut. Now, it is demanding 2,500 additional seats a week although it was given permission to conduct 11 services with 2,468 passengers, according to K.M. Basheer, president, Malabar Development Forum.

Emirates has secured the approval to operate Boeing 777-200 Extended Range, Boeing 777- 200 Long Range and Boeing 777-300 Extended Range. At the same time, Air India will operate Boeing 747-400, a wide-bodied jet airline, direct flight twice a week — Monday and Saturday.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/stakeholders-bat-for-more-emirates-flights/article30537813.ece
315,2020/01/10,Self-financing centres’ staff may lose jobs,"Around 300 employees of self-financing institutions directly run by Calicut University are staring at a bleak future with the authorities deciding not to renew their contracts after March 31.

According to K.P. Abdul Azeez, State joint secretary, Self-Financing College Teachers’ and Staff Association (SFCTSA), the varsity is terminating the services of such a large workforce at a time when the national trade unions had just participated in a day-long general strike raising demands such as better minimum wages and more benefits for contract employees.

“The problem lies in the fact that what Calicut University is doing now is likely to be followed by Kerala and Mahatma Gandhi Universities in the future,” Mr. Azeez said. SFCTSA functionaries said that those teaching and non-teaching employees had been working in around 45 study centres of the varsity offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses in engineering, paramedical subjects, and arts and science. They were spread across five districts and their work experience was in the range of five to 20 years. Normally, these persons were appointed on a one-year contract, which got extended later.

The university authorities, meanwhile, claimed that the decision was based on a Government Order (GO) that barred extending the services of temporary staff more than twice. The contract of temporary staff with fewer than three years of service would be extended, they said. Mr. Azeez disputed this claim saying that the order pertained to the staff in educational institutions that receive grant-in-aid from the Government. “Self-financing institutions don’t receive any such funding,” he said.

C.L. Joshi, Registrar, told The Hindu that the issue would be discussed at a meeting of the Syndicate in February. Ahead of that, SFCTSA authorities had been called for talks on January 20, he said.

The SFCTSA on January 6 held protests at various centres. On January 14, a day-night protest has been planned outside the administrative block of the university.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/self-financing-centres-staff-may-lose-jobs/article30530957.ece

318,2020/01/10,A dying business survives in some pockets of Madurai,"MADURAI

Kallanai village in Alanganallur panchayat is filled with festive spirit ahead of Pongal. Apart from preparations for the world-famous jallikattu here, the paddy fields, in colours ranging from light green to yellow, are ready for harvest.

Amidst this bustle, A. Raja’s ‘manda vellam’ (jaggery) unit on Kallanai Main Road, roars with life. While three men can be seen grinding sugarcane juice in large machines, others can be seen filling a large tub of 150 padi (over 250 kg) with juice. The juice is then heated up in a large iron vessel overnight with periodic stirring, says Mr. Raja.

After the juice is reduced to hot, bubbling brown sugar, it cools down to form lumps. Women sit in groups, shaping this substance into round jaggery and later store it in a dark room.

Mr. Raja’s unit, consisting of 20 labourers, works tirelessly during season – between late December and March. But that is not the only reason. “While it is of course an integral part of making the sweet pongal during the festival, we are also producing large amounts for our clients in Kerala,” he says.

Mr. Raja says that they have had to double their usual production to 540 kg each day in 2019 and 2020, in order to cater to a growing jaggery obsession among foreigners. “While white sugar is largely preferred among Indians, foreigners who come for yoga retreats prefer jaggery as it has far fewer chemicals and is good for health. It tastes best in good evening tea,” he says.

The entrepreneur says that his unit, which began two generations ago, is one of the few surviving businesses in this belt. “Making manda vellam is an art. Until five years ago, there were around 10 businesses in this area alone, making it competitive. Now, there is only my unit. Sugarcane production has not been excellent in Madurai in recent times, making procurement cost high and leading to shutting down of units,” he says.

He adds that he has been able to sustain his business only because of this growing demand for jaggery outside Tamil Nadu.

“We get orders directly to our units too but prefer giving it to the commission shops as we receive a steady income each day. Although we would like to continue year-round production, we tend to shut down because labourers demand up to ₹700 each day, making it unaffordable,” he says.

He adds that though there has been a recent turn-around to organic food, corporates are taking over the production of jaggery too and adding additives to give it a muddy colour. “Look at our sugar. It looks greenish-brown and later becomes darker with time. It is not perfectly brown. Take a sniff, the lump is heady with the smell of sugarcane. To get the best quality product, people have to buy directly. The cost will be low and the quality will be great. We too will find a way to sustain. ‘Farm to home’ will get its real meaning,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/t6wswa/article30537703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NA11MDUJAGGERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-dying-business-survives-in-some-pockets-of-madurai/article30537692.ece

321,2020/01/10,Bull tamers gear up for jallikattu,"MADURAI

It is a few minutes past noon and a group of young bull tamers is seen cautiously circling Kalaa, a black bull, at a farmland in Kottaimedu village near Alanganallur in Madurai district. Tense moments are witnessed as K. Karthikeyan (26) approaches Kalaa and successfully holds on to its hump for a brief period.

With less than a week left for jallikattu, the popular bull-taming sport held during Pongal, the bull tamers of ‘Jallikattu Training Centre’ have intensified their practice. The Centre, which was started in 2018 after the unprecedented protest against the ban on the rural sport across Tamil Nadu, is training bull tamers and preparing them to enter the arena.

Around 200 bull tamers from Madurai, Tiruchi, Sivaganga and Dindigul districts, who are currently members of this Centre, undergo training at different locations every week.

President of the Centre B. Manikandaprabu, who has been participating in jallikattu events since 1998 and has won several prizes, says the Centre was started to train bull tamers and reduce ‘accidents’ in the arena. “Through this Centre, experienced players teach techniques and share their expertise with young bull tamers. If players know how to approach a running bull and in what position they need to stand in the arena, it will reduce ‘accidents’,” he says.

Since the jallikattu protests of 2017, there is an increasing interest among youngsters to participate in the rural sport, says Mr. Karthikeyan. “Since my young age, I was fascinated by bulls. But, it was only after the protests that I decided that I should become a bull tamer,” he says.

Many educated youth are also showing interest in the sport, says K. Saravanan, a postgraduate in Commerce. “The myth that only uneducated play jallikattu is changing,” he says.

The Centre also wants to create a team of trained bull tamers for the future, says P. Ranjith, its State secretary. “This is a traditional sport of Tamil Nadu and by training youngsters, we can ensure that the legacy is taken forward,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/n3264n/article30536705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA11MDUJALLIKATTUTRAINING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bull-tamers-gear-up-for-jallikattu-madurai/article30536674.ece
322,2020/01/10,DMK moves HC seeking police protection for new councillors,"MADURAI

Former DMK Minister ‘Sattur’ Ramachandran moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday seeking a direction to the State to provide police protection to newly elected councillors belonging to the party in Virudhunagar district, who are to cast their votes in the indirect elections on Saturday.

In his petition, K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, DMK MLA of Aruppukottai constituency, alleged that functionaries of the ruling AIADMK were using their influence and trying to abduct some of the elected DMK members. The DMK members were being prevented from exercising their right to vote in the indirect election to the posts of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of District Panchayats and Panchayat Unions.

He said that he had already sent a representation to the authorities concerned to provide police protection to the elected members. However, there was no response from them, he said.

During the course of the hearing of the petition, the State government informed a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran that the representations made in this regard were being considered individually. Protection would be given to those who had complained of such a threat, the Bench was informed. Taking note of the submission, the court disposed of the petition.

Meanwhile, Justice A.D.

323,2020/01/10,‘Bombay’ Jayashree sings effortlessly,"Presenting her songs effortlessly, with accompaniments, noted vocalist Bombay Jayashree staged a concert to a packed auditorium at Lakshmi Sundaram Hall, as a part of the 68th Annual Music Festival of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam.

The vocalist then rendered ‘Marugelara O raghava,’ in Jayantashree by Saint Tyagaraja, in which Tyagaraja explains that he has perceived Lord Rama as everything and emphasises his monotheist belief.

Then she went on to sing ‘Najiv adharanan Omu phalama’, in raga Bilahari, in which Sri Tyagaraja ecstatically describes the Lord to be everything to him. Jayashree sang with brisk alapana, which inspired the violinist to follow suit with his version of it, which was applauded by the rasikas.

The vocalist selected Todi raga for the evening. She explored the interesting complexities of Todi effortlessly and built the alapana meticulously for Shyama Shastri’s ‘Ninne namminanu’, with excellent support from the accompaniments to a resounding applause.

325,2020/01/10,No collective conscience on waste segregation yet,"It is only seven in the cold morning of January. But conservancy workers M. Veeramma and R. Muniammal are already up and about, collecting waste door-to-door at Kannanendal, ward 25 of Madurai Corporation. They do the rounds in a light commercial vehicle, which repeatedly plays a message, urging people to segregate waste before dumping. The waste collected is taken to the micro composting centre (MCC) in Menendal where wet waste is decomposed to produce manure.

As bins are being emptied at the centre, Ms. Veeramma digs her hand deep into a green bin filled with wet waste to fish out a shiny toffee wrapper. “Though we ask people to segregate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, not many do it. So it becomes impossible to achieve 100% waste segregation,” she says.

With Kannanendhal having been declared a ‘model ward,’ in a move to make Madurai a ‘binless city, the Corporation is focusing on implementing solid waste management rules. But total compliance has not been achieved despite awareness campaigns. This has affected production of manure at the micro composting centre, an important component of decentralised waste management system.

Only a single dumper bin is present in the ward near Kannanendal bus terminus. Conservancy workers collect waste door-to-door on light commercial and battery-operated vehicles.

Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, stipulate that residents must segregate wet, dry, electronic and hazardous waste. While wet waste is decomposed at the MCC to produce manure, dry waste is sent to the Corporation dump at Vellaikkal, and hazardous and electronic waste is given to authorised collectors. Conservancy workers sell recyclable plastic products found in dry waste to traders and share the money among themselves.

Challenges

Corporation officials say only 70% of households in Kannanendal segregate waste. S. Muniandi, a resident of G.R. Nagar Fourth Street, says he has been segregating wet and dry waste. “There is a visible change in the last two months, as many households in the area have started segregating waste at source,” he says.

However, a good number of residents do not segregate waste, says N. Chinnarasu, a conservancy worker. “When we ask them to segregate waste, they shout at us saying that it is not their job but ours,” he says.

Many of these workers do not have gloves to handle the waste. “We wrap a piece of cloth or plastic cover around our arms,” says a worker.

After non-segregation of waste, the next major problem with the residents is that they dump dry, hazardous and electronic waste together.

“We know that sanitary and harardous waste, like napkins, diapers and damaged electronic gadgets, have to be segregated at source. But, lack of bins and time constraints are the main reasons for our not being able to follow it. Also, conservancy workers do not insist on it and they dump all waste together,” says Mr. Muniandi.

A Corporation official says that as part of the initial phase, they are trying to inculcate the practice of segregating wet waste, which goes to the MCC. “Once this becomes successful, we will start asking people to segregate waste into four categories. Also, we want the conservancy workers to get familiarised with this concept first,” the official says.

What happens to waste?

The wet waste from households is shredded and dumped into cubical cement tanks for decomposition. It is then dried and sieved to produce manure. The Corporation official says around 1.5 tonnes of wet waste is processed in the centre every day. “Around 750 kg of manure has been produced at the MCC in Menendhal, which has been functioning for the past two months. Interested people can purchase the manure free of cost from us,” says the official.

The manure is also used for raising saplings near the centre, using the Miyawaki method, a Japanese technique used to raise dense forests.

But wrappers of toffees, betel nut and foil papers were found in the dry manure.

“A 100% waste segregation at source by the residents is the only way to produce completely organic manure,” says Ms. Muniammal.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says the civic body has been carrying out various awareness campaigns on waste segregation. “It is a shared responsibility and only if the residents cooperate can the mission be successful,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6xwvxj/article30530962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MADump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/no-collective-conscience-on-waste-segregation-yet/article30530964.ece

331,2020/01/10,What is the state of ‘open source’ in India today?,"The open source movement, which has focused on democratising technology access, has over a two-decade history in India. In a conversation moderated by Jacob Koshy, Venkatesh Hariharan (Senior Fellow, IDFC Institute) and Sangeeta Gupta (VP, National Association of Software and Services Companies) discuss its relevance to digital technology, privacy, and software patenting. Edited excerpts:

Open source (OS) has been a part and parcel of software programming and code development for a while. Since the advent of Linux (an OS operating system) in the 1990s, what do you think is the state of the OS movement in India now?

Venkatesh Hariharan: When we started the campaign for more OS in 2000, we had political, cultural and economic reasons to believe it was important. Politically, we wanted to ensure more diversity in the kind of players that existed in the market with twin objectives: that we were independent from a technology standpoint and that software was localised to Indian languages. From a cost perspective, if we were dependent on multinational companies for core technology like operating systems, that would have been a drain on the exchequer. So that was the logic. Today, some of the largest e-governance projects and start-ups in India are running on OS. The early days when we had to campaign for people to use OS is over; now we are in a new era where OS is the new normal.

Sangeeta Gupta: In the initial years, there was a lot of focus on OS versus proprietary. From a NASSCOM perspective, we’ve always believed that while it’s important for us to promote OS, it’s also important to give users a choice: do they want OS or some other proprietary software? I think some government decisions helped propel OS adoption in India. One [reason] why OS was held back in the early years was the lack of capability in fixing technical issues that OS software could bring in versus using proprietary software, which your regular vendor also knew how to fix, such as a Microsoft Office or a Windows. That is what has happened now with the democratisation of technologies, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) — OS has become much more mainstream.

Do you think proprietary forms have co-opted OS? Yes, sharing software and tweaking source code happens, but largely have major tech companies monopolised OS?

VH: The commercial support for OS ensures that people can use it in mission-critical applications like the stock exchange or e-government applications. That has played a major role in boosting the adoption of OS. Now, if you look at the amount of code that has been written, in the initial days OS was an imitation of proprietary software or a replacement for it. For instance, Linux as an alternative to NetWare or Unix for Microsoft. The pace of innovation in OS, because of its collaborative nature, outstrips that in proprietary software. So, if you look at the current areas of explosive growth such as Big Data and analytics, the pace of innovation in OS is so rapid that there is no proprietary competitor. We are in an OS 2.0 era where we are no longer catching up with proprietary software; we have leapfrogged. We see the pragmatism of Microsoft joining the open invention network. And now what they are realising is that OS is not a competitor, but maybe an OpenOffice is a competitor to Microsoft Office.

One of the things about OS was that it would democratise code creation and train coders to use basic tools to make commercial products. Do you think the government and the tech industry have done enough to promote OS technologies and introduce them in school and engineering curricula?

SG: Software education in universities in India continues to lag behind. But it’s good to see the All India Council for Technical Education and others introduce new courses on some of the newer technology areas. NASSCOM is trying to do a number of things to upskill software developers and students and bring in the industry-academia connect.

The promise of OS was that programmers everywhere could learn to code and apply them to various contexts. But India has few creators and is mostly a passive consumer of technology. Have barriers imposed by language along with limited access to technical education sharpened the digital divide?

VH: The digital divide has been bridged: the mobile phone is in the hands of an estimated 800 million people today. It’s the first computing device that they have been introduced to. Combine this with the fact that bandwidth has become far cheaper in India. Among the largest YouTube channels are three Indian channels. That has also changed a lot of things in terms of consuming technical content, which is relevant to OS. We also need to work on the mindset of people. We are in an era where people have to continuously update themselves.

SG: When we look at the digital divide, I think the first part of it is about access, where you may have your low-hanging use cases like entertainment. This access has been addressed to a great extent because [content on] the computer was once only in the English language. The computer was expensive and was meant for people who could afford it. I think the ability of the smartphone combined with cheap data has enabled a lot of access for people. I believe, by the use cases, people are starting with entertainment and some other things. There is hope that we will get into more effective usage, whether it’s for healthcare or education. Some of these will be locally built for India. And some of these may be solutions that we will adopt from other markets. But I do believe that many of these entertainment apps have played a role in removing the fear of technology from people’s minds.

There was a time when debates around OS and proprietary used to be around the patenting of software. We’re in the era of AI, machine learning, Internet of Things. But multinationals continue to be the biggest patentees in India. We’ve moved into a post-OS era. Are debates around software patenting even relevant now?

VH: We will continue to see pressure on the Indian government to allow for patenting of software. The law says that software per se is not patentable. But the interpretation of ‘per se’ has been twisted and that game of football has been going on for almost a decade now. The intent of Parliament was that software shouldn’t be patentable. The reason we will continue to see pushback by multinational companies is because these are the largest patent holders anywhere in the world and the balance of power and software patentees is with them. If patents are allowed in India, they will be able to charge royalties from domestic software technology players. There are billions of dollars at stake for this and it is never going to go away unless the Indian government removes the term ‘per se’ from Section 3(k) of the Indian Patent Act.

SG: I agree. But given that we are living in a world still dominated by companies, India needs to invest in building its own intellectual property. And that means we need to have our own patents. We see a number of Indian service companies patenting whatever products or solutions they are building in the U.S. and other key markets. So I don’t see this as an era where patents will not exist; I think patents will become an even more important tool for supremacy or whatever you want to call it in this new technology era.

When these initial debates were happening in the '90s, it was a world of globalisation. But now we have more trade barriers and authoritarianism. So should India get more serious about patenting?

VH: We’re living in an era where data is abundant and I look at the commonality between code and data. The ideals of the OS movement were about collaboration and the shared ownership of knowledge. And within that context, the proliferation of data and the fact that it’s only a few players who are able to monetise that data means that we now need to move to an era where it’s not just a few platforms that benefit from our data, but that individuals are able to leverage and are empowered with their own data. So, in a sense, I see a commonality with the OS movement in that even a college student sitting in Sweden or any other part of the world should be able to write an operating system that can be used in any part of the world. Now, we should be able to build systems where individuals can take control of their data and be in control of how other people monetise it and leverage it for loans, etc.

Privacy, or the lack of it, is the dominant concern around the technology debate. What can the OS movement contribute, beyond activism and legislative participation, to make ordinary Indians more informed about protecting their privacy?

VH: Clearly we need new approaches. What might happen in the next few years is that there will be AI tools which will act as personal data brokers between me and the platform so that I need not surrender my privacy to access book and music recommendations from platforms. Many of these tools will be built on the back of OS. And the other bit of it is that the platforms that are being built in India, like the account aggregator, are built on top of OS. The idea and intent is to give people more control over data.

SG: The data privacy issue requires every creator to build trust. Trust is going to be an important feature for any data-led industry as we move forward. There are two or three different roles that the OS sector could play. One is organisations like the Mozilla Foundation, which is doing a lot of good work in demystifying what privacy notices mean for the average user and how they could make privacy-aware decisions. The second is when you create tools that will help organisations either enhance their compliance on privacy or create an intermediary between me and the organisation that is providing me the tools or software to do that. The third can be about building privacy-maturity discussions or building frameworks. OS has a key role to play.

Do you think legislation will help regulate the scene?

SG: Legislation is important; there is the Data Protection Bill. Our focus at NASSCOM has also been about practices. It should not only be about regulations. Whether you have the right practices that will help comply with these regulations is equally, if not more, important.

VH: The government has two roles. One, lawmakers have to ensure that they pass laws that benefit citizens. And the second is that the government is also one of the largest data controllers apart from platforms. So what kind of governance they have around the data is going to be a really critical part of the data ecosystem in India.

332,2020/01/10,Teaching research ethics better,"Years after ignoring the elephant in the room, the UGC has finally made it compulsory for PhD scholars to take up a course on research and publication ethics as part of their pre-registration course work. Effective from the coming academic session, the course carries two credits and entails 30 teaching hours. It covers several aspects of research conduct, publication ethics and misconduct, open access publishing and databases, and research metrics. But on closer scrutiny, it looks like the course will not help much. It will create “awareness about publication ethics and misconduct” but it will not equip students to steer clear of unethical research practices. For instance, ‘scientific conduct’ deals with a range of issues that research students might face during research. This includes plagiarism, falsification and fabrication, misrepresentation of data, selective reporting, duplicate publication, and segregation of data and publishing as multiple papers. All this is to be magically covered in just five hours.

Substantial copying of text from previously published papers and even paraphrasing without due citation are quite common in papers published from India, particularly from state universities. The introduction of plagiarism-checking software in most universities and compulsory checking for plagiarism prior to paper publication by most journals has largely addressed the problem.

Preparing images

While the course does cover data falsification and fabrication, there is no mention of teaching researchers the basics of preparing images for publication. While certain changes to images are acceptable, hundreds of papers are corrected or retracted every year for image duplication and manipulation. Unlike plagiarism, journals have woken up to inappropriately altered images and manipulation only since the early 2000s.

As Dr. Elisabeth M. Bik and others had noted in a June 2016 paper in the journal mBio, the instances of “inappropriately duplicated images” suddenly peaked in 2003 and has been 4-5% since then. Over 8,100 papers screened from PLOS One for a 16-month period from 2013 to 2014 revealed that papers published from India had 1.93-fold higher probability of containing “problematic images”, the highest in the world.

Unlike in the case of data falsification and fabrication, duplication and manipulation of images is relatively easy to identify post-publication. That PubPeer, a website that allows independent scientists to publish post-publication review of scientific papers, is flooded with reviews of papers with questionable images is proof that the scientific community has become alert to a malice that has so far been largely overlooked.

A big Indian problem

In India, dozens of papers with questionable images have been published by researchers from a few Council of Scientific and Industrial Research labs, and reputed institutions such as IIT-Dhanbad, the Indian Institute of Science, and Bose Institute. It is far worse in the case of state universities. Recently, Dr. Bik identified problematic images and plagiarised text in over 200 papers from Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu. Several papers from Periyar University in Tamil Nadu and Banaras Hindu University too can be found on PubPeer.

The magnitude of the problem can be judged by scanning the largest database of retracted papers maintained by the Retraction Watch blog. The blog reveals that of the 1,050 papers from India retracted since the 1970s, 330 have been for plagiarism and nearly 200 for image duplication and/or manipulation. There is no ballpark figure for papers corrected for problematic images. Though the U.S. and China have the most number of journal papers retracted, India has a higher rate of retractions, says a paper in Science.

If UGC is serious about teaching research and publication ethics, it should make scientific conduct and publication ethics separate courses with sufficient teaching hours or retain it as a single course and devote more time to teach research ethics and include image preparation as part of the course.

333,2020/01/10,Political cartoons in the age of memes,"The job of the editorial cartoonist has changed considerably since the advent of social media. The editorial cartoon used to be placed on a pedestal; this is no longer the case.

With the advent of 24X7 news channels, access to breaking news stopped being the privilege of the newsroom. Since an editorial cartoonist’s job is to observe and comment through the comic medium, the exclusivity of observation was the first loss. What they still retained, however, was the space for response, the hallowed political cartoon space. At the time, political cartoons did not evolve to the video format beyond the occasional Gustakhi Maaf (a TV programme with puppets). The cartoon space of important newspapers could inform readers what political news was ‘trending’ the previous day. Cartoons began to be shared via email and became ‘viral’ in the email era. All these changes only served to make the cartoonist’s space more sacrosanct.

But social media changed all that. Today, everybody has a space to respond. And there is no exclusivity of observation whatsoever. At times, a child sitting in his bedroom can access expert opinions of distinguished journalists more quickly than an editorial cartoonist can while sitting in a newsroom. He can also respond to it without being bound by the necessary drawing skills. In other words, with the creation of memes, the cartoonist’s life has changed forever.

Today we live at a time where the ‘one point witty comment’ space has become the most crowded and dynamic space on the Internet. Observations in this space are not always commonplace; they are often deep and insightful. In fact, some of the most profound observations come from regular people with a small number of followers. All these changes have forced cartoonists to reflect not just on political affairs, but the space they occupy in political humour.

These rapid changes have also pushed cartoonists from the cosy and exclusive gentleman’s club into the muck of unfiltered online commentary. This can be a harrowing experience, but often liberating too. Having your ego shattered a hundred times a day can educate you but also free you in a way.

However, not all is bad. I find memes and web cartoons a great way to exercise my brain. A lot of stray comments serve as inspiration for my work, and college students are sometimes my mentors. People ask me to address specific issues, so there is constant feedback. And amidst all the trolling I deal with, I also receive really positive comments.

The political climate is also important for cartoonists. What has really changed over the last decade or so is the manner in which cartoonists have been censored. India once again finds itself in an authoritarian regime without a sense of humour. Cartoonists want to say a lot but are often silenced by editors, trolls, political parties and the worst of them all, Sections 124A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code.

We find solace in the fact that the best work and the most dynamic ways of resistance always come in the worst of times. Cartoonists must balance the dual task of being neutral and witty political observers and being activists who constantly push boundaries and attempt to reclaim lost spaces through innovation and persistence. These are not easy times, but they sure are exciting times.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/cartoon/hkn3zq/article30449760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01SatwikCartoonscape,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/political-cartoons-in-the-age-of-memes/article30525504.ece
334,2020/01/10,CDS and the path to jointmanship,"The announcement on a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) last year and the appointment of Gen. Bipin Rawat as the first CDS has been one of the key policy decisions made by the Narendra Modi government in its second term. In the aftermath of an emphatic election victory in May 2019, Mr. Modi pushed the needle on a long-pending reform for the establishment of a CDS, which was recommended by the Kargil Review Committee in 2001. The CDS will be “first among equals” in that he will consult and solicit the views of the services, but the final judgment will be the CDS’s alone and he will be the principal military adviser to the Defence Minister.

The role here will be confined to the acquisition matters exclusive to each service and won’t extend to the procurement of big-ticket items such as warships or fighter aircraft, which will remain under firm control of the Department of Defence (DoD). The CDS will be the single-point military adviser to the Defence Minister on matters involving all three services and the service chiefs will be obliged to confine their counsel to issues pertaining to their respective services. The CDS is also vested with the authority to provide directives to the three chiefs.

A chief as well as an adviser

Additionally, the CDS will lead the Department of Military Affairs (DoMA) dealing with the three services. Gen. Rawat will enjoy the rank of Secretary within the DoD and his powers will be confined to only the revenue budget. However, he is vested with the authority in prioritising inter-service procurement decisions as Permanent Chairman-Chiefs of Staff Committee. While the CDS does not enjoy any command authority, in his capacity as DoMA, he will wield control over issues governing promotions, travel, appointment to key posts, and overseas assignments. Consequently, the CDS will enjoy a substantial amount of influence. He will also perform an advisory role in the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA). Above all, his core function will be to foster greater operational synergy between the three service branches of the Indian military and keep inter-service frictions to a minimum. Fundamentally, the CDS will perform two roles, as the single point military advisor to the Defence Minister and as head of the DoMA.

With his inauguration as India’s first CDS last year, Gen. Rawat has hit the ground running with some important announcements. He has sought the establishment of an Air Defence Command (ADC) by directing the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) to develop a proposal by June 30. An integrated ADC will enable nationwide coverage, prevent fratricide in the event of war and sustain jointmanship in air defence operations. In addition, Gen. Rawat has declared his intention to synergise logistics support, particularly in areas where two or more services are co-located.

Three main challenges

Gen. Rawat faces three main challenges. First, there are concerns over matters relating to service parochialism, though there have been no initial indications in this regard. If he privileges support for the Army, his parent service, he is likely to put himself on a collision course with the Naval and Air Force chiefs. A corollary is that as an infantry officer, he may become susceptible to bias in matters concerning procurement decisions or personnel issues focused on the infantry. The latter outcome could vitiate his capacity to address the needs of the armour and artillery corps. Any parochialism could potentially derail the primary objective of creating the CDS — promoting synergy and shaping acquisition priorities both within and between the services. Indeed, one of the tasks the CDS is to avoid wasteful expenditure and duplication of equipment in the inventories of the services.

But, the CDS’s role is not simply about tri-service cooperation, it is equally about fostering better cooperation between the MoD bureaucracy and the services and ensuring that projected and planned acquisitions of the services do not exceed capital allocations. A secondary challenge stems from the sheer levels of manpower in the Indian Army, which is the service that consumes the lion’s share of the defence budget. As it is a manpower-intensive fighting force, pruning the number of personnel in the Army will remain perhaps the most vexed challenge for possibly the entirety of Gen. Rawat’s tenure. This will demand innovation, given the fact that infantry-based operations geared for counterinsurgency warfare, which a large part of the Army is dedicated to undertaking, are manpower intensive.

There are no instant remedies, but one pointer is towards greater investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the long term, a process that has already begun, but will require a dedicated push from the CDS over the course of his tenure. The application of AI technology is likely to lend itself to tanks and artillery systems, as is visibly evident from the vigorous pursuit of AI by China’s People’s Liberation Army.

The final challenge facing the CDS will be the extent to which he can encourage the services to support indigenisation. Cost saving is not simply about reducing manpower in the Army, it is equally about getting all the services, particularly the capital-intensive services, to rally behind a committed enterprise to support the native Research and Development for production and eventual deployment of weapons systems, which when procured from abroad drive a massive hole in the budget.

335,2020/01/10,A continent on fire: on Australia wildfires,"Australia’s catastrophic fire season that began in August last year is unprecedented, and has caused large scale destruction, mainly in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Fire is no stranger to the dry continent’s woodlands, but the inferno this time has devastated over 10 million hectares of land, killing at least 25 people and tens of millions of animals, besides forcing the evacuation of entire communities. Shocking images of kangaroos burnt in their tracks as they tried to flee and koalas desperately escaping the fire are indelibly imprinted in the consciousness of people around the world. This is a moment of reckoning for Australia. The government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has sought to downplay the impact of changing climate, is struggling to pacify angry citizens who are calling for a reconsideration of the country’s relationship with fossil fuels. Warnings have been sounded by scientists that even with a global average temperature rise of 1°C, the raging fires have engulfed an area the size of Switzerland. In a world set to warm at least half a degree more in coming decades, Australia’s encounters with devastating fires could become more frequent, perhaps even once in eight years, making large parts of the continent uninhabitable. The current fire season presents a cross-roads, and a wise choice would be to move to a greener future, one that strengthens an already diverse economy through innovation.

As scientists have been pointing out for years, the coal industry has a sway over politics in Australia that is disproportionate to its share of economic production. This was evident when Mr. Morrison held up a big piece of the black rock in Parliament in a gesture to highlight its economic importance. The display may have reassured the mining industry, which has torpedoed a profits tax in the past, but it shocked researchers who worry about greenhouse gas emissions increasing in Australia, and in countries to which it exports the fuel. Credentialled specialists at the country’s Climate Council have had to crowdsource funds to continue their work after the official Climate Commission was shut down by the government six years ago. Today, they are raising the alarm over the lowest ever rainfall recorded in parts of NSW and Queensland, and high peak temperatures, producing a tinderbox effect across the large Murray-Darling Basin. The situation is bound to worsen without policy change, as temperatures are predicted to soar to 50°C. Over the past half century, the number of hot days and very hot days each year have steadily increased. It would be tragic if this scientific insight is ignored. Long-term prosperity for Australians and a future for its charismatic animals can be secured only through policies that foster environmental protection.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-continent-on-fire/article30526610.ece
336,2020/01/10,Mining deep: on Cabinet easing mining laws,"The Centre’s decision to liberalise norms for entry into coal mining and relax regulations on mining and selling coal in the country is significant in many respects. Amendments to two legacy Acts through the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 cleared by the Cabinet on Wednesday will free the sector from restrictions that were inhibiting its development. This will open up the coal mining sector completely, enabling anyone with finances and expertise to bid for blocks and sell the coal freely to any buyer of their choice. Until now there were restrictions on who could bid for coal mines — only those in power, iron and steel and coal washery business could bid for mines — and the bidders needed prior experience of mining in India. This effectively limited the potential bidders to a select circle of players and thus limited the value that the government could extract from the bidding. Second, end-use restrictions inhibited the development of a domestic market for coal. The ordinance essentially democratises the coal industry and makes it attractive for merchant mining companies, including multinationals such as BHP and Rio Tinto, to look at India. The move was overdue considering that the country spent a huge ₹1,71,000 crore in coal imports last year to buy 235 million tonnes; of that, 100 million tonnes was not substitutable, as the grade was not available in India, but the balance 135 million tonnes could have been substituted by domestic production had it been available.

Large investment in mining will create jobs and set off demand in critical sectors such as mining equipment and heavy commercial vehicles. The country may also benefit from infusion of sophisticated mining technology, especially for underground mines, if multinationals decide to invest. However, for that to happen, the government needs to do more such as whittling the time taken for approvals of mining leases and also easing the procedures for clearances. The test would come when 46 producing mines, whose leases expire in March, come up for bidding shortly. The opening up of coal mining effectively ends Coal India’s (CIL) monopoly status. Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi took care to emphasise that CIL has been and will be allotted adequate blocks and that it will be supported and the interests of labourers will be taken care of.

337,2020/01/10,A nation losing democratic steam,"These are bewildering times for members of civil society in countries bordering India, who are no longer able to appeal to New Delhi on the platform of reason, pluralism and even humanity. When New Delhi appeared arrogant or tone-deaf in the past, there were ways to make yourself heard, but today there is a silencing within that weakens not only the spirit of India, but the prospects of peace in South Asia.

While the first term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw adventurism, from demonetisation within to blockade without, his re-elected government seems intent on changing the face of India through majoritarian intolerance under the banner of Hindutva. While putting fear in minority communities, this trajectory is also accelerating India’s economic decline and weakening New Delhi’s international influence.

A geopolitical folly

While the adoption of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December has triggered India-wide dissent, it began as an act of geopolitical folly. For domestic appeasement, Home Minister Amit Shah and Mr. Modi brought forth a Bill that essentially accused three selected countries of discrimination against their Hindu, Jain, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi minorities. In one stroke, New Delhi distanced itself from the friendly state establishments of Dhaka and Kabul, and deepened the divide with Islamabad.

Even discounting the fact that residents of glass houses must resist the urge to throw stones, this was an unexpected accusation. While no South Asian country is free of majoritarian discrimination, the concern of New Delhi’s rulers was clearly not the well-being of the minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who have been in fact been made more vulnerable by the Act. The Indian authorities did not engage in sustained international effort to address the issue, such as through the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues. The appropriate approach here would have been to join the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees, and to be open to foreigners of any faith or persuasion who seek refuge. To cherry-pick among non-citizens on the basis of religion was crass.

Now, the human rights community and intelligentsia in the neighbouring countries are left in an awkward position when challenging the CAA’s selectivity — their interest is to promote inclusion within rather than demand that India become an ‘equal-opportunity’ host for Muslims as well. Nevertheless, one must challenge India’s Home Ministry as to why the CAA ignored the larger number of Muslims of different sects enduring sectarian strife. These include Ahmadiyya and Shia, particularly Hazara, of Pakistan and Ahmadiyya and Bihari Muslims of Bangladesh. And why ignore the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India and the vulnerable Rohingya of Myanmar?

In reality, the adoption of the CAA is just a way-station on the Hindutva highway, which considers not just modern-day India but all of the notional ‘Jambudvipa’ as the Hindu homeland. Those galloping along this highway believe in a selective rendering of a Hindu subcontinent overrun by invaders from the northwest. This exclusivist project seeks to paint the variegated belief system of ‘Hinduism’ with a broad ideological brushstroke. Faith has been turned on its head, becoming less a quest for spiritualism. Many god-men, god-women, gurus and babas have boarded this Hindutva wagon, notably the mahant of Gorakhnath temple who is now also the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister.

The Indian establishment has thus super-charged its social engineering campaign, specifically targeting the country’s Muslim citizenry. The campaign started with the revocation of the autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir, followed by the Ayodhya verdict that privileged mass belief over evidence. The enactment of the CAA and the scheme to confirm citizenship through the National Register of Citizens is part of the plan.

Hunger for political power

Of course, India’s population of 200 million-plus Muslims will not be going anywhere. India is their homeland, and they have no extra-territorial magnet similar to Israel vis-à-vis the Jewish people. One searches, therefore, for an explanation as to why Indian society has thus been led to the cliff’s edge. This seems to be motivated by nothing more than a hunger for political power using religion and ultra-nationalism as tools. Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have essentially lined up behind Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory, leaving India’s Muslims emotionally drained and fearful.

In a world increasingly defined by populist ultra-nationalism, seen in the ascent of figures like Donald Trump, Rodrigo Duterte and Jair Bolsonaro, India with its ancient-civilisational and modern-Gandhian heritage should have been framing the democratic response to myriad pressing issues, from global warming to nuclear weaponisation. A confident, egalitarian-minded India would also have been leading the discourse on international migration and challenging China for its internment camps for Uighurs and for using facial recognition technology for surveillance. Instead, we have a regime whose topmost leader terms Muslim immigrants as ‘termites’ fit to be dumped into the Bay of Bengal; which keeps Rohingya refugees away with threats of deportation; and which is itself rushing to catch up with Beijing in building internment camps and using facial recognition and drones to control dissent.

Looking at India from the outside, we see a ruling establishment that values mythology more than history and a society losing its scientific edge, its great universities being run to the ground. India under Mr. Modi is losing democratic steam, with its weakened courts, progressively politicised military, and a police force and investigating agencies that are willing instruments of power-brokers. Many of us have been there, done that.

The genie that has been released through the enactment of the CAA must be forced back into the bottle, taking into consideration the sheer scale of human tragedy possible in the subcontinent. And, while the ongoing countrywide dissent against the CAA by lay-citizens has been spontaneous and heartfelt, it may not be enough to challenge a party that has just been elected with an overwhelming majority for a five-year term.

Seeking greater federalism

One used to regard India’s Central government as the protector of citizens when the States went renegade, but what happens when the Centre goes rogue? Devolution of power and authentic federalism is clearly the solution for human dignity and social justice in a country as vast and diverse as India. Here, as a former Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi could have set an example as the great federalist Prime Minister. Instead, he has presided over a further Centralisation of governmental power, with the Hindutva agenda part and parcel of this process.

And this is why it is vital to recognise the institutional resistance to the CAA emerging from the States run by non-BJP parties. Amidst the gloom, one sees in the State-side reaction not only an immediate response to the CAA, but the glimmer of possibilities of a longer-term restructuring of the Indian state towards governance that is more accountable to the people. The centripetal force represented by Narendra Modi requires a centrifugal counter from the States of India.

338,2020/01/10,Dialling down tensions,"Fortunately, better counsel has prevailed and U.S. has backed away from escalating the conflict (Front page, “Trump backs away from further conflict after Iran hits U.S. troops,” Jan. 9). The truth behind the diametrically opposite claims of “minimal damage” by U.S. and “80 American terrorists” having been killed by Iran may or may not be known immediately. But, the world has heaved a sigh of relief that a disastrous war has been averted. As it has taken the revenge for the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Tehran should desist from issuing further threats. It would be in the best interests of the volatile region for Iran to make peace with the U.S. As President Donald Trump has called upon the other signatories of the earlier nuclear accord to work for a new deal, Iran should also come forward to negotiate a fresh accord.

339,2020/01/10,JNU V-C should resign,"After remaining absent for long when a set of his students were attacked by masked hooligans with allegiance to right-wing elements, it is uncharitable that Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar advised the affected students to bury the past. Looking at the manner in which the events took place — goons were allowed free entry into the campus; the security guards and the police acted as mute spectators to the gruesome attacks; and electricity was cut off for some time — we can deduce that the administration must have had some knowledge of what was in store. Mr. Kumar should submit his resignation immediately, in deference to the wishes of the students and teachers.

340,2020/01/10,Deepika’s gesture,"Deepika Padukone’s gesture of solidarity with the JNU students conveyed the message that even those who cannot be described as ‘political animals’ have made common cause with the protesters to preserve India’s cherished values. Despite the risks involved in these days of muscular nationalism and Hindu revivalism, the fine and famous film star had the courage of her convictions. The stand taken by a celebrity like Padukone should make the BJP and the Modi government to sit up and take notice.

By her gesture of letting herself being flanked by Kanhaiya Kumar and Aishe Ghosh at JNU, the screen idol erred on the side of humanity and lent her support to the people’s movement for preserving the ‘Idea of India’ predicated on secularism and pluralism. It was no surprise that the bigoted and narrow-minded supporters of Hindu Right trolled her online for her ‘support to the tukde-tukde gang’ and favoured the boycott of her upcoming film Chhapaak in which she is featured as an acid attack victim.

Unlike other superstars who continue to maintain a studied silence on issues of existential importance, Padukone chose to stand up and be counted. We wish celebrities emulate Padukone and join the ongoing protests to halt India’s drift towards a majoritarian state. Silence when speaking out is called for and becomes a duty can be tantamount to acquiescence in wrongdoing.

Much of the turbulence that India currently undergoes can be safely ascribed to the ruling party’s mistaken belief that the great nation of ours belongs only to upper caste Hindus with inherited privileges and its all-out attempts to impose Hindutva hegemony on the polity. Nobody has the divine right to say that India is the ancestral property of the self-styled nationalists and it does not belong equally to all of us.

The BJP peddles xenophobia and virulent nationalism to gain acceptability for its hold on power and tighten it. But more and more people now realise that the BJP and the Modi government are pulling the country backwards by attempting to fulfil the ‘majoritarian’ agenda set by the RSS instead of pushing it forward with concrete action to improve the human development indices. It is encouraging that women are participating in large numbers in the protests to save India from drifting into a state where citizens are graded on the basis of creed (religion), caste and class.

Deepika Padukone’s visit to the JNU on Tuesday, in solidarity with the students injured in Sunday’s attack in the campus, has evoked unnecessary controversy. It did not take long for Internet trolls to take a cue and get all riled up, calling for a boycott of her upcoming movie. We have a democracy; any common person, not just an artiste, can go anywhere and express his/her opinion and even dissent. There should not be any objection to it by anybody either in the government or the Opposition. Even the electronic media debated on this unwarranted issue and wasted precious time. Instead of taking up such issues, the media is duty-bound to organise debates on important and alarming issues linked to unemployment, economic slowdown, poverty, hunger and law and order being faced by masses.

341,2020/01/10,Centrist bias,"The founders of the Indian Constitution cannot be faulted for framing a Constitution with an explicit ‘Centrist bias’, considering the background of Partition (Op-ed page, “The Indian Constitution’s unitary tilt,” Nov. 9). Perhaps they hoped that the democratic process would deepen in the years to come and electoral reforms would follow. This has not happened, as amply revealed by the lack of any meaningful electoral reforms. A single-party dominance would not have occurred had India switched to proportional representation. As a consequence, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which secured 37.36% of votes, is now in a position to initiate changes which have far-reaching implications. The declaration of a few States that they will not implement the Centre’s moves on citizenship is unlikely to have any significant impact. More than legality, it is the fiscal dimension that is going to dampen the activism of States. In India’s fiscal federalism, powers are disproportionately tilted in favour of the Centre. The Goods and Services Tax has further exacerbated this. Part of the problem lies in the unwillingness of the States to tap the potential of the assigned taxes. Kerala, which is in the forefront of the opposition to the Centre, is in deep fiscal stress and mostly dependent on the Centre to meet its committed items of expenditure. The message that comes out of the recent developments seems to be: to fight the centralisation tendencies, the States have to become more fiscally independent.

But his proposed cure — an appeal to Muslims to shun orthodoxy — appears as a mere palliative. Conspicuous by its absence is any mention of the role of Muslim nations like Saudi Arabia in propagating extremist ideology. Ordinary Muslims are powerless to counter the coalition of powerful rulers and fundamentalists. How then can the syncretic and benign Islamic vision that remains in the margins of popular imagination go mainstream? Where is the courageous reformer who will challenge the intolerant scriptural narratives?

343,2020/01/10,"From Kashmir to Kanyakumari: Rajasthan girl rides 4,200 km to drive home a message for women","“It was my way of protesting the gruesome crime,” says Neetu Chopra, the fiery 29-year-old event manager from Udaipur, about her #rideforrevolution. Her aim was to quell fear and motivate women to fearless, step out of their comfort zones and learn self-defence techniques.

True to the spirit of her campaign, she rode through the night from Madurai to Kanyakumari on NH 44 in the final leg of her expedition last weekend: she started from Ramban, 65 kilometres from Srinagar on December 15, riding 4,200 kilometers to reach Kanyakumari on January 3. “I did not feel any fear at all, and actually reached my destination 12 hours ahead of schedule,” she laughs.

The only break she took was at a tea kiosk at 2.30 am and posted a video of it on Instagram. The positive responses she received prompted her to drive an extra 400 kilometres to and around Thiruvananthapuram. “Kerala was not on my itinerary but I am happy I could show more people that if one woman gathers the courage to leave her home, she is equal to a 100 and proves that she is not just caring but also daring,” says Neetu.

Neetu decided to embark on the long distance solo journey because she feels holding placards and posters, sloganeering and candle light marches are all just symbolic and lead to nowhere. “Have they reduced crimes against women since the Nirbhaya case in Delhi in 2012?” she asks. “Nothing has changed and women in our country continue to be unsafe,” says Neetu and adds, “Only women can make the roads less dangerous for themselves by using public spaces more instead of getting cowered by fear and choosing to remain indoors.”

Her Ladkiyon bahar niklo (girls, step out) campaign on a two-wheeler was a shout-out to young girls and women. She met many of them en route, from motley crowds to large gatherings, and addressed pre-arranged and spontaneous meetings. “ I wanted to inspire confidence in women that it is okay to venture out even during odd hours,” says the bungee jumper and NCC gold medallist.

Neetu describes herself as the quintessential rebel fighting patriarchy in her home State, Rajasthan and within her community. Successfully completing the Kashmir-to-Kanyakumari (K2K) ride, she became the first Jain girl to achieve the feat – something that all bikers dream of.

She is happy that she undertook this ride — even though she decided about it on an impulse. “I was addressing college students in Jodhpur on December 2. The gangrape incident was fresh in everybody’s mind and I mentioned that girls needed to be out of their safe zones to conquer their fears of being unsafe. I told the audience I would like to ride alone on the highway on a scooty like 'Disha'.” Mediapersons present on the occasion splashed it in the local papers.

Neetu admits she was got a tad nervous initially not knowing how to go about it. Fortunately, Swaroop Roy of Royal Rider’s Club (RRC) read about her talk and enrolled her into the club. After that, things moved at jet speed. However, Neetu was shocked by the attitude of people while scouting for sponsors. “Many asked me who will do the household chores if women stayed out for days. Such comments made me more determined and #rideforrevolution was born.”

Neetu had never been on an expedition before, barring a fun ride she did with her friend on November 23. “We rode after midnight in search of chai and snacks on November 23. We were working on a project in Udaipur till late at night and needed a break,” she says. And the two girls ended up doing a carefree 265 kilometre ride on the Udaipur-Ahmedabad highway. “It gave us a strange sense of empowerment. We reached Ahmedabad at 5.30 am, had dhokla for breakfast and returned to Udaipur by noon next day.”

Her friends and family dubbed her crazy, but the adventure-spirited Neetu says she overcame her fears with that night’s spontaneous drive. “It worked as an immense boost for my Kashmir-to-Kanyakumari (K2K) expedition,” she says.

Neetu did a warm up ride of 2,700 kilometres from Jodhpur to Jammu from December 4 to 12 before kickstarting her K2K expedition. “The State was in the midst of a lockdown and internet black-out and I was warned about landslides. But with the assistance of four RRC bikers, I drove continuously on damaged roads for eight hours in rain and snowfall.”

She says her physical and mental strength helped her pull this off. Four sets of clothes, a knife, and a taser torch was all that she carried besides earning goodwill on the way.

Neetu returned to a rousing reception back home earlier this week and was awarded the Rajasthan Book of Records trophy. Her boldness has inspired many in her community to allow their girls to go on similar expeditions. “There is a request now to take 11 girls with me on my next ride,” says Neetu. At the moment, she is excited about the two rounds she has cleared for MTV Roadies Show. The final results will be out next week and you may see me on TV soon,” she smiles, adding, “But it is K2K solo ride that made me realise my power within.”",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/nau19v/article30534971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mamp11NC1-a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/enraged-by-hyderabad-veterinarian-gangrape-and-murder-in-november-2019-rajasthan-girl-neetu-chopra-completed-a-4200-kilometre-solo-ride-from-kashmir-to-kanyakumari-to-drive-home-a-message-for-women/article30534977.ece
344,2020/01/10,Gulati restaurant: More than just Butter Chicken,"Nostalgia is best served hot, with onion rings on the side. I thought that some days ago when a friend from Singapore came home. Since he misses Dilli-wallah food, we’d ordered some mutton korma for him. But, while we chatted, I realised that what he missed the most was the food of Gulati, a restaurant on Pandara Road that he and his friends often went to.

If I had known then that Gulati delivers food to areas even 15 km away (via Zomato and Swiggy), I would have ordered some butter chicken for him from there. But I only got to know this when I went there for lunch a couple of days ago. I was told by the young man in charge of the restaurant that they deliver food to aficionados through the day.

I was a bit surprised when I received an invite from Gulati. After all, the restaurant has been there since 1959, and has quite a few hard-core fans. But Namit Gulati has plans: For one, he has expanded the delivery system, and wants to expand the buffet. The old favourites — such as butter chicken, brain curry, dal makhni — are all there, of course, but he has been adding to the menu keeping diner demands in mind.

Right now, Gulati has on the menu select Punjabi, Mughlai and Hyderabadi dishes, but he hopes to expand that as well. Sometime in the near future, there may be new Gulatis in other parts of the town. “But not franchises,” he says firmly.

As I bit into a firm yet juicy Fish Tikka Lajawaab, I remembered the time when Delhi was a hick town, and the Pandara Road Market was one of the few places where you could go late at night for a rich meal. There was even a Chinese restaurant there called, of all things, Shahi Andaz! When Gulati was first set up, it was just a dhaba. But over the years, the eateries (Gulati, Pindi, Havemore) smartened up. Then the market itself changed, with a cobbled front courtyard and a fountain welcoming visitors. Gulati is the biggest there, with 140 covers, I was told.

In the olden days, we used to go Havemore for its brain curry, and to Gulati for the butter chicken. The butter chicken is still its most popular dish, Namit tells me. But I had the Hyderabadi cuisine — Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani and the Hyderabadi Handi Gosht — and found them both delicious. The fine-grained biryani was not over-spiced, and the chicken had been cooked just right, with just the right masalas. The mutton in the Handi Gosht was nice and tender, and the gravy was deliciously rich.

We started with the Gulati Mutton Burrah Akbari. The burrah was superb: The meat was tender, and had soaked in all the spices. The Murgh Malai Tikka, again, was deliciously creamy. The menu includes Chicken 65 and a Mushroom 65 and Vegetable Galouti Kebab for vegetarians. There is also a bustling buffet table, and I could see diners going back for seconds and thirds.

The buffet, I am told, is a great hit, and especially so during festivals. For Lohri, for instance, there will be a special buffet, with a spread of seasonal dishes. The good bit about the buffet is that it starts early, and then carries on till 4 or 4.30 p.m ( ₹819 plus taxes, a la carte meal for two approximately ₹1500).

The friend’s visit — and the meal at Gulati — opened up the floodgates of memory. Ah, those days when we dug into our butter chicken and brain curry without worrying about clogged arteries. Time machine, anyone?

345,2020/01/10,"A food festival that brings together delicacies from Puducherry, Kayalapatnam and Jaffna","There is pizza, there is pineapple on pizza and then there is Anasi kary, a curry made from pineapple. For someone who is against pineapple in savoury dishes, having it in my curry felt like blasphemy. Sensing my disapproval, Praveen Anand, executive chef at Welcom Hotel Grandbay hastily assures me, “ In the Indian subcontinent it is highly unlikely that we put fruits in our curries but for the Tamils residing in Jaffna, it is no big deal. Anasi Kary which is made with pineapple boiled in coconut milk and spiced up with red chilli powder is a part of their daily diet.”

I am at Dakshin, the south-Indian restaurant of the hotel which is hosting a food festival called ‘Kadaloram’. The festival brings to the table variations of Tamil cuisine found along the coastline of Tamil Nadu and parts of Sri Lanka.

While he curated the festival, Chef Praveen said, “I chose three places- Puducherry, Kayalapatnam and Jaffna. I wanted to highlight how a cuisine undergoes variation as it moves from one place to another. Puducherry cooking is influenced by the French. The palate of Kayalapatnam, a small town in Tamil Nadu has a tinge of South Asian countries as the residents here are traditionally sailors who brought back tastes and traits from the lands they travelled to. So their food has lemon grass and pandan leaves as its main ingredient. Jaffna is still very authentic in its cuisine and sticks by the traditions of Tamil cooking.”

The Anasi Kary and Varutha Pasiparippu Kary, a curry made with roasted green gram are the only vegetarian dishes on my plate. The rest of the food there includes Kozhi Vadisaaru, Malaya Kozhi curry, Kaatu paravai curry and Kothina Kari Perattal along with a Malabar paratha (You can instead ask for appams).

Huge chunks of chicken cooked in coconut milk and lemon grass is what the Malaya Kozhi curry is all about. It is creamy and tasty.

The Katha Paravai curry is spiced quails simmered in a coconut curry and is a notch spicier than the Malaya Kozhi curry. The curry leaves add it a special flavour and it is perfectly complimented by the paratha. The Kothina Kari Perattal, is even more fiery. The minced lamb, that resembles keema is served along with a boiled potato. The seafood I try is squid, tossed in oil and served with an onion and chilly gravy. Called Mezhukku Peratti it has a strong but not unattractive taste of curry leaves. For the vegetarians the menu offers Marakkari Koozh, a broth of rice cooked with jackfruit and chillies, and a side of Palm jaggery makes it extra special. This can be teamed with Poritha Ulli Kari, a curry made with fried garlic and pepper. The dish draws its roots from Jaffna.

346,2020/01/10,BJP leader takes potshots at Deepika Padukone over JNU visit,"BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Wednesday took potshots at actor Deepika Padukone, who visited Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) after violence, saying she should not try to act like warrior Mastani, because “she does not have a real-life director behind her”.

Ms. Padukone had expressed solidarity with JNU students attacked by masked goons on the campus in Delhi on Sunday night. She also visited the university campus on Tuesday. She was trolled on social media for her gesture.

Speaking on the premises of Vidhan Bhavan, Mr. Shelar said, “It is easy to portray the character of warrior Mastani, when you have a director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali behind you. But in real life, when she does not have a director behind her, (then) she should not try to portray herself as a warrior or Mastani because it is now clear that she is unable to live that kind of life in reality.”

Ms. Padukone had featured in Hindi film Bajirao Mastani, a 2015 historical romance movie. Mastani was a warrior during the Peshwa rule. He called the actor’s act of meeting some JNU attack victims as “insensitive and inappropriate”.

The BJP leader said she has shown insensitivity by meeting just one side of the people in the JNU violence. “The incident is being probed by the police. So, meeting just one side of the people is inappropriate; obviously she is in trouble.”

“We condemn and reject her step. We find it (her act) insensitive,” the BJP leader said.

347,2020/01/10,‘Free Kashmir’ poster at Gateway: Shiv Sena lashes out at Fadnavis for targeting CM Uddhav,"The Shiv Sena on Thursday hit out at BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis for targeting Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over the ‘Free Kashmir’ placard displayed by a woman at a protest against the JNU violence in Mumbai.

When Mehek Prabhu, a Marathi woman from Mumbai, stood up for the pain of Kashmiris by holding the placard, the Opposition termed it sedition, the Sena said, adding there cannot be a dirtier example of irresponsibility.

In remarks laced with sarcasm, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said the placard shocked the Opposition leaders and awakened the nationalist sentiment in them.

“They attacked Mr. Thackeray and asked how this anti-national activity can happen right under his nose. The allegation was so frivolous that the Opposition leaders made a mockery of themselves,” it said. “This is not good for the State...we are worried for the opposition,” the Sena tauntingly said.

After the placard with ‘Free Kashmir’ message was seen at the protest against the JNU violence at the Gateway of India, Mr. Fadnavis had asked what exactly was the protest for and if the CM would tolerate this “anti-India campaign” right under his nose.

The Sena said Ms. Prabhu came out before TV channels after her placard kicked up a row and gave her side of the story, saying her intention was about freeing Kashmir from communication restrictions faced by people there.

“A Mumbaikar Marathi woman could understand the pain of Kashmiris. The Opposition feels this is sedition. There can’t be a dirtier example of irresponsibility,” it said. “If the Opposition and its supporters feel expressing yourself fearlessly is sedition, it is not good for them (Opposition) and the country. The Opposition has fallen flat on its face after Ms. Prabhu’s clarification,” the Marathi publication said.

It also asked Mr. Fadnavis to exercise caution and restraint, and respect his current post as the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Assembly.

“We understand his pain. He should apply balm on his wounds and stay quiet for sometime,” it said.

The Sena said the opposition BJP needs counselling as it has become directionless since Mr. Fadnavis became LoP. Every day, the Fadnavis-led opposition feels the State government will collapse and they will return to power, the Sena said. “The Opposition raises flimsy issues in an attempt to corner the Uddhav Thackeray-led government. But nothing of this sort will happen. In fact, the three parties (Sena, NCP and Congress — allies in the State government) will come closer and become stronger,” it said.

The Sena asked the BJP to organise a counselling workshop on duties and responsibilities of Opposition at Rambhau Mhalgi Prabhodini, a RSS-affiliated research institute located in Thane district.

It also took a dim view of BJP leader Chandrasekhar Bawankule asking Congress’s Vijay Wadettiwar to join the saffron party, amid speculations that the latter was upset with the portfolio allocated to him in the Thackeray-led government.

“This is too much. Did Mr. Bawankule quit the BJP and join the Congress after he was denied ticket in the Assembly polls (held in October last year)?” the Sena asked.

348,2020/01/10,Do not pass order on ED plea against Mehul Choksi: Bombay HC,"The Bombay High Court has directed a special court here not to pass a final order for four weeks on a plea filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking to declare diamond merchant Mehul Choksi a Fugitive Economic Offender (FEO).

Four-week gap

Justice A.M. Badar on Tuesday said the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court shall not pass a final order for four weeks. The High Court had posted Mr. Choksi’s petition against the proceedings in the lower court for hearing after four weeks.

Mr. Choksi, a prime accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, is presently in Antigua. He said in an affidavit filed before the High Court that he can not return to India due to ill-health.

He also claimed that he left the country in January 2018 to undergo a bypass surgery and not to avoid prosecution. He said he would return to India if he is medically fit. Justice Badar said the lower court can carry on with the proceedings on the ED’s application, but it shall not pass any final order for now.

Declaration as FEO

Mr. Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding PNB to the tune of ₹13,400 crore in collusion with a few bank employees by fraudulently obtaining letters of undertaking, a form of credit guarantee given to overseas banks.

349,2020/01/10,Will not allow cases against those who plotted PM Modi assassination to be withdrawn: Union Minister Mahendranath Pandey,"BJP leader and Union Minister Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Dr Mahendranath Pandey has hit out at Maharashtra Government for attempting to withdraw cases related to the Bhima Koregaon violence and ‘urban naxals’ responsible for allegedly plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) MP from Chandauli said governments in some states were working to undo all the good work done by the Narendra Modi government against the naxal ‘menace’.

The Maharashtra Government has the right to ‘review’ cases, but if they are reversed with an ‘ideological tint’ in mind, BJP will oppose it tooth and nail both from New Delhi and from within Maharashtra, he said in the financial capital on Thursday.

“The BJP will oppose any polluted view while reviewing or withdrawing cases. The Narendra Modi government has worked on the naxal menace in the rural areas and reduced its to few districts from an earlier spree of over 300 districts, the union minister said adding even some persons in the urban areas with a ‘naxal mentality’ were controlled.

“It is this control these naxalies in urban areas are opposed to since there livelihood is depending on the urban naxal ecosystem. This is the government which has even worked for peace in the campuses but the people with such mentality are encouraging youngsters to take to streets against the CAA/NRC bills,” he said.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has agreed in principle to withdraw nearly 700 cases related to the Bhima Koregaon and Maratha agitations.

The state Home Department has put up a status report to the Chief Minister recommending withdrawal of cases.

According to the status report submitted to the Chief Minister, 323 cases for withdrawal are related to Maratha reservation while another 386 are scrutinised and will be taken back in the Bhima Koregaon agitation.

About 114 cases are of serious nature and cannot be withdrawn yet.

350,2020/01/10,Canada’s TBDC to take Indian start-ups offshore,"Canada is eyeing to tap into the ever-growing start-up ecosystem of India, which is considered to be the third-largest globally with around 50,000 such ventures.

Toronto Business Development Centre (TBDC) and City of Brampton have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with CorpGini, a platform that connects start-ups with corporates, to give Indian start-ups access to companies in Canada in the form of business and solutions.

“TBDC and City of Brampton have signed an MoU with CorpGini to globalise thousands of Indian start-ups that are looking for expansion beyond India. Start-ups will gain access to corporates in Canada and a chance to find business from them,” a release said.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Mayor Patrik Brown from City of Brampton, who is in India for a week-long tour to meet start-ups in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi.

Incidentally, TBDC will provide access to a network of key resources that will help accelerate growth for start-ups. These include a mentor network, access to capital through its angel investor network, and a portfolio of support services that are required to help start-ups build and scale.

This assumes significance as the Indian start-up segment is believed to be growing at nearly 15% every year and boasts of more than 30 unicorns (a start-up that has a valuation of more than $1 billion).

Further, Indian start-ups have attracted investment from global marquee investors and some domestic ventures like Paytm, Zomato, Ola, Oyo, Zoho and InMobi among others have even expanded their operations in overseas markets.

“TBDC has been playing a key role in accelerating start-ups in Canada. With this MoU, CorpGini would assist Indian start-ups to establish their presence in Canada,” Mahavir Lunawat, partner, CorpGini, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/canadas-tbdc-to-take-indian-start-ups-offshore/article30528427.ece
351,2020/01/10,‘We must make children realise that even animals have feelings ’,"With the country steeped in political strife, it’s evident that there’s little value for human rights. Animal welfare then, which has always been of little concern to most, gets further neglected. So it’s no wonder that compassion for all living beings is the need of the hour.

“The only way we can create a caring next generation is to make children realise that even animals have feelings,” says Brinda Khatau, a trustee of the The Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) and a member of the executive and fundraising committees. She’s talking to The Hindu about Woofs and Hoofs Carnival and Fundraiser, an annual event that hopes to inculcate awareness of indie animals and help raise money for the BSCPA to continue its charitable work towards the city’s four-legged and feathered creatures.

Simultaneously, 27-year-old Akshay Gupta brings yet another edition of Pet Fed India to the city with an aim to connect animal lovers with a host of brands. “India is not a pet friendly country,” says Mr. Gupta, talking about how it’s inconvenient when most establishments don’t allow animals. Plus, the industry, which includes food, toys and services, is terribly unregulated and disorganised. For instance, as Mr. Gupta points out, there’s no certification — like the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India — for pet food.

Game, set, go

Naturally, both events will be pet friendly, which means you can take your furry companions along for the day. Plus, each have a range of activities. Woofs and Hoofs will showcase a range of stalls from NGOS with products for both animals and humans. “All of them have been given free of charge to help raise money for a good cause,” says Ms. Khatau, whose committee has received donations specifically for the event. In addition to an adoption camp with healthy animals from the BSPCA — which includes stringent house check formalities — there will be a petting zoo for kids to interact with baby goats, lambs and calves. A fancy dress competition with a category for “most embarrassing outfit” includes the top prize of tickets to an upcoming show of Agatha Christie’s The Mirror Crack’d.

“We’re hoping children will lose their fear of animals,” says Ms. Khatau, adding that parents are also usually worried about them getting bitten or scratched. Interaction with indie animals and meeting pet parents with their dogs and cats helps encourage curiosity.

Pet Fed on the other hand is organising a cat show with international judges, a first in the city. NGOs from across Mumbai will be bringing adoptable animals for anyone interested in adding a furry friend to their family. “It’s important to encourage adopting an indie pet, they’re just as good as any breed animal,” says Mr. Gupta. Plus, police dogs will put on a show for attendees. A special agility and play area, spanning 10,000 square feet — including a fully indoor cat zone — will ensure pets get a chance to stretch their legs and socialise. But most importantly, there will be more than 150 Indian and international brands offering their wares.

Entry to Woofs and Hoofs is free; January 11; 4 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.; Mahalaxmi Race course, second enclosure. Tickets to Pet Fed India are priced ₹399 onwards (desi pet parents get free entry); January 11 and 12; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; JVPD Grounds, Juhu; petfed.org/events/pfm20/tickets.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7obfna/article30528413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bmAnimal-carnival,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/we-must-make-children-realise-that-even-animals-have-feelings/article30528414.ece
352,2020/01/10,Ashwin Sheth Group launches commercial project in Thane,"Real estate developer Ashwin Sheth Group has announced plans to expand its commercial realty portfolio by foraying into the Thane market. The company on Thursday said it would launch a new commercial project called Cnergy Thane in the prime locality next to Viviana Mall.

The group already has its residential and retail projects such as Sheth Zuri, Sheth Avalon, Sheth Vasant Lawns and Viviana Mall on this land parcel spread over 50 acres.

The total project cost of the new project is pegged at ₹200 crore and once completely sold out the company will fetch a revenue of ₹350 crore to ₹400 crore, top executives said.

A few years ago, the company had successfully developed a luxury Grade-A commercial office space tower at Prabhadevi by the same name, which was well accepted in that locality.

Cnergy Thane will have a cumulative office space of over 2 lakh sq.ft., with office sizes starting from 550 sq. ft. to an entire floor of around 10,000 sq.ft. The project is targeted at corporates, professionals and even start-up companies. Top company officials said Thane currently lacks such a facility and they have received an overwhelming response.

A 550 sq.ft. space would typically cost about ₹1.4 crore, and the project is slated for completion in December 2022.

Chintan Sheth, director, Ashwin Sheth Group said, “This project will provide facilities like the ones available to corporates in Mumbai. There is a need for such as high quality project in Thane. We have already sold 40,000 sq.ft. and are expecting to be sold out very soon,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/79l6rj/article30528389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMVIVIANAMALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ashwin-sheth-group-launches-commercial-project-in-thane/article30528391.ece

The police found the mammal, weighing 7 kg and 360 gm, in a blue plastic drum in an SUV driven by the accused, Kalpesh Jadhav, outside Asudgaon bus depot in Panvel on Tuesday. Constable Anil Patil had received a tip-off that a resident of Khed was looking for a buyer. Posing as customers, the police got in touch with Mr. Jadhav. When he reached Asudgaon bus depot to hand over the mammal, the police arrested him.

“In the interrogation, he said he procured the mammal from an Adivasi in Ratnagiri The accused is now in police custody,” senior police inspector Shyam Shinde said. In the international market, the animal fetches between ₹20 lakh and ₹1 crore depending on its size.

Mr. Shinde said, “The mammals are among the world’s most trafficked animals as their thick scales are said to have medicinal properties. In India, the animal is believed to bring wealth and prosperity.”

354,2020/01/10,Education panels with non-govt. experts scrapped,"The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday decided to scrap all committees with non-government members under the Higher and Technical Education Department.

The move comes after Congress leader Ashish Deshmukh demanded that the State government remove all vice-chancellors (V-Cs) from State universities who have links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and were appointed during the term of the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.

Mr. Deshmukh alleged that the violent attacks on students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University on January 5 were made possible because of the university’s administration having people who followed the ideology of the RSS. Mr. Deshmukh said the V-C of JNU, M. Jagadesh Kumar, is also believed to be a follower of the RSS ideology. “So to avoid any JNU-type incidents in Maharashtra’s universities, the government should remove the V-Cs who have links with the RSS,” he said.

On Thursday, State Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant decided to cancel committees with non-government members after holding a review meeting of his department. He said new committees would be formed soon.

An officer, who was present at the meeting, said, “The previous government had included outsiders of their choice. The minister thought it was important to not continue with the previous committees and therefore the decision to scrap them has been taken.”

On Mr. Deshmukh’s demand to cancel the appointment of V-Cs with RSS links, Mr. Samant said the government held the opinion that there should be no politics over such posts. “However, I will speak to the Chief Minister on this issue and a decision will be taken soon,” said Mr. Samant.

Meanwhile, the BJP said the demand reeked of revenge politics. “Even if a V-C adheres to the RSS ideology, that does not mean he is anti-India or pro-Pakistan. All appointments of V-Cs are as per the law. If this government is going to withdraw these appointments, then it is clear that the government is functioning with the aim of revenge politics,” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uj1g5q/article30528335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMPROTESTAGAINSTCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/education-panels-with-non-govt-experts-scrapped/article30528336.ece

In its 25th year, the flower show will be held from January 31 to February 2.

BMC’s gardens department hosts a Flower Show and Exhibition at the zoo every year and since 2016, it has been designed around a central theme. In the first year, the theme was ‘Clean Mumbai’ and in 2017, the BMC erected attractive selfie points where cartoon characters were created using topiary. In 2018, the same was done for aquatic creatures. While 50,000 people visited the exhibition in 2016, the numbers went up to 1.5 lakh in 2018.

This year’s theme is icons of Mumbai, which means the civic body will be creating topiary models of iconic structures like the first tram of India, a textile mill and a camera to symbolise Bollywood, among other things. The exhibition will be inaugurated by the Mayor of Mumbai. Several dignitaries are expected to attend.

The exhibition will feature various species of shrubs, flowering plants, fruit-bearing trees, bonsai, exotic vegetables and spice shrubs. Visitors can also buy saplings, seeds, garden equipment at the exhibition.

356,2020/01/10,Centre should focus on economy: Prakash Ambedkar,"Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar on Thursday said the Central government is trying to divert the attention of people from the deteriorating state of the economy by introducing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Addressing a press conference at the VBA office in south Mumbai, Mr. Ambedkar said instead of running a missed call campaign to build support for the CAA, the government should devise methods to fill the shortfall in revenue.

‘Reach out to donors’

He said, “The budgeted tax collection estimate for the current fiscal was ₹24.6 lakh crore. However, recent reports indicate that the government will only reach up to ₹11.43 lakh crore. Instead of the missed call campaign in support of CAA and NRC, the BJP government should organise a campaign to reach out to millions of Indians to donate money to bridge the revenue shortfall.”

Mr. Ambedkar said the Centre is acting like a drunkard and it thinks that the only way to resuscitate the economy is by selling government properties.

He said, “The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the disinvestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, the Oil and Natural Gas Cooperation, the Container Corporation of India and several others. They are all on the list of the NITI Aayog. While their internal valuation is over ₹9 lakh crore, the government wants to sell them for ₹70,000 crore.”

Referring to the brutal police crackdown on students and protesters across the country, Mr. Ambedkar said, “Instead of sending students and teachers to hospitals, the government should focus on the state of the economy.” He added, “Our Gross Domestic Product growth has slipped to 4.5% from 6.8% in 2018-19. This slowdown is going to impact the country in many ways and it is likely going to enter into a coma.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ny8ask/article30528302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMAmbedkar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/centre-should-focus-on-economy/article30528303.ece
357,2020/01/10,MMRCL invites brands for station naming rights,"The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) is planning to shore up its non-fare revenue as it advances into the business end of constructing Metro 3. MMRCL officials said that they aim to have at least 15% of the total revenue through non-fare sources such as advertising and station naming.

As part of its initiatives, MMRCL said it is in talks with businesses and brands around key Metro stations for naming rights along the 33.5-km corridor. “We are hoping that brands near key stations, like Zara near Flora Fountain or Phoenix near Science Museum, would have a strategic interest in our station branding initiative,” an MMRCL official said.

Typically, the naming rights are leased out by a Metro operator to an outdoor advertising agency as part of the overall advertising contact, who then sells them to brands. In this process, stations get named with brands that have no local significance, the official said. The MMRCL has floated an expression of interest to gauge if businesses are willing to participate in the process.

In another initiative, the MMRCL has evinced the interest of seven developers and builders — K. Raheja Corp, DB Realty, Wadhwa, Oberoi, Indiabulls, Shrem Hotels and HBS — to construct dedicated pedestrian subways from under-construction buildings to nearby Metro stations such as Science Museum, Terminal 2, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Worli. MMRCL officials said they will be preparing a detailed project report for each of the proposals with the associated cost. The MMRCL is also in talks with BKC Property Owners’ Association and the Mumbai Mile Regeneration Association, a non-profit organisation of developers, residents’ associations and corporates on Senapati Bapat Marg, to see if multiple developers can pool in resources for the subway.

“We are hoping to finalise the direct access project by June as the subways need to be built while the stations are being constructed. Once the stations are built, constructing subways becomes more challenging,” an MMRCL official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7dkcjr/article30528299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMMETRO3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrcl-invites-brands-for-station-naming-rights/article30528300.ece
358,2020/01/10,Ghatkopar murder case: victim’s son held in Kurla,"Ten days after a dismembered torso of a woman was found in Ghatkopar, the police on Wednesday arrested the victim’s son for allegedly murdering her in the heat of an argument.

The torso, with the legs missing, was found on Kirol Road near Vidyavihar on December 30. The police, over the next few days, went on to find the legs on December 31 and the head on January 4. A case of murder and destruction of evidence was registered against unknown persons and inquiries were initiated into the matter.

An officer, who was part of the investigation, said, “The first thing we had to work on was to identify the woman and we checked the CCTV footage of the area. We identified four vehicles seen around the spots where the body parts were dumped and started tracing their movements. We were also analysing dump data of cell phones that passed through the spots.”

The police also tried to find clues based on a tag on the gown found on the torso. The tag read ‘Kala’ and the police tried to trace its owner at garment stores in the area. However, around 15 stores sold products by the manufacturer. The shop owners were only able to say that the fabric was seven to eight years old and it was impossible to pinpoint who had bought it.

CCTV footage and dump data analysis led the police to Kurla, where inquiries with locals revealed that a mother-son duo, Badrunissa Shaikh and Sohail, had been missing for a few days. The officer said, “We reached their residence and found Mr. Shaikh, who said his mother was in Delhi. However, cellular location mapping matched his movements and we found a scooter near his house that matched the description in the footage. We then took him into custody.”

On being questioned, Mr. Shaikh allegedly confessed to killing his mother in a fit of rage at 6 p.m. on December 28 during an argument over his compulsive drinking habit and lack of income due to unemployment.

Akhilesh Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone VII), said, “After strangling her to death, Mr. Shaikh chopped the body into three parts at 3.30 p.m. on December 29. He let the blood drain in the bathroom for over six hours. He then wrapped the parts in different garments and left on his scooter to dispose of them.”

Mr. Singh said the accused sold his mother’s gold jewellery to reclaim his scooter which he had mortgaged. He also gave some of the money to his girlfriend. “We are investigating whether anyone else was involved or had knowledge about the offence,” Mr. Singh said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k4phru/article30528264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMGHATKOPARMURDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ghatkopar-murder-case-victims-son-held-in-kurla/article30528266.ece
359,2020/01/10,MMRDA sets sights on starting work on four new Metro lines,"The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is aiming to start work on four additional Metro lines, comprising a total length of 87.6 km, and commission 35 km of Metro lines this year.

R.A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said, “The target is to implement 337 km of Metro lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region by 2026. We hope to start work on four more lines this year and are also looking at making two lines operational by the year-end.”

The four projects are Line 10 (Gaimukh to Shivaji Nagar), Line 11 (Wadala to General Post Office), Line 12 (Kalyan to Taloja) and the 45-km-long Line 14 (Kanjurmarg to Badlapur), which Mr. Rajeev said would be built on a Public Private Partnership model. The MMRDA is planning to commission Lines 2A and 7 by December.

In an interaction with journalists on Thursday, Mr. Rajeev said among its main shortcomings last year was the Monorail, which continues to be plagued with several issues. Earlier this month, the MMRDA had to cancel the tender to procure new Monorail rakes as there were few bidders.

Mr. Rajeev said they had floated tenders again but the process has been hampered by the dearth of Monorail manufacturers globally.

ITS to be finalised

He said the Monorail guideway was built to suit rakes made by Scomi. Owing to this, other manufacturers had to invest in design, thus raising the cost. The other major shortcoming was the non-implementation of the Integrated Ticketing System (ITS). He said, “We are aiming to finalise the ITS in time for the commissioning of the Metro lines in December.”

Mr. Rajeev said 25% of the civil work of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link had been completed and the MMRDA aims to open Kalanagar flyover by March. It also aiming to complete work on Santacruz-Chembur Link Road and BKC-Vakola junction this year.

“We should also start work on our project to improve the Western Express Highway. We should begin work on T2 junction as a pilot before the monsoon,” he said. The MMRDA has appointed Louis Berger Consultants to suggest plans to reduce congestion on the 25-km road. Work on Lines 2B (DN Nagar to Mandale), 4 (Wadala to Kasarwadavali) and 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli) is under way.

Work on Metro 4A (Kasarwadavali to Gaimukh), 5 (Thane to Bhiwandi-Kalyan) and Metro 7A/9 (Dahisar to Mira Bhayander, and Andheri East to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport) was recently started.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ikncpm/article30528156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bmmetrocol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrda-sets-sights-on-starting-work-on-four-new-metro-lines/article30528157.ece

Unveiled in January 2018, the app has been downloaded by over 2 lakh people and implemented by Thane Smart City Limited. It allows Thane residents to report service issues as well as make bill payments and apply for permits.

Sameer Unhale, CEO, Thane Smart City, told The Hindu the idea was to go beyond providing municipal services and grievance redressal and create a platform to improve the overall quality of life of Thane residents. “We want the app to be a digital gateway to the city. In the past we have had several apps for different services, which can get cumbersome. We are in the process of integrating all of them in DigiThane,” he said.

The app is also encouraging local businesses by providing a platform for them to provide discounts and deals as a way to connect with citizens.

Ankit Bhargava, director of Foxberry Technologies, which has developed the app, said they were able to provide targeted and localised discounts to the city’s residents. “One of the ways to ensure a sustainable urban environment is to promote local businesses and shops, which have taken a hit due to the spurt in online shopping portals,” he said.

The app has nearly 700 merchants on board and around 1,000 discount coupons are active on the app, Mr. Bhargava said.

Mr. Unhale said the company was planning a listing platform on the app for services such as plumbing and carpentry, which are not organised. “We are also planning to upskill naka workers within Thane, so that they have other avenues and are not severely affected by the seasonal nature of construction work,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5rznde/article30528150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bmthanecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/digithane-gets-award-for-e-advancement/article30528151.ece

Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh lauded the police’s efforts at a press interaction in Mumbai.

Lakdawala, 50, who fled the country some time between 1998 and 1999, was wanted in a string of cases, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion, registered since 1989. Crime Branch officers said that so far, they had 25 cases registered against him, apart from 80 applications pending with various police stations and agencies. His daughter Shifa alias Soniya was arrested by the Anti Extortion Cell on December 28 last in a fake passport case, and has been in police custody.

“We stepped up our efforts to apprehend him in the past six months and received a lot of information, which we verified with multiple sources, including the Central intelligence agencies. The arrest of his daughter further increased the pace of our efforts, as we got a lot of information about him from her,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi said.

On Wednesday, the Anti Extortion Cell received information that Lakdawala would be in Panta and rushed a team there. “A team of the Mumbai police sought our assistance in arresting someone under the Jakkanpur police station last night [on Wednesday night] and the local police helped it arrest Ejaz Lakdawala… After his arrest, the Mumbai police completed the legal formalities, and Lakdawala was handed over to them,” Bihar Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Amit Kumar told journalists in Patna.

However, sources in Bihar’s Police Department told The Hindu that Lakdawala was arrested at the Mithapur bus stand under the Jakkanpur police station in Patna, and he was planning to board a bus bound for Darbhanga-Madhubani.

The reason for his return to the country has evoked curiosity, with the police believing that he could have come down to help his daughter come out of jail.

Lakdawala grew up at Dongri in Mumbai. The influence of the erstwhile gangsters like Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and his own violent tendencies pushed him into a life of crime. He was still a teenager when the Dongri police booked him for allegedly assaulting his teacher, a woman, with a compass. He spent several months in the juvenile remand home at Dongri before being released. He was subsequently recruited by Rajendra Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan as a footsoldier. Then, Rajan was with Dawood, working as an enforcer-cum-recruiter for the gang.

Crime Branch officers said the first murder case against him was registered in 1989 and the second in 1998.

“After Rajan broke with Dawood in 1993, Lakdwala stayed loyal to Rajan and started working for him. In 1998, he killed an accused wanted in the 1993 bomb blasts. To promote his image of being a “patriotic don”, Rajan had announced a vendetta against the perpetrators of the serial blasts and killed several of the people accused in the case. After the murder, Lakdawala fled the country and joined his boss in Malaysia,” a Crime Branch officer said.

In 2002, Lakdawala survived an attempt on his life, when Dawood’s henchmen shot at him in Bangkok. He sustained seven bullet injuries and was rumoured to have died for months before he resurfaced and resumed his place on the wanted list of law enforcement agencies.

Lakdawala parted ways with Rajan in 2008 and started working independently. Sources said the relations between him and Rajan began to sour after the attack on Rajan in Bangkok. After the attack, Rajan started suspecting all his henchmen of informing the Dawood gang of his movements. Several of his aides, including Ravi Pujari, broke with him. The tension, which started simmering between Rajan and Lakdawala in 2000, reached the boiling point in 2008, owing to issues over payment, officers said.

“Since then, according to our information, Lakdawala has travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Cambodia and Nepal, and is said to have property in Canada, Malaysia and London. Our information also indicates that he has had several aliases and travel documents...,” Mr. Rastogi said.

362,2020/01/10,Awhad assures Mahul residents of a meeting with Uddhav on Jan. 14,"Residents of Mahul staged a protest at Azad Maidan on Thursday, and sought support from the State government for shifting their residences to a safer area. Later, Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad met protesters and assured them of taking up the matter with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

Around 200 residents raised slogans against the Brihanamumbai Municipal Corporation for going against the residents to the Supreme Court after losing in the Bombay High Court. Thousands were shifted to Mahul under a Slum Rehabilitation Authority scheme, but the residents are reportedly facing several health problems as the area is surrounded by three refineries and 16 chemical factories.

Nandu Shinde, a protester, said the Bombay High Court had given the BMC 12 weeks to shift the residents to another place or compensate them with the deposit amount and provide residents with the rent each month till new houses were built for them. “In the last two years, around 300 people have died as people are suffering from deadly skin diseases, cancer, tuberculosis, and many more. The High Court had ordered the BMC to compensate the residents till December 16 last year. Still no steps have been taken by the BMC to help us. Instead of providing a safer place, it went to the SC for the second time against us,” he said.

Mr. Shinde hoped that they would find support from the new Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “Before coming to power, Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray had raised his voice for Mahul and supported us. We hope since he and his party are in power, they will soon help us in getting out of Mahul.”

Mr. Awhad also told the protesters that he would fix a meeting with the CM on January 14 so that residents could discuss their problems with Mr. Thackeray.

364,2020/01/10,What’s your cause célèbre?,"There I was, standing at the Gateway of India, alongside myriad protestors who were decrying the violence against students in Delhi. Just as I was feeling at one with my fellow citizens, a loud ringtone pierced through the cries of “Azaadi.” I looked around and saw a Gucci sneaker clad young woman behind me fumble for her phone, in her Balenciaga handbag. “Hello, haan Shashi, I’ve been trying to reach you. Can you come for my hair colour tomorrow,” I overheard her say. Protest or no protest, life must go on.

It is a new year and a new decade and a cause célèbre is like the new IT bag. If you don’t have one, I suggest you get one pronto. With the Citizenship Amendment Act and intrusions on to campuses, a new generation is increasingly politicised. Those who aren’t protesting these lightening rod national issues are railing against others. The climate crisis, for example. Plenty of us know people who are giving up on plastics, meats and dairy. And solar is the new black.

All around us people are fighting the good fight. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this past week, the Impossible Foods company unveiled Impossible Pork — to provide a vegetarian, gluten free, animal free alternative to the world’s most widely consumed meat. Patrick Brown, the company’s CEO, said, “We won’t stop until we eliminate the need for animals in the food chain and make the global food system sustainable.” This may sound like hyperbole, but there is a whole lot of evidence to suggest that animal husbandry is a huge contributor to the planet’s destruction.

Closer to home, I know plenty of people exploring more efficient farming methods. Hydroponics — which avoids using soil (and, therefore, uses less water) to grow vegetables — is one catching on like those Australian bush fires. I am as likely to encounter anxious cocktail party chatter on the precarious state of the world, what with the US-Iran tensions, as I am about India’s food security. The US-Iran issue typically involves probing questions like ‘What’s going to happen to our flight paths?’ and ‘Should we fly Arab airlines?’ But the food issue elicits slightly more informed blather. At a soiree last weekend, I stumbled upon a conversation where two private equity types were discussing crop yields and nutrient solutions like wizened old farmers. “I’ve leased 45 acres for hydroponics because water is going to be our biggest issue,” said PE #1, with great earnestness. “I’ve created a vegetable garden on my terrace,” replied the other, looking somewhat deflated.

Then there’s fashion. Those of us who were mortified to learn that each pair of jeans uses 7,600 litres of water are looking to the industry to lead the way in sustainability. It is a conundrum because, after all, fashion is predicated on the idea of buying more. A close friend who is impassioned about this issue asked me to vow not to buy one new thing for a year. I replied, with some trepidation, that I would try. After all, new year resolutions are ultimately about faith — in one’s own willpower.

In the dawn of this new decade, India faces many of our old challenges (hunger, malnutrition, poor public health services, agrarian distress — the list is long), and many new ones, including the aforementioned water shortages and abysmal air quality. In the absence of political will, perhaps it is up to those at the very top of the income bracket to rise to the occasion. Azim Premji led the way by giving $7.6 billion to his charity last year, as reported by Forbes. Will other wealthy Indians follow suit? As anxiety prevails, so does hope.

365,2020/01/10,Real estate expectations,"With the Union Budget on the horizon, the wishlists from various sectors vary but also remain the same in terms of growth expectations, liquidity, credit, and ease of doing business.

The real estate and infrastructure sector are also focused on easing liquidity and easing business structures. There are, however, some concerns that the industry is faced with. The NBFC crisis has impacted real estate in the country, and there’s enough justification to warrant the improvement of credit off-take. Aside from recapitalisation by the government and stringent measures by the RBI, the gross NPAs of banks also improved to just about 9.1% towards September-end 2019 (against 11.2% the preceding year).

The need for the hour is governance changes in terms of the creation of a well-functioning bonds market, partial credit guarantee scheme, alternative investment funds in the real estate sector, and measures for alleviating stress among NBFCs.

Another concern would be the cancellation of ITC benefits. While the GST rate on under-construction properties was reduced to 5% in 2019, the previously available ITC benefit was shelved. Already cash-starved developers cannot get tax benefits and therefore the increased costs are passed on to the buyers. Providing benefits may be a great incentive to reduce property prices and make under-construction homes more attractive.

A corrective measure for boosting demand in the sector would be the immediate deployment of ₹25,000 crore alternative funds for completion of stressed projects. This would improve buyer sentiment and boost demand.

The most important change that needs to be brought about is making affordable housing projects a reality. Easing liquidity is one such initiative that will increase capital flow for developers and keep a supply, thus gaining the confidence of the home buyer. We also need proactive initiatives for investments in affordable housing since developers are currently unable to get funding from major banks and NBFCs at lower interest rates, leading to dismal profit margins.

Another initiative that might kick-start a healthier demand for housing would be the hiking of tax rebates on housing loans, especially within affordable and mid-segment categories.

The new lower 15% tax fee for businesses trying to set up new factories may be useful if they are able to procure land easily. Implementation of a unique identification number (UID) for land will bring transparency to India’s old land records system and help entice more overseas investors. This will hopefully speed up the approval system for actual estate projects as well.

Execution must be good

All these initiatives would only be fruitful with effective execution. The government’s plan to spend ₹105 lakh crore on infrastructure over the next five years can only give economic results with speedier on-ground implementation. There is a dire need to iron out the bottlenecks hampering infrastructure growth – this is needed in the short term (1-3 years) rather than the long term.

For the common man, personal tax relief should be implemented either by a cut in tax rates or favourably readjusted tax slabs since the last increase in the deduction limit under Section 80C (to ₹1.5 lakh a year) was in 2014 and a revision is long overdue. More incentives and schemes need to be implemented for home principal and interest exemptions to encourage first-time buyers. Long-Term Capital Gains tax should be abolished to bring back investors to the stock market.

The economy grappled with global issues including the U.S.-China trade war and internal issues like bank NPAs and liquidity crisis in 2019.

While the government took steps including reduction in corporate tax rates and standardisation of GST, the current fiscal deficit and the muted GDP growth rate puts it in a tight corner in terms of living up to the budget expectations of the industry and the common man. The very recent U.S.-Iran tussle may further complicate the issue.

Only time will tell how it will walk the tightrope and achieve GDP growth, and improve liquidity and employment and consumer spending in the years to come.

366,2020/01/10,An eco park for the future,"Suraksha Acharya is no stranger to sustainable architecture. Aero Hive, her design for a skyscraper bagged the Silver A Design Award in Italy last year, and she has submitted several conceptual outlines for renewable energy projects across the globe. With the focus now on eco parks, her firm, Midori Architects has won first place (Architecture Category) in the Creative Minds Next national competition at the Festival Of Architecture and Interior Design (FOAID) late last year.

Acharya called it Desert Trinity, and says the design was initially submitted to the Land Art Generator Initiative’s (LAGI) 2019 Dubai International Competition. Architects and designers were invited to design an iconic work of art for a landmark site within Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, using renewable energy technology to provide on-site energy production consistent with the master plan of the city. Envisioned as the energy park of the future, she explains how Desert Trinity comprises two solar elements (concentrated solar paraboloids) and one wind element (paraboloid) that work in synergy to provide a clean and sustainable source of energy (an approximate estimate of 2,388 MWh/year electricity is generated through these elements). In addition, the pedestrian bridge that connects these three elements is composed of low carbon concrete with piezoelectric tiles, enabling visitors to contribute towards the energy generation during their visit to the power plant.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/94h1fs/article30534274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Desert-Trinity-3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/eco-park-of-the-future/article30534275.ece
367,2020/01/10,How a farmer is making peace with his ‘natural’ enemies,"Growing up, I’ve raised many babies from the wild. One of the first was a coucal (crow pheasant) that had fallen out of its nest. Then, a desert cat that used to purr so loud, we named him Motorola! I had a civet for a while and an owlet with a broken wing. I used to catch frogs and mice for her to eat. There were also the ones that I couldn’t help, like a myna that died after ingesting poison (from a farmer spraying his crops).

For one to live in harmony with nature requires a level of compromise, and a different value system, which is absent today. The human psyche is not to adjust to the environment, but to mould it based on our needs. With this series, I aim to share my understanding of the issues we as humans, and particularly as farmers, face. And what we can do, on a micro level, as individuals, and on a macro level, as a society, to ease this coexistence with nature.

What’s it to us?

Plenty has been said about elephants and tigers, and how we are encroaching on their habitat. But what about the important species in the food chain like the minor cats, insects, birds, rodents and snakes — that provide natural pest control (fly-catchers eat bugs) and population control. They are becoming extinct, or are changing their patterns of living to co-exist with humans.

Then there are the tree groves that are home to rare animals such as civets and slow lorises. The trees play an important role in maintaining reserves of subsoil water, harbouring mycelium (the vegetative part of a fungus) in their roots and wildlife in their branches. The smaller birds and animals, or ‘little people’ as I like to call them, are also important to preserve a healthy ecosystem. For example, if certain birds do not feed on the berries of a Singapore Cherry tree, it will develop fungal issues. But these groves are under threat today as they don’t have any monetary value.

Love the mongoose Mongeese, my all-time favourite little animals, are around for hunting birds, rats and snakes. There is a belief that any day a mongoose crosses your path to the right is a good day. It works for me! Villagers tend to trap them in cages to save their chickens — not realising they help control the rats and snake population in the area. I request them to give the animals to me so that I can release them in our farm. People need to see the connect between what is being done today and what will happen tomorrow; we are getting short-sighted as a species, which does not bode well.

Eye in the Yarroway sky

Sparrows are a great place to start. At our farm, very few places were without them once. Today, there are far less. Radiation from cell towers is supposed to be the culprit, as are chemicals used for pest control, but I feel no food in our cities and towns is also a big reason that these friendly birds are missing.

We have close to 50 sparrows living in and around our home. Initially, we put out a small plate of rice for them; what started off as a pair on the porch became a whole colony living in the roof of the house and the surrounding trees. Now they enjoy all the leftover seeds and grains after harvest, all year round. We’ve also planted bird-friendly trees like the Singapore Cherry and Indian Ber, which give them food throughout the year. Besides the sparrows, we have the grey hornbill, many varieties of bee-eaters, sunbirds, pigeons, blue jays, bulbuls and mynas, among others. In addition, the crows arrive when the peanuts are ready for harvest, and the parakeets come when the corn and sunflower are ready.

More food, please

Growing up in rural India, I’ve witnessed a change in cropping patterns — going up from 50% dry land being cropped with cotton and other cash crops to close to 90%, cutting out even the legumes that were used as intercrops. In areas where we used to grow two crops, one cotton (kharif) and one food (rabi), our farmers are only growing one, and that too a cash crop. This leaves not only the farmers and their families hungry (and dependent on markets for food), but the wild animals too (since we take over their natural habitat to grow our crops, so they are dependent on our lands). The reasons behind this shift are many and for another discussion.

In this current situation, when organic farmers like us grow food crops such as sunflower, jowar or bajra, the bird population swoops down and flatten the crop. Parrots dig out the sunflower kernels with their hooked beaks and rip up the corn ears, rats fill their burrows with grain, and rabbits make homes around the farm, to eat young shoots. Chillies and tomatoes are destroyed by hordes of peacocks, not leaving much for the farmer. All the small animal population in an area become concentrated in a small area that chooses to grow diversified crops. This is why sustainable agriculture practitioners struggle to grow crops in such an environmental crisis.

So, what can be done to minimise these effects? Farmers need to plant more food crops (even as intercrops for cash crops) that can act as food banks. This will spread crop losses because of other members of the environment across many farms and not be magnified in the few who choose to grow food crops.

These changes are not easy to make for the society as a whole, but if a few people care and take time to observe patterns, differences can be made. Feed sparrows, plant fruiting trees. Listen to the bulbul and the cuckoo, and know that because of what you’ve created there are no silent mornings.

368,2020/01/10,Govt finalises guidelines for internship scheme,"The State government has taken a significant step towards realising its twin goals of enabling engineering graduates and postgraduates to intern at civic bodies, and encouraging budding engineers to work towards finding solutions for grassroot-level problems through start-ups.

While the ambitious project of the Higher Education Department to facilitate internships has hung fire for long, a recent order issued by the Local Self Government Department (LSGD) that empowered local bodies to employ graduates and postgraduates for specific projects has set the ball rolling for the scheme.

The programme enables students of government, aided and self-financing engineering colleges to apply for a one-year internship in local self-government institutions and allied institutions including Kerala Institute of Local Administration, Suchitwa Mission, Kudumbasree, Clean Kerala Company Ltd., Life Mission and Haritha Keralam Mission after registering in the State internship portal of the Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP).

According to the guidelines that have been laid down for implementing the scheme, district panchayats and corporations can provide internships for two civil engineering, and one electrical and mechanical or automobile engineering student each at a time. While block panchayats and municipalities can rope in the services of two civil engineering students each, grama panchayats will be able to provide internship opportunities for a civil engineering student. While engineering graduates can be offered a monthly stipend of ₹10,000, postgraduates will earn ₹15,000.

Local bodies have also been instructed to provide opportunities for engineering students to undertake project works in accordance with their curricula. Ideas for such projects can be generated with consultation with engineering colleges and with the assistance of the department’s engineering wing. Those successfully completing the internship programme and project works will be given certificates that are issued jointly by either departments.

The LSGD Principal Director, Chief Engineer, and other senior officials have been tasked with identifying nodal officers in each institutions that come under the department for the project implementation.

Local self-government institutions, various missions, and other allied institutions have also been tasked with encouraging engineering colleges, including self-financing institutions, to launch start-up companies on their campuses. Start-ups that have registered with the Kerala Startup Mission must be considered for the purpose.

372,2020/01/10,SSI murder: radical link being probed,"At least one of the suspects wanted by the Tamil Nadu Police in the fatal shooting of Special Sub Inspector of Police (SSI), Wilson, reportedly had a rendezvous with the law in Kerala earlier.

Investigators said the Karamana police had arrested the prime suspect, Abdul Sameem of Thiruvithancodu, Thuckalay, in 2013 on the charge of wanton cruelty to animals. He had allegedly carried out sword practice on stray dogs. The court granted him bail and ordered him to report to the station house officer weekly once.

The Kerala Police said initial reports from their counterparts in Tamil Nadu suggested the youth were part of a 12-member gang of radicalised youth involved in covert martial training in a remote seaside locality in Kanyakumari district. They frequently visited Thiruvananthapuram and had relatives and associates in town.

On Thursday, the Q-branch of the Tamil Nadu Police had staked out a coastal neighbourhood in the capital district where they believed the accused had taken refuge after the crime. A warren of narrow streets marks the densely populated locality, and the police ruled out a house-to-house search operation. The Kerala Police backed the search operations and put armed commandos on the standby for rapid deployment in the event of a firefight.

‘UAPA provisions’

Security agencies have deemed the fatal shooting of the Tamil Nadu officer as an act of war against the State. The Kanyakumari police have reportedly evoked the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

Investigators are probing whether the youth had drawn inspiration from radical online propagandists to carry out the attack.

They pointed out that in 2018, the Tamil Nadu Police had arrested a Chennai-based IT professional Dawood Suleiman on the charge of inspiring acts of war against the State by starting a primarily online campaign named Base Movement. The Q-branch was retracing the digital footprints of the suspects on the internet. Officials said the agency had not ruled out the possibility of the suspects being influenced by Zaharan Hashim, the Tamil-speaking architect of the Easter day bombings in Sri Lanka.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ssi-murder-radical-link-being-probed/article30527677.ece

374,2020/01/10,Nod for Aruvikkara reservoir’s desilting,"The State government has given approval for a Kerala Water Authority (KWA) proposal to desilt and double the storage capacity of the Aruvikkara reservoir, the dedicated drinking water source of the State capital.

On January 3, a high-level empowered committee constituted by the government cleared the proposal to ‘desilt Aruvikkara reservoir entirely.’

Expression of interest

The Water Resources Department, in a January 6 order giving administrative approval for the project, instructed the KWA to invite an expression of interest for the preparation of a detailed project report for carrying out the work.

Restoration of the reservoir capacity through desiltation will help augment water supply to the capital city and its suburbs, the Water Resources Department noted.

There has been a sustained demand over the past several years for active measures to dredge out the sediment deposits and increase the water holding capability of this reservoir.

Daily requirement

The city region requires approximately 220 million litres a day (mld). However, sediment accumulation in the reservoir has reduced its storage capacity to about 40%.

At present, the reservoir has a storage capability to meet city requirements only for five days, according to department estimates.

“Given the present rate of usage of water (around 220 million litres a day) the fresh water storage tanks in the city would run dry within hours of cessation of pumping from Aruvikkara,” the department noted. A successful desiltation programme, it is expected, can enhance the storage capability to 10-12 days.

Flood control

Ensuring water security for the city aside, restoration of storage capability will also aid flood control in the region. The desiltation exercise will bring relief from floods experienced in the lower reaches of the Karamana river. It would also help prevent unexpected flooding in the city during heavy rains, the department said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/nod-for-aruvikkara-reservoirs-desilting/article30527602.ece

Giving the league a miss will be Northeast United FC, Odisha FC, Punjab FC and Indian Arrows.

The preliminary round will kick off in the last week of January. Teams will play on a home-and-away basis against other teams within a group.

The winners of each group along with the best second-placed team between Group A and C would qualify for the final round.

However, if reserve teams of ISL clubs finish as winners or runners-up in any group, the position will be passed on to the next non-ISL team.

In the final round, four qualified teams will play at the central venue on a ‘single-leg’ league system. Eventually, the winners will qualify to the next edition of I-League.

Preliminary round:

Group A: Lonestar Kashmir FC, Punjab FC (reserves), Garhwal FC, Rajasthan FC, ATK (reserves), Jamshedpur FC (reserves).

376,2020/01/10,Football these days is an industry: Barcelona coach Valverde on Spanish Super Cup’s new format,"Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has concerns with the new format of the Spanish Super Cup and said that playing the competition in Saudi Arabia is a consequence of the football industry's desire to find more revenue streams.

The Super Cup traditionally kickstarted the season in Spain with a two-legged contest between the Copa del Rey winners and La Liga champions although the 2018 edition was played as a one-off game in Tangier, Morocco.

Last year the Spanish football federation (RFEF) agreed to double the number of teams and take the competition outside Spain permanently as well as moving it from August to January.

The federation has signed a three-year deal to play the competition in Saudi Arabia, which Spanish media say is worth 40 million euros ($44 million) annually.

“I know there have been rumblings but football these days is an industry,” Valverde told a news conference ahead of Barca's semi-final match against Atletico Madrid in Jeddah on Thursday. “The reason why we are here and why we were in Morocco is because the authorities are looking for more sources of income.”

The move has been criticised by supporters' groups for excluding the teams' traditional fanbase and from campaign groups such as Amnesty International due to the conservative Muslim kingdom's record on human rights.

Valverde also questioned the merits of opening the competition up to Atletico and Real Madrid, who ended last season empty handed.

Barca and Valencia qualify for the Super Cup as league and cup winners respectively, while Atletico earned one of the new berths due to coming second in La Liga.

The last spot was intended for the cup runners-up but as Barca had already qualified, Real took the vacant place due to their superior cup record over Real Betis, last year's other losing semi-finalists.

“For me it's strange to play the Super Cup with two guest teams. It's clear that these games are exciting for the crowd but from a sporting point of view there is only one league champion and there is only one cup winner,” added the coach.

“It was always the first trophy of the season between the league and cup winners, I thought that format was fine but it has been changed. When the competition is over we'll be able to say whether it has gone well or not,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/3fw5o6/article30530936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-SPAIN-FCB-ATMREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/football-these-days-is-an-industry-barcelona-coach-valverde-on-spanish-super-cups-new-format/article30530937.ece
377,2020/01/10,Spanish Super Cup | Messi laments Barcelona’s childish mistakes in defeat against Atletico Madrid,"Barcelona captain Lionel Messi cursed his side's careless errors in their 3-2 defeat by Atletico Madrid on Thursday as they crashed out of the revamped Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.

The Spanish champions, who had two goals ruled out in the second half after VAR reviews, dominated the match and were leading 2-1 with 10 minutes left thanks to goals from Messi and Antoine Griezmann.

But it was Atletico who booked their place in Sunday's final against Real Madrid, levelling thanks to a penalty from Alvaro Morata before Angel Correa struck the winner after Griezmann gave away possession.

“We need to try and continue playing as well as we did today for the rest of the year but make sure we don't make the childish errors we made today,” Messi told reporters. “We controlled the game for around 80 minutes, we played at a high pace, we attacked all the time and created lots of chances. But in the last 10 minutes we made big and we let a game slip which we had under control.”

The defeat continued a poor start to the new year by the league leaders, who were held to a 2-2 draw at struggling Espanyol last week which left them level on points with second-placed Real.

That result led to further criticism of coach Ernesto Valverde, although Messi said the team backed their manager.

“We still have confidence in him and we will work hard so we can improve, but it's normal that there is discontent when there's a defeat and people feel the team is not playing as they would like,” Messi added. “We have to be more united than ever, be a strong group and move forward. We are top of La Liga but we have not been playing well recently so we are going to try and recover our best play so we can stay at the top.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/pnmosk/article30530893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-SPAIN-FCB-ATMREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/spanish-super-cup-messi-laments-barcelonas-childish-mistakes-in-defeat-against-atletico-madrid/article30530894.ece
378,2020/01/10,Curious battle in indirect election,"The indirect election for the post of Mannargudi Panchayat Union Chairman has become interesting as the battle for the top spot depends on the stand of an independent councillor.

In the 22 member panchayat union council, the ruling combine has bagged 50% of the seats in the elections for the PU wards and the Opposition parties which forayed into the elections individually garnered 10 seats (DMK – 8 and CPI – 2). An Independent, said to be a rebel candidate of one of the opposition parties, emerged victorious from ward number 17.

With the AIADMK and BJP combine securing 11 out of 22 wards in their favour, the tally would become equal if the independent decides to back the DMK and the CPI. If such a situation crops up, sources said, a decision would be taken after consulting the Election Commission. Officials said anti-defection law does not apply to civic bodies.

Indications are that the ruling coalition and the DMK-CPI combine might enter into power sharing agreement to avoid complications with respect to election of Chairman and Vice-Chairman posts.

Reports of intra-party strife crop up in the AIADMK camp in Peravurani Panchayat Union in Thanjavur district where the AIADMK and BJP combine which has secured 8 out of 15 seats, could enable the DMK bag the chairman post though the party had won in 6 wards only.

Horsing trading is on at Muthupettai in Tiruvarur district too. Here the AIADMK and DMK have secured 4 wards each while the BJP, CPI and PMK have bagged one each and four wards were pocketed by independents out of the 15 wards for which elections were held.

When it comes to other Panchayat Unions in Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts, the DMK enjoys an upper hand in three PUs - Koradacherry, Tiruvarur and Needamangalam in Tiruvarur district and in 12 PUs - Ammapettai, Orathanadu, Kumbakonam, Sethubhavachatram, Thanjavur, Thirupanandal, Thiruvidaimaruthur, Thiruvaiyaru, Thiruvonam, Pattukottai, Papanasam and Budalur in Thanjavur district.

The AIADMK was assured of securing chairman posts at Madukkur PU in Thanjavur district and at Kudavasal, Nannilam and Valangaiman PUs in Tiruvarur district. The CPI is all set to capture chairman posts at Kottur and Thiruthuraipoondi PUs in Tiruvarur district with the support of CPI(M) and the DMK.

As far as district panchayat council chairman and vice-chairman posts of Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts are concerned, the indirect elections to be held on January 11 would turn out to be a mere ritual since the DMK enjoys majority on its own in these two councils.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/curious-battle-in-indirect-election/article30537133.ece
379,2020/01/10,Glut in production of sugarcane in Tiruchi district,"‘Senkarumbu’ or ‘panneer karumbu,’ the sugarcane variety that is ubiquitous during Pongal festivities, has started arriving at the market. But farmers who have raised the variety are complaining of poor returns given the bumper harvest and glut in production this year.

As they are literally racing against time to sell the sugarcane within the next few days, as it would not have takers after the Pongal festival, farmers have been forced to sell the produce at whatever price offered by intermediaries and traders. The Pongal festival sees a huge demand for this variety but with that the demand ends. Farmers raise the crop of 11 months duration in specific pockets such as Tiruvalarsolai and Thirukattupalli seeking to make a good profit during the season.

Farmers who have raised the cane say that despite the good harvest, they are not reaping the benefits as the field price offered by the middlemen are lower than last year’s rates. Although the government was procuring the cane for being distributed as part of the Pongal gift to ration card holders, middle men are getting a cut here too, farmers complain.

“The yield has been very good and the sugarcane is of very good quality this year in my field. I had spent about ₹2 lakh to raise the cane on an acre,” said S. Bala, 35, of Thiruvalarsolai near Tiruchi. So far, he has sold a part of his harvest, about 3,000 canes, to the government at ₹19 each. He would be selling the rest in the market as his canes are usually in good demand due to its quality. “But the intermediaries who buy the cane from us are offering a rate lesser than last year. Last year, they offered ₹30 a cane, but this year they are offering just about ₹25,” said Mr.Bala.

Obviously, an increase in area of cultivation due to availability of water for irrigation and good yield has resulted in a glut. Some claimed that farmers in places as Salem district too have raised the variety due to availability of water and normal monsoon. Farmers are sore that the government procurement is being done at the eleventh hour this year and that too at poor price. A section of farmers in Thirukattupalli area, another major pocket where the variety of cane is grown every year, say they were offered just ₹120 a bunch (10 canes) by those procuring the sugarcane for supply as part of Pongal gift.

Many farmers sell their produce at ₹15-17 a cane fearing that they would be saddled with the cane. “We have just a few days left to sell our produce. The cane has to be harvested over the next two or three days. Otherwise, we will face huge losses,” said Mr.Bala.

“Farmers, who had entered into agreements with traders about 15 days, have made some profit as they were able to sell the cane at ₹140 to 150 a bunch (of 10 canes). But the rest are in a bad situation as a bunch fetches just ₹115 now out of which they would have to shell out ₹20 towards cutting charges,” said P.Raghu, a farmers of Nadupadgai near Thirukattupalli. Farmers will be able to make a profit of about ₹ 50,000 an acre only if they sell they get at least ₹160-170 a bunch, he said.

Mr.Raghu, who clinched a deal 15 days back, has sold the crop on 30 cents for a price of ₹1 lakh. Though he has made some profit, he says he is unlikely to raise the crop next year. “Supplying cane to the sugar factories seems to be better option and I will rather go for the variety,” he says.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/glut-in-production-of-sugarcane-in-tiruchi-district/article30537043.ece

381,2020/01/10,‘Pursue any ideology but outside institutions’,"Students were free to follow any ideology but not inside premises of institutions, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said on Friday.

Students ought to realise the sacrifice their parents undergo to educate them, he said while speaking at the inaugural of centenary celebrations at National College. “We must inculcate cultural, social and moral values in our students. The education must be value based and holistic,” he said.

‘If we are to restore the ancient glory of education, we must endeavour to fortify our modern education system with the wisdom gleaned from our ancient texts and practices keeping in view the application of this wisdom to today’s real-world challenges,’ he said.

Ancient wisdom is India’s uniqueness and its greatest strength, he said adding ‘we will be doing a grave injustice to posterity if we do not preserve, protect and promote this treasure trove of wisdom, handed down to us by generations of wise men and women.""

The key to fast-tracking development while ensuring social justice and equal opportunities to all is good education. Investing in education is investing in a bright future for the country, Mr. Naidu said. Although our literacy rate has risen significantly, from 17% at the end of 1950 to 76% currently, India still has the largest illiterate population in the world, with its literacy rate remaining below the world average of 86%.

“Today, we dream of being a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2022. But there are pockets in the nation where poverty, illiteracy and social evils persist. We must step up our investment in education from the current 4.6 % of GDP to 6 % of GDP, as mandated by the NITI Aayog,” he said.

The private sector must take an active interest in investing in education. The future of India’s education lies in effective and efficient models of public-private partnerships. We must bring about an immediate shift from rote-learning to conceptual and application-oriented learning, he said.

India has the potential to be the manufacturing hub and human resources capital of the world. But we must ensure that we have a vast pool of skilled manpower. Universities must become centres of excellence in skill training. Research must not be limited to those pursuing a doctoral degree. Undergraduate students in universities must be encouraged to undertake research activities. Innovation must become the culture of universities.

The Vice-President said his position on learning Hindi was that the language must neither be imposed nor opposed. Batting for right physical and mental fitness to build a strong India, he called upon the younger generation to shun junk food and sedentary life style and practice yoga.

Earlier, he released a special postal cover in commemoration of the centenary celebrations of the institution and handed over the first copy to the college committee vice-president Jayakar Krishnamurthy.

382,2020/01/10,Two die after consuming liquor,"Two labourers - Saravanan, 30, and Damodaran, 55, - died after they consumed liquor suspected to be mixed with some chemical near a hair dresser shop at Kannanur near Jambunathapuram on Friday. Another person, Sathish, who consumed the liquor, has been hospitalised at Thuraiyur.

The trio were said to be habitual drinkers and used to consume liquor together, said the police. They assembled near the hair dresser shop on Friday and consumed liquor.

Saravanan who left the spot after consuming liquor was found dead a few distance away from the shop. Damodaran was found in an unconscious state near the shop and was shifted to the Government Hospital at Thuraiyur where he died.

Sathish, a load man, complained of vomiting and giddiness when he reported for work later. He was taken to the Government Hospital in Perambalur for treatment and referred to a private hospital in Thuraiyur.

A liquor bottle containing the left over substance was found at the spot where the trio had consumed alcohol. It would be sent to the forensic laboratory for examination.

Police suspect that they could have mixed liquor with some chemical to get a high. A senior police officer said phenyl smell emanated from the old liquor bottle which had no batch number.

The spot where Damodaran had vomited before dying had the same smell. However, the exact substance could be known only after report comes from the laboratory.

383,2020/01/10,"Price of Bellary onion stabilises, smaller variety rules high in Tiruchi market","The price of Bellary onion appears to have stabilised in Tiruchi market, thanks to marked improvement in arrivals from Maharashtra and Karnataka.

The price of smaller variety, referred to as sambar onion, continued to rule high due to crop failure in vast areas of Perambalur district and Thuraiyur in Tiruchi district.

On Thursday, top quality Bellary onion was being sold at ₹50-55 a kg at the wholesale market in Tiruchi. However, those of lesser quality were available at ₹30 a kg.

Imported varieties from Egypt and Turkey found few takers though they were available at ₹40 a kg.

Top quality small onion sold at ₹100 a kg, while shallots were available at ₹50 a kg, according to A.Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association. The retail prices were higher by ₹5-10 a kg.

Normally, about 300 tonnes each of small onion and Bellary varieties arrive in the wholesale market every day in the city, which caters to retail markets in Tiruchi and its neighbouring districts.

“We are now getting our daily requirement of about 300 tonnes of Bellary onion from Maharashtra and Karnataka. Hence, the price has stabilised at around ₹50 a kg. Since the domestic variety is available at affordable price, there are not many takers for imported onion,” Mr. Thangaraj said.

However, the price of the widely consumed small onion, largely sold only in Tamil Nadu, continue to remain a concern for consumers. But traders such as Mr. Thangaraj say that since the price of the Bellary variety has come down, many consumers are opting for it, restricting their purchase of small onions.

“Arrival of fresh crops is expected to return to normal levels only by mid-February. Till then, the price will rule high,” Mr. Thangaraj said.

The small onion requirement of the market is largely met by arrivals from Perambalur and Tiruchi districts, two major shallot-growing districts in the State.

The crop is raised on over 8,000 hectares in Perambalur district and about 4,000 hectares in Tiruchi district. Arrivals plunged as ‘untimely’ rain and diseases hit production in several areas of the two districts. At present, the market gets about 150-200 tonnes of small onion.

Some of the traders are of the view that about 10-15 days after Pongal, the price of shallots too will come down to about ₹50 a kg. “Once the price drops, people will not think or talk about onion,” he quipped.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/lchmnb/article30530991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY10-SMALLONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/price-of-bellary-onion-stabilises-smaller-variety-rules-high-in-tiruchi-market/article30530992.ece

385,2020/01/10,Penumbral lunar eclipse today,"The first celestial event of 2020, a penumbral lunar eclipse, will take place on January 10 and skywatchers will be able to witness the phenomenon across the country.

The penumbral lunar eclipse can be seen on January 10 from 10.30 p.m. till 2.42 a.m. (January 11). The complete span of lunar eclipse is expected to be around 4 to 5 hours.

However, astrologers say that the religious rituals associated with the lunar eclipse need not be performed.

Quoting astrological texts, the almanac writers and astrologers such as Kappagantu Subbarama Somayaji, Subrahmanya Siddhanthi and Pulipaka Chandrasekhara Sarma say that the rules of grahana (eclipse) need not be followed. The ‘rishis’ stress on the need to follow ‘Chaya grahanam’, either partial or total eclipse, but not prachhaya (penumbral eclipse). No temples are likely to be closed during the eclipse period.

Mr. Chandrasekhara Sarma says that the grahana nimaya (rules to be followed during the eclipse) were not applicable if the eclipse was seen in other continents or not seen in our region. There was no need for a cleansing bath during and after the eclipse or performing of a ‘Santhi’ ritual, he says.

Mr. Subrahmanya Siddhanthi says that in a penumbral lunar eclipse, the moon drifts into Earth's outer shadow called the penumbra. Unlike other eclipses, the penumbral eclipse is a very subtle celestial event and can be a bit hard to see as the shadowed part is only a little bit fainter than the rest of the moon.

As this eclipse is being formed when moon drifts into Earth’s outer shadow, the grahana nimaya is not applicable, he explains.

No closure of temples

Managements of the temples have also not made any announcement on closure of the temples on account of the eclipse.

Usually, the temples are closed a few hours before the eclipse -- solar or lunar -- and thrown open for public only after necessary suddhi (cleansing) rituals.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/penumbral-lunar-eclipse-today/article30531074.ece

Opposing decentralisation of the State Capital, leaders of the JAC planned to organise a bus yatra which was prevented as there was no permission from the police.

Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu, MLAs and a group of former Ministers and TDP leaders reached Benz Circle in the evening and planned to organise a ‘padayatra’ protesting the police action. Later, they staged a sit-in on the main road bringing traffic toa standstill for about two hours. The Patamata police had served a prior notice to the Vedika Function Hall management on Wednesday morning, not to give shelter to the agitating leaders which might create law and order and traffic problems and cause inconvenience to the public.

The State government cannot suppress the agitation and prevent people from registering their protest.

Addressing a press conference in Guntur, Mr. Venkat Rao said that DGP Gautam Sawang only recently said that everyone has the right to protest in a democracy. The DGP now owes an explanation on why the bus yatra planned by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti was stopped. TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and other leaders were not allowed to participate in the programme. “Is the right to protest only for YSR Congress workers or for everyone? The DGP has to clear the air on the guidelines in the police manual,” he said.

‘No truth in Botcha’s claim’

At another press conference, TDP official spokesperson Gurazala Malyadri said the government need not spend a rupee from the exchequer for construction of the capital. Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana says ₹1.09 lakh crore was required for the Capital.

The previous government had spent ₹10,000 crore on constructions. Of this, only ₹250 crore was the government’s share. The present government could follow a similar procedure. It could sell 10,000 acres of the total land pooled and invest it on the construction of the Capital, he said.

TDP leader Varla Ramaiah, at yet another press conference, said Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy evaded personal appearance in 28 instances before the CBI court. He was not Chief Minister when the cases were slapped against him.

The Secretariat is a temporary one, and so are the Assembly and High Court. All government offices in the region are being operated in rented accommodations. Now, Mr. Naidu is saying that these buildings are enough to run the capital in Amaravati. But before the elections, he stated that capital construction needed ₹1,09,023 crore,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

“People know the financial status of the State. The opposition parties are going against the interests of the State. We know what people want. Completion of irrigation projects, which included Polavaram, is top priority of the government. People of Rayalaseema are waiting for water to flow into their region. Fulfilling their needs is our priority. We have to complete the projects,” the Minister said.

Referring to the charges made by Mr. Naidu on permission for rallies, the Minister said the government never permitted anyone to stage a protest or take out a rally without prior permission. In case Mr. Naidu applied for permission, it would be granted.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had take out padayatra only after taking prior permission, he added.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/govt-will-fulfil-promises-to-farmers-says-botcha-satyanarayana/article30530987.ece
390,2020/01/10,Malayalam graphic novels are rooted in Kerala and its culture,"Thakara, Pannimalathu, Premalekhanam, Kallan Pavithran, Koprachev and now Idivettu are all Malayalam graphic novels/comic books set in Kerala. “Since it is a story based in Kerala, it had to be in Malayalam,” says Tina Thomas, of Kochi-based storytelling and publishing house Kokaachi, of Idivettu, its first Malayalam comic book series, explaining why she chose to work with the language, even if it means only reaching a niche audience.

She is not alone. When Idivettu, the first of her eight book series, comes out in April, it will be one of a handful of graphic comic books in Malayalam. Tina confidence is rooted in the slowly growing, but loyal community of comic book readers. Exposed to new mediums of storytelling, via OTT platforms and social media, readers are increasingly looking beyond stories in just prose.

Graphic novels/comics are niche; working against the genre is the perception that illustrated stories are only for children. Highly stylised, the stories are essentially for a grown-up/young adult audience. The ones that spring from Kerala are hyper-local, dialect and relatable characters - mundu clad men in typical Kerala settings and women in set-mundu, beaches, coconut and jackfruit trees.

Some of the stories are original, and located in Kerala. Like Idivettu, the story of three thieves, written by Prateek Thomas, one of the founders of Kokaachi. The stories are of regular folk and some familiar stories such as Premalekhanam, based on Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s story by KP Muraleedharan.

His first graphic novel Thakara, published by DC Books in 2014, was inspired by auteur Padmarajan’s eponymous film, made in 1979. Then, Muraleedharan, now a freelance animator, decided to retell Thakara in graphic novel format. “Padmarajan’s work is already there. I wanted to reinterpret the story, create a different mood,” says the Kayamkulam-based artist, who has worked with Toonz Animation in Thiruvananthapuram.

Making Idivettu Kokaachi’s Idivettu is set in Kottayam, “it is the story of a kallan, a kalli and a perumkallan – all thieves. It has pulp, colour and is accessible. We are targeting an audience between 16 and 40 years of age,” says Tina. The team has a detailed marketing plan, since accessibility tends to become a problem when it comes to graphic novels/comics.

They intend to display it in places frequented by this demographic. Planning it as a series would keep interest and curiosity alive when the series is complete they intend to bring out an English translation. The dialogues are by Tina and Pratheek, art by Mohith O and the cover by Upamanyu Bhattacharyya.

He adds, “I wanted to retell it in terms of interpretation and characterisation. For instance Nedumudi Venu’s Chellappan asari, is very different in my version.” Thakara was serialised in 2013-14 and published in a Malayalam weekly magazine over three months, then published as a book.

Joshy Benedict’s Pannimalathu and Koprachev too are rooted in Kerala, in ‘village stories’ as he calls them. Also a former employee of Toonz Animation, Joshy read graphic novels from France, Germany and other European countries, each unique and so experimental that he found them inspiring. When he created Pannimalathu he deliberately worked on finding an individual style. “I wanted to make it for myself. I didn’t think of publishing it,” Joshy says. In 2015 it was published online and he later decided, for posterity’s sake, to publish it in book form. Koprachev followed a couple of years later.

Joshy approached a publishing house, with Pannimalathu in 2016, which put him on hold for a couple of years, since the market was not viable. He finally decided self-publish, in response to requests on his social media accounts. Since he prints only a few copies, on demand at a time, he has to use expensive digital printing which makes up for 60% of the selling price and leaves him with a profit margin of barely 40%. Yet, Joshy is not ready to give up, and plans another graphic novel. “Why? Out of passion. There is no other reason!” he explains.

To tell a story “People want to tell such stories. But how do we sell it and where?” asks Tina. With technology and a vibrant Indie comic scene there is no dearth of talent or ideas, but the issue is marketing. Since these are niche, the readership is limited making it unviable for publishers to take on.

Lack of awareness is a factor, “People are unfamiliar with this genre in Kerala. Also they don’t understand the prices, since these are thought of as comic books which they are not,” says Joshy.

The unfamiliarity percolates to the publishing industry for which the genre is not viable. However comic fests such as the recently concluded Indie Comix Fest (ICF) offer these creators the elusive platform to gauge interest and meet prospective consumers of their product. These books are priced from ₹150 upwards.

Joshy and Muraleedharan both draw each picture by hand, colouring them, using technology (Photoshop) only for page layout and printing requirements. Each artist has his or her own style, not all hand draw there are others who prefer to work with tablets and software.

Comic collector Tony Davis says, of what draws him to these, “It is the familiarity of one’s own language, landscape, and culture - this is a huge factor. With these the reader base of graphic work increases drawing more people to it so that it is no longer limited to an urban demographic.” He however cautions against sticking to formulae such as mythology of fantasy. “The story has to be relatable. Content should be contemporary like vigilante-type stories, satire, or adventure. Sticking to the tried and tested such as mythology or fantasy is safe, but creators should take a risk.”

The work that goes into a graphic comic is often more than a regular comic book, some compare these with films for their detailing and narrative style. The comic book format has great potential, says Muraleedharan, but he adds, “it is not considered mainstream and has not been acknowledged as a form of literature. There is more to this form than just pictures, it is interpretative and imaginative as it is art.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/bdk108/article30531589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cover-pannimalathjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/a-small-fiesty-group-of-talented-designers-is-creating-locally-rooted-stories-in-a-fresh-form-they-may-not-be-making-profits-yet-and-their-audience-is-niche-but-that-just-makes-it-more-interesting/article30531593.ece
391,2020/01/10,Full-time farmer K Naveen works towards preserving nature,"In many ways, K Naveen is the Renaissance Man of agriculture. Proud to be a full-time farmer since 2006, the Thuraiyur resident’s career trajectory is full of interesting ancillary passions like animal rescue, social work and cultivating a spirit of enquiry among school children in his vicinity through his monthly science club.

His love for animals recently made him a social media star when a video of him rescuing a peacock marooned in a deep well with a snake went viral (see related story). Among his growing collection of pets donated by their city-dwelling owners who are unwilling or unable to keep them, are a horse, a camel, and several dogs and cats, besides rabbits and iguanas.

At a time when farmers’ children are moving away from agriculture, 38-year-old Naveen’s steadfast faith in the traditional occupation is a pleasant surprise. “In my area, after Class 10, boys would rather work as cab drivers than come to the fields,” says Naveen, who initially assisted his father D Krishnan. “Agriculture is indeed a difficult way to earn a living, but a long-term vision helps one to see consistent results.”

Maximising resources

Naveen has done his Masters and MPhil in Biotechnology from Bishop Heber College, Tiruchi. He has also undergone training from Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad, which inspired him to develop his 10-hectare (approximately 24 acres) ‘Naveen Garden’ farm back in Krishnapuram, Mavilipatty Panchayat.

For irrigation, Naveen used bore wells and a pumping system to channel the water into a tank in the dry parts of the field. Rainwater harvesting and methods like drip irrigation and rain gun sprinkler systems have helped to make the best of the scarce resources in this area.

“You don’t need to have a big financial infrastructure for agriculture, but you must work out the daily expenses carefully,” says Naveen, who suffered heavy losses due to an acute shortage of water, labour and electricity in 2010, and closed down operations for a year to re-orientate his goals. “I realised that the only way ahead would be an integrative approach, with technology,” he says, “so I started by fencing in my farm, and then created sections for animal husbandry, sustainable farming trials, and a variety of crops.”

In 2013, Naveen was awarded the Karmaveerar Kamarasar Viruthu by the State Government for his successful efforts.

Model farm

The farm today grows paddy, maize, groundnut, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fodder crops. Its grove of 3,500 ultra-high density (UHD) pomegranate trees is considered to be one of the biggest of its kind in Tamil Nadu. The variety of farming methods used here have made it a training centre for agronomists through Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and District Rural Development Agencies (DRDA).

Two acres of the land has been dedicated to Miyawaki afforestation, with each plot having five different types of plants. Unlike a conventional Miyawaki forest that is usually too dense to be explored when it matures, the farm has made enough space for pathways that can be used for nature studies.

The animal husbandry unit has poultry, fisheries, a beekeeping facility and dairy cattle, besides a shelter for abandoned pet animals.

The farm is also home to the new breed of Nari-Suvarna sheep developed by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute in Phaltan, Maharashtra. Considered to be a boon to small-holding farmers, this breed gives birth to two or three lambs at a time, unlike the single lamb-producing local sheep.

Daring rescue Late last year, Naveen responded to an animal rescue call and found himself under the media spotlight after a video of his work went viral online. “I have always loved snakes since childhood, and have been part of rescue efforts in and around my farm for a long time,” says Naveen, who is authorised to carry out such operations by municipal authorities.

In this particular case, Naveen was called when villagers reported a peacock to be marooned inside a deep well with a snake. “If it was just the bird, anyone would have been able to deal with it, but because of the snake, they called me,” he says.

With some urgent Google research, Naveen decided to tie harness ropes around him as a ‘chair knot’ and had himself lowered into the well with the help of bystanders. “Once we got past 40 feet, it became quite dark, and I was feeling a bit scared myself. I kept looking for the snake, but it seemed to be hiding in the crevices of the rock walls. Luckily I was able to catch hold of the peacock quickly,” he recalls.

In the video, still available online, Naveen, who is also an avid trekker, can be seen shouting out instructions to his helpers, and clambering up the last section of the slippery wall with a precarious leap. “I released the peacock back into the wild because it was unhurt,” says Naveen. “For farmers, snakes are the best option to control rodents on the fields. It’s a pity they are so misunderstood by the public.”

Scientists from Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) regularly visit the farm to confirm the genetic makeup through blood sample collection and subsequent DNA finger-printing.

Social conscience

Naveen’s NGO Global Nature Foundation (founded in 2011) coordinates his environmental and conservation projects. It also sponsors research in agriculture.

Last year, the foundation’s supporters in Bengaluru began a branch office called Roots for Fruits to sensitise that city’s young people towards a more eco-friendly and socially responsible lifestyle.

From 2012, Naveen has been overseeing a sparrow conservation project with the help of 500 nesting boxes fixed in various places.

Nearly 45 school and college students of his monthly science club, started in 2015, have excelled in the district- and state-level competitions.

Naveen has is now collaborating with his Namakkal-based family friend Gowri Vasudevan in building a care facility worth ₹75 lakhs for homeless people with mental health problems. “This is our way of serving the disadvantaged sections of society. The home conforms to Government norms on such facilities, and will include standardised healthcare procedures in a serene setting within the farm,” he says.

Naveen Garden has become a popular destination for ‘agri-tourism’, especially among educational institutions in the region.

“Talking to children about the ecosystem helps them to understand the importance of preserving nature. We also get many teams of research scholars and volunteers from India and abroad who like to become part of the daily routine of the farm,” says Naveen.

392,2020/01/10,Code red: isn’t the global climate crisis our third world war?,"Australia is reeling under its worst bushfires in history, over 60 people have died in the ongoing Jakarta floods, Western Norway is experiencing an unusual heatwave in January... the list of climate catastrophes the world is witnessing is endless. With intensifying U.S.-Iran tensions, the term ‘World War 3’ is now going viral on social media platforms. But haven’t we all been at war already? Isn’t the raging global climate crisis our third world war? People are now questioning the economic implications of a third world war and if, in fact, we can afford it.

Running out of time

The latest report by Australian think-tank Breakthrough – National Centre for Climate Restoration, called ‘Climate Emergency Defined’, is a great read to understand why we need to act, and fast. Authored by environmentalist Paul Gilding, it analyses the scale, timing and urgency of the risks posed by climate change to determine ‘whether an emergency response is both necessary and feasible’.

For example, it highlights how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 report (on the impacts of global warming 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels) stated that we need to first cut CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 (from 2010 levels), then reduce them to zero by 2050. ‘This compares to the globally agreed Paris climate targets which involve not a 45% reduction, but an increase in emissions by 2030’.

Gliding writes that to turn these numbers around in just a decade requires a transformational change in the direction and structure of the economy. ‘This is sufficient by itself to justify an emergency response... Only an emergency mobilisation could possibly achieve such a result in such a short time’. Failing to do so, he says, “could commit humanity to widespread misery for hundreds and possibly thousands of years. It could literally change the course of evolution and human history.”

Need of the hour At a minimum (considering the history of underestimated impacts), we will most likely need to:

Reduce CO2 emissions by significantly more than 45% in around 10 years

Achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions well before 2050

Remove warming gases from the atmosphere urgently to curtail system feedbacks

Are leaders listening?

Yet, one can’t be sure that governments are serious about mitigating climate change. Australia’s fires have been raging since September and the country has lost over 6.3 million hectares of bush, forest land, and countless animals. Yet, Sydney’s iconic fireworks display on New Year’s Eve went as planned. Prime Minister Scott Morrison ignored calls to skip them and enjoyed a lavish party even as the country was burning.

Donald Trump is known to mock climate change and he has not only withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement but has rolled back regulations (set in place by the Obama government) aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions. He has also vehemently opposed US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal (GND) — a proposed legislation that aims to address climate change and economic inequality.

Back home, India Meteorological Department’s report released on January 6 reveals that the average temperature across the country in 2019 was above normal. That we witnessed several high impact weather events like extremely heavy rainfall, heat and cold waves, snowfall, thunderstorms, dust storms, lightning, floods, etc. The Arabian Sea, which usually sees one cyclone a year, had five in 2019. Meanwhile, people are fighting the government to save Aarey Colony in Mumbai, reduce pollution in Delhi, and save forests from being razed for mining in Odisha’s Talabira region. It is interesting to note that at the 2015 Paris Summit, PM Narendra Modi claimed that India did not create the climate change menace but was suffering its consequences. Need we say more?

And to think Albert Einstein knew this decades ago: ‘I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.’

393,2020/01/10,The Shikra is a bird that embodies brains and bravery,"The talents of the Shikra (Accipiter badius) have long been known. Great courage, coupled with intellect as a hunter, making it one of the easiest to train and tame (this is illegal now), made the Shikra the most common bird used in the art of falconry across the country in pre-independence times. Falconry is the keeping and training of birds of prey, especially the falcon, and hunting with them, a practice still prevalent in Pakistan and a few Gulf countries.

The bird’s brilliance had several eminent colonial British ornithologists express awe at its capability to hunt and adapt. The Shikra is one of the commonest hawks in India. Its name has been derived from Urdu, and the Hindi word, shikari, meaning hunter. It justifies its name with majesty . As the apex predator in the urban avian world of Delhi, watching the Shikra hunt makes a lasting impression.

The size of the small, stout hawk (at 30-36 cm), is no indicator of its skill and ability. The adult males are ashy-blue-grey above with fine brownish-orange, barring on underparts, with deep orange-red eyes. The females are comparatively larger and more brown, with their eye colour varying from deep yellow to orange-yellow. Juveniles have more pale-brown upperparts with pale dull yellow eyes. Their tails are ashy brown with dark bands, and they have a black mesial stripe running down from the white chin across their throat. Their wings are rounded and they have a long tail.

Shikras frequent open jungles, and even urban gardens and avenues. It avoids dense jungles and deserts but is found in every other type of habitat, preferring areas with plenty of large trees. To hunt, it either takes a low, stealthy flight along the treeline, pouncing on an unwary bird or animal. Sometimes, it soars high in circles and dives down at the sight of prey.

Its diet consists of lizards, frogs, grasshoppers and small birds and fledglings, but it is sometimes brazen enough to go for bigger birds like the Greater Coucal, Spotted Owlet and even bats.

The Shikra most often can be observed flying from one tree to another, with rapidly flapping wings, followed by short glides, and disappearing into the foliage.

It is rather a noisy hawk, and the shrill call of notes titu-titu is a familiar sound prior to and during establishment of pair bonds and when breeding. Their nesting season lasts from April to June, which is quite an interesting time to observe their behaviour from a distance.

Their nest looks like a loosely built cup of twigs and sticks, untidy, much like that of crows. They aren’t exactly homely birds. However, they do take precautions by building their nests usually in trees, well screened by leaves in order to reduce any kind of outside disturbance. In cities, they can be aggressive, defending their nest from crows and other creatures (even humans). Both males and females incubate the eggs (they believe in equality) but males are the primary food-bearers.

It was the Shikra’s attempt to hunt in my garden, that made me notice the bird properly for the first time. For over a month, a Shikra would perch on a tree near my house, eyeing squirrels in the neighbourhood. The exceptional patience, discipline and skill displayed every single day completely won me over. Though I don’t remember it preying on the squirrels successfully, it did manage to fly away with rodents, insects, a skink (a kind of lizard), and my heart.

394,2020/01/10,Award-winning farmer SR Sundararaman on taking the organic path,"Breast-fed babies or bottle-fed ones? Which is the healthier one? Organic farmer SR Sundararaman asks me. The farmer was in the city for a session on organic farming, organised by Bio Basics and On The Go. “Any nutrient that is artificially fed can never be a substitute to what is available naturally. The same principle applies to soil. It has to be nourished the natural way to get good yield in organic farming,” he declares.

Seventy-eight-year-old Sundararaman from Satyamangalam in Erode district is an award-winning organic farmer with over five decades of experience. For 30 years, he says he practised conventional farming before taking the organic path. “For the last 28 years, I grow turmeric, banana, tapioca, coconut and fodder crops. During the green revolution, I learnt a lot about conventional farming from my brother SR Ramakrishnan who worked in a fertilizer company. The lessons came in handy when I made the switch.”

He says going organic is inevitable as any other way is not sustainable. “Environmentalist S.N. Nagarajan predicted that there will be large scale land degradation from rampant use of fertilizers and pesticides; a spurt in diseases and a flourishing of hospitals.” Sundaraman says how once five ml pesticides was enough to control pests, now 60ml is required as the pests have become resistant.”

Sundararaman’s learnings from inorganic farming turned out to be a boon. “I looked for organic solutions. And found them in my gurus L. Narayana Reddy, a farmer from Karnataka and Dabholkar an expert in natural eco-culture and also a Math professor from Pune University. I also worked with Balakrishnan from Tanjore and Bhaskar Save of Maharashtra.”

The first step to a healthy crop is the soil, says Sundaraman quoting Dabholkar. “The top nine inches of soil should have microbes. The first step is to improve their numbers by adding plant or animal waste to the soil,” he explains. This can be done in a 200-day cycle of sowing and ploughing of mixed crops of grains, pulses, oil seeds, nitrogen-giving plants and spices. At the end of the cycle, 50 tonnes of biomass is added to the soil that becomes the food for microbes. “With nine inches of organic matter, what you get is fertile soil with better water retention and aeration qualities. Use farmyard manure as it contains a wealth of nutrients. All you need to ensure is that there is a healthy ecosystem for the microbes to thrive.”

Bring back the original bio-diversityof the soil, urges the organic farmer. “If you do, the crops will naturally develop resistance to disease and adapt themselves to unfavourable conditions.” Sundararaman dispels the myth that organic farming is suitable only for low-yielding native crops. “It is suitable for any high-yielding crop, be it paddy, sugarcane, grains, banana, turmeric or maize. For the last seven years, we have been exporting over 150 tonnes of organic turmeric. We are currently experimenting with moringa and curry leaves.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/nin15h/article30532285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CMORGANICFARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/award-winning-organic-farmer-sr-sundararaman-on-taking-the-organic-path/article30532286.ece
395,2020/01/10,"Jitish Kallat on aliens, interstellar space and breaking the otherness","Imagine a capsule hurtling through space, 13 billion miles from Earth, with information about our species, genetic makeup, animals, architecture, language… a presentation of “our” world to an unknown other, which may come upon these ‘Golden Records’ billions of years from now. Then imagine if that discovery were made now, in our times, when there is global dissent and an absolute loss of a shared vocabulary. Will we be proud of how we appear to those who don’t know us?

Also Read Sounds of dissent

Artist Jitish Kallat was three when NASA, the US space agency, sent the records on board Voyagers 1 and 2, in 1977. Over 40 years later — and after Voyager 2 beamed back its first message two months ago (shedding new light on the structure of the heliosphere, the edge of our solar system) — this attempt to reach out to a distant other has inspired the artist’s latest work, Terranum Nuncius. The solo exhibition at Famous Studio debuts Covering Letter, a photographic and sound-based installation pivoting on cosmology, and Ellipsis, a 60-foot painting, which is his largest to date.

These two works could not have come at a more appropriate time, as we find ourselves in a deeply divided world that appears hell-bent on tearing itself into opposing camps. Kallat hopes to bring about a collective meditation on ourselves as “united residents of a single planet”, where the only ‘other’ is an unknown intergalactic alien.

Search for the lost

His interest in the galaxy might be a departure from his earlier allegorical work that combined self-portraiture and images of urban chaos, but not so his interest in language. “I’ve always been interested in utterances, whether it is the spoken or the written word. Speech [like in the Public Notice trilogy] helps us return to the past, to rethink what it means to be in the present,” he says, speaking about the germination of the work. “I’ve been very interested in these images dispatched into space, and now on the outskirts of the solar system. The only artefects made by our species that are in interstellar space.”

Kallat explains that the work brings viewers towards the contemplation of our mortality and extinction. “Thinking of that brings an urgency to our present moment. Also, the human desire to communicate is very powerful for me, especially in the current moment that we inhabit globally, where we see ourselves split into binaries: religious binaries, or ideological and gender separations. There is a loss of vocabulary to reach what is seemingly the other. At the heart of Terranum Nuncius is this search for a vocabulary.”

Here's what artists on social media brought out during the recent CAA, NRC and NPR protests

Ashwin Chacko | @whackochacko: “Every period is defined by its art, and our generation is no different,” says the Mussoorie-based illustrator, who put out a series on police brutality during the protests. “[Artists] push society towards a better future.” Rohan Chakravarty | @green_humour: Popular for his eco-centric comics, Chakravarty has now been posting political content. To those objecting to the shift, he says, “Your suggestion is valued, and the inconvenience is regretted.” Rachita Taneja | @sanitarypanels: With those in power spreading wrong facts and backtracking on earlier claims about CAA, NRC and NPR, Taneja says she made this comic “to show that their actions will have consequences”. Priyanka Gogoi | @phophophoworld: With this poster, the Assamese illustrator attempted to portray “the amicable relationship between communities in the state, and how everyone stood together to protest”. Priya Kuriyan | @priyakuriyan: In this sketch, the Bengaluru-based illustrator has taken off on the saying Jhoot bole, kauwa kaate ( When you lie, the crow will caw). As a self-described people watcher, she has also been sharing quirky illustrations of protestors. Lamya Khan | @agraphicnerd: When she conceptualised this poster, Khan saw art pushing the boundaries of conversation and making people think. “When your back is against the wall and you can't be pushed any further... It has given me courage to speak against this government through my art.” Appupen | @appupen: The graphic novel artist and author has rolled out season three of his Rashtraman cartoon (initially launched in 2018). The satirical take on current events includes conversations with BR Ambedkar on how to fight corruption (by making it legal) and more.

The galaxy and beyond

Covering Letter is presented as a large round table with over 100 backlit 3D photographic transparencies on it. The images slowly illuminate and go into darkness — almost like being calibrated to the speed of human breathing. (Kallat referenced images that California-based programmer, Ron Barry, downloaded on the Golden Records’ 40th anniversary, from the sound files uploaded on Voyager.) Projected on the wall is the return address of the intergalactic ‘letter’. “It is a diagram drawn showing the location of the sun in relation to 14 pulsars. Now we know there hundreds of pulsars, so whoever finds this capsule won’t be able to find us,” he says. The projection is set to the sound of greetings in 55 languages.

“We are all as one, but we create the otherness between ourselves. That generates alienation, violence and brutality. But when the other is so far away and is unknowable, the sender of this message becomes us, a unitary planetary message... it is the summary of our existence to the universe,” he adds.

Kallat also addresses how the interstellar agent may not be able to understand our communication. “I think that somewhere, at the heart of this work, is also the absence of certitude. Everything that plays out on our television channels is about people’s sureties about themselves. So, this work reaches to the other end of the spectrum and speaks of the world we do not know,” he says.

Sign of the times

Meanwhile, Ellipsis — much like a “diary being laid open to read” — started as a speculation of abstractions. “I returned to painting after a gap of close to five years. While working on specific canvases in 2018, I parallelly began making marks on various other canvases. These fragments began to grow slowly, gathering momentum... and coalesced into Ellipsis,” says Kallat, commenting that the graph itself, which he drew to connect the scattered images, also began to change and atrophy as he created it. “This painting [evoking the environmental, geological, the earthly, etc] is a dive into the unknown. I believe that my works, politically or socially motivated, cannot be read only in one manner,”

He illustrates his comment with the example of the first edition of Covering Letter, where he projected a letter from Mahatma Gandhi to Hitler, pleading for peace, on to clouds of artificial fog. “It premiered at the Philadelphia Museum of Art at a time when Trump had just won the elections and that had a deep bearing on the manner in which the work was read,” he says. It has since travelled widely and was last exhibited at the 2019 Venice Biennale, as part of the India Pavilion show, Our Time for a Future Caring.

One hopes that Kallat’s latest contemplations will be read in the right spirit. After all, as the artist repeatedly states in his interviews, “My primary need is not to produce a placard pointing to one message, but a cluster of signs to create self-reflection.”

The exhibition is on till January 21, at Famous Studio, Worli, Mumbai.

396,2020/01/10,Sounds of dissent,"The night when Jawaharlal Nehru University turned into the red-hot epicentre of violence against students, singer-songwriter Ankur Tewari was in a green room in Mumbai, waiting to go up on stage. “I was shaking as I saw the videos, shocked at the audacity of those who felt they could barge into JNU. This was instigated violence [against those who had the courage to speak up against the National Register of Citizens and Citizen Amendment Act] and I felt I had to do something,” says Tewari, who wrote ‘Woh Hum Nahin’ right there in the green room and later uploaded a video recording off his phone. The song has his stamp, with the lilting notes of a ballad rather than the angry fire associated with a protest anthem. “I want to protest with love,” he says. “I don’t want to write songs that are hating on others. I performed the song at the Carter Road and Gateway protests recently and people were singing along,” adds Tewari, who was the music supervisor of Gully Boy, a film which captured India’s burgeoning hip-hop music scene.

Here's what artists on social media brought out during the recent CAA, NRC and NPR protests

Ashwin Chacko | @whackochacko: “Every period is defined by its art, and our generation is no different,” says the Mussoorie-based illustrator, who put out a series on police brutality during the protests. “[Artists] push society towards a better future.” Rohan Chakravarty | @green_humour: Popular for his eco-centric comics, Chakravarty has now been posting political content. To those objecting to the shift, he says, “Your suggestion is valued, and the inconvenience is regretted.” Rachita Taneja | @sanitarypanels: With those in power spreading wrong facts and backtracking on earlier claims about CAA, NRC and NPR, Taneja says she made this comic “to show that their actions will have consequences”. Priyanka Gogoi | @phophophoworld: With this poster, the Assamese illustrator attempted to portray “the amicable relationship between communities in the state, and how everyone stood together to protest”. Priya Kuriyan | @priyakuriyan: In this sketch, the Bengaluru-based illustrator has taken off on the saying Jhoot bole, kauwa kaate ( When you lie, the crow will caw). As a self-described people watcher, she has also been sharing quirky illustrations of protestors. Lamya Khan | @agraphicnerd: When she conceptualised this poster, Khan saw art pushing the boundaries of conversation and making people think. “When your back is against the wall and you can't be pushed any further... It has given me courage to speak against this government through my art.” Appupen | @appupen: The graphic novel artist and author has rolled out season three of his Rashtraman cartoon (initially launched in 2018). The satirical take on current events includes conversations with BR Ambedkar on how to fight corruption (by making it legal) and more.

Voices in union

The voices may be new and the vocabulary different, but the fire once lit by Ambedkarite shahirs in Maharashtra (Dalit singers who sang against casteism) and the Burra Katha musicians from erstwhile Andhra Pradesh (who rose to prominence during the pre-independence period, performing on themes of colonial oppression) seems to be blazing now. “You can’t live in India and not write protest songs,” says Tewari.

Taru Dalmia, aka Delhi Sultanate

However, artistes across the country are cautious. Not everyone wants to create a polarising narrative. Independent music label, Azadi Records, released the track ‘Scalp Dem’ in the week that the Delhi police reportedly assaulted and fired tear gas at the students of Jamia Millia Islamia. Rap and reggae artist, Taru Dalmia, who performs as Delhi Sultanate, co-wrote the song with Delhi-based hip-hop group, Seedhe Maut. It was released as a lyric video last month, but it is unlikely that it will be performed at any of the protests. “The song can be misinterpreted as hurting Hindu sentiments, which is not our intention,” says Dalmia, who has been attending protests in Delhi. “This is about Hindutva and extremists, and the song is a play on how people have used this as a license to exercise violence.”

Inspiring the masses

On its own, music may not have the power to convince or convert those who are pro-CAA and NRC, but it can perhaps contribute to a groundswell of public opinion and inspire more people to join the protests, believes Dalmia.

Bruce Lee Mani and band members of Thermal And A Quarter

Bengaluru band Thermal And A Quarter’s lead vocalist Bruce Lee Mani says his biggest achievement has been to have rational conversations about the protests with his followers and convince his 15-year-old son to participate. “He’d stayed away until now. The first thing he said when he came along [to the Town Hall protest] was that there should’ve been more people,” says Mani. At the Music For Harmony concert in Bengaluru a couple of weeks ago, TAAQ performed tracks such as ‘No Mo-Shah’ and ‘A World Gone Mad’, a song that was written almost two years ago but the lyrics of which seem more prophetic than ever now:

In this world gone mad

Choose the lies you want

Choose the hate that's closest to your heart

In this world gone mad

How do blurring lines suddenly tear you apart

In this world gone mad…

The idea of the nation in the throes of an apocalyptic madness is one that has also inspired Kolkata hip-hop collective Park Circus’s rapper BC Azad to write ‘Krantikari’. “For six years, I’ve been watching the world go crazy. At the moment, there’s a battle for the consciousness of India, where idealism seems to be lost to our generation. But a lot of people have begun to question their status quo. I wrote this song so that people could step out and reclaim their country,” says the rapper. Azad’s subtle yet reflexive lyrics take down everyone from politicians to god men to actors who support NRC and CAA. As rallying cries go, ‘Krantikari’ is the laal salaam that this generation of protesters have been waiting for.

397,2020/01/10,Behind the scenes of the Murajapam Festival at Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple,"“Usually we play cricket or badminton after the siesta. But today we are off to Thiruvattar to pray at Adikesava Perumal Temple in Kanyakumari district,” says Eshwar Sharma, before he rushes off to change into a T-shirt and dhoti.

Eshwar is one of the 72 youngsters staying at the gracious Vadakke Kottaram on Padmavilasam Road near the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. All of them, in the age group of 20 to 30, are scholars in the Vedas. They lead the chanting of the Vedas at the 45th edition of the 56-day Murajapam festival at the temple, which concludes on January 15 with the grand Lakshadeepam, when the temple will glow in the light of one lakh oil lamps.

The Murajapam was first organised at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple by Marthanda Varma (1705-1758), the architect of Travancore, after he shifted his capital from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram. In 1744, he had conducted a Bhadradeepam at the temple, and the Murajapam is believed to have been first conducted in 1750 when he invited Vedic scholars from all across Kerala to participate in the grand ritual. Since then, this practice has been followed by the heirs of the King. This is the first time that the temple trust is organising the Murajapam.

“Prior to the Murajapam in Thiruvananthapuram, Sucheendram, which was then a part of Travancore, used to host the Murajapam but not on such a grand scale,” says history buff Prathap Kizhakkemadom.

“Murajapam pana, written by an anonymous poet, gives us a clear and vivid picture of the festivities that surrounded the ritual in 1804. According to poet and writer Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer (1877-1949), this work, which was given to him by Ottasekhamangalam Achuthan Namboodiri must be one of the oldest descriptions of the ritual. Ulloor was collecting old palm leaf documents and books from all corners of Kerala for his seminal work on Kerala Sahitya Charithram, a comprehensive documentation of Malayalam language when he came across this version of the Murajapam pana,” says Prathap.

According to Prathap, Ulloor says although the work on the Murajapam was not of the highest literary standards, it was a work that deserved attention on account of its descriptive details of the festival.

“It is an eyewitness account of a commoner who is in awe of the grandeur of the festival. There are details about the preparations for the rituals, the food that was prepared for scholars and Namboodiris, the raw materials that were stocked and so on. In those days, sadya was not such a common feature for ordinary people. So, the feasts with a number of curries, pappadam and payasam were a rare sight for many. The entire administration would be involved in the conduct of the ritual. More than 1,500 Namboodiris used to participate in the festivities,” he adds. Although the numbers have come down, many of the rituals continue to be practised by the young scholars.

“They are young and may appear carefree. But they are a well-versed and dedicated bunch. Study of the Vedas is a way of life for these men from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. At the same time, like most other people of their age, they are up-to-date with modern technology and gadgets,” says S Kasturi Rangan of Kerala Brahmana Sabha (KBS), which looks after the scholars during the course of the festival.

A highlight this year is the just-concluded ‘Jalajapam’, which was revived after nearly a century. In this session, the scholars stand in the Padmatheertham, the temple pond, and chant ancient hymns, adds KP Madhusudhanan, another member of the KBS.

Fact file Murajapam stands for chanting in turns (‘mura’ means turn, ‘japam’ is chanting). They chant hymns from Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda, with 24 scholars each assigned to recite the verses. The ceremonial chanting is being held in seven sessions, with each lasting for eight days and this is called a ‘mura’. Each mura concludes with a special ‘sheeveli’ or procession.

In addition, sookthams are chanted by 60 scholars in two batches and Vishnu Sahasranamam by 75 scholars. Sahasranama japam and Jalajapam concluded on the 48th day.

The day starts early for them as the murajapam begins at 6.30 am and goes on till 10.30 am. “They have a break at 8 am during which we serve a special parippu kanji and banana (padathi variety),” says Rajukumar R, who heads the kitchen. “The kanji has cherupayar parippu, jaggery and coconut milk,” he adds.

Lunch is more like a sadya though there are specific rules that distinguish it from the traditional Kerala feast. “There are certains dos and don’ts. Use of spices is tempered and even salt is reduced. Raw banana, snake gourd and drumstick are proscribed during the ritual and so also shallots, onions and garlic. Use of coconut is minimal,” says Raju, who was in charge of the kitchen at the previous edition of the Murajapam as well.

Paal payasam, the main prasadam of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, is served every day. In addition, a special payasam is prepared at the end of each ‘mura’. “They all love pappadam. We also make evening snacks; sometimes home-made eats are provided by volunteers. Dinner is usually poori, idli or chappathi or different varieties of rice. Curd rice is a must for dinner. Some of them take a glass of hot milk after dinner,” he explains.

Mukunda Sharma, a Yajurveda exponent from Kancheepuram, says that they are extremely pleased with the arrangements in place for their stay and food. “We are treated with respect and warmth by the temple authorities, the members of the royal family and all those associated with the event,” he says with a broad smile.

Talking about the ceremonial chanting, he points out that certain sessions are strenuous and tough. “But we don’t prepare in advance for this. This is how we spend our lives. All we have to do is get used to new places. That is not difficult considering the significance of the tradition,” he adds.

Murajapam is a learning experience for newbies such as Sreekrishna Sarma, a resident of the city. “I didn’t want to miss out on this because I have to wait for another six years to be part of this again. Learning the Veda is a rigorous exercise, it is like a sacrifice. But all the effort is worth it when we take part in events like this,” Sreekrishna says. However, he rues the fact that not many youngsters in Kerala are taking up the learning of the Vedas. “And those who’ve mastered it want to go outside Kerala,” he adds.

398,2020/01/10,Meet Thiyaga Sekar who teaches Origami at government schools in Tamil Nadu,"“Each piece of paper holds magic within it. It is amazing what it can turn into in the right hands,” says Thiyaga Sekar as he fashions a paper crane at the Corporation Middle School, Krishnarayapuram. Students try to imitate his action and fold the colourful papers into cranes. Why cranes? To remember Sadako who lived in Hiroshima when it was bombed in1945. While Sadako was in hospital fighting cancer caused by the deadly radiation from the bomb, she began making origami cranes believing that if she could make a thousand of them, she would be cured. “But, she died after she had made 644 cranes. After her death, her friends raised money to build her a memorial and a statue of her holding a crane was raised at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Paper cranes are now considered a symbol of peace and love,” explains Sekar as he examines the models made by his students. “Sadako Sasaki made origami popular across the world. She was born on January 7 in 1943 and this is to celebrate the occasion.” he adds.

Thiyaga has been teaching origami across Tamil Nadu for 12 years. “I loved working with paper from a young age. There was a bookseller who used to frequent my school. He gifted me a pop up book and also taught me how to make a paper boat. I don’t remember his face, but I consider him my first origami teacher,” says the 38-year-old. “I wanted to bring a positive change in society and decided to teach children a craft that I loved doing. My first session was at an economically backward area in North Chennai. I still remember the look on their faces as the colourful papers took different shapes,” he exclaims.

But it was not an easy journey for him. “For a long time I did not know the right methodology for origami. There were not many artists in the state who took the craft seriously. So, I had to learn it all myself. I read books and researched online. It was also difficult to get schools to allow me to teach the students in the early days. The authorities were not aware of the benefits of origami, but now things have changed,” he says. He has taught in more than 1000 schools . “Most of them are government schools. Children there do not get access to such craft. I fill in the gap,” he smiles.

Thiyaga can now make more than 500 different origami models with paper. “I use it to introduce the basic concepts of math and science. Origami also developsobservation in children along with motor skills,” he says. He has taught hearing and speech impaired children who not only enjoyed the craft, but were very adept at it. “I started with a school in Tiruppur. They learn origami much faster as they have great observation abilities. In Coimbatore, I teach at the Corporation School for Deaf Children at R S Puram,” he says. Thiyaga hasauthored a Tamil book on origami called Kokkukalkakave Vanam in 2017. “It has step by step instructions to make different models and is easy to follow,” he says. He now plans to take his craft to other parts of the country. “I hope to visit every village in the country and spread the craft.”

400,2020/01/10,NASA discovers Earth-sized exoplanet in habitable zone,"Researchers have discovered an Earth-sized planet that lies in its star’s habitable zone — the range of distances from a star where conditions may be just right to allow the presence of liquid water on the surface. The planet was discovered using NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the first Earth-sized planet that has been discovered since the satellite was launched in April 2018.

The star lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere.

Emily Gilbert from the University of Chicago in Illinois and others discovered a small, cool M dwarf star (TOI 700) located just over 100 light-years away in the southern constellation Dorado. Ms. Gilbert, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, reported the discovery on January 6 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii. The authors have posted a reprint at Arxiv on January 7.

The star is roughly 40% of the Sun’s mass and size and about half its surface temperature. “TOI-700 is a quiet star, with no detectable flares in the optical TESS data, making it an optimal target for habitability studies of planets orbiting M dwarfs,” the authors write in the preprint.

Three have been found orbiting the star. The innermost planet is almost the size of the Earth and completes an orbit in 10 days. The middle planet is 2.6 times the size of the Earth and completes an orbit in 16 days. The third outer planet — TOI 700 d — is about 1.2 times the size of Earth and takes 37 days to complete one orbit. It receives from its star 86% of the energy that the Sun provides to Earth and so considered to be in the habitable zone of the star. All the three planets are thought to be tidally locked to the star. As a result, they rotate only once per orbit such that one side is constantly facing the star.

While the approximate mass of the star has been calculated, the Earth-like planet’s mass has not been measured yet. Knowing the mass of the planet will allow scientists to calculate the density and hence deduce if it is rocky or made of gas like in the case of Neptune.

Researchers had earlier misclassified the star in the TESS database as being similar to the Sun. As a result, the planets were supposed to be hotter and bigger than they actually were. This mistake was later corrected.

“When we corrected the star’s parameters, the sizes of its planets dropped, and we realized the outermost one was about the size of Earth and in the habitable zone,” Ms. Gilbert was quoted as saying in a NASA release. “Additionally, in 11 months of data we saw no flares from the star, which improves the chances TOI 700 d is habitable and makes it easier to model its atmospheric and surface conditions.”

“TESS will return to the Southern Hemisphere observe TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in TESS’s extended mission, which is scheduled to begin in July 2020. This will enable studies for additional evidence of transit timing variations, place further constraints on planet parameters, and searches for additional planets in the system,” the authors write.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/vsmt4b/article30533236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10Exoplanet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nasa-discovers-earth-sized-exoplanet-in-habitable-zone/article30533237.ece
