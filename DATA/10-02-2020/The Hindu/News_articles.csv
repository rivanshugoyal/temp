0,2020/02/10,Aditya Mehta triumphs Pankaj Advani,"Aditya Mehta defeated multiple-time World champion Pankaj Advani 6-2 to win the National snooker championship here.

Mehta, who represented the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) in the clash on Sunday night, started off with a bang after wining the first frame 103-17, with a break of 103.

He lost the next two frames and it looked like Advani was staging a comeback.

But, Mehta held his nerve and claimed the following four frames to win the title 6-2.

In the women’s snooker final, Karnataka’s Vidya Pillai edged out Amee Kamani of Madhya Pradesh 3-2 (41-68, 57 -35, 37-61, 69-50, 87-05) to defend her senior ladies snooker title.

The results: Finals: Men: Aditya Mehta bt Pankaj Advani 6-2 (103(103*)-17, 50-58, 47-48, 70-40, 83(51)-36, 69(61)-07, 79-29, 64-28).

1,2020/02/10,"Anand, the author, is just loving it","Viswanathan Anand, the author, is just loving it. Select city-hopping to promote his book, Mind Master and getting a first-hand feedback on his honest effort.

So you begin by asking the Grandmaster, how does it feel to be an author?

Adding to public idea

“I would say it's very nice. But you have to do this with some enthusiasm,” says Anand and elaborates, “the point of the book is to share, add to the public idea of what, who or what you are.

“I mean, most people have a certain impression of what a chess player is like, what you do and so on. And they now have something which is slightly closer to the truth.

“That's why I felt that it was important to address this book as a chance to get your story out and, you know, you have to divulge stuff. So even though that’s not something I normally do liberally, over the last few years, I found that I have opened up in many ways.

Been fun

“I talk more frankly. May be, it's just the sense that, now everything's in the past and I can talk about it without the pains and so on. But it's been fun for me. I had this feeling of something, you know, I've done it. Now I can't do anything more.”

Did any of the chess players get back to you on this?

“Quite a few players said they really liked it. Many players said they couldn’t get it yet. I probably expect more feedback later. (Boris) Gefland said he loved it. He was in Chennai and he read it on the flight back home.

“Kramnik didn't mention it. Anish (Giri) even tweeted something, you know, as usual. I'm sure if I probed he would tell me something. But I expect the few others will read it as well.”

Away from the book, what does your schedule for 2020 look like?

Light year

“For the moment. I’ve got a tournament — Grenke Chess Open in April. Hopefully I'll get an event in May. And then it's a fairly light year because I am not playing the Grand Chess Tour. I'll play the Olympiad, maybe. And if some new tournament turns up, I might go for that.

“After all these years of complaining that the schedule was heavy, if I spend this year complaining, it doesn't make sense. So I thought I'll just go with the flow, keep working, keep training and also enjoy more time at home.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/3s2wqg/article30785641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11ANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/anand-the-author-is-just-loving-it/article30785642.ece
2,2020/02/10,Harika beats Kosteniuk in Cairns Cup,"India’s D. Harika got the better of former world champion Alexandra Kosteniuk in the third round of the Cairns Cup chess tournament here.

Meanwhile, K. Humpy drew with reigning world champion Ju Wenjun of China in 22 moves late on Sunday, to take her tally to 1.5 points.

Harika, who is unbeaten after three rounds, is joint second with two points along with former world champion Mariya Muzychuk (Ukraine) and Katernya Lagno (Russia).

Georgia’s Nana Dzagnidze beat American player Carissa Yip in 55 moves with white pieces, overcoming a stubborn challenge from the youngster. She leads the field with 2.5 points after three rounds.

Defending champion Valentina Gunina defeated Irina Krush to earn her first win of the tournament.

Harika, ranked ninth in the latest FIDE rankings, after draws in the first two rounds, played black against Kosteniuk in a Spanish opening game and took advantage in the middle when the Russian made a few errors. She won in 57 moves.

Humpy, on the other hand, smarting from a loss to Muzychuk in round two, played it safe against her Chinese opponent and they signed the peace treaty in 22 moves. In the fourth round, Harika faces American Irina Krush while Humpy takes on Lagno.

Third round results:

Nana Dzagnidze (2.5) bt Carissa Yip (0), K. Humpy (1.5) drew Ju Wenjun (1.5), D.

3,2020/02/10,Three Indians for NBA’s BWB camp,"Indian players Siya Deodhar, Harsimran Kaur and Amaan Sandhu have been named among 64 boys and girls from 34 nations for the sixth Basketball Without Borders (BWB) camp from February 14 to 16. The players’ shortlist was announced by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) for the camp in Chicago at Quest Multisport as part of NBA All-Star 2020.

The coaches are 2020 NBA All-Star Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors), Davis Bertans (Washington Wizards), Tacko Fall (Boston Celtics) and 2017-18 NBA All-Rookie First Team member Lauri Markkanen (Chicago Bulls). They will be joined by former WNBA players Ashley Battle, Michele Van Gorp and Ebony Hoffman, as well as select players from NBA All-Star 2020.

Chicago Bulls assistant coach Karen Stack Umlauf, Milwaukee Bucks assistant coaches Vin Baker, Josh Longstaff and Ben Sullivan, and Chicago Sky director of player development John Azzinaro will also serve as BWB Global coaches. The players and coaches will lead the campers through a variety of activities on and off the court, including movement efficiency, skill development stations, shooting and skills competitions, 5-on-5 games, and life skills seminars.

The final day will feature a single-elimination tournament culminating with the boys and girls championship games.

4,2020/02/10,AICF elections: Justice Kalifulla finalises nominations,"Notwithstanding legal intervention and delay, secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan and four members of his election panel are set to get elected unopposed to the All India Chess Federation (AICF) for the term 2020-2023.

The situation arose after the nomination papers filed by his rival, presidential-candidate Venketrama Raja and 22 others were found invalid by the Madras High Court-appointed Returning Officer Justice F.M. Ibrahim Kalifulla on Sunday.

Since there are only five nominees in the fray for as many posts — Messrs Ajay Patel (president), Vipnesh Bhardwaj (vice-president), Bharat Singh Chauhan (secretary), Arun Singh (joint secretary) and Naresh Sharma (treasurer) — they could be declared elected unopposed, ahead of the scheduled voting in Hyderabad on February 23.

Order to be challenged

Ravindra Dongre, whose papers for the post of secretary from Raja’s panel were found invalid, told The Hindu, “Soon, we will approach an appropriate court of law to challenge the order of the Returning Officer.”

After the scrutiny of nomination papers was taken up on February 8 in Chennai and the rival factions put forth their arguments through their advocates, Justice Kalifulla rejected 23 nominations.

In his 11-page order, Kalifulla highlighted the main reason for rejection of nominations was the violation of para 6.4 of the National Sports Development Code, which reads as under:

“6.4 - Each nomination paper shall be delivered personally to the Returning Officer in person by the candidate himself/herself from…”

Elaboration

Elaborating on his verdict, Kalifulla stated, “the inevitable conclusion would be that any candidate who wish to contest for any of the posts either president or vice-president or secretary or joint secretary or treasurer, he should file his nomination paper personally by handing it over to the Returning Officer and the said condition will have to be scrupulously followed.

When that is the ultimate resultant position of the implication of para 6.4 of the Code and the attending circumstances, in the present case, I find that the candidature of the following persons for different posts having failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of para 6.4, they cannot be held to be validly nominated candidates.”

List of nominations found invalid: President: P. R. Venketrama Raja; Secretary: Ravindra Dongre; Treasurer: Kishor Bandekar; Vice-president(s): A. Narasimha Reddy, G. Basker, Jagdish Singh Cheema, V. Chandra Sekhar Iyer, Ajay Ajmera, Sanjay Kapoor, Dhiraj Singh Raghuvanshi, Niapung Konia, P.C. Lallianthanga and D.P. Anantha. Joint-secretary: Atul Kumar, Pradip Kumar Choudhuri, R.

5,2020/02/10,"Asia badminton team championship | Praneeth and co. eye medal, crucial points","Unfazed by coronavirus fears, a full-strength Indian men’s team has landed here to compete at the Asia Team Championships from Tuesday, eyeing a medal-winning performance which will give players crucial ranking points in the Olympic year.

The Indian women team, which was supposed to be led by young shuttlers Ashmita Chaliha and Malvika Bansod, chose not to travel for the competition, fearing the spread of coronavirus, which has claimed over 900 lives in China so far.

A 44-year-old Chinese tourist from Wuhan had died on February 1 in Philippines, which has reported three virus cases so far. The two others were discharged from hospital after their tests were reported to be negative.

Former world number one Kidambi Srikanth and 2019 world championship bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth will lead the Indian team which also has HS Prannoy, Subhankar Dey and young Lakshya Sen.

The Indian men’s team, which won the bronze medal in the 2016 Championship, was initially clubbed with two-time defending champions Indonesia and hosts Philippines in Group A but with China and Hong Kong not playing due to a travel ban on them by the Philippines, the draw was re-worked at the team managers’ meeting on Monday.

India are now placed in Group B alongside Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The top two team in each of the four groups will make it to the quarterfinals.

India, who had lost to China 1-3 in the last edition in 2018, will begin their campaign against Kazakhstan on Tuesday before taking on Malaysia on Thursday. This is only the third edition of the Asia Team championship, which serves as Asia qualifiers for the Thomas and Uber Cups.

Praneeth and Co. are expected to have an easy outing against Kazakhstan, who are not a prominent badminton nation, but the clash against Malaysia will be a interesting one.

Malaysia boast of a young team, comprising world no 14 Lee Zii Jia, 2014 Youth Olympic Games gold medallist Cheam June Wei and Leong Jun Hao, a former three-time silver medallist at World Junior Championships.

In doubles, Malaysia have world no 17 pair of Ong Yew Sin and Teo Ee Yi, who claimed the Thailand Masters title last month, and the pair of Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin Mohd Rumsani, who were part of 2018 Asian team Championship bronze medal winning team, in their team.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/frf7qf/article30782402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIPRANEETH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asia-badminton-team-championship-praneeth-and-co-eye-medal-crucial-points/article30782403.ece
6,2020/02/10,National Squash Championships | Ramit Tandon pulls out,"Ramit Tandon, seeded two in the men's section of the ongoing SRFI-77th senior National Squash Championships, has pulled out of the event citing back injury.

Tandon, 27, was supposed to reach the city on Monday when news emerged that he had withdrawn from the Nationals.

Tandon, who is busy on the professional circuit, e-mailed the Squash Rackets Federation of India on Sunday that he had suffered a back injury, which required rest as per medical advice. Abhishek Pradhan of Maharashtra replaces him as the second seed.

Tandon said he injured his back while playing in the Pittsburg Open (January 22-26) and aggravated it in the Motor City Open in Bloomfield Hills, USA (Feb. 5-9).

The 27-year-old, ranked 52 in the world, said it was disappointing to miss the Nationals. “I wanted to play in the Nationals — it would have been my first — and most important I was keen to be a part of ISA’s 20-year celebrations. That's why I entered the event in the first place,” Tandon told The Hindu over phone.

It would be a two-and-a-half week recovery process, he said.

With the squad for the Asian team championships in Kuala Lumpur being picked at the Nationals, Tandon said he was keen to be part of the Indian team. “I would love to play for India. But, it is SRFI's call,” he said.

Qualification matches

Meanwhile, the Indian Squash Academy courts were a beehive of activity with two rounds gone through in men’s qualification. Around 87 matches were scheduled in the day.

7,2020/02/10,Premier Badminton League: Bengaluru Raptors keep title with top show,"Bengaluru Raptors became the first team in the Premier Badminton League championship to win back-to-back titles when it scored a 4-2 win over first-time finalist North-Eastern Warriors in the fifth edition at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Sunday.

Mixed doubles decides

Once again, with scores tied two-all, it was a doubles match which decided the fate of the winner.

And, this time, the mixed doubles pair of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won, playing the Trump match for Raptors, lived up to the expectations of their team and the lustily cheering fans to outslug G. Krishna Prasad and Kim Ha Na and clinch the trophy for their team.

Strong comeback

Earlier, in the first singles match, Sai Praneeth, World championship bronze medallist and captain of Raptors, came back strongly after losing the first game to outplay World No. 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu.

It was a performance which should have pleased even World No. 2 and Sai’s teammate Tai Tzu Ying.

Though he was erratic in the first game, the crowd favourite stepped into a different zone in the next two games, especially after winning the 39-stroke rally point at the start of second game.

The mixed doubles pair of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won helped Raptors have the last laugh.

Best foot forward

Then, in the men’s doubles, Warriors’ pair of Bodin Isara and Lee Yong Dae, playing the Trump match, had to put the best foot forward to ward off a spirited challenge from Arun George and Rian Agung Saputro to keep their team in the hunt.

In the decider, Saputro, who was brilliant right through, faltered at 13-all with a service error and then messed up a simple net point to hand over the match and a 2-1 lead to the opponent.

For Raptors, Tai Tzu Ying remained unbeaten in this edition with another dominant display to outsmart World No. 10 Michelle Li to take the team to two-all.

The results:

Bengaluru Raptors bt North-Eastern Warriors 4-2 (B. Sai Praneeth bt Lee Cheuk Yiu 14-15, 15-9, 15-3; Arun George & Rian Agung Saputro lost to Bodin Isara & Lee Yong Dae (T) 11-15, 15-13, 14-15; Tai Tzu Ying bt Michelle Li 15-9, 15-12; Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won (T) bt G.

12,2020/02/10,Blaupunkt BTW Pro true wireless earbuds : more cons than pros,"Blaupunkt has long been known for their high-quality yet affordable car audio systems. In the early 2000s, no one did audio systems like the German name. Last year, however, when they entered the Indian market, with consumer accessories such as earbuds and televisions, many were excited.

Now, Blaupunkt is out with their latest true wireless earbuds, the BTW Pro’s.

Vanity in design is something brands need to stay attuned to, and, sadly, the BTW Pro’s do not meet the benchmark here. What the company tried for in angular design, they lacked in general appeal with this device. Similar to the BTW01, the main build material is ABS which keeps the gadget light and heat-resistant, but the matte finish is not as appealing as the glossy one of the previously-tested Blaupunkt BTW01’s.

One of the pet peeves I faced with the BTW01 is that to shut the case, it requires a bit of pressure. The higher-end Pro only requires a flick of the wrist to shut the case, thanks to the magnetic feature.

Power up

Like most budget-friendly earbuds, the BTW Pro requires wired charging via a Micro-USB cable. Charging is fairly quick and the fortnight-long battery life is probably one of my favourite pull-factors with the brand name. I use these earbuds for about five hours everyday — music, workout, calls, streaming, transcribing — so that is fairly impressive. Each earbud, however, has only 70mAh, while the BTW01 had 75mAh each. The BTW Pro’s charging case has more juice with 740mAh.

That said, the fact that I used the earbuds this much says a lot, and, the BTW Pro does give good game. Initial pairing takes a bit of trial and error, and only a couple of times did I randomly experience ‘out of range’ unpairing when it was not warranted. Also, do these not mimic the Airpods, but with a more angular look?

But let us talk audio quality: the Qualcomm aptX HD Sound offers up users detailed nuances to even the tiniest sound in whatever they are listening to. The noise cancellation is effective but not dizzying.

Voice assistant and calls are pretty easy on these, thanks to the two-mic system, but these features are more preferable to the long-haul users, who might not even remove these through the day.

Ultimately, these earbuds have more cons than pros. While they pack a punch in the audio department, there is a lot to be said for the technical and design flaws, making them not worth the price tag.

Word to Blaupunkt: if you had started 2020 with a set of true wireless earbuds with a wireless-charging capacity and a savvier look, you would have been set.

The Blaupunkt BTW Pro True Wireless earbuds are available to purchase from major online retailers at ₹6,999.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/baj0nb/article30783161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11mp-blaupunkt-set,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-blaupunkt-btw-true-wireless-earbuds-pro-more-cons-than-pros/article30783162.ece
13,2020/02/10,Samsung unveils new foldable phone in surprise ad during the Oscars,"Samsung Electronics, the world’s top smartphone maker, gave a glimpse of new square-shaped foldable phones in a surprise TV commercial aired during the Academy Awards on Sunday.

The ad, broadcast only in the United States, comes two days before its Galaxy Z Flip phones, which open and close vertically like a flip phone, are due to be unveiled at an event in San Francisco.

While there were many shots of the phones, which come in at least purple and black, there were few other details.

They are, however, expected to be less expensive than the $1,980 Galaxy Fold, which opens like a book and was launched in September, delayed by several months after problems with its screens.

“The new Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone will create a halo effect for Samsung’s brand and help it better compete with Apple’s pricey models,” said Tom Kang, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint, adding that Samsung had taken the lead in foldable phones at a time when Chinese rivals looked set to leap into the nascent market.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/soikbl/article30782220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETSAMSUNG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/samsung-unveils-new-foldable-phone-in-surprise-ad-during-the-oscars/article30782221.ece
14,2020/02/10,"OnePlus 8 series design, 120Hz display confirmed in new leak","With the forthcoming OnePlus 8 series launch around the corner, a new leak of the devices has surfaced that confirms the design language of the handsets and a 120Hz refresh rate display.

A fresh new leak claims to have a render of the upcoming OnePlus 8 Pro, alongside a few specs points. Some of these pretty obvious and easy to deduce, while others are rather interesting, GSMArena reported on Saturday.

Putting together all the rumours and speculations, the likely specs sheet could include an obvious Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip and Android 10 bits.

“The memory options are neither here nor there, honestly. 128GB or 256GB with 8GB of RAM is a perfectly valid guess. Perhaps 12GB is a possibility as well. OnePlus could even jump on the increasingly popular train of showing-off with a 16GB tier,” the report added.

Meanwhile, the Chinese smartphone maker has filed a patent for a technology that hides the front camera when not in use, a report said earlier this week.

The patent seems to be similar to the implementation of the recently unveiled ‘Concept One’ smartphone by OnePlus that was showcased by the company at CES 2020 last month.

As per report, the photograph of the device included in the patent application shows that there are no punch-holes of pop-up camera mechanism for the front camera and the entire surface is covered by the screen.

The back of the phone looked similar to the OnePlus 7T.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/bg8rjg/article30780752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETONEPLUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/oneplus-8-series-design-120hz-display-confirmed-in-new-leak/article30780753.ece

17,2020/02/10,Democratic rivals rip into each other,"Rifts between Democrat candidates were on full display over the weekend as the presidential hopefuls criticised each other during a weekend of campaigning in freezing temperatures across New Hampshire, before the State’s primary elections on Tuesday.

Candidates campaigned against the backdrop of confusion over and a delay in results from the crucial Iowa Caucuses held last week — in which centrist Pete Buttigieg has claimed most delegates and progressive candidate, independent Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders’s campaign has said it will ask for some of the votes to be recanvassed (votes re-checked against paper ballots).

Several news outlets, including the Associated Press, which has traditionally had a prominent role in calling U.S. races, refrained from doing so.

Weekend polls showed that Mr. Sanders continued to hold on to his significant lead going into the state’s primaries. A Boston Globe/Suffolk poll put Mr. Sanders at 27%, followed by centrists Mr. Buttigieg at 19%. Senator from Minnesota, centrist Amy Klobuchar, was third at 14%. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also running on a progressive platform like Mr. Sanders, came in at 12%, tied with former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden.

Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg took aim at each other’s campaign financing.

“Our views are different,” Mr. Sanders said over the weekend. “Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires.”

Mr. Buttigieg — like his competitor for the centrist vote, Mr. Biden — criticised Mr. Sanders for his Medicare-for-all policy without details about how it would be funded. He also suggested Mr. Sanders was not the one to unite a highly polarised country.

“I respect Senator Sanders, but when I hear this message go out that you’re either for revolution or you’ve got to be for the status quo, that’s a vision of the country that doesn’t have room for most of us,” Mr. Buttigieg said on Sunday, as per the Washington Post.

Mr. Biden is still leading in national polls. The Economist/YouGov poll of February 2-4, where he was at 24% followed by Mr. Sanders at 19% and then Ms. Warren at 18%. Mr. Biden is also expected to win in South Carolina on February 29, where the African American vote is strongly represented.

Further complicating the Democrat field are two billionaire candidates. The first is hedge fund manager Tom Steyer who has been doing well in South Carolina polls. The other is businessman and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has far outspent his rivals, is joining the race on Super Tuesday (March 3), when a large number of states hold their primaries.

President Donald Trump has tried to capitalise on the confusion over the Iowa results.

“Will be in Manchester, New Hampshire, tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results, votes were fried,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday morning.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a3mqw8/article30785614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-SRIRAM-SANDERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/democratic-rivals-rip-into-each-other/article30785615.ece
18,2020/02/10,Israel tortured detained Palestinians: rights groups,"One of the men was hospitalised with kidney failure and 11 broken ribs. Another was nearly unrecognisable to his wife when he was wheeled into a courtroom. A third was stitched up after being attacked by a security dog.

Then the three Palestinians were returned to their Israeli interrogators. They had been swept up in a sprawling manhunt launched after a roadside bomb killed a 17-year-old Israeli girl and wounded her father and brother as they hiked down to a spring last August in the occupied West Bank. The attack raised fears of a sophisticated militant cell that might strike again, and Israeli interrogators appear to have treated it as a ticking time-bomb scenario. Israeli and Palestinian rights groups say there is strong evidence that Israeli interrogators tortured several detainees in violation of Israeli and international law.

The allegations against Israel are the most serious to come to light in years, and the rights groups say they point to a loosening of constraints two decades after Israeli Supreme Court outlawed most forms of torture.

Lawyers and family members of the three main suspects say they were tortured to the point of being hospitalized. Several other Palestinians swept up by Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency say they were threatened, beaten, forced into painful stress positions and denied sleep.

A landmark 1999 Israeli Supreme Court ruling forbids such torture. But the law allows interrogators to defend the use of force when there is fear of an imminent attack.

Rights groups say interrogators routinely make use of the loophole, knowing they will face few consequences, if any.

The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel says more than 1,200 complaints against the Shin Bet have been filed since 2001, without a single case going to trial. Only one criminal investigation has been launched, over a 2017 case involving alleged rape, and it is still open.

The allegations come at a sensitive time following the release of President Donald Trump’s Mideast initiative, which heavily favors Israel and would allow it to annex large parts of the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, and sporadic clashes have erupted across the West Bank in recent days.

The Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which has also been accused of torturing prisoners, has responded to the plan by threatening to end its longtime security coordination with Israel, which many Palestinians view as an extension of the occupation. The latest torture allegations could add to the mounting pressure on President Mahmoud Abbas to follow through on those threats.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/95yaff/article30785506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-PALESTINE-PROTESTINGAZA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-tortured-detained-palestinians-rights-groups/article30785507.ece

Last week, German health minister Jens Spahn suggested at a meeting with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn that Europe impose restrictions on travellers from China.

The United States has already banned the arrival of foreign nationals who have visited China recently.

But for any such measure to be imposed in Europe the 27 EU members would have to coordinate the decision, since most of them are in the Schengen passport-free travel area.

21,2020/02/10,5 Turkish soldiers dead in Syria fire,"Five Turkish soldiers were killed on Monday by Syrian regime artillery fire in the northwestern province of Idlib, Turkey’s Defence Ministry said.

Another five soldiers were wounded in the “intense assault that targeted our elements sent as reinforcement to the region with an aim to prevent clashes in Idlib, ensure our border security and stop migration and human tragedy,” said the Ministry.

The Syrian regime artillery fire retaliated, it added, “destroying targets.”

“The developments are closely watched and the necessary measures are being taken,” it added.

The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish soldiers were killed and injured by regime forces shelling Taftanaz airport, north of Saraqeb town.

But the war monitor did not give a toll.

This is the second such incident in a week after eight Turkish military personnel were killed in regime shelling in Idlib last Monday.

The latest attack is likely to further raise tensions between Ankara and Damascus.

Fahrettin Altun, top press aide to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Twitter that “Turkey retaliated against the attack to destroy all enemy targets and avenging our fallen troops.”

He added: “The war criminal, who ordered today's heinous attack, targeted the entire international community, not just Turkey.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Defence Minister Hulusi Akar immediately came together for talks following the attack, NTV reported.

It comes as a Russian delegation is in Ankara since Saturday for talks on Idlib, another round of which was expected Monday.

Turkey and Russia have worked closely despite being on opposing sides of the war, and the two agreed previously on a deal to avert an offensive by Syrian government forces.

Under that deal, Turkey set up 12 observation posts in Idlib.

Turkey has beefed up those positions in recent days by sending at least 350 vehicles with commandos backed by armoured vehicles.

But the regime supported by Moscow has intensified an assault against the last major rebel bastion, home to an estimated three million, for more than two months.

The situation in Idlib is particularly worrying for Turkey considering its close proximity to the Turkish border.

The United Nations said Monday close to 700,000 people in northwest Syria have been displaced since December. Many of those have been forced to flee towards Turkey, which is already home to over 3.5 million Syrian refugees.

Ankara fears a renewed surge of violence could cause a new flow to Turkey, which could be politically damaging to Erdogan at a time when Turks are facing economic hardship.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5-turkish-soldiers-dead-in-syria-fire/article30785364.ece
22,2020/02/10,World will take Pakistan seriously once it is economically stable: Shah Mahmood Qureshi,"Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday said the world will take his country seriously once it is economically stable.

He made this comment while lamenting that the world was not taking the Kashmir issue seriously though Pakistan was raking it up at international meetings.

“The world will take Pakistan seriously when we are financially stable,” the Minister said.

The Pakistan Foreign Minister conceded that many countries were reluctant to speak on the Kashmir issue and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) because of their economic interests as India was a big trade market for them.

“The thing is that while everyone speaks of ethics and doing the right thing, their actions are always in line with safeguarding their own economic interests,” he said.

Mr. Qureshi said his Ministry would facilitate other Ministries to establish stronger commercial ties with other nations, which would help introduce better trade practices in the country, Dawn News reported.

Mr. Qureshi said “de-industrialisation” in Pakistan in recent years had led to closing down of many factories.

“The question is about when this process [de-industrialisation] started. If industries are shutting down now, something must have happened in the past few years to have triggered the process,” the Minister was quoted as saying by the Dawn News.

He said placing blame or playing politics on the economy would serve no purpose but a solution must be found.

The cash-strapped Pakistan government has been implementing austerity measures to improve the country’s finances. In July last year, Pakistan registered a currency reserve of less than USD 8 billion – enough to cover only 1.7 months of imports.

The International Monetary Fund formally approved a USD 6-billion loan to Pakistan in July 2019, citing “significant” economic challenges. Pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid from friendly countries such as China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE during the current fiscal year.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e2n6gn/article30647176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHMAHMOODQURESHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-will-take-pakistan-seriously-once-it-is-economically-stable-shah-mahmood-qureshi/article30784260.ece
23,2020/02/10,Weinstein to call more defense witnesses as his rape trial nears end,"Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein is expected to call several more defense witnesses on Monday in his New York rape trial, now nearing its conclusion well ahead of schedule.

Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann and to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi. Since 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.

The former producer has denied any non-consensual sex.

Also Read Taking on Harvey Weinstein and a colluding system

His trial is a key moment in the #MeToo movement in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct. The trial began Jan. 6 and was originally predicted to last up to two months, but it now appears that lawyers could deliver their closing arguments as soon as this week.

Weinstein faces life in prison if convicted of predatory sexual assault, the most serious charge against him.

Prosecutors rested their case last Thursday after jurors heard testimony from six women accusing Weinstein of sexual assault, including Mann, Haleyi and Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in her home in the early 1990s.

Weinstein’s defense team began their case by calling Paul Feldsher, who was a close friend of Sciorra around that time.

Feldsher testified that Sciorra told him she had done a “crazy thing with Harvey,” which he understood to mean a sexual encounter, and gave no indication that it was non-consensual.

Feldsher appeared surprised during cross-examination when a prosecutor presented him with texts he had sent Weinstein since October 2017, in which he promised the former producer his loyalty and harshly disparaged Sciorra and other accusers, calling them a “dog pile of actresses.”

The defense case continued Friday with testimony from Elizabeth Loftus, a professor at the University of California, Irvine and well-known expert on memory who testified that memories could be distorted over time.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v2utx4/article30783237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/weinstein-to-call-more-defense-witnesses-as-his-rape-trial-nears-end/article30783238.ece
24,2020/02/10,135 cases of coronavirus on board cruise ship docked in Yokohama,"Passenger tests aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan confirmed at least 65 more cases of coronavirus on Monday, according to the vessel’s captain, as some passengers took to social media to warn against depression over their confinement.

The figure, announced to passengers after a statement by the cruise operator put the new infections at 66, takes the tally on board to 135, showing a rapid rise in the outbreak on the ship docked in the port of Yokohama.

Among the new cases are 45 Japanese and 11 Americans, the ship’s operator, Princess Cruises, said in the earlier statement.

“This is not news that anyone of us wanted to receive,” the captain told passengers in a broadcast over speakers in their cabins.

Also Read Sixty more people confirmed with coronavirus on cruise ship in Japan: media

“However, we have been also advised since we are in the early quarantine period of 14 days, it was not unexpected.”

The captain’s remarks formed part of an audio recording about the 66 new cases posted on Twitter by Yardley Wong, a passenger documenting the experience on the ship, using the hashtag #anxiety.

In a subsequent announcement, however, the captain told passengers he had been advised to correct the figure of new infections to 65 from 66, according to audio recordings posted by passengers.

Japan’s health ministry confirmed the 65 cases in a statement. Reuters could not immediately contact the cruise operator to seek comment on the change.

The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.

About 3,700 people are aboard the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. Passengers have been allowed on decks in shifts to get fresh air and encouraged to regularly take their temperature.

“Lots of the passengers now are getting a bit of cabin fever,” British passenger David Able said in a video posted on Facebook. “Depression is starting to set in.”

Another said he hoped assurances about the effectiveness of quarantine and ventilation on board would prove true.

“I will get nervous if we pass 200,” said the 43-year-old Hong Kong resident quarantined on the boat with his wife, child and several of his family.

“Hoping best for those taken to hospital. At least two report back to us on Facebook that they are symptom free,” added the man, who declined to be identified.

People who have been in close contact with newly confirmed cases on the ship face a longer quarantine than the originally planned period until Feb. 19, the World Health Organization said late on Sunday, without saying how many there were.

Japan’s health ministry is recording infection counts on the ship and evacuee flights from China separately from the official tally. Domestic cases stand at 21.

Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Japan would send a fifth chartered flight to China’s central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, to bring citizens home.

The disease has killed 908 people, chiefly in mainland China, and infected more than 40,000.

25,2020/02/10,Indian-origin Irish PM Leo Varadkar suffers bruising polls,"Ireland’s Indian-origin Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suffered a bruising general election as his liberal-conservative Fine Gael party took a battering in the face of an unprecedented surge in the fortunes of the nationalist party Sinn Fein.

As the poll results poured in overnight on Sunday, Varadkar’s party was pushed down to third place with Sinn Fein in the lead, followed by conservative Fianna Fail in second place.

In what has been described as one of the most extraordinary election results for the country, the process of government formation is likely to be very long-drawn one with Varadkar having ruled out an alliance with Sinn Fein — historically associated with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.

The final results of the weekend’s election are still being counted but with all first preferences counted, Sinn Fein has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna Fail and 20.9% for Fine Gael.

“Nobody can be forced into some sort of forced marriage or forced coalition,” said Varadkar, who took over as the Irish Taoiseach or Prime Minister in 2017.

“In order to form a government together, you have to have roughly the same views around the courts and the criminal justice system; around how the economy and society should be run and also how democracy should function. That is what makes my party Fine Gael not compatible with Sinn Fein,” he said.

Varadkar, whose father was born in Mumbai, has indicated a coalition with Fianna Fail could be possible, saying, “we are willing to talk to other parties about the possibility of forming a new government, one that would lead the country forward for the next five years“.

Michael Martin, the leader of Fianna Fail, has meanwhile left the door more widely open, saying he is a “democrat” and would “listen to the people.”

Sinn Fein’s win of over 24% of the popular vote in the voting that took place on Saturday puts Anglo-Irish relations also on the line, with the party a vocal critic of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.

Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald has hailed her party’s successes across the country and is reaching out to other left-wing parties to arrange talks on government formation.

Candidates in Ireland are elected by single transferable vote (STV), with each constituency returning between three and five deputies, each called a Teachta Dala or TD.

It is clear that no one party will win enough seats for an outright majority, leaving Varadkar’s future as the Irish Taoiseach in doubt.

A former general practitioner, Varadkar became the country’s youngest and first openly gay Prime Minister over two years ago. He has kept his Indian connect alive over the years, completing an internship at the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1kjue8/article30783029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEOVARADKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-origin-irish-pm-leo-varadkar-suffers-bruising-polls/article30783030.ece
26,2020/02/10,Merkel party’s crisis deepens as designated successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer quits,"Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right party plunged deeper into crisis on Monday following a debacle in a regional election, as the long-time German leader’s successor unexpectedly announced that she wouldn’t stand for the chancellorship.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer informed leading members of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union that she will begin the process of organising a leadership contest in the summer. Germany is scheduled to hold its next general election in the fall of 2021 and the 65-year-old Merkel, who has led Germany for 15 years, said two years ago that she won’t run for a fifth term as chancellor.

The move throws German politics into further turmoil, days after Merkel’s party was heavily criticised for its handling of a vote for governor in the state of Thuringia that saw both the Christian Democrats and the far-right Alternative for Germany party back a centrist candidate. The vote broke what is widely regarded as a taboo around German political parties cooperating with extremist parties.

Kramp-Karrenbauer, often referred to by the acronym AKK, took over the leadership of the Christian Democrats in December 2018 after beating out Health Minister Jens Spahn and Friedrich Merz, a former party veteran sidelined by Merkel before she became chancellor in 2005.

Yet Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, who is also Germany’s Defence Minister, has struggled to boost the party’s declining election results amid a stiff challenge from the far-right.

The fiasco in Thuringia State further highlighted tensions in the center-right Christian Democrats after the party’s regional lawmakers ignored a recommendation from Berlin not to back a centrist candidate against the left-wing incumbent.

It was unclear how the latest development would affect Merkel’s earlier plans for her succession. Among the names currently being bandied around as possible party leaders are Spahn, Merz and Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state.

Spahn and Laschet are considered centrists in the Merkel tradition, whereas Merz has tried to appeal to the conservative wing of the party that has flirted with the far-right Alternative for Germany.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tx7kti/article30782702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MERKELANNEGRET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/merkel-partys-crisis-deepens-as-designated-successor-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-quits/article30782703.ece
27,2020/02/10,British Airways flight sets new speed record by crossing Atlantic in less than 5 hours,"For the first time in years, a commercial passenger plane has flown across the Atlantic in less than five hours.

A British Airways flight landed early Sunday morning at Heathrow Airport in London after leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York just 4 hours and 56 minutes earlier.

That set a new speed record for subsonic — or slower than the speed of sound — commercial aircraft to fly between the two cities, according to Flightradar24, which tracks global flights.

The previous record was held by a Norwegian Air flight, which flew between the two cities with a flight time of 5 hours and 13 minutes.

The flight had been expected to take 102 minutes longer. The recent average flight time between New York and London is 6 hours and 13 minutes, according to Flightradar24.

The wind and air currents were ideal for a fast flight, said Ian Petchenik, Flightradar24’s director of communications. “In the winter, the jet stream dips down a bit,” he said. “It’s kind of in a perfect spot for flights across the North Atlantic to take advantage of it.”

British Airways just narrowly beat out a Virgin Atlantic flight, which arrived in London at around the same time but one minute slower.

British Airways confirmed the flight time for the Boeing 747 plane, saying the company prioritises safety over speed.

28,2020/02/10,Doctored video of Pelosi brings renewed attention to ‘cheapfakes’,"The issue of misleading political messages on social media arose again last week, when U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted out an edited video showing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi repeatedly tearing up his State of the Union speech as he honoured audience members and showed a military family reuniting.

Pelosi did tear the pages of her copy of the speech — but only after it was finished, and not throughout the address as the video depicts.

Pelosi’s office asked Twitter and Facebook to take down the video, which both sites have declined to do.

Also Read The rise of ‘deep-fakes’ and threats to truth

Researchers worry the video’s “selective editing” could mislead people if social media companies don’t step in and properly label or regulate similar videos. And with the proliferation of smartphones equipped with esasy editing tools, the altered videos are simple to make and could multiply as the election approaches.

Doctored content not new in political campaigns

Political campaign ads and candidate messages showing opponents in a negative light have long been a staple of American politics. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams attacked each other in newspaper ads. John F. Kennedy’s campaign debuted an ad showing different videos edited together of Richard Nixon sweating and looking weak.

So, to some extent, the video of Pelosi, which appears to be created by a group affiliated with conservative organisation Turning Point USA, is not novel. What’s different now, said Clifford Lampe, a professor of information at the University of Michigan, is how widely such content can spread in a matter of minutes.

“The difference now is that the campaigns themselves, the president of U.S. himself, is able to disseminate these pieces of media to the public,” he said. “They no longer have to collaborate with media outlets.”

The Pelosi team has pushed back against doctored online content in the past. A video released last year was slowed down to make it seem the speaker was slurring her words.

What policies from social media companies govern these videos?

Facebook, Google and Twitter have all been emphasising their efforts to cut down on disinformation on their sites leading up to the election, hoping to avoid some of the backlash generated by rampant misinformation on social media during the 2016 election.

But the video of Pelosi does not violate existing policies, both Twitter and Facebook said. Facebook has rules that prohibit so-called “deepfake” videos, which the company says are both misleading and use artificial intelligence technology to make it seem like someone authentically “said words that they did not actually say.”

Researchers say the Pelosi video is an example of a “cheapfake” video, one that has been altered but not with sophisticated AI like in a deepfake. Cheapfakes are much easier to create and are more prevalent than deepfakes, which have yet to really take off, said Samuel Woolley, director of propoganda research at the Center for Media Engagement at University of Texas.

That editing is “deliberately designed to mislead and lie to the American people,” Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill tweeted on Friday. He condemned Facebook and Twitter for allowing the video to stay up on the social media sites.

Facebook spokesman Andy Stone replied to Hammill on Twitter saying, “Sorry, are you suggesting the President didn’t make those remarks and the Speaker didn’t rip the speech?” In an interview Sunday, Stone confirmed that the video didn’t violate the company’s policy. In order to be taken down, the video would have had to use more advanced technology and possibly try to show Pelosi saying words she didn’t say.

Twitter did not remove the video either, and pointed toward a blog post from early February that says the company plans to start labelling tweets that contain “synthetic and manipulated media.” Labelling will begin on March 5.

What does the law say?

Not much. Social media companies are broadly able to police the content on their own sites as they choose. A law, section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, shields tech platforms from most lawsuits based on the content posted on their sites, leaving responsibility largely in the companies’ own hands.

Most platforms now ban overtly violent videos and videos that could cause real-world harm, though of course much of that is up to internal company interpretation. Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube have received a significant amount of criticism in recent years about live-streamed and offensive videos that have appeared on the sites. The companies sometimes bend to public pressure and remove videos, but often point to people’s rights to freedom of expression in leaving videos up.

What happens next?

Misinformation on social media, especially surrounding elections, is a varied and ever-changing conversation. Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University, called for legislation to better regulate social media in cases of political propaganda. It gets tricky though, she admits, because the “very people who will be regulating them are the same ones using them to get elected.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z1h0vw/article30782225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCIALMEDIA-PELOSIVIDEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/doctored-video-of-pelosi-brings-renewed-attention-to-cheapfakes/article30782226.ece
29,2020/02/10,Deposed Pakistani cleric agrees to vacate mosque after striking deal with government,"Deposed cleric of Pakistan’s Lal Masjid Maulana Abdul Aziz, who occupied the state-owned mosque here and asserted his claim to be its prayer leader, has agreed to vacate it by Tuesday after striking a deal with the government.

Aziz was removed from the post on the orders of the court in 2004 following a fatwa he issued against the army and the operation against terrorists in Waziristan.

However, he was reinstated after his release from prison in 2009, but he stirred another controversy in 2014 after he openly extended support to the perpetrators of the Army Public School attack in Peshawar by calling it a reactionary move by the terrorists.

Lal Masjid is a state-owned mosque in Islamabad and Maulana Abdullah, father of Aziz, was its first cleric. After his assassination in the 1990s, Aziz was appointed the cleric by the Islamabad Capital Territory’s (ICT) Auqaf Department.

He returned to the mosque about two weeks ago and occupied the pulpit, delivering a fiery sermon against the government on Friday and demanding implementation of the Sharia law in the country.

According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, the cleric on Sunday struck a deal with the government to vacate the compound by Tuesday in lieu of a 20 kanal (2.5 acres) piece of land in the capital to set up a Jamia Hafsa, a women seminary.

He also agreed that his female students would vacate a building of a seminary in H-11 area of Islamabad which they forcibly occupied apparently on his behest after he took over the mosque.

Several rounds of talks were held since he took over the mosque, including one facilitated by the banned anti-Shia extremist group Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), but remained inconclusive.

The cleric was demanding a hefty amount of Rs 250 million along with a large piece of land to establish Jamia Hafsa and the possession of the adjacent old children’s library plot, the report said.

However, he agreed to have the land in Islamabad which could be worth millions of rupees depending on its exact location.

Almost all the land of Jamia Hafsa where he resides has been built on encroached land after covering a natural water course.

Aziz was caught during a 2007 operation when he was trying to escape clad in a woman’s full veil (burqa). The operation was launched by former president Pervez Musharraf in which Aziz’s younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rasheed, was killed.

Several cases were also launched against him but he was not convicted and allowed to walk free from imprisonment after some time. He has been living in Islamabad since then.

In 2014, he named a library in a female seminary after Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden - Maktbah Usama bin Laden Shaheed- to the anguish of the Pakistan government.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article17642934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/deposed-pakistani-cleric-agrees-to-vacate-mosque-after-striking-deal-with-government/article30781908.ece

Forty-six members of the ruling Communist Party of Nepal filed the proposal in Parliament to legalize the production and use of marijuana, party lawmaker Birod Khatiwada said on Monday.

Nepal was famed for use of marijuana and other narcotics in the 1960s when hippies made their way to Nepal. Shops and tea houses used advertise and sell it legally.

Nepal made it illegal in 1976 with the Narcotic Drugs Control Act. Users are jailed for a month while traffickers are sent to prison for up to 10 years.

Pakistan came under criticism after it said that Pakistani students should not be evacuated from Wuhan as medical facilities back home do not meet the standards required to treat a patient diagnosed with coronavirus.

The Pakistani nationals stuck in areas affected by the novel virus have been making requests to the government on social media platforms to evacuate them.

The matter is being considered at the high level and best possible decision would be taken after considering all possible aspects. Rest assured that we care about you, said Zafar Mirza, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health, on Sunday.

Mr. Mirza said that the government has been keenly observing the situation in China, the Dawn newspaper reported.

He said that all options were being explored and the government wanted to maintain a balance on the issue.

We have to consider all aspects including situation of the Pakistanis (in China), Chinese regulations and advisories of the World Health Organisation (WHO). All the stakeholders are involved over the issue and we have kept all options open, he said.

Addressing students in China in a tweet, Mr. Mirza said, My very dear students in China and your respectable family members, we are intensely discussing the situation at highest level and will make the best decision in view of all factors with reference to devastating coronavirus potential global pandemic.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Naghmana Hashmi said that they could not reach the stranded Pakistani students in Wuhan due to the complete lockdown of the city, the capital of Hubei province.

Pakistani officials are in contact with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing and Wuhan and will promptly reply to any query by a Pakistani citizen in China, she was quoted as saying by Geo News.

However, Pakistani nationals vent out their anger on social media after Mr. Mirza’s tweet, the Dawn report said.

Dear sir, if you care about us then please spend at least one day with us in Wuhan, China at least one day please after this we will never say to evacuate us. Please consider my suggestion thanks, a Pakistani national living in Wuhan tweeted.

Another Pakistani student tweeted, it is a humble request not to tweet if you won’t change things.

The death toll in China due to the novel coronavirus increased to 908 and the number of confirmed cases surged over 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday.

Five persons with symptoms of coronavirus were reported from Pakistan on Sunday after they arrived from a flight from China.

There were up to 800 Pakistanis studying in various universities in Wuhan - a city of 11 million people which has been quarantined by the Chinese authorities in an effort to stem the spread of the deadly virus.

Earlier, Foreign Office said that there were 28,000 Pakistani students currently in China apart from hundreds of businessmen.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/o9aybo/article30670855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-to-take-a-decision-soon-on-its-nationals-evacuation-from-coronavirus-hit-china-official/article30780717.ece
34,2020/02/10,Momentum of India-U.S. trade moving in favour of America: Mukesh Aghi,"The momentum of the bilateral trade between India and the US is moving in favour of Washington, mainly due to the sudden increase in energy import by New Delhi, the head of a top India-centric American trade and strategic advocacy group has said.

Noting that the India-U.S. trade has gone up from $142 billion in 2018 to $160 billion in 2019, President of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) Mukesh Aghi said that the energy import by India from the US had shot up dramatically.

“If you look at three years ago, it was almost zero. Now as of last year’s cross $6 billion, and we expect this to cost $10 billion this fiscal year. So, the momentum is moving in favour of U.S.,” Mr. Aghi told PTI.

He said the bilateral trade numbers were going up without the trade deal and when the big ticket items such as Boeing planes were not being delivered.

India’s private air carrier Spice Jet has placed an order for 200 planes to Boeing. As such, the trade numbers would go up significantly, once the delivery of the planes kicks in motion.

Mr. Aghi said that even after the US withdrew India’s GSP privileges, the export in that sector had not slowed down.

“In fact, that is up another five per cent,” he said.

The momentum on the bilateral trade continues even as a trade deal between the two countries is still being negotiated. There are a few issues that need to be sorted out, he said, hoping that there will be more mature response from both sides as time goes by.

“You will have differences. But at the same time, I think we’ll find a solution. I don’t think there are very many open issues. It’s just matters of trying to cross the T’s and make sure the dots are in the right places so you can move forward,” he said.

From the U.S. export environment, Mr. Aghi said the energy sector - ranging from gas, LNG, and even high-quality coal - was taking the lead in the India-U.S. bilateral trade.

“From the U.S. side, scientific products, energy, planes, and defence, will keep on fuelling the growth,” he said.

“From Indian side, you will definitely see low-end stuff like jewelry and leather and other garments coming into the US. But we also see services, especially the IT services. They will cut you to grow regardless of what H-1B, the demand for that, those services is at the moment fuelling quite a bit. And that’s fuelling is coming because of the growth of the economy also,” he said.

Mr. Aghi asserted that American companies continued to be bullish on India and will continue with their investment in the country.

They are showing a substantial growth on the current base itself and are also gaining the market share, he added.

However, Mr. Aghi said the American companies continue to be challenged by ease of doing business environment in India, in particular at the State level.

While there has been market improvement in the World Bank’s ranking in ease of doing business, which is basically based on parameters in major cities like Mumbai and New Delhi, companies continue to require a number of permits for opening their businesses in States, where the manufacturing is going to be set up.

“The other big issue is a transparent and predictable policy. That’s important to have. Because classic example is people are saying, we invested in Andhra Pradesh, a change of government, reversed everything. So today, a lot of companies which are invested are struggling with the change in policy.

If you have a contract, those contracts have to be honoured regardless of change of the government. To me, that’s very critical, if you’re going to bring that strong sentiment of confidence among US companies to come invest in India,” Mr. Aghi said.

The court system has to play a much more “efficient and effective role” and there has to be “maturity on part of politicians” that you attracted a strong investment and you can’t overturn because of political reasons, he said.

“Yes, if there’s some bribery or some other issues then we absolutely agree with that. But if a company has gone through a proper transparent process, then to reverse that sends a wrong message,” Mr. Aghi said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/njjixh/article28302267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INTERVIEWWITHMUKESHAGHI-USINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/momentum-of-india-us-trade-moving-in-favour-of-america-mukesh-aghi/article30780618.ece
35,2020/02/10,WHO warns overseas coronavirus spread may be ‘tip of the iceberg’,"The head of the World Health Organization said on Monday there have been “concerning instances” of coronavirus among people with no travel history to China, warning that it could be the “tip of the iceberg”, as he urged all countries to prepare for the possible arrival of the novel virus that has killed over 900 people.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the doctors, nurses and health workers for doing “their utmost” at personal risk to contain the epidemic, terming them “true heroes” of the outbreak that first surfaced in December in Wuhan city in China’s central Hubei province where millions of people are under lockdown in a bid to stop it from spreading.

“There’ve been some concerning instances of onward 2019nCoV spread from people with no travel history to China. The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” tweeted Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.

“In an evolving public health emergency, all countries must step up efforts to prepare for #2019nCoV’s possible arrival and do their utmost to contain it should it arrive. This means lab capacity for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and other tools in the public health arsenal,” he said.

The death toll in China from the novel coronavirus epidemic jumped to 908 and the number of confirmed cases has risen over 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday.

Ghebreyesus said the spread of coronavirus outside China appeared to be slowing, but could accelerate, warning that any breach in solidarity is a victory for the virus.

“Containment remains our objective, but all countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus’s possible arrival,” he said.

“In the spirit of financial solidarity, donors have been stepping up, but we have not reached our goal of US$675 million for @WHO and vulnerable countries,” Ghebreyesus said.

“Containment remains our objective, but all countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus’s possible arrival,” he said.

A total of 908 people have died of coronavirus and 40,171 confirmed cases of infection were reported in 31 provincial-level regions so far, China’s National Health Commission said on Monday.

By the end of Sunday, 36 confirmed cases, including one death, had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 18 in Taiwan. Overseas, over 300 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including three from Kerala.

Outside China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in almost 30 places with two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong.

Several countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.

China and countries around the world are scrambling to contain the spread of coronavirus which is wreaking havoc in China and abroad.

37,2020/02/10,Malaysia’s economy to grow 4.5% in 2020: Mahathir,"Malaysia's economy is expected to expand by 4.5% this year, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday, down from the government's initial estimate of 4.8%.

Mr. Mahathir cited “challenging times” for the revision to the government's forecast, which was announced when the 2020 budget was tabled in November. He did not elaborate.

“With good fiscal discipline, our budget deficit will narrow to 3.2% this year. We are committed to provide a stable business environment for investors. We will be business friendly,” he said in a speech at a business conference.

Malaysia's finance ministry has floated a stimulus package to cushion the potential hit to the economy from the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, which has so far killed over 900 people and infected more than 40,000 worldwide.

Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Friday that his ministry is currently seeking feedback from other ministries and will present the stimulus plan to cabinet once completed.

“It [the virus outbreak] will definitely have an effect, but we need to look at it over the entire year,” Mr. Lim said.

Malaysia has so far confirmed 18 cases of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Monday confirmed the latest case, a 31-year-old Malaysian male based in Macau, with a history of travelling to mainland China before returning to Malaysia on Feb 1.

38,2020/02/10,"Coronavirus | China virus deaths rise past 900, overtaking SARS toll","The death toll from the novel coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on February 10, overtaking global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, even as the World Health Organization said the outbreak appeared to be stabilising.

With 91 more people dying in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak, the toll is now higher than the 774 killed worldwide by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The number of confirmed infections in China has reached 40,171 nationwide with more than 3,000 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said on February 10.

The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen “some stabilising” in Hubei, but warned the figures could still “shoot up”.

The virus is believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei's capital Wuhan, where residents are struggling to get daily supplies.

The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis — especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus.

With much of the country still not back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, cities including financial hub Shanghai ordered residents to wear masks in public.

Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said the “stable period” of the outbreak “may reflect the impact of the control measures”.

A WHO “international expert mission” left late on February 9 for China, the agency's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. The mission is led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies.

While the death toll has climbed steadily, new cases have declined since the single-day peak of nearly 3,900 people nationwide on February 5.

Public anger

Millions of people are under lockdown in Hubei in a bid to stop the virus spreading.

“The local government asked people to stay at home as much as possible, but there are not enough goods in shops each time we get there, so we have to go out frequently,” a woman in Wuhan, surnamed Wei said.

China's central bank said from February 10 it would make 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) available in special loans to banks to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic.

China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, whereas the WHO has praised measures it has taken this time.

Also Read A time for solidarity, not stigma

But anger erupted after the death of a Wuhan doctor who police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December, 2019.

The 34-year-old doctor died early on February 7, after contracting the virus from a patient.

Chinese academics were among those angered by his death, with at least two open letters posted on social media demanding more freedoms.

“Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,” one letter demanded.

Percolating along

Beijing responded by sending its anti-graft body to launch an investigation, attempting to ease the anger.

But Ian Lipkin — a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak — said earlier intervention could have made a key difference.

“This virus was percolating along without anyone realising it was there,” he said.

If the quarantine measures have been effective, the epidemic should peak within the next fortnight, Lipkin added – but he warned there is also the risk of a “bump” in numbers when people return to work.

Wuhan has converted public buildings into makeshift medical centres, and built two new field hospitals.

But Wuhan resident Chen Yiping said her 61-year-old mother has severe symptoms and was still waiting for a hospital bed because “there are too many people in need of treatment”.

Seventy people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan's coast have tested positive, with all passengers told to stay inside their cabins to prevent further infection.

39,2020/02/10,"Storm Ciara: Hurricane-force winds pound UK and Europe, upend travel","Storm Ciara battered the U.K. and northern Europe with hurricane-force winds and heavy rains Sunday, halting flights and trains and producing heaving seas that closed down ports. Football games, farmers’ markets and cultural events were cancelled as authorities urged millions of people to stay indoors, away from falling tree branches.

The storm, named by the U.K.’s Met Office weather agency, brought gales across the country and delivered gusts of 97 miles per hour to the Isle of White and 93 mph (150 kph) to the village of Aberdaron in northern Wales. Propelled by the fierce winds, a British Airways plane was thought to have made the fastest New York-to-London flight by a conventional airliner.

The Boeing 747-436 completed the 3,500-mile transatlantic journey in 4 hours and 56 minutes, landing 102 minutes early and reaching a top speed of 825 mph (1,327 kph), according to flight tracking website Flightradar24. Two Virgin Airlines flights also roared across the Atlantic, with all three smashing the previous subsonic New York-to-London record of 5 hours and 13 minutes, Flightradar24 reported.

Storm surges ate away at beaches and pounded rock cliffs and cement docks. The Met Office issued more than 250 flood warnings, and public safety agencies urged people to avoid travel and the temptation to take selfies as floodwaters rose. Residents in the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland in northwest England battled to protect their homes amid severe flooding as the River Eden burst its banks.

At least 10 rail companies in Britain sent out “do not travel” warnings, while nearly 20 others told passengers to expect extensive delays. The strong winds damaged electrical wires and littered train tracks with broken tree limbs and other debris, including a family trampoline.

Flights cancelled

Dozens of flights were cancelled at London airports due to heavy wind. Heathrow Airport and several airlines consolidated flights Sunday to reduce the number of cancellations. British Airways offered to rebook customers for domestic and European flights out of Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports. Virgin Airlines cancelled some flights.

Lufthansa airlines said there would be numerous cancellations and delays beginning Sunday afternoon and running until at least Tuesday morning. The airline planned to keep operating long-haul flights at its main Frankfurt hub. Eurowings, a budget subsidiary of Lufthansa, cancelled most flights for the duration of the storm.

Brussels Airport also saw delays or cancellations.

Two huge ports on either side of the English Channel, Dover in England and Calais in France, shut down operations amid high waves. Dover was partially reopened after being closed for 10 hours. Ferries stopped running there and across the region, including in the turbulent Irish Sea and North Sea.

The Humber Bridge in northern England also shut down, a move its website said was only the second time the massive bridge had been entirely closed.

Breaking with her usual Sunday routine, Queen Elizabeth II did not attend church in Sandringham to keep her out of harm’s way during the storm.

The Met Office said most of the the U.K. likely had seen the worst of Ciara by 9 p.m., when the storm had moved on to northeastern Scotland. However, forecasters predicted more blustery weather Monday, including much colder temperatures and snow in some northern areas.

""While Storm Ciara is clearing away, that doesn’t mean we’re entering a quieter period of weather,” Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said. “Blizzards aren’t out of the question.”

In Ireland, an estimated 10,000 homes, farms and businesses had their power knocked out Sunday. National weather agency Met Eireann warned that a combination of high tides, high seas and stormy conditions had created a significant risk of coastal flooding, particularly in the west and northwest.

Fierce winds knocked out electricity in northern France as well. Paris authorities sent out a warning to residents and tourists alike to stay indoors for their own safety. Parks and cemeteries in the city of Lille and nearby towns shut down as strong winds cracked heavy branches. Open-air markets closed early.

Luxembourg and the German city of Cologne announced that all school children could stay home Monday to avoid travelling under dangerous conditions.

In Germany, where the storm was known as “Sabine,” national railway operator Deutsche Bahn canceled long-distance trains to destinations most at risk, including Emden and Norddeich in Germany’s northwestern corner, the northern city of Kiel and the North Sea island of Sylt.

“We have learned from previous storms that it’s better not to have trains travel into critical regions in the first place,” Deutsche Bahn spokesperson Achim Stauss said. “What we want to avoid is trains getting stuck between stations.”

Teams of railway employees fanned out with chainsaws to remove any fallen trees blocking the tracks.

In Denmark, meteorologists warned about possible hurricane-force winds coming late Sunday, and flights were cancelled out of Copenhagen. Danish authorities warned motorists not to cross large bridges, including the Great Belt Bridge that links eastern and western parts of Denmark.

The storm was also expected to smash into southern Norway’s coast and hit southern and western parts of Sweden.

Sports events called off

In the world of sports, dozens of football games, horse races, rugby matches and other events were called off, including the Premier League match between Manchester City and West Ham. A 10-K run in London that was expected to draw 25,000 participants was also cancelled.

The Dutch football association called off all matches Sunday in the top-flight league due to safety concerns, as did Belgium’s top two soccer leagues, the Jupiler Pro League and Proximus League. A German soccer league match between title challenger Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne was also put off.

Yet in the Netherlands, an intrepid band of cyclists made the most of the wild conditions to take part in the Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships.

Using only basic bikes without gears, lightweight frames or drop handlebars, contestants rode a timed 8.5-kilometer course along the coast of southern Zeeland province. Blasted by winds, blinded by blowing sand from nearby beaches, the cyclists struggled to stay upright.

""I survived, but it’s very tough,” said Hans Deting, 56, his right hand dripping with blood after being blown off his bike.

“This is a bucket list thing,” rider Edwin van Gaalen explained, as he leaned on his handlebars, gasping for breath after finishing.

Ultimately, the gale-force winds became too strong even for this macho event. Organizers brought the race to an early end after 250 of the 300 riders had finished.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vkrgch/article30780085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IAG-MOVESTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/storm-ciara-hurricane-force-winds-pound-uk-and-europe-upend-travel/article30780086.ece
40,2020/02/10,Taiwan scrambles jets as Chinese air force flies round island,"Taiwan's air force scrambled on Sunday to intercept Chinese jets that flew around the island claimed by Beijing as its own, in a move denounced by Taiwan's Defence Ministry as a threat to regional peace and stability.

China has been flying what it calls “island encirclement” drills on-off since 2016 when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen first took office.

Beijing believes Ms. Tsai, who won re-election last month, wishes to push the island's formal independence. She says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

In a statement, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said Chinese J-11 fighters and H-6 bombers flew into the Bashi Channel to the south of Taiwan, then out into the Pacific before heading back to base via the Miyako Strait, located between Japan's islands of Miyako and Okinawa, to the northeast of Taiwan.

“During this period, the national military appropriately used air reconnaissance aircraft and air defence forces in accordance with combat readiness regulations,” it said.

The ministry provided a picture of a Taiwan air force F-16 shadowing one of the Chinese H-6 bombers.

“The Chinese Communist's long-range far-out-at-sea missions have impacted regional security and stability and endanger the peace and welfare shared by all parties in the region,” the ministry said.

China's Eastern Theatre Command, in a statement late on Sunday carried by the official People's Liberation Army Daily, said the aircraft carried out “real combat-oriented training”.

“Taiwan and its island are sacred and inalienable parts of China. The Chinese military's combat ready patrol was a completely legitimate and necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and safeguarding national sovereignty.”

Relations between Taipei and Beijing have further plummeted in the past few weeks following the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China, with Taiwan accusing China of preventing the island from accessing full information from the World Health Organization (WHO) or attending its meetings.

Taiwan is not a WHO member due to China's objections, which says the island is merely a Chinese province whose interests in the health body are adequately represented by Beijing.

But in one small diplomatic breakthrough for Taiwan, the WHO said Taiwanese experts will participate this week in an on-line meeting of experts about the virus.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a Sunday statement this was a “good start” and that they would strive to take part in more WHO events.

42,2020/02/10,"U.S. President Donald Trump to propose cuts in foreign aid,social safety nets in budget: officials","U.S. President Donald Trump will propose on February 10 a 21% cut in foreign aid and slashing social safety net programmes in his $4.8 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2021, according to senior administration officials.

The budget will seek an increase in funds to counter developing economic threats from China and Russia, but will also raise funds by targeting $2 trillion in savings from mandatory spending programmes in the United States.

Mr. Trump, a Republican, sought in his budget proposal last year to slash foreign aid but faced steep resistance from Congress and did not prevail.

Mr. Trump's latest blueprint for administration spending proposals is unlikely to be passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, particularly in an election year.

The budget will raise military spending by 0.3% to $740.5 billion for the fiscal year 2021, starting Oct. 1 and propose higher outlays for defense and veterans, administration officials said.

The White House proposes to slash spending by $4.4 trillion over 10 years.

That includes $130 billion from changes to Medicare prescription-drug pricing, $292 billion from cuts in safety net programmes — such as work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps — and $70 billion from tightening eligibility rules for federal disability benefits.

Mr. Trump’s foreign aid proposal seeks $44.1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year compared with $55.7 billion enacted in fiscal year 2020, an administration official said.

Aid to Ukraine would remain at its 2020 levels under the new proposal, the official said. Mr. Trump was acquitted last week of impeachment charges that he withheld aid to Ukraine to spur Kiev to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Vice-President.

43,2020/02/10,Iranian 'Victory' satellite fails to reach orbit,"Iran unveiled a new short-range missile called Thunder on February 9 and launched a satellite named “Victory” which failed to reach orbit.

The developments took place at a time of high tension with the United States, which killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting an Iranian missile attack on a U.S. base in Iraq.

Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said the satellite launch had not gone as planned.

“I wanted to make you happy with good news but sometimes life does not go the way we want it to. The launch was not successful,” he tweeted.

A Defence Ministry official earlier told state television the “Zafar” (“Victory”) satellite had launched successfully but not reached orbit.

“We will make improvements for future launches,” he said.

U.S. officials say they fear long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads. Tehran says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.

State television said Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is in charge of the country's missile programme, had unveiled the new missile, called Raad-500, Farsi for Thunder.

Iran's clerical rulers have said Tehran's missile programme is solely defensive.

The first picture the satellite had been due to transmit to state media would have been of Soleimani, Mr. Azari-Jahromi told state TV.

He said it was launched from Iran's Imam Khomeini Space Center in Iran's Semnan province, a facility under the control of the country’s Defence Ministry.

Tehran launched the first Iranian-made satellite in 2009, another in 2011 and a third in 2012, but at least two satellite launches failed last year.

New missile

Iran usually displays its military and space achievements in February during the anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah.

State television said the Raad-500 missile was half the weight of a similar missile, the Fateh-110, but its range was about 200 km (120 miles) more and it could be powered by a new generation of engines designed to put satellites into orbit.

There was no immediate U.S. comment on the announcements.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted the satellite launch had failed and said Israel was continuing to curb Iranian military reach.

“They are also failing when it comes to the transfer of weapons to Syria and Lebanon because we are acting [against that] all the time, including during these very days,” he wrote in a tweet.

Washington reimposed sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.

Under that deal, Tehran curbed its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran.

But Mr. Trump said the agreement was flawed because it was not permanent, did not address Iran’s missile programme and did not involve what Washington considers Iran's meddling in regional countries.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3904ru/article30777949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IRANSATELLITE-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iranian-victory-satellite-fails-to-reach-orbit/article30777881.ece
44,2020/02/10,Facebook buys start-up that uses AI vision to find location,"Facebook has acquired Scape Technologies — a London-based computer vision start-up working on location accuracy beyond the capabilities of GPS.

Full terms of the deal remain as yet unknown, although a Companies House update reveals that Facebook Inc now has majority control of the company (more than 75%).

“However, by looking at other filings, including a recent share issue, I understand the price could be about $40 million,” TechCrunch reported on Saturday.

The start-up’s cloud-based ‘Visual Positioning Service’ translates images into 3D maps that deliver a precise outdoor location across entire cities.

It is pertinent to note that it’s not yet clear what Facebook intends to do with Scape. But, the augmented reality (AR) glasses may be the best fit.

45,2020/02/10,Oscars 2020: South Korea’s ‘Parasite’ makes Oscar history with Best Picture,"Just days before the Oscars, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho had referred to the Oscars as “very local” awards. It seems to have done the trick. Or, perhaps, it was Mr. Bong’s other famous quote — “once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films” — that made the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences look beyond the home turf, and English language, to write history. Mr. Bong’s searing look at class divides — Parasite — became the first non-English feature film to win the Best Film Oscar at the 92nd Academy awards. Ten foreign language films are said to have been nominated previously for Best Picture but none of them could make it to the final post. These include Ingmar Bergman’s Cries and Whispers in 1973 and Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in 2000.

Not just that, Parasite is also a rare film to have won both the international film and the best film awards. Last year, Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma took the best international film and best director award but was overtaken by Green Book in the best film category. In 2013 Michael Haneke’s Amour took the foreign language Oscar but not for the best film. In 1999 Roberto Benigni’s Life Is Beautiful got best foreign film and best actor awards but the best film eluded it.

The firsts for Parasite didn’t stop at that. It is the first South Korean film to get nominated and to have won the International Film Oscar. Lee Chang-dong’s Burning couldn’t make it to the list of final nominees last year. Parasite is also the first Asian film to have grabbed the Best Screenplay award, shared by Mr. Bong with Han Jin-won.

Nazi satire

Giving Mr. Bong company in making history was the New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi, who became the first Maori to enter the privileged Oscar club with adapted screenplay award for his Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit. He dedicated the award to the indigenous kids all over the world.

Mr. Bong grew up in the 90s when there was crazy passion for cinema in Korea. “We would give everything up for cinema. 90s was the most cinephile decade in Korean history, the time when we devoured films like crazy,” he had said in an interview to The Hindu on the eve of winning the Palme D’Or at Cannes Film Festival last year. No wonder his Oscar acceptance speech for best director was a warm and generous ode to fellow filmmakers, starting off with Martin Scorsese: “When I was young and starting in cinema there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart which is, ‘The most personal is the most creative.’ That quote was from our great Martin Scorsese… When I was in school, I studied Martin Scorsese’s films. Just to be nominated was a huge honor. I never thought I would win.”

He then went on to thank Quentin Tarantino for getting him a place in the sun: “When people in the U.S. were not familiar with my films, Quentin [Tarantino] always put my films on his list.” And then rounded it off by acknowledging Todd Phillips and Sam Mendes. “If the Academy allows, I would like to get a Texas chainsaw, split the award into five and share it with all of you,” he said.

The acting Oscars went as expected. Joaquin Phoenix won Best Actor for playing a failing clown who finds fame through violence in the dark comic-book tale Joker.

Renee Zellweger was named Best Actress for her performance as an ageing Judy Garland in the musical biopic Judy.

Mr. Tarantino’s sentimental ode to Tinseltown, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, brought the first acting Oscar for Brad Pitt, who played a supporting role as a laid-back stunt man.

Laura Dern took the Supporting Actress Oscar, her first Academy Award, for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Marriage Story.

Political messaging

Mr. Pitt gave a fitting political start to the ceremony by referring to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump and blocking of the crucial testimony of John Bolton: “They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 seconds more than the senate gave John Bolton last week”.

First World War film 1917, from Universal Pictures, had been seen as the film to beat but won just three of its 10 nominations. They came for its stunning “one-shot” feel cinematography, for visual effects and for sound mixing.

46,2020/02/10,Oscars 2020: Natalie Portman honours snubbed female directors with her cape,"Hollywood star Natalie Portman made a subtle yet powerful statement when she walked the Oscars red carpet wearing a black Dior cape with the last names of women directors snubbed by the Academy Awards embroidered on it. According to Page Six, Little Women director Greta Gerwig, The Farewell’s Lulu Wang and Melina Matsoukas, who directed Queen and Slim, were among the names etched in gold on her cape.

“I wanted to recognise the women who were not recognised for their incredible work this year in my subtle way,” she told reporters on the red carpet outside the Dolby Theatre.

This year’s nominees in the directing category include Martin Scorsese (The Irishman), Todd Phillips (Joker), Sam Mendes (1917), Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood) and Bong Joon Ho (Parasite).

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been criticised by many A-listers including best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo and comedienne Leslie Jones for overlooking people of colour and women in the nominations.

This is not the first time Portman has criticised the lack of female representation in Oscars. During the Academy Awards two years ago, she introduced the best director saying, “... and here are the all-male nominees.”

47,2020/02/10,Razzie awards 2020: 'Cats' and its furry stars nominated for worst film awards,"The widely panned movie musical Cats and four of its stars were nominated on Saturday for Razzie awards, an annual ritual that lampoons the worst of cinema.

James Corden, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson and Francesca Hayward received Razzie acting nominations for their Cats roles, in which they were costumed in digitally created fur. Oscar winner Dench was singled out for “looking suspiciously similar to The Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz,” organizers said in a statement announcing this year's nominees.

Overall, Cats was given eight Razzie nominations, tying for the lead with Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral, and Sylvester Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood. All three movies are in the running for worst picture, alongside psychological thriller The Fanatic and horror flick The Haunting of Sharon Tate.

Cats, an adaptation of the popular Broadway musical of the same name, was released in December and drew widespread ridicule from film critics. The $95 million production flopped at the box office, taking in just $69.7 million at theaters worldwide, according to website Box Office Mojo.

The tongue-in-cheek Razzies, created in 1980, serve as an antidote to Hollywoods glitzy Academy Awards ceremony. Nominees were announced a day before the bestowing of the Oscars, the highest honours in the movie industry.

John Travolta received two Razzie nominations this year for The Fanatic and Trading Paint, as did Anne Hathaway for The Hustle and Serenity. Her Serenity co-star Matthew McConaughey also was named.

The worst screen combo category piled on Cats with a nomination for “any two half-feline/half-human hairballs.”

It was not all bad news. Eddie Murphy was nominated for the Razzie Redeemer Reward for his role in Dolemite is My Name, along with Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers and Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems. The redeemer award goes to a past Razzie nominee or winner who has recently earned acclaim.

Razzie nominees and winners are voted for online by around 1,000 Razzie members from more than two dozen countries, who sign up online and pay a $40 membership fee.

49,2020/02/10,Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar is set to be transformed into an art district,"Over the course of next few weeks, Kannagi Nagar’s (off Mahabalipuram Road) otherwise grey walls will adorn murals of city-based and international artists alike. St+art, in association with Asian Paints and the Greater Chennai Corporation, is having its first public art project in the city featuring an eclectic mix of 10 national and international artists, to create public art interventions including murals, workshops and tours.







Chennai’s very own A-Kill, who is currently at work, brings his portraiture skills to the project. The young graffiti artist has already left a mark on the city: his body of work depicts everyday nature of life. Another Chennai artist who is confirmed to be part of the project is Karthik, better known by his artistic name SS 108. His visual expression plays with a variety of textures. Since 2012, he has worked on developing a style of art with circles and dot work, often creating compositions that are surreal or abstract.

St+art (@startindia on Instagram) has also revealed names of other artists who will be part of the project: Australia-based Bronte Naylor, Madrid-based Antonyo Marest, Gujarat-based street artist Do, Mumbai-based Sanskar Sawant, Ben Johnston, Kashmira Sarode, Austria-based David Lietner, New Delhi-based Osheen Shiva. Start India’s Ritesh Sharma, who is on the field, says that more artists might join later.

The first leg of the project will feature eight national and five international artists, who will help set up the country’s fifth art district. While artist Kashmira’s mural is almost done, A-Kill and Osheen Shiva are working in parallel in Kannagi Nagar currently. The latest one to join the bandwagon is artist Antonyo Marest, whose mural is located on a façade that is instantly visible when you enter the colony that houses more than 80,000 people. It, he says, is inspired by the colours of India.

A-Kill’s artwork, on the other hand, is adapted from a photograph of two young kids, the artist clicked himself. Osheen’s piece looks at the concept of livelihood through the lens of gender. This vibrant piece-in-making contains elements informed by visuals Osheen observed in women from the fisherfolk communities of Chennai.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/8qdvae/article30783870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11mpStart1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-kannagi-nagar-is-set-to-be-transformed-into-an-art-district/article30783871.ece
50,2020/02/10,Nose for fish,"You can both look and touch at the ‘fishploration’. Participants walk through Nochikuppam fish market, learning to identify fish, and gauge freshness by handling anchovies, barracuda, stringrays and more.

“We are making an attempt to educate consumers on seasonal and local fish,” says ecologist Divya Karnad, co-founder of InSeason Fish, which conducted the event. She adds that by teaching people the variety available, they hope to “diversify fish consumption, and gradually bring about a behavioural change.”

Stating that there are over 100 varieties of local fish, but only a few varieties such as seer and pomfret are popular, Divya says “This must change. This walk tries to familiarise people with fresh, local fish; encourage them to eat what is seasonal, and thereby create a market for fishermen who will then be encouraged to sell local fish.”

At Kasimedu fish market, trawlers return with catch only after 15 days at sea. In Nochikuppam, however, local fishermen spend less than a day at sea. “By opting for local fish, freshness is assured, we get diverse options. These fish offer health benefits too,” says Divya.

The Nochikuppam market is divided into two sections. “As you enter from the Lighthouse side, fishermen who source their fish from Kasimedu set up stalls towards your left. On the right by the road side, local fish caught using small boats are sold in small quantities by fisher women.

“Local fishermen practice safe fishing as they spend no more than four to six hours at sea. While the Kasimedu fishermen focus on huge, popular fish from deep sea, local fishermen catch what is available in that season in a particular location,” she says.

The next step is to identify the fish. “Sellers can mislead us. So, being able to identify fish will give the sellers an impression that we know what we are buying. You must ask numerous questions and not just go by what they say and be convinced.”

Once consumers learn this, the next step is to find out if the fish is fresh or frozen. There are simple ways to do so. If fish is fresh, it will have clear eyes, glossy skin with a layer of slime, and absolutely no stench.

The market is flooded with seer, pomfret, emperor fish, barracuda, trevally, barramundi and also stingray. “Fisherman can take you for a ride by selling freshwater fish that looks similar to a barramundi. There are also fish which look similar to seer and red snapper, and people end up paying through their nose without realising the difference between the two. Freshwater fish have prominent scales, whereas sea fish usually have a soft body with scales nearly invisible,” Divya explains.

She pauses, along with the group, to watch a seine being dragged to shore by a group of fishermen. Fishermen at Nochikuppam practice shore seine fishing: this method employs a fishing net called a seine, which hangs vertically with its bottom edge held down by weights and the top edge buoyed by floats.

“A group of 25 or more men cast this net, with the help of a boat. The seine is then towed to the beach and with it comes the catch. Locally, this method of fishing is called periya vala or kara vala,” Chaitanya Krishna of InSeason Fish says.

This net usually brings in small fish such as nethili (anchovies), sudhumbu, and karapodi. Watching the nets being pulled to the shore is fascinating, and even more interesting is the way the fresh catch is immediately auctioned off.

“Such fishplorations could transform sea food lovers into responsible consumers. We learn to make an informed choice, and are encouraged to do our homework before we buy fish,” says Narayani S, marine biologist and a volunteer at InSeason Fish, adding, “We must understand that fish is the last wild food that we eat these days, which is why conservation is vital.”

The collective conducts monthly fishplorations in cities like Bengaluru and Mumbai. The next walk in Chennai is towards the end of March. It will be at any of the fish markets located at Nochikuppam, Urur Kuppam, or Semmancheri Kuppam.

51,2020/02/10,Drive along Nemmeli-Thiruporur Road to visit Chennai’s own Great Salt Lake,"As I balance myself on one leg to avoid dung at the sidewalk of Nemmeli-Thiruporur Road, two motorcycles zip past, at nearly 90 kilometres per hour. I flap my hands and yelp.

The cows on the field look up at this strange crane-like human being with mild derision, and go back to lazily chewing their cud. Occasional speeding vehicles apart, Nemmeli-Thiruporur Road is a painting of idyll.

If you want to escape the bustle of the city, ECR is the best option to head out on a long drive. Past Muttukadu, it is separated from its sister highway, OMR, by a water body, ‘The Great Salt Lake’.

Named so because of its nature, the lake is a result of seawater from Bay of Bengal cutting in at Muttukadu, flowing South and getting trapped in this lake. As water from this lake evaporates, it leaves behind arid stretches of land with salt deposits.

To cross over to OMR from ECR and vice versa, over the Great Salt Lake, you can use the preferred Kelambakkam-Kovalam Road. For this column however, we head further down South to the more desolate Nemmeli-Thiruporur Road.

To take this lane, we make a right from ECR at Nemmeli — a slope leads us to the pastoral entrance of the bridge. After the winter monsoons, the area is green enough for herds to graze.

Herders Gajalakshmi, Srinivasa and Shigamani are here with their cows. “We come every morning at nine, from Porur,” says Gajalakshmi. “Other people drop off their cows with us and we get them to graze here. About 13 of these cows are under my care,” she says, pointing to the cows, who are right now in the middle of what looks like a shiatsu massage by cranes.

Getting salty

In February, The Great Salt Lake is not brimming the way it does during the monsoon months of August or November, however it has considerably more water than it will in the coming months. The lake looks like a salt pan — shallow in parts, leaving parallel lines of dry land between azure waters as if divided into square pieces.

The last time I was in this area, in August, we chanced upon a 15-feet-high dune of salt near Kelambakkam. That is incidentally, where the former government-run and now defunct Covelong Salt Factory is located. The building is almost in ruins, and production there stopped nearly a decade ago.

Today, as we make our way to Thiruporur, not far from the bridge, we discover the Sapan salt factory, whose compound walls are plastered with posters of their iodised salt. “There were many salt factories in this area,” says cyclist Ramanujar Moulana, who first told me about the Covelong Salt Factory when we were discussing his book on biking trails in OMR and ECR.

According to a guard at the Sapan Salt Factory, this branch is responsible only for the cleaning and packaging of salt, which makes its way from Thoothukudi. The district known for its salt-production makes Tamil Nadu second only to Gujarat in this business. However, the factory staff reveals that the quantity of salt coming to Chennai has decreased over the past couple of years. According to media reports, even in Thoothukudi, salt from Gujarat was imported last year. An effect perhaps of the 2018 Cyclone Gaja.

As we head back to the city, our veteran cab driver, Joseph recalls a time when even in Chennai’s ECR stretch, there were active salt pans. “I would make trips here often, any time something new opened up, like MGM Dizzee World. Ten years ago, I would see people working on salterns in the Kelambakkam-Kovalam stretch.” Active or not, the drive sure is pleasant, with coconut trees looking from beyond the grassland and a row of tall white buildings from beyond the lake.

55,2020/02/10,AG&P to charter floating LNG unit,"Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Company of Manila Inc. (AG&P), a downstream gas and LNG logistics firm and ADNOC Logistics and Services (ADNOC L&S) have signed an agreement for the conversion, supply, operations and maintenance of a floating storage unit (FSU) at AG&P’s new LNG import facility located within Karaikal Port in Puducherry.

The 1,37,756 cubic meter FSU, owned by ADNOC L&S, is being chartered for 15 years through a commercial model enabling supply to be scaled to match demand.

Construction of the terminal will begin shortly with commercial operations expected to commence before the end of 2021.

The Karaikal FSU will be only the fourth FSU-based LNG import terminal in the world after those in Malta, Malaysia and Bahrain.

ADNOC L&S will provide a Japan-built, Moss-type containment vessel as FSU for the project from its fleet of eight LNG ships.

Abdulkareem Al Masabi, CEO of ADNOC L&S said, “It is also an important agreement because it provides AG&P with additional storage flexibility for their LNG terminal as well as giving us the chance to generate more value from one of our historical assets which is coming to the end of its current contract.”

Owned and operated by AG&P, the LNG import facility at the Karaikal Port will have an initial capacity of one million tonnes per annum (MTPA) which will be expanded to three MTPA in the medium term as demand increases.

The terminal will serve domestic, industrial and commercial customers within a 500-km radius, including the heavily-industrialised region of central Tamil Nadu, which has major manufacturing clusters for fertilizer, cement, steel, textile, leather, sugar and garment industries.

In addition, it will serve gas-fired power plants as well as AG&P’s own extensive city gas distribution network across South India.

Karthik Sathyamoorthy, president, AG&P Terminals & Logistics, said: “ Both of our companies will work very closely to provide a comprehensive LNG solution for our downstream customers through the Karaikal LNG Facility. AG&P has focused on bringing down the unit cost of re-gasification terminals for smaller volumes.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/agp-to-charter-floating-lng-unit/article30785548.ece
56,2020/02/10,Union Bank profit surges to ₹575 crore on recoveries,"Recoveries from Essar Steel and Ruchi Soya helped State-run lender Union Bank of India to report ₹575 crore in net profit for the quarter ended December 31 compared with ₹153 crore in the year-earlier period.

Net interest income grew 25.7% to ₹3,134 crore while non-interest income growth was almost flat at ₹112 crore.

Domestic net interest margin (NIM) improved to 2.55% compared with the 2.23% in Q3 FY19.

“We were helped by some good recoveries which came from Essar Steel, Ruchi Soya Industries and Prayagraj Power Generation Company. We recovered close to ₹2,000 crore from these three accounts,” said Rajkiran Rai G., managing director and chief executive officer of the bank.

Cash Recoveries increased 261.4% year-on-year to ₹2,255 crore .

“Our total recoveries and upgradation for the nine months has been ₹4,910 crore. We are expecting another ₹3,000 crore in this quarter both from the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) and non-NCLT accounts. So, we can close the year at about ₹8,000 crore,” he added.

57,2020/02/10,"CRR exemption for retail, MSME loans for 5 years","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has exempted banks from maintaining cash reserve ratio (CRR) for loans to retail and micro, small and medium enterprises for five years, if these loans are extended between January 31 and July 31, 2020.

“An amount equivalent to the incremental credit outstanding from the fortnight beginning January 31, 2020 and up to the fortnight ending July 31, 2020 will be eligible for deduction from NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) for the purpose of computing the CRR for a period of five years from the date of origination of the loan or the tenure of the loan, whichever is earlier,” the RBI said.

During the monetary policy review last week, the central bank said lenders will not have to maintain CRR for loans extended between the above mentioned time period.

“...the Reserve Bank is actively engaged in revitalising the flow of bank credit to productive sectors having multiplier effects to support growth impulses,” the RBI said.

This exemption was available for incremental credit disbursed as retail loans to automobiles, residential housing, and loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

At present, CRR is 4% of net demand and time liabilities. Banks do not earn any interest for maintaining CRR with the RBI. CRR is the proportion of deposits of deposits that a bank has to park with RBI in cash.

“Banks are advised that they can claim the first such deduction from the NDTL of February 14, 2020 for the amount equivalent to the incremental credit extended to the sectors indicated above over the outstanding level of credit as at the end of the fortnight ended January 31, 2020,” the RBI said in a notification.

The move is expected to make loans cheaper to these particular segment.

Commenting on the results, T.T. Srinivasaraghavan, managing director, SFL said that in a difficult environment, they were able to post reasonable results by containing costs and improve market share in a majority of segments that they operated in.

He also said that the sales for automakers during the fourth quarter would be more depressing than that in the third quarter as most of them would be trying to clear their BS-IV inventories. There would not be much sales of BS-VI vehicles in the period.

However, no arrests have been made, according to the Finance Ministry.

To a query in Lok Sabha, the Ministry on Monday said as per existing guidelines, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) had been given powers to act on whistle-blowers’ complaints.

Chief Vigilance Officers of the Ministries or government departments are the designated authorities to receive written complaints or disclosures on any allegation of corruption or misuse of office by any employee.

“Fundamental governance reforms of far-reaching significance have been effected in public sector banks (PSBs). To strengthen governance at the board level, the position of chairman and managing director has been bifurcated into a non-executive chairman and an MD & CEO,” the Ministry said. A Banks Board Bureau has been created for arm’s length selection of non-executive chairmen and whole-time directors (WTDs). Performance-based extensions have been instituted for WTDs.

The Ministry said comprehensive reforms to institutionalise responsible banking had been effected through codified policies and audited procedures for prudential lending, and robust data-driven risk assessment and monitoring.

The board-approved loan policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail-risk appraisal in project financing.

“Monitoring has been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above ₹250 crore,” said the Ministry.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/chiefs-of-6-banks-under-cbi-ed-scanner-finmin/article30785497.ece

The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 162.23 points, or 0.39%, down at 40,979.62. It hit an intra-day low of 40,798.98.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 66.85 points, or 0.55%, to 12,031.50.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, cracking over 7%, after the home-grown auto major on Saturday reported 73% decline in consolidated quarterly net profit.

Other major laggards were Tata Steel, ONGC, Sun Pharma, Hero MotoCorp, PowerGrid and NTPC.

On the other hand, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank, TCS, Asian Paints, HDFC, HUL and RIL closed with gains.

Market mood remained jittery amid rising apprehension about economic fallout due to Chinese coronavirus globally as the increase in casualty figures surpassing SARS outbreak has raised alarm bells about its severity, Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said.

62,2020/02/10,Sony latest to withdraw from Barcelona conference over coronavirus fears,"Sony Corp on Monday became the fifth company to pull out of this month's international telecoms conference in Barcelona over fears related to the coronavirus.

The event, the Mobile World Congress - which attracts more than 100,000 visitors, is due to take place on Feb 24-27.

Amazon.com Inc, South Korea's LG Electronics , Swedish equipment maker Ericsson and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia have already said they will not attend the conference.

GSMA, the conference organiser, had no immediate comment.

Sony said its launch event for the conference would be held via video. “As we place the utmost importance on the safety and wellbeing of our customers, partners, media and employees, we have taken the difficult decision to withdraw from exhibiting and participating at MWC 2020 in Barcelona, Spain,” it said in a statement.

In a statement on Sunday GSMA had said no one from China's Hubei province - where the coronavirus outbreak started - would be allowed to attend the conference, while visitors from China must prove they have been outside the country for at least two weeks prior to the event.

These measures add to earlier actions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus across the conference's three main venues, including changing microphones between speakers and advising all attendees to adopt a no-handshake policy.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China has risen to more than 900, with more than 40,000 people infected. More than two dozen countries are grappling with the virus, which has infected more than 330 people outside China.

Spain has just two cases confirmed on islands off the mainland.

In 2019, some 6% of Mobile World Congress attendees were from China, according to GSMAs post-congress report. Most were from Europe, around 64%, as were about 45% of the exhibitors.

Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE have said they will attend, ordering China-based staff to self-isolate ahead of the event and drafting in European staff to cover for those not able to attend from China.

The GSMA estimates that the Mobile World Congress boosted the local Barcelona economy by around 470 million euros ($514.65 million) last year.

63,2020/02/10,Ghosn seeks release of internal documents,"Lawyers for Carlos Ghosn, the fugitive former automotive executive, on Monday argued in a Dutch court for the release of internal documents relating to his dismissal by Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors .

Ghosn, former chairman of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance who was arrested in Japan in 2018 but fled to Lebanon last December, launched a court case in the Netherlands against the Japanese carmakers in July arguing that his firing was unlawful.

Monday's hearing at the Amsterdam District Court was the first public session in the case. Ghosn is seeking 15 million euros ($17 million) in damages from the carmakers, who he says violated Dutch labour laws.

“Nissan and Mitsubishi publicly shamed Ghosn,” attorney lawyer Roeland de Mol told the court. “Their reports and accusations were never put to Ghosn. There was no due process.”

De Mol said Ghosn wants “a full debate on the reasons of Ghosn's dismissal. We need the information in his file to be able to do that. Mr. Ghosn is ready for a fight.”

Ghosn is seeking access to documents relating to internal Nissan and Mitsubishi investigations, which the carmakers used to substantiate his dismissal on allegations of financial misconduct.

His defence team has argued that the documents will show the companies were aware of Ghosn's activities.

Ghosn's lawyers claim he was unfairly dismissed as chairman of Nissan-Mitsubishi BV, a Dutch-registered entity, because the details of the allegations were not shared with him.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/x07xg5/article30440605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THCARLOSGHOSN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ghosn-seeks-release-of-internal-documents/article30782551.ece
64,2020/02/10,Govt has no plans to give permanent status to finance commission: Thakur,"The government has no plans to give permanent status to the finance commission, Union Minister Anurag Singh Thakur said on Monday.

Currently, the government appoints finance commission for a fixed term.

While replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Thakur also said the RBI was also not considering any proposal to give permanent status to the commission.

“No, Government of India is not considering any proposal to give permanent status to Finance Commission,” the Minister of State for Finance said in a written reply to the lower house.

Core responsibilities of the finance commission include evaluating the state of finances of the Union and State governments, recommending the sharing of taxes between them, laying down the principles determining the distribution of these taxes among states.

The government in November extended the term of 15th Finance Commission, headed by former bureaucrat N K Singh, by one year to October 30, 2020.

The term of the commission was originally set to end in October 2019, but was extended by one month to November 30.

Singh presented the first report pertaining to financial year 2020-21 to the government in December 2019.

“The recommendations made by the Finance Commission will be examined in the ministry in consultation with various departments and approval of Cabinet will be sought,” Mr. Thakur said in the House.

In accordance with approval of the Cabinet, “an explanatory memorandum as to the action taken on the recommendations made by the 15th Finance Commission will be laid on the floor of both the Houses of Parliament during Budget Session,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ml5gd7/article30775863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAKUR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-has-no-plans-to-give-permanent-status-to-finance-commission-thakur/article30782364.ece

66,2020/02/10,Airlines face growth warning as virus curtails Singapore Airshow,"Asian airlines face “drastic” cuts in their planned growth because of the coronavirus crisis, an industry group warned, adding gloom to an already depleted Singapore Airshow as more companies scaled back plans on Monday.

The Singapore Airshow from Feb. 11 to 16 is proceeding, but the exhibition centre is pockmarked with empty spaces that would have held displays from Chinese companies and others skipping the show because of the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people.

More than 70 exhibitors, including major U.S. defence firms Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co have pulled out over concerns related to the new coronavirus.

Few deals are expected at the biennial event, where the epidemic has triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.

Before the coronavirus hit, the International Air Transport Association had expected passenger numbers to rise by 4% in 2020 and cargo traffic to be 2% higher.

“All bets are off in terms of traffic forecasts for this year,” Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines, said in an interview.

“If you look at the schedule cuts and the actual operations they have been cut by 50%, 60%, 70% within China. It is pretty drastic,” he said.

The Pentagon reduced the size of its delegation to the air show, which had been set to include its chief weapons buyer, U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Ellen Lord, Reuters reported on Friday.

Singapore on Friday raised its alert level for the coronavirus outbreak to orange, the same level reached during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS) pandemic, sparking panic buying at supermarkets across the island.

There are 43 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Singapore. The orange alert level advises organisers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events and recommends precautions such as temperature screening and more frequent cleaning of common areas for those that do proceed.

Health experts, however, said they were concerned that temperature screening might not be effective, given reports the coronavirus could be spread by people without symptoms.

“Temperature screening is okay to pick up people already sick - and those people should not be coming to the show anyway - but doesn't pick up people incubating the virus,” said John McBride, an infectious disease physician and professor at Australia's James Cook University.

SIA Engineering Company Ltd and GE Aviation on Monday said they had postponed plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for a new engine overhaul facility in Singapore on Tuesday until further notice because of the raised alert level.

Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries withdrew from the show late Sunday, citing concerns associated with the coronavirus.

The air show's organisers said on Sunday they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from the 54,000 at the last show in 2018. They also plan to limit public attendance.

The lobbies of major hotels, usually bustling with attendees, were noticeably quiet.

A spokeswoman for the organisers on Monday declined to provide an update on numbers and why the air show was going ahead when many smaller associated events and briefings were being cancelled over coronavirus concerns.

Cancelling the show would lead to refunds running into the tens of millions of dollars, a source at one of the exhibitors told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Organiser Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engineering and government agencies, charges at least S$1,550 per square metre for space in the show's exhibition hall, according to its website.

That would equate to more than S$3 million ($2.16 million) for ST Engineering's booth, the show's largest at more than 2,000 square metres. ST Engineering is majority owned by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings.

Experia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam on Sunday said he could not comment on the financial terms of a cancellation.

67,2020/02/10,Inflation likely hit a near six-year high in January,"Retail inflation likely rose to a near six-year peak in January as food prices stayed high, according to a group of economists in a Reuters poll.

The Feb. 5-7 poll consensus of more than 40 economists showed India's annual consumer price inflation is expected to have risen to 7.40% in January, a touch above December's 7.35% and the highest since May 2014.

While nearly half of the economists polled predicted price pressures eased in January, none expected it to have fallen within the RBI's medium-term target range of 2%-6%, suggesting a significant decline in inflation over the coming months was unlikely.

The RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 5.15% on Thursday, despite slowing growth, and revised up its inflation projections, estimating it would range between 5.0% and 5.4% in the first half of the upcoming fiscal year.

“Headline consumer price inflation is likely to have edged up in January, in large part due to a continued increase in food inflation,” said Darren Aw, Asia economist at Capital Economics.

“Weekly data indicate that vegetable inflation has peaked, but remains very high. And supply constraints have also caused milk producers to raise prices.”

However, recent data showed a decline in some vegetable prices, including onions - the primary driver for the latest inflation surge - while oil prices, India's biggest import, plunged over 10% last month after the coronavirus outbreak in China raised concerns about global economic growth.

The RBI, which cut interest rates by a cumulative 135 basis points last year, is now expected to stay on hold until late this year, putting the onus on the government to boost the flagging economy.

But the latest annual budget fell short of expectations for fiscal expansion.

68,2020/02/10,SoftBank set for sharp quarterly profit drop amid pressure from Elliott,"Japan's SoftBank Group is expected to post a slide in profits for the past quarter, deepening concern about its ability to secure funding for a second Vision Fund and giving activist fund Elliott Management more fodder for a shake-up.

Elliott, the New York-based fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, has amassed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank and is pushing for changes including $20 billion in stock buybacks, sources said last week.

The emergence of Elliott, one of the world's most powerful activist investors, as a prominent SoftBank shareholder is likely to highlight the Japanese conglomerate's difficulties following its soured bet on office-sharing startup WeWork.

SoftBank, which reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years in July-September, has come under increasing pressure for its lack of transparency, especially around its $100 billion Vision Fund of largely unlisted start-ups.

“I'm not sure investors will have confidence in the private valuations that drive the reported performance of the Vision Fund, particularly after the performance of WeWork and others,” said Morningstar analyst Dan Baker.

Also Read SoftBank sets up $108 billion investment fund with no Saudi money

The tech conglomerate, which reports on Wednesday, is expected to post a 20% fall in operating profit to 345 billion yen ($3.1 billion) in the October-December quarter, according to the average forecast of three analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

That would follow a quarterly operating loss of 704 billion yen when the firm was whiplashed by an $8.9 billion hit at the Vision Fund as the value of WeWork and other bets like Uber plunged. The loss prompted founder Masayoshi Son to acknowledge his “investment judgement was poor in many ways”.

A second quarter of dismal results would only reinforce doubts about the viability of a second, massive fund, given that it would be reliant on profits from the current Vision Fund for some of its funding.

TOUGH CALL

Analysts have long highlighted the challenge of forecasting SoftBank's earnings, given the limited visibility on Vision Fund valuations. In the six months to September, the fund said it had gains on 25 companies and losses on another 25, but identified only a handful of names.

What is clear, though, is that since the WeWork bailout, a slew of portfolio companies - from hotel-booking platform Oyo to cloud robotics firm CloudMinds - have cut jobs and come under pressure to show their business models are viable.

That's a marked shift from Son's previous strategy of prioritising growth over profitability.

SoftBank Corp, the telecommunications firm that is two-thirds owned by SoftBank Group, and one of the parent's biggest listed assets, on Friday reported a 15% rise in quarterly profit.

The Vision Fund has stakes in nearly 90 start-ups. Only five were listed prior to the October-December quarter. During that period, three of those fell although ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co Ltd rose almost 60%.

Chip designer Arm, which will also provide an update on Wednesday, has turned money losing.

TTD hopes to complete the construction of the temple along with a Vedic School and Hospital in two years time, MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy who led the delegation of TTD Board said on Monday. Talking to The Hindu over phone from Delhi, Mr. Reddy said two sites were identified as suitable for constructing the temple.

​“We also met the Chief Secretary of Jammu & Kashmir and explained the details of our project. It has been a long-pending demand of pilgrims from many North Indian States visiting Tirumala that a replica of the temple be constructed in Jammu,” he said.​

Mr. Reddy said that funds for constructing the temple, a Vedic school, a marriage hall and a hospital would be raised from devotees and the TTD would also contribute, to the extent possible. Asked about security concerns in the newly formed UT, the Rajya Sabha Member said that Jammu was peaceful and there was no threat whatsoever. ​

“Jammu is a peaceful place. Life is absolutely normal and no untoward incidents are reported in the area.

70,2020/02/10,Speaker cautions Mahua Moitra for casting aspersions on Chair,"Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday cautioned TMC member Mahua Moitra for casting aspersions on the Chair and passing comments from her seat while the proceedings of the House were under way.

“I am telling you that please don’t keep passing comments from your seat or else I will be forced to take action,” Mr. Birla told the Trinamool MP.

The Speaker’s comments came after Ms. Moitra made certain remarks on the Chair after she was not allowed to ask a supplementary question on the growth rate during Question Hour.

“Honourable member, please don’t make undue comments and that too when sitting in someone else’s seat. Whether I am impartial or not, the House will decide...,” Mr. Birla said expressing his displeasure.

Then Mr. Birla told TMC leader of the House Sudip Bandyopadhyay to advise his colleague.

“Sir, she is a first time MP. She is very jovial and very promising. I will definitely convey your message to her but you too kindly bless her,” Mr. Bandopadhyay said.

Mr. Birla also expressed concern over members bringing placards and posters into the House and said there should be a debate on whether such things could be allowed or should there be a complete ban.

It happened when Trinamool member Saugata Roy rose to oppose the introduction of The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Bill, 2020 and the BJP members from West Bengal displayed posters that said “Save Democracy in West Bengal”.

“Would you allow this, Sir? In your dispensation such things should not be allowed,” Mr. Roy told the Speaker.

Mr. Birla then said there should be a debate on whether posters should be allowed at all and if someone still brings, should there be action against the member.

Though Mr. Birla sought the views from the House including Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, there was no unanimity but Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi supported the move.

No reason for worry over PSBs: Anurag Thakur

During the Question Hour that witnessed several questions on the state of the economy, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur told the House that the public sector banks (PSBs) were doing well now and there was no reason for worry.

71,2020/02/10,Opposition walks out from Houses over quota issue,"Opposition parties on Monday staged a walkout from both Houses of Parliament after Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot said the Centre was not a party to the case in which the Supreme Court held that reservation in promotions in public posts could not be claimed as a ‘fundamental right’.

He said that though the Centre was neither asked to file an affidavit nor made a party to the case, the matter was being discussed at the “highest level” and “appropriate steps” would be taken. His remarks were in response to the Opposition’s charge that the Centre had failed to defend the reservation in promotions.

Refutes charge

Refuting the Opposition allegation, the Minister reiterated the Narendra Modi government’s commitment to reservation for the Scheduled Castes (SCs), the Scheduled Tribes (STs) and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and pointed out that the order pertained to a 2012 decision of the Uttarakhand government when the Congress was in power in the State.

Last Friday, the top court ruled that the State governments were not bound to give reservation in promotion without data showing imbalance in the representation of certain communities. The order pertained to an appeal against the Uttarakhand High Court order with regard to promotions to Assistant Engineers (Civil) in the Public Works Department.

When Mr. Gehlot talked about the Congress being in power in Uttarakhand then, Opposition MPs shouted “shame, shame” and walked out. The issue was raised by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as soon as the Question Hour began.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who is also the Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha, said, “The Congress is politicising the issue.” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi urged Speaker Om Birla to expunge comments from Opposition leaders who had linked the Centre with the judgment.

In the Rajya Sabha, Minister for Food and Consumer Affairs Ramvilas Paswan said, “We have been demanding two things: there be a separate judiciary services with due reservation for the SCs/STs; and the reservation clause be part of Schedule 9 of the Constitution so that it can’t be tampered with.”

Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “None of us could have imagined that the reservation would be revoked. We were hopeful that Mr. Gehlot would say the government would file a review petition immediately or bring in a law to make the judgment null and void.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/92j3ec/article30785439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-walks-out-from-houses-over-quota-issue/article30785440.ece
72,2020/02/10,Govt. in denial of economic collapse: Chidambaram,"Senior Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday led the Opposition’s severe criticism of the government’s economic policies, saying the economy was perilously close to collapse and, with “rising unemployment and falling consumption, India is becoming poorer.”

Leading the debate on the Union Budget in the Rajya Sabha, he said the government was in denial and the economy had to be attended to by ‘competent doctors’.

Revenue shortfall

The Congress leader said the States were being cheated. “In the beginning of the current year, you promised to transfer ₹8,09,133 crore in the Budget Estimate. At the end of the year, you will transfer only ₹6,56,046 crore. There is a cut of ₹1,53,000 crore. Divide it among 30 States. On an average, every State will lose ₹5,000 crore…and the next year, you [have] promised to give ₹784 lakh crore. I don’t believe your numbers,” he said.

The economy, he said, is facing demand constraints and is investment starved. “Fear and uncertainty prevails in the country,” he added. The former Minister pointed out that government is facing a shortfall in all forms of taxes — ₹1.56 lakh crore on corporate tax, ₹10,000 crore on personal income tax, ₹30,000 crore on customs, ₹52,000 crore on excise and ₹51,000 crore on the GST. This despite “the extraordinary powers” and “all kinds of power” given to lower-level tax officials, he said.

The net tax revenue in the current fiscal was targeted at ₹16.49 lakh crore but only ₹9 lakh crore had been collected in first nine months till December 2019 and “you want us to believe this will rise to ₹15 lakh crore by March 2020?” he said.

Similarly, the expenditure in 2019-20 was pegged at ₹27.86 lakh crore, but only ₹11.78 lakh crore was spent during April-December, and by March this is projected to rise to ₹27 lakh crore.

“Today there is no money in the hands of the people and there is no incentive for anyone to invest. On the contrary, there is fear and uncertainty prevailing all over this country and under this fear and uncertainty, nobody will invest in India,” he said.

He said Arvind Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser to the BJP government for four years, had stated that the economy is in the ICU. “I would say the patient has been kept out of ICU and incompetent doctors are looking at the patient,” Mr. Chidambaram quipped.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q3szsx/article30785406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11PC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-in-denial-of-economic-collapse-chidambaram/article30785407.ece
73,2020/02/10,Analysis: RSS leader Suresh Joshi underscores broader Hindu unity,"RSS second-in-command Suresh “Bhaiyyaji” Joshi in an interaction in Goa on Sunday said the BJP, referred to as the political voice of the Sangh Parivar, was not “synonymous” with the Hindu community and moves to oppose the BJP should not be automatically assumed to be opposing Hindus.

While many meanings are being read into Mr. Joshi’s words, specifically in the context of the Union government’s handling of a bitter face-off over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) but more importantly over the BJP’s break with the Shiv Sena — its only ally on the issue of Hindutva — last year, RSS insiders say the context is even larger.

The meaning of Mr. Joshi’s statement, say RSS insiders, is to draw the point that the Hindu cause is a larger issue, notwithstanding the political position taken by people of different political ideologies. It is also to underscore the point that the RSS’s voice is not confined to that of the BJP.

Insiders point to the fact that the late Nanaji Deshmukh favoured supporting the Congress in the elections called in the aftermath of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. At that time, say senior RSS men, the country needed to be united in the face of fissiparous forces regardless of ideology.

Many in the Sangh also feel that ideology is one thing, but the way the RSS functions organisationally is also important. That functioning, say sources, cannot be based only on political activity.

In Kerala, Bengal

Mr. Joshi’s statement in Goa (the transcript of which was made available to The Hindu) also referred to instances of Durga Pooja pandals, during the Left’s rule in West Bengal, being headed by members of the CPI(M) or even the fight for control over Devaswom Boards in Kerala by the Left again. In such situations, he says, while political ideology is the basis for the tussle, that it necessarily stems from an anti-Hindu stance is not correct.

This broad swathe drawn by Mr. Joshi is significant as the BJP is engaged in a bitter political battle in West Bengal and in Kerala, where religious polarisation is part of the political playbook and parties that seek minority votes are often accused of speaking the language of Pakistan.

It also does not mean that the RSS is backing off from its support of the CAA, with several office bearers being part of the programme for a door-to-door outreach to win over those opposing the Act.

What it does or at least seeks to do is to send a message to parties like the Shiv Sena that the RSS’s agenda still includes them. It also points to an effort to broad-base Hindutva as an ideological aspect of other parties, and to have certain causes of the Hindu society as acceptable to all and separate from politics.

In all, Mr. Joshi, considered a tough, ideologically driven man, has given much food for thought — not just to the BJP-led Central government — but also other parties and organisations on their levels of engagements with what are considered largely Hindu causes.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m8ph19/article30785326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11SURESHJOSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rss-leader-suresh-joshi-underscores-broader-hindu-unity/article30785328.ece
74,2020/02/10,Many Malaysians share Mahathir's concerns on Kashmir: expert,"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad’s recent comments on Kashmir reflected the sentiment shared by many in the country, Elina Noor, a senior Malaysian expert on international affairs, has said.

India’s decision to stop palm oil imports in response to the comments was expected, Ms. Noor observed and maintained that her country would look for alternative markets such as Pakistan. India’s ban would not hurt immediately but would prove to be challenging for Malaysia “if it continued”, she noted.

“Prime Minister Mahathir's concerns are certainly shared by a number of Malaysians, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. However, there are also Malaysians who feel that Mahathir breached diplomatic boundaries by voicing his thoughts so strongly and publicly,” said Ms Noor who is currently based at Hawaii’s Daniel K. Inouye Asia Pacific Centre for Security Studies.

Prime Minister Mohammad had expressed his concern on multiple occasions after India ended the special status of Kashmir on August 5, 2019 and in response India urged Malaysia to respect its sovereign decision.

Ms Noor said, “India's reaction to Mahathir's comments is understandable and expected. However, it does not negate the concerns held by many within and beyond India on the situation in Kashmir even if those concerns have not been expressed as explicitly as Mahathir's were.”

India had also hit out at Malaysia after a recent joint statement with Pakistan referred to Jammu and Kashmir. “India completely rejects the references made in respect of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral and inalienable part of India,” said the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs on February 6.

“Malaysia is hopeful that the restriction [palm oil ban] will be temporary and is reaching out to India to ameliorate tensions.At the same time, it is also reaching out to other markets to raise exports - including Pakistan, Malaysia’s third largest importer to make up for the shortfall,” Ms Noor said.

Insia’s ban affected Malaysia as India used to import a major share of palm oil from the Southeast Asian country. Palm oil production accounts for 37.9% of the agricultural sector’s contribution to Malaysia’s total GDP, but agriculture does not constitute a major part of the GDP.

75,2020/02/10,"1.97 lakh passengers travelling in 1,818 flights screened for nCoV so far","More than 1.97 lakh passengers travelling in 1,818 flights had been screened for the novel coronavirus, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday as he outlined the steps taken by the government to deal with the infection since its outbreak last month.

Issuing a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha, Dr. Vardhan said the screening of the passengers had been initiated at 12 major seaports and all minor ports to identify passengers and crew members coming from China and isolate them in case they were found symptomatic.

He told the House that India had also provided support to other countries in tackling the challenge posed by the nCOV disease.

“The ICMR has offered to do testing of samples for other South East Asian Region countries. Testing of samples from Maldives has already been undertaken. Request from Afghanistan for samples testing has been agreed to. We have agreed to provide technical assistance to Bhutan in screening of passengers also,’’ he said.

He thanked the Air India, its crew and the team of doctors and the para medical staff who brought back 654 passengers — 647 Indians (including two embassy officials who were on the ground in Wuhan to coordinate the evacuation operation) and seven Maldivians.

He said the government had initiated screening at all integrated checkposts from Nepal in collaboration with U.P., Uttarakhand, Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the Land Port Authorities.

“In our country, three positive cases have been reported so far from Kerala. All these cases have travel history from Wuhan. They have been isolated and are reported to be clinically stable,” Mr. Vardhan said.

The government had already constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by the Health Minister to monitor the virus. Besides, gram sabhas were being organised near the border with Nepal to create awareness.

So far, 1,510 samples had been tested of which 1,507 were found negative. Three samples had tested positive and 27 were under process.

The Minister said China had reported the outbreak on December 31. “The outbreak was initially noticed in a seafood market in Wuhan city in Hubei Province early December and in a short span has spread to all the provinces of China. As on February 9,37,198 confirmed cases and 811 deaths had been reported there while 354 confirmed cases had been reported from 27 countries [including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan].

76,2020/02/10,Opposition expresses concern over Budget in Parliament,"The Budget has exposed the failure of the current government when it comes to fiscal health, said the Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule, participating in a discussion on the proposed Union Budget 2020-21 in the Lok Sabha on Monday.

Terming the budget as “long and tiresome”, she said that the government is “living in a fairytale world”.

“While the government is talking about achieving a $5 trillion economy, we are not even barely crossing 5% [growth],” she added.

Investment declining

The Opposition in the Lok Sabha expressed concern over the “decline” in investments in the country and said that the expected GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate and tax collection figures appear unrealistic. Biju Janata Dal (BJD) member B. Mahtab said that investment in India has been the main driver of growth, but it has been declining since 1991.

“More corrective measures are necessary. The banks were not in a position to lend for infrastructure and the government should not lose sight of wider reforms in the public sector. There is a need to bring competition within the banking sector,” he said.

Dayanidhi Maran of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam noted that the government is selling away assets, which does not work for the country in the long run. “Also, while the government is saying that it has brought in a more effective tax paying mechanism, the truth is that to understand the new tax laws, one has to spend more money paying the auditor to figure out which bracket one falls into. Why can’t you come up with a single tax system?”

‘Unrealistic numbers’

Expressing apprehension over the Budget numbers, Preneet Kaur of the Congress Party said the presumption of 10% nominal GDP growth and 12% rise in tax collection seem “optimistic and unrealistic given the low economic growth and falling exports”. The agriculture sector seems to be an area of concern, she said, adding that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana needs to be reviewed.

However, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Aparajita Sarangi said that there is a balance between intent and content, and vision and provision, in the Budget. “We have moved from policy paralysis to policy action under the Narendra Modi government,” she said.

‘Because of fear’

“The real issue for the economy is not addressing investors’ sentiments. The government is strong, our Prime Minister is strong, then why are people not investing? It is, in my view, because of fear. People would rather sit on the mountains of cash than invest it,” Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said in the Rajya Sabha.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/14dhar/article30784758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Supriya-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-expresses-concern-over-budget-in-parliament/article30784744.ece

78,2020/02/10,DGCA bans IndiGo pilot for 'threatening' passenger,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday suspended the flying licence of an IndiGo pilot for three months for “threatening and intimidating” a woman passenger accompanying a wheelchair-bound senior citizen on January 13, 2020.

“The pilot’s attitude towards the wheelchair-bound senior citizen was intimidating, threatening and lacked compassion. His actions led to avoidable detention,” the DGCA said in a statement.

Sharing her ordeal of “harassment” on Twitter shortly after the incident, Bengaluru resident Supriya Unni Nair said the pilot stopped her and her 75-year-old mother from deplaning the aircraft after she insisted on a wheelchair for the latter. The wheelchair had been booked by her before embarking on the flight but the crew members said they had no access to it, leading to an argument.

Probe ordered

Civil Aviation Minister of State Hardeep Singh Puri, taking note of her social media post, asked the DGCA to probe the matter.

The DGCA also found the pilot guilty of misusing his authority, threatening to hand over the woman passenger to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), and warning her of a police complaint for her “unruly” behaviour. It highlighted that the pilot stopped the two passengers from deplaning the aircraft for nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes after other passengers had started deboarding.

“His actions led to the detention of a wheelchair-bound passenger. The PIC [pilot-in-command] exhibited lack of ability in managing a threat and error situation, especially when he was to operate another commercial flight after a short duration,” DGCA chief Arun Kumar said.

2018 Rules

This is the first instance in the recent past where the DGCA has acted against a crew member for misbehaving with a passenger. When the government framed rules on “unruly passengers” in 2018 and provided for a ban on air travel from three months to up to two years, it faced criticism for not holding crew members similarly accountable for their conduct.

Cruise ship Diamond Princess, carrying 3,711 people, arrived at the Japanese coast early last week and was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the novel virus on the ship.

Around 60 people tested positive of the virus on Monday, taking the total number of those infected on the ship to 130. Authorities had initially tested nearly 300 people when the ship arrived at the Japanese coast.

Indian Embassy in Tokyo on Monday tweeted the information about the Indians on the ship.

“Many Indian crew & some Indian passengers are on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess quarantined off Japan due to Coronavirus (nCoV),” it tweeted, without giving a specific number of Indians on the ship.

“In this context, any query please contact First Secretary (Consular) @IndianEmbTokyo at fscons.tokyo@mea.gov.in @CPVIndia @MEAIndia @PMOIndia,” it said.

Those on the ship have been asked to wear masks and allowed limited access to the open decks as they are advised to remain in the cabins most of the times to contain the spread of the virus, according to media reports.

Quoting an Indian crew member, identified as Binay Kumar Sarkar, on-board Diamond Express, NDTV news channel said there are 160 Indian crew members and eight Indian passengers on the ship.

Sarkar, in a video recorded from the ship, appealed to the Indian government and the UN to segregate the Indians on board on urgent basis.

“None of them have been checked (for coronavirus),” Sarkar, a chef from Bengal, said in Hindi. He was flanked by five of his Indians colleagues who were wearing masks.

“Please somehow save us as soon as possible. What’s the point if something happens (to us)...I want to request the government of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi-ji, please segregate us and bring us back home safely,” he said.

According to an AFP report, people on board the ship are facing difficulty due to the quarantine measures, particularly those in windowless interior cabins and others who require medication for various chronic conditions.

The Japanese health ministry said Monday that around 600 people on board urgently needed medication, and around half received supplies over the weekend, it said.

Meanwhile, the operator of the ship on Monday vowed to refund all 2,666 passengers due to the onboard outbreak of the new coronavirus.

It may be just a plastic sheet covering. Our children are called ‘Pakistani, terrorist, ghadar’ in school”.

Ms. Alam persisted that “these children live in jhuggis. They attend melas. You have to hear the mothers’ voices... On the other hand, families are being separated by NRC [National Register of Citizens] and children are being detained”.

But the CJI intervened, saying “we do not want you or any people using this forum as a platform to further create problem. If somebody calls ‘Pakistani’ in a school, this is not the platform to bring that... We are not here to discuss NRC, CAA [ Citizenship (Amendment) Act], rude behaviour in school, calling ‘Pakistani’, climate change or the Prime Minister”.

The CJI said: “we are on the death of a particular child... We respect motherhood, we respect social peace. So don't make arguments intended to generate guilt”.

Another lawyer, also appearing for the mothers, argued that India had ratified the UN Convention for Protection of Child Rights. “Children have a right to protest. Don’t stop that”, she argued.

“A four-month-old child is going there [Shaheen Bagh] to protest? Are you saying a four-month-old can protest?” the CJI asked.

Notice to government

Issuing notice to the government, the CJI agreed to the protesting mothers of Shaheen Bagh to intervene but warned them not to make “irrelevant” submissions.

“We are not stifling arguments. Remember, this is a properly constituted proceeding of the Supreme Court of India,” the CJI pointed out.

Ms. Sadavarte has sought a direction to the Delhi Police to stop children and infants from getting “involved” in the Shaheen Bagh protest against the CAA and the NRC. She said the protesters included women, senior citizens and even new-borns.

“The new-born babies need a lot of attention and care as they cannot express their pains. They are brought to the protest place, which is violator of their child rights and natural justice”, she wrote.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q374l5/article30759511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRASHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-tells-shaheen-bagh-mothers-it-will-not-entertain-irrelevant-submissions/article30782284.ece
84,2020/02/10,Report admonishes NCPCR for its Shaheen Bagh directive,"The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) directive seeking counselling for children at Shaheen Bagh is an attempt at “stifling their voice” and “targeting” their community, argues a report prepared by educationists and researchers who visited the protest site and recorded the testimonies of many mothers present there.

“Hatred and suspicion targeted at the Muslim community is what children are being exposed to through television and social media. That seems to be a larger reality that NCPCR ought to be concerned about – about children living and learning in an environment of communal polarisation and political hate speech that has become the ‘new normal’ especially in times of elections,” says the report.

It is based on field observations of the researchers and interactions with children, women and others at Shaheen Bagh and includes views expressed by experts at a panel discussion earlier this month. The study was submitted to the NCPCR on February 9. The authors include Poonam Batra, Professor of Education, University of Delhi, Monica Gupta, Department of Elementary Education at Gargi College, University of Delhi, and Chetan Anand, Research Scholar, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. The panellists included Shanta Sinha, the first NCPCR chairperson, and Amit Sen, Senior Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, among others.

It asserts that the NCPCR has failed to do its job in protecting children from police atrocities in Uttar Pradesh and by remaining silent on the issue of the police questioning school children on sedition in Karnataka’s Bidar as well as against rampant sexual abuse in the country. The study also points out that by ordering the South Delhi District Magistrate to identify children and ensure their counselling on the basis of an “anonymous complaint”, and without conducting its own investigation, the Commission violated its own rules. As per the NCPCR’s rules, a complaint should be “clear and legible and not vague, anonymous or pseudonymous”.

The authors say that it is in fact the NCPCR which is subjecting the children to trauma by giving such harmful directives.

“For these children the site is secure, because their parents are there, and the community is there. The children are safe, they are imbibing the best patriotic values and learning the importance of speaking out against perceived injustice. None of this can be equated to trauma. To want to take children for counselling without any kind of assessment, without any kind of discussion is in itself shocking, perhaps traumatic.”

The researchers found that the children at the protest site attended their school regularly and had access to enough safe spaces at Shaheen Bagh such as a makeshift reading room as well as a library and could be seen participating in activities such as drawing and painting.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jt04bz/article30746397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05DELPRIYASHAHEENBAGHPROTESTREPUBLICDAYAGAINSTCAANRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/report-admonishes-ncpcr-for-its-shaheen-bagh-directive/article30782170.ece
85,2020/02/10,"Shaheen Bagh closure: There cannot be indefinite protest in common area, says SC","The Supreme Court on Monday gently drew the attention of citizens, mothers and senior citizens agitating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to the inconvenience caused when protests were held on public thoroughfares for days.

A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K.M. Joseph said protests could not be carried on indefinitely in a common area. On Friday, the Bench indicated that the court would not be party to any sort of pre-election narrative to garner votes a day before the Assembly polls.

The Supreme Court, however, refused to pass any interim directions urgently in the Public Interest Litigation filed by advocate Amit Sahni seeking the removal of Shaheen Bagh protesters.

“The protests have been going on for over 50 days, you can wait. We like to hear the other side (Police),” Justice Kaul said.

The court issued a formal notice to the Delhi Police and listed the case for further hearing on February 17.

The court nudged the protesters about the bother created for ordinary commuters when protests were held on public roads indefinitely.

“There cannot be an indefinite protest in a common area. You have to find an area for protests. If protests are held everywhere, what will happen?” Justice Kaul asked advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad.

When Mr. Pracha submitted that there should be a “balancing of rights”, Justice Kaul said “this is not about any balancing of rights”. Justice Joseph asked, “Can you block a public road?”

The petition filed by Mr. Sahni sought directions to the police to take action to ensure smooth traffic movement on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which has been closed for over a month due to anti-CAA protests, making the public at large suffer.

The plea sought supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh, where several women are sitting on an indefinite protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court to avoid any further deterioration in the situation and to circumvent any violence.

“The respondents (Delhi Police) cannot be permitted to behave like mute spectators particularly in a situation presently faced by persons living in the vicinity of Kalindi Kunj,” said the plea.

Mr. Sahni contended that the Delhi High Court did not order the forthwith removal of traffic restrictions and observed that no direction could be issued on the methodology to handle protest and traffic movement successfully, and left it to the discretion of the police.

“No one can be permitted to occupy a public road for any reason whatsoever under the pretext of peaceful protest and that too for (an) indefinite period to make others suffer...” his plea said.

The High Court had asked the police to examine the issue while bearing in mind that law and order was supposed to be maintained.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8esk1b/article30782153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRAINDIA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shaheen-bagh-closure-there-cannot-be-indefinite-protest-in-common-area-says-sc/article30782154.ece

It also accused Minister for Social Justice Thaawarchand Gehlot of “misleading” the Lok Sabha and said it would move a privilege motion against him.

“The issue is that the RSS and the BJP cannot stand the idea that the Dalits, the tribals and the OBCs have reservation. It is in their DNA. They wake every morning and this irritates them, right!

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat might be “dreaming” of ending reservation, but the Congress would not let it happen.

The nine-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, said a Bench engaged in the review of a particular judgment could indeed refer other questions of law to a larger Bench. Arguments on merits would be heard from February 17.

The Bench also framed seven questions of law which the nine-judge Bench would decide now. These are:

What is the scope and ambit of religious freedom under Article 25 of the Constitution? What is the interplay between religious freedom and rights of religious denominations under Article 26 of the Constitution? Whether religious denominations are subject to fundamental rights? What is the definition of ‘morality’ used in Articles 25 and 26? What is the ambit and scope of judicial review of Article 25? What is the meaning of the phrase “sections of Hindus under Article 25 (2)(b)? Whether a person not belonging to a religious group can question the practices, beliefs of that group in a PIL petition?

On the last day of hearing, the Chief Justice had defended the November 14, 2019, reference made by a five-judge Sabarimala Review Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.

“By making this reference order (on November 14), the Bench (led by Justice Gogoi) has not prejudicially affected anybody’s rights. It may be the most innovative idea, but it has not affected any rights,” Chief Justice Bobde had said orally.

On November 14 last year, the Gogoi Bench, in a majority judgment, did not decide the Sabarimala review cases before it. Instead, it went on to frame “larger issues” concerning essential religious practices of various religions. It further clubbed other pending cases on subjects as varied as female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras to entry of Parsi women who married inter-faith into the fire temple and Muslim women into mosques and referred them all to a larger Bench. The reference order also asks the larger Bench to consider the Rule pertaining to the prohibition of entry to women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala temple. Chief Justice Bobde, who succeeded Justice Gogoi as top judge, set up a nine-judge Bench to hear the reference.

The November 2019 reference had hit a bump on Monday last when senior advocate Fali Nariman had objected to it. He had argued the court could not declare law in thin air.

“Fundamental (to judicial process) is you apply law to the facts of cases and not decide the law before looking into the facts... Never indulge in the exposition of law outside the realm of the facts of the case,” Mr. Nariman had argued.

He had said the Gogoi Bench’s sole task was to review the Sabarimala judgment of September 2018. The major ground for seeking a review was the finding in the judgment that Ayyappa devotees did not form a separate religious denomination. On November 14, the Review Bench had recorded no errors apparent or miscarriage of justice in the 2018 verdict.

‘Academic exercise’

“When Ayyappa devotees was not found to be a separate denomination, then these reference questions on Article 25 (religious freedom) are purely an academic exercise. It was not necessary to raise these hypothetical questions in reference. The President, and not the CJI, consults the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution on questions of law and facts,” Mr. Nariman had argued.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan had agreed that review jurisdiction did not include “framing a catalogue of questions randomly”.

“But what if judges have a doubt? They refer it to a larger Bench. Are you saying the President can refer questions of law to the Supreme Court, but judges cannot?” senior advocate A.M. Singhvi had countered.

‘Unlimited jurisdiction’

Senior advocate K. Parasaran had said the Supreme Court, as the highest court of the land, had unlimited jurisdiction. The fact that it was reviewing Sabarimala judgment does not preclude it from referring other questions of law and cases with similar issues to a larger Bench.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had contended that the objections raised against the November 14 reference to a larger Bench were based on “inherently faulty premise”.

Also read | Review and reference: On Sabarimala review pleas

“To say that a Review Bench cannot refer questions of law to larger Bench is absolutely absurd... No technical fetter prevents the Supreme Court from doing complete justice,” Mr. Mehta had said.

The Kerala government had also objected to the reference, saying the Gogoi Bench could not have kept the Sabarimala review pending until nine-judge Bench had finished examining questions referred to it.

The government had voiced apprehensions about the possibility of the Sabarimala case being re-opened if the nine-judge Bench ended up declaring a new law in the future.

88,2020/02/10,Supreme Court upholds amendments made to nullify own judgment diluting provisions of SC/ST Act,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act of 2018, which nullified its own controversial March 20, 2018 judgment diluting the stringent provisions of the Dalit protection law.

The Supreme Court had itself earlier recalled the March 20 judgment on October 1, 2019 in a review petition filed by the government. It had said it was wrong on the part of the March 20 judgment to treat all SC/ST community members as “a liar or crook”. It was against “basic human dignity”. The March 20 judgment had diluted the original 1989 legislation, saying they were using its provisions to file false criminal complaints against innocent persons.

Even while reserving the case for judgment, the Bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran and S. Ravindra Bhat had made it clear that it would neither upset the October 1 judgment nor dilute the provisions of the statute.

The government had enacted the Amendments, saying the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes continued to face the same social stigma, poverty and humiliation which they had been subjected to for centuries.

The 2018 Act had nullified a March 20 judgment of the Supreme Court, which allowed anticipatory bail to those booked for committing atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members. The original 1989 Act bars anticipatory bail. The Supreme Court verdict saw a huge backlash across the country. Several died in ensuing protests and property worth crores of rupees was destroyed. The government reacted by filing a review petition in the Supreme Court and subsequently amended the 1989 Act back into its original form.

Several petitions were filed challenging the 2018 Amendment Act. The lead petitioner, advocate Prithvi Raj Chauhan, had even called the amendments a “blunder” and a violation of the fundamental right to equality and personal liberty. The Supreme Court, however, had refused to stay the implementation of the amendments.

The government had responded that there was no decrease in the atrocities committed on members of SC/ST communities despite the laws meant to protect their civil rights.

“The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 is the least which the country owes to this section of the society who have been denied several civil rights since generations and have been subjected to indignities, humiliations and harassment,” the government had argued.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ew8wn3/article30771954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-upholds-constitutional-validity-of-scst-amendment-act-2018/article30780857.ece
89,2020/02/10,Omar’s sister challenges PSA charge against him in SC,"Sara Abdullah Pilot, sister of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, has approached the Supreme Court against the government's move to charge him under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

Ms. Pilot urged for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to the authorities to forthwith produce Mr. Abdullah before the Court and set him at liberty.

The petition, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, was mentioned before a Bench led by Justice N.V.Ramana on Monday

The Bench said it would consider their plea for early listing of the case.

Ms. Pilot said she was gravely concerned about the welfare, safety and security of her brother. He was already under detention from August 5 last — the day the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 — when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

Also read | Explained: The Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act

Ms. Pilot said she was shocked to learn that, just like what happened to their father, the government, had imposed a fresh lease of detention under the PSA on her brother too.

The petition explained that Mr. Abdullah's detention from August 5 under Section 107 CrPC (security for keeping the peace) was scheduled to end on February 5, 2020. His release was imminent. He had served the maximum period of detention.

On February 5, the Executive Magistrate, instead of releasing him, ordered his further detention under Section 8 of the Public Safety Act of 1978 in an “arbitrary exercise of power”.

Ms. Pilot asked what was the point of detaining a man already detained through the long months of lockdown suffered across J&K.

In fact, she said, during the past six months there had been no effort by the authorities to verify the truth behind the “information” that Mr. Abdullah was a threat to peace. On the other hand, there were reams of material in the form of tweets and public statements vouching for his exemplary conduct to maintain peace.

Ms. Pilot said there was danger to her brother's life and liberty.

Threat to public safety: govt

The government, in its PSA dossier against Mr. Abdullah, described him as a threat to public safety. It said he was “planning activities against the Union government”. It also highlighted “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths”.

The writ petition argued that the detention order was illegal as it conflated 'governmental policy' with the 'Indian State', suggesting that any opposition to the former constituted a threat to the latter.

“This is wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Indian Constitution”, it added.

Both the dossier and detention order contained “patently false and ridiculous material, essentially accusing the detenu of becoming a popular figure among general masses”. The grounds of detention were at best “illusory, vague and irrelevant”, Ms. Pilot contended.

The petition argued that if a petition's personal liberty had been taken away, there would be no fresh material or grounds for his further detention. Hence, the new detention order under the PSA was simply motivated by malice.

The petition narrated how at one point of time during his over six-month long detention, Mr. Abdullah had refused the government's overture to set him free in exchange for an undertaking that he would not participate in public assemblies in connection with the de-operationalisation of Article 370.

Two other former chief ministers of J&K, Omar Abdullah’s father Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti remain detained under the PSA along with other leaders. Mr.Omar Abdullah had been a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1998-2009 and subsequently a member of the J&K Legislative Assembly, the petition said. He had been a Minister at the Centre twice, as the Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce and MoS for the Ministry of External Affairs.

“It is rare that those who have served the nation as members of Parliament and have always stood by the national aspirations of India, are now perceived as a threat to the State,” the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ro63ky/article30780832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10OMAR-ABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/omar-abdullahs-sister-moves-sc-challenging-his-detention-under-psa/article30780833.ece
90,2020/02/10,Assam plans survey to identify indigenous Muslim population,"Assam is likely to conduct an exercise to identify the State’s indigenous Muslim population and segregate them from illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, even as doubts over the accuracy of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are yet to be addressed.

As per the plans, the survey will be conducted to identify people of four communities— Goria, Moria, Desi and Jolah of the tea tribes, considered as indigenous.

Assam Welfare of Minorities Minister Ranjit Dutta has convened a meeting on Tuesday with various organisations of the four communities and other stakeholders to finalise the plan.

“Assam has about 1.3 crore Muslims population, of which around 90 lakh are of Bangladeshi origin. The remaining 40 lakh are from different tribes and they need to be identified,” Assam Minority Development Board Chairman Muminul Aowal told PTI.

The indigenous Muslims are deprived of benefits of the government welfare schemes in absence of proper identification, he claimed.

Mr. Aowal, who is also the convenor of Janagosthiya Samanway Parishad Asom (JSPA), said the entire rationale behind such an exercise is to give protection to the indigenous people from demographic changes in the state.

“The NRC included lakhs of Bangladeshi-origin people.

So, we cannot rely on that. If we do not act now, one day all the indigenous tribes will be wiped out from Assam,” he added.

“Once the indigenous tribes are officially recognised, it will be better and easier to work for the development of these people. I, as a representative of these tribes, had in 2015 met the then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh,” Mr. Aowal said.

The indigenous groups had urged Singh for such a survey, he said.

When asked how the exercise will be carried out, he said, “We will request the state government to get an approval from the RGI (Registrar General of India). Without the RGI’s approval, the findings may not be legally tenable.”

The organisations representing the Muslim tribes want the paper works to be completed by March so that the actual fieldwork of enumerating people can begin early next fiscal, he said.

“The entire initiative is of the Minority Department of the state government, but it does not have the required manpower to carry out such a state-wide exercise. That is why it can be conducted through the Revenue Department, which is present at the village-level,” Mr. Aowal explained.

The NRC, which was published last year under the supervision of the Supreme Court with over 19 lakh exclusions, is being criticised by all sections for the “minimal number” of people left out.

It is being alleged that genuine Indians, mostly Hindus, were left out and many illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, mostly Muslims, were included.

94,2020/02/10,Goa Archbishop urges Centre to revoke citizenship law,"Archbishop of Goa and Daman, Rev. Filipe Neri Ferrao, has urged the Central government to “immediately and unconditionally revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)” and stop quashing the “right to dissent”. He also appealed to the government not to implement the proposed countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

However, Goa Bharatiya Janata Party’s general secretary Narendra Sawaikar asked why the Archbishop was opposing the CAA when “crores of people including Goans” were supporting it.

Diocesan Centre for Social Communications Media, a wing of the Goa Church, in a statement on Saturday, said, “The Archbishop and the Catholic community of Goa would like to appeal to the government to listen to the voice of millions in India, to stop quashing the right to dissent and, above all, to immediately and unconditionally revoke the CAA and desist from implementing the NRC and the NPR.”

The laws are “divisive and discriminatory” and will certainly have a “negative and damaging effect” on a multi-cultural democracy like ours, the church said.

There is serious concern that the NRC and the NPR will result in “direct victimisation of the underprivileged classes, particularly Dalits, adivasis, migrant labourers, nomadic communities and the countless undocumented people who, after having been recognised as voters for more than 70 years, will suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps,” it said.

There has been widespread discontent and open protests throughout the country and even abroad against the CAA, NRC and NPR, which are “forecasting a systematic erosion of values, principles and rights” that have been guaranteed to all citizens in the Constitution, the release said. Eminent citizens, including top intellectuals and legal luminaries, have taken a studied and unequivocal stand against the laws, it noted.

“We have always taken great pride that our beloved country is a secular, sovereign, socialist, pluralistic and democratic republic,” the church said. The very fact that the CAA uses religion goes against the secular fabric of the country, it said.

“It goes against the spirit and heritage of our land which, since time immemorial, has been a welcoming home to all, founded on the belief that the whole world is one big family,” it said.

However, Mr. Sawaikar questioned the Archbishop’s reasons for opposing the Act and tweeted, “Archbishop says that #CAA should be withdrawn as it is being opposed. My question is Why? When Crores of people are supporting #CAA, including Goans.

95,2020/02/10,India-Bangladesh rail link to be ready by 2021,"The landmark rail line to connect the northeastern region with Bangladesh will be ready by the end of 2021, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Sunday.

Mr. Singh said the completion of the line between Agartala in Tripura and Akhaura in Bangladesh would pave the way for the first train to run from the northeastern region to Bangladesh on the eve of the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022. The line between Agartala and Akhaura would be completed before the end of next year, he said.

Briefing journalists of about some of the upcoming projects in the region, Mr. Singh, Minister for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), said the Ministry would bear the cost of laying the 5.46-km track on the Indian side and the cost of the 10.6-km track on the Bangladesh side was being borne by the Ministry of External Affairs. The link will connect Gangasagar in Bangladesh to Nischintapur in India and from there to Agartala.

Land handed over

Mr. Singh said land had been bought and handed over to the executing agencies in both countries, and ₹580 crore had been sanctioned for the work on the Indian side. The soil condition on the Indian side is soft, therefore the latest technology was being used.

97,2020/02/10,nCoV scare: Goa tourism industry puts Chinese team’s visit on hold,"A Chinese delegation’s visit to Goa has been put on hold by tourism industry stakeholders in view of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the neighbouring country, an official said on Sunday.

The delegation, comprising photographers, models, online and offline booking experts, and marketing strategists from China, was supposed to arrive on Sunday, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias told PTI.

“But their visit has been now put on hold in view of the present situation following the outbreak of the nCoV in China. The delegation was part of a marketing strategy planned by Goa tourism industry stakeholders to attract visitors from China,” Mr. Messias said.

Goa has been eyeing Chinese markets to salvage its sagging international tourism industry.

A delegation from the coastal State participated in a travel mart last month in China’s Chengdu city.

There were also plans to market Goa as a tourist destination in China’s prominent cities like Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, Mr. Messias said. “But the plans have now been put on hold till the nCoV scare is there. Once it is over, we will resume our promotions in China,” he said.

Former TTAG president Ralf D’Souza, who also runs a chain of hotels in Goa, claimed that highest footfall in any tourist destination across the world are from India and China.

“Goa’s tourism industry also sees a huge potential from China, but due to the coronavirus scare, we have to keep our promotional activities in the neighbouring country on hold,” he said.

Goa attracts nearly four lakh foreign visitors annually, including from destinations like the U.K. and the U.S.. The death toll in China’s coronavirus outbreak rose to 811 on Sunday, while over 37,000 people have been confirmed as infected with the deadly virus.

98,2020/02/10,"One killed, three injured in Bihar road accident","A woman was killed and three others injured after a pick-up van carrying them collided head-on with a truck in Bihar’s Begusarai district on Sunday morning, police said.

The incident happened on NH 28 near Malti village under the jurisdiction of Phulwariya police station of the district, the police said.

99,2020/02/10,"Amid exodus of Muslim members, M.P. BJP reaches out to them","The BJP’s insouciant response to minority members quitting in droves over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a challenge it is grappling with in Madhya Pradesh, has propelled a spiralling spate of resignations showing no signs of abatement. But faced with a sturdy Congress government treading cautiously on policy matters, recent setback in the Jhabua Assembly byelection and its inability to whip up a sustainable offensive, the BJP has shed its reluctance to soothe minority members, with the exigency of the local body elections this month in view.

During January, the BJP’s State unit remained in denial mode, looking away from simmering resentment among its Muslim members — snubbed for flagging their exclusion from awareness drives on the contentious law, communal remarks during rallies and ignoring of complaints. A sense of betrayal gradually sank in, resulting in more than a thousand resignations in Indore, Bhopal, Khargone, Guna and Satna districts. The biggest shocker was Jabalpur, where 700 members quit, virtually dissolving the cell.

Different response

On Saturday, however, when the party’s only Muslim corporator in Indore quit over the CAA, its response was different. “If not the backbone, the cell is a major wing of the party. Several leaders have called me and are ready to talk. They said all differences could be resolved amicably,” Usman Patel, a member for 40 years, told The Hindu. This contrasts with the party’s dismissive response to the resignations of cell’s State secretary Akram Khan and media chief Javed Baig, who claimed even the State party president ignored complaints, and democracy was subverted within the party.

Urdu pamphlets

Moreover, State BJP media chief Lokendra Parashar confirmed that besides Hindi, the party would now distribute CAA pamphlets in Urdu too. “Muslims are being misled. Therefore it’s important to convince their elderly, who make decisions for the community and read Urdu,” he said. From February 3, the minority cell began hearing out its grassroots workers, explaining the law to them, as “if we don’t understand the law ourselves, how will we make others aware?” said the cell’s vice-president Nasir Shah.

However, the Muslim retreat would not hurt BJP’s electoral prospects in the local elections, believes Yatindra Singh Sisodia, Director, Madhya Pradesh Institute of Social Science Research. “Muslim population is concentrated in certain pockets of urban areas. The BJP didn’t enjoy popular support from the community even before the CAA, which may in fact have consolidated its vote against it,” he explained.

Local issues

As for political dividends for the BJP owing to a possible polarisation on religious lines after the minority members quit, he said elections to panchayats and urban bodies were fought primarily on local issues instead. “Candidates contest panchayat elections without using the symbol of a political party yet are endorsed by them. In Madhya Pradesh, the pattern largely has been that results of the Assembly elections are replicated in local elections,” he said.

Loan waiver

“The smaller the electoral college, the more personality-centric the contest,” said Rasheed Kidwai, Visiting Fellow, the Observer Research Foundation. “Farmers, irrespective of their religious identity, at present feel the pinch due to an incomplete loan waiver promised by the Congress in the State.”

A virtual two-party system in the State however, added Mr. Kidwai, forecloses the BJP option for Muslim aspirants now. “Unhappy with one party, aspirants switch to the other party. It’s not a decision taken on ideology, but on exigency. There was a time when the BJP had more than a 100 corporators in the State. Muslims have a sizable population in cities like Indore, Bhopal, Burhanpur and Jabalpur, therefore religion will be a factor nonetheless,” he said.

At present, the BJP controls all the 16 Municipal Corporations, while the Congress leads in 23 of the 98 Municipal Councils. With no Mayor to call its own, the Congress government last year amended rules to allow indirect elections to the posts of Mayor and president of smaller civic bodies, claiming direct elections meant incongruence between the functioning of Mayors and corporators.

Meetings held

BJP State president and MP Rakesh Singh, who earlier downplayed the exit of minority members from the party, on Sunday said, “We held meetings with them to assure them Muslims won’t be affected by the CAA. Home Minister Amit Shah during a rally in Jabalpur had stated the law will be implemented no matter what and had assured Muslims too. Anyway, no one can convince those who have made up their mind about leaving.”

Furthermore, Mr. Singh discredited reports of thousands of members resigning from the party, refusing to recognise them as members in the first place. “In Jabalpur, the cell didn’t have 700 members. And in Indore, the same people staged resignations more than once.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amid-exodus-of-muslim-members-mp-bjp-reaches-out-to-them/article30779388.ece

101,2020/02/10,No tally of govt. buildings to be made accessible,"Four years after the Accessible India Campaign was launched to make public offices, transport and websites accessible to persons with disabilities (PwD), officials said at a recent review meeting said the number of buildings of the Central Public Works Department across the country, and websites of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) were not known.

During the review by Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot on December 19, 2019, a Department of Empowerment of PwD official said the “total buildings either under maintenance or owned by CPWD are not known”, minutes of the meeting recorded. All these buildings, along with other projects being implemented by other Ministries, are supposed to be made accessible by March 2020.

An official of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under which the CPWD operates, said 787 out of 889 buildings had been made accessible so far, while approval for 13 buildings had been received from various Ministries and work would be started. “For remaining 89 buildings, approval of respective Ministries is still awaited,” the minutes said.

On government websites, Mr. Gehlot reiterated the target of making at least 50% of the sites accessible.

“However, the quantum of websites i.e. total no. of government websites is not known,” the minutes said, adding that Mr. Gehlot directed the MeitY to find out the total number of the Central and State government websites.

With regard to transportation, the Minister noted that while there had been progress on making airports accessible, all aspects of air travel, including aircraft and buses used to ferry passengers from terminals, needed to be compatible.

An official of the Civil Aviation Ministry said all 35 international airports and 55 domestic airports under the Airports Authority of India had been made accessible by providing ramps, and had accessible toilets and provision for audio and Braille commands in lifts. A Railways official said 7,000 wheelchairs had been provided at major stations and 22 stations had online booking of wheelchair facility.

103,2020/02/10,Sexual harassment at workplace: SC rejects plea,"The Supreme Court has refused to entertain an appeal seeking protection for complainants and witnesses in sexual harassment-at- workplace cases from victimisation or retaliation by accused persons or organisations involved.

A Bench of Justices R. Banumathi and A.S. Bopanna disposed of the special leave petition filed by Sunita Thawani highlighting the issue that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 does not have any provision mandating protection for victims and witnesses in workplace sexual abuse cases.

The court, in its February 6 order, however granted the petitioner liberty “to work out her remedy in accordance with law, including by making representation before the authorities concerned.”

The Delhi High Court had dismissed the plea in July 2019, saying the petitioner was effectively seeking the creation of a new offence under the head of ‘retaliation’, something which the Act has not provided. The High Court had reasoned that courts cannot legislate. It had concluded that Ms. Thawani’s plea was “ fundamentally misconceived.”

“Retaliation or victimisation, are only the provocation for an act of assault. If an act of assault amounts to sexual harassment, it would anyway be punishable under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace

(Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.

104,2020/02/10,"People may criticise us, but environment is top priority for Bhutan, says Lotay Tshering","Last week, Bhutan’s government took two important decisions which could impact its regional ties, especially with India. The first was to end free entry for regional tourists from India, Bangladesh and Maldives, by levying a daily Sustainable Development Fee (SDF) on them for the first time. Indians make up about 1.8 Lakh of all 2.74 Lakh tourists who visit Bhutan each year. The other decision was to confirm that Bhutan will stay out of the proposed Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement (BBIN-MVA) that would allow for transit traffic between all four countries. Bhutan joined the meeting of the BBIN, but only as an observer.

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering explained the decisions, emphasizing that they had more to do with Bhutan’s capacity than to keep out tourists and traffic.

Does the new fee mean that you want to discourage too many visitors from coming?

Absolutely not. Actually we are trying to encourage tourists. Our policy of “high value, low volume” comes from our leaders, is because we have a limited size and our carrying capacity for visitors is limited, our road surface area is limited, and we have 72% of our land under forest cover. We are trying to enhance that.

With time, we have no doubt that we will have many more tourists from India and regional countries. In the last few years, their numbers have grown from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand each year. In order to provide the value for the money they spend, we needed a better system in place. We also want to redistribute the tourists amongst destinations. Which is why the Sustainable Development Fee (SDF) will not be charged to those travelling to 11 out of the 20 districts in Central and Eastern Bhutan, while we will charge for those travelling to the Western tourist destinations.

Nevertheless, are you worried at all that the decision to levy a fee on Indians, who have always enjoyed free entry to Bhutan, will impact bilateral ties?

The worry is whether we can cater to hundreds of thousands of visitors with our carrying capacity. The bigger worry is about motor vehicle accidents involving regional tourists. In the long run, I think we will only value-add to the good relations between our two neighbours. I don’t think this ₹1,200 is a problem, given the paying capacity of most Indian tourists.

Indian tourists have been accused in the Bhutanese media of littering, disrespecting Bhutanese shrines and not following local traditions. Do you think they need to be sensitized?

These are a few isolated incidents, and our decision to levy a fee is not based on them. With this new fee and our new tourism policy we will be able to offer all visitors from the region a high quality, guided tours, and I am hopeful that such things will not happen.

What about the domestic tourism and hotel industry in Bhutan? Is there a concern that the fee might result in lower numbers of regional tourists, which would impact their business?

Yes, I think that is an important point. We are also under some pressure given the concerns of the industry, but I think these worries will be only transient, and any negative impact will not last. I personally feel, the numbers of tourists will not go down, and even if there were a marginal decrease, it would be made up by the spending capacity of the tourists who pay the fees. The main concern comes not from the high-end hotels, but the budget hotel operators and I will be meeting them to discuss how to upgrade them. We also need to redesign our fiscal policies to tide over any troubles.

Do you think Bhutan will reconsider its decision not to join the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement (BBIN-MVA)?

Our decision [to stay out] is for reasons similar to the reasons for our decision on the tourist fee: our infrastructure does not have the capacity to allow all the truck traffic to travel through Bhutan. If our infrastructure improves, our economy improves, trade improves at some point, we would definitely want to be a part of the [BBIN-MVA], but currently given our current infrastructure we cannot even cater properly to our own local needs. As a result, we cannot consider this plan despite its economic potential for Bhutan.

As you know, we are a carbon negative country, and today motor vehicles are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. This is the reason we can’t have too many visitors, and we can’t be a part of BBIN-MVA. This is the essence of Gross National Happiness (GNH), not to measure what you have in monetary terms alone.

How do you answer critics who say Bhutan’s policies on transit and tourism are elitist?

It all depends on how you look at it. Our main objective for tourism is not to make money, but to use it as a way to build Bhutan’s brand and have visitors who wish to visit again and again. Our mountains, our forest cover, clean rivers, being a deeply spiritual country, simple and accommodative people…these are all what make us unique. Bhutan may be economically under-developed, but we give our environment the top priority. We take pride in these. People may criticise us for this, but we are committed to our policies to the next generation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jfrjg1/article30777197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBHUTAN-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/people-may-criticise-us-but-environment-is-top-priority-for-bhutan-says-lotay-tshering/article30777198.ece

106,2020/02/10,Converting wasted timber into art,"To educate the public about the importance of nature, Arun Kumar Sahu of Kanteikoli village in Hinjli block of Odisha’s Ganjam district has been converting thrown away pieces of timber into beautiful artefacts of famous monuments of the world.

“It is a small effort to motivate people to refrain from wasting any portion of the trees that are cut down for our needs. My artefacts may make some realise the importance of trees so that they refrain from cutting them down unnecessarily”, said Mr. Sahu.

The 31-year-old started carving out artefacts from disposed pieces of wood as a hobby from 2007. His father, Bhaskar Sahu, is a carpenter engaged in manufacturing wooden furniture. After dropping out from a degree course, Mr. Sahu started helping his father with the family business.

While working with his father, Mr. Sahu was shocked to find out that a large portion of the timber used for furniture manufacturing was wasted or used as fire wood. “So, I decided to transform the wasted wooden pieces from our workshop into beautiful artefacts of famous monuments of the world,” he said.

The wooden sculptures prepared by him involve intricately-scaled designs and carving. The construction of some of the artefacts like the Taj Mahal in Agra had taken him more than a year. But other artefacts, like a replica of the Odisha Assembly, took him just 20 days. A wooden model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris took him seven months, while a miniature version of the India Gate in New Delhi took him two months.

He now wishes to have a small museum to showcase his artefacts. “I want to include all the major monuments of the world in my museum to make visitors realise that every human construction in this world is ultimately a gift of nature,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iz79hy/article30779335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200209-WA0031,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/converting-wasted-timber-into-art/article30779340.ece

113,2020/02/10,First meeting of Ram temple trust likely on February 19,"The Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, established for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, is likely to have its first meeting on February 19.

Sources confirmed that the meeting would not only choose office-bearers but also elect two more members as mandated by the terms and conditions of the formation of the Trust. Some ‘sants’ from Ayodhya had expressed dissatisfaction with the composition of the Trust and asked for representation for more sections that had supported and led the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Former Union Minister Uma Bharati had also sought representation for the Other Backward Classes.

The sources said the agenda might include announcement of a date for the start of construction. The possible dates are Ram Navmi (April 2) and Akshay Tritiya (April 26).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced in Parliament last week the formation of the Trust with 15 members (seven members, three trustees and five nominated members).

114,2020/02/10,‘Decentralisation will spur economic growth of State’,"Concentration of development in Hyderabad for over half-a-century, while ignoring other regions in combined Andhra Pradesh had led to the demand for a separate State. Repeating the same mistake in Amaravati will lead to similar demands from north Andhra and Rayalaseema regions, opined speakers at a meeting on ‘decentralisation’.

Former Member of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) K.S. Chalam, former Chairman of AP State Council of Higher Education K.C. Reddy, former Vice-Chancellor of Acharya Nagarjuna University V. Bala Mohan Das, president of AP Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation Pydah Krishna Prasad, and professor in political science Ravi were among those who spoke at the meeting, organised by Jana Chaitanya Vedika, at the Public Library here on Monday.

Jana Chaitanya Vedika State president V. Lakshmana Reddy presided. Interestingly, all the speakers, except Prof. Chalam, who is from north Andhra, hail from other regions of AP, including Guntur, Krishna, and Kadapa districts. While unanimously welcoming the decision taken by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government to make Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital of AP and Kurnool as the Judicial capital by setting up the High Court and retaining the Legislative capital in Amaravati, they wondered as to why anyone should object to the decentralisation of administration, which could spur the economic growth of the State as a whole.

While Amaravati may be the centre of the State, the land acquired was not suitable for the capital but fit for agriculture. The previous government had ignored the Sivaramakrishnan Committee report and destroyed the fertile lands, which was yielding three to four crops. They appealed to the Opposition parties to stop politicising the issue and think of what was necessary for the State and how decentralisation could help in the development of all regions.

Dig at Opposition

There were 12 States in India, where the capital and High Courts were at different places. It was unfortunate that the Opposition was indulging in a false campaign that there were no such States in India. The objective of decentralisation was optimum utilisation of the available resources in all regions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/g3o7er/article30785965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11ONGDECENTRAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decentralisation-will-spur-economic-growth-of-state/article30785967.ece
115,2020/02/10,Domestic users spared power tariff hike,"In a relief to a majority of domestic power consumers in the State with a monthly consumption up to 500 units, the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has spared them from any increase in the tariff for 2020-21.

Besides, telescopic billing for all domestic consumers would be based purely on the monthly billing and not on their annual consumption during the previous year. The telescopic billing for the domestic consumers even with monthly consumption up to 500 units was categorised into three groups – A, B and C for the current (2019-20) year.

In the retail supply tariff for 2020-21 released here on Monday, APERC Chairman Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy along with Members P. Raghu and P. Ram Mohan said consumers with monthly consumption above 500 units would be charged higher at ₹9.95 per unit from the existing ₹9.05 per unit.

Revenue gap pruned

The Commission has also pruned the revenue gap estimated by the two distribution licensees – AP Souther Power Distribution Company Ltd and AP Eastern Power Distribution Company Ltd – and three RESCOs in their annual revenue requirement filed before it to ₹10,061 crore from ₹12,954 crore. The Commission said that the State government would bear the entire revenue gap in the form of subsidy given for 9-hour free power supply to the agriculture sector and other categories of consumers.

“The subsidy for free power to agriculture, jaggery farmers and rural nurseries would be about ₹8,354 crore for 2020-21, 18% higher than ₹7,064 crore provided for 2019-20. It will benefit about 18 lakh farmers having pump sets”, the APERC Chairman said. Of a total of 1,45,00,000 domestic consumers, 1,43,65,000 (99.07%) would not be affected by the revised tariff, he added. Other takeaways in the new tariff include relief to government hospitals, government educational institutions and non-profit organisations as they have been spared from the time of day (ToD) tariff and included in the HT general category from the existing LT commercial category. Free power supply to dhobi ghats would be continued in 2020-21 too.

The traction tariff for the Railways has been fixed at ₹5.50 per unit against ₹6.50 per unit proposed by the Discoms.

Similarly, the tariff for charging of electrical vehicles has been fixed at ₹6.70 per unit as against ₹12.25 per unit proposed by the Discoms. The existing traction tariff is ₹3.75 per unit and fixed charges of ₹350 per KVA.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/domestic-users-spared-power-tariff-hike/article30785936.ece
116,2020/02/10,ACB to probe police official case,"After issuing an order suspending IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao, the State government has decided to hand over the case to Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe his role in awarding a contract to Israeli defence equipment manufacturer RT Inflatables Private Limited.

According to information, based on the ‘preliminary enquiry report’ submitted by the Director-General of Police (DGP), the State government issued GO No.18 putting him under suspension in the late hours of Saturday. The DGP, sources say, in his letter has informed the government that in the preliminary inquiry it was found that irregularities and corrupt practices in the procurement of security equipment took place during the tenure of Mr. Venkateswara Rao. The DGP has emphasised that a ‘full-fledged inquiry’ into the allegations is necessary. Subsequently, a file relating to his suspension orders and also handing over of the case to the ACB were circulated the same day. “The case will be handed over to the ACB in next couple of days,” say the sources.

Though the GO has been issued suspending him, the orders are yet to be served on Mr. Venkateswara Rao, a 1989 batch IPS officer who is serving as Additional Director-General of Police. It may take a day or more as Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney is not in headquarters, sources say.

Divided opinion

There is a divided opinion among the officials on the suspension. A few argue that showcause notice should be served if ‘principles of natural justice’ were to be followed. However, there is a counter-argument that serving a show-cause notice and giving an opportunity to ‘defend oneself is not a legal requirement.’

Notwithstanding the arguments, the suspension orders are yet to be served on Mr. Venkateswara Rao.

As per the GO, the suspension came into effect immediately.

During the period of suspension, Mr. Venkateswara Rao should not leave the Headquarters without obtaining permission from the government.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/acb-to-probe-police-official-case/article30785899.ece
117,2020/02/10,Botcha refutes TDP charges on LPS,"Sharpening the attack on the TDP for what he called ‘spreading falsehood’ on Land Pooling Scheme undertaken to provide houses to the poor, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Monday ruled out forcible acquisition from the assigned land-holders.

He told reporters that the government was acquiring lands in most transparent manner. He said after forming 38 teams, comprising representatives from various departments headed by an officer of Deputy Collector rank, the government identified 6116.50 acres in Anandapuram, Sabbavaram, Bheemili, Pendurthy, Visakha Rural, Gajuwaka, Pedagantyada, Anakapalle, Parawada, and Padmanabham for acquisition under LPS after holding gram sabhas.

Mr. Satyanarayana said while LPS initiated by the erstwhile TDP government was aimed at promoting real estate business and benefiting few close to the corridors of power at Amaravati, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had introduced LPS in Visakhapatnam to provide houses to the homeless.

The Minister termed the committee, led by the then Minister, K. Narayana, to finalise the capital along with 10 members from various businesses and acquire land for Amaravati capital as a ‘big fraud,’ he said the YSRCP government was implementing LPS with utmost transparency.

He said they were offering 900 square yards of developed plot for one acre of assigned land. “We will give 450 square yards of developed plot for one acre to those in possession of encroached land for 10 years and above and 250 square yards for possession for five years with evidence that they are cultivating,” he stated.

Mr. Satyanarayana said all those who give lands to the government would be entitled with the ‘right to sell.’ He said: “we have initiated the process and VMRDA has been sanctioned ₹150 crore to develop layouts.”

Executive capital

Rubbishing the TDP claim that none sought Visakhapatnam to be made the capital, he said the people of North Andhra strongly batted for making the city the Executive capital to remove backwardness in the region.

He said the YSRCP government was firm on balanced development in all 13 districts and the reason for decision to set up Executive capital was to make Visakhapatnam a prominent city like Hyderabad and save huge expenditure on building infrastructure at Amaravati.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ti518f/article30785871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11ONGBOTCHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/botcha-refutes-tdp-charges-on-lps/article30785872.ece
118,2020/02/10,Chilli prices crash by 20% in Guntur,"While the outbreak of nCoV virus in China has caused a global scare, disturbed travel schedules and affected businesses, the famed Guntur red chilli (Gunturu Sannalu) too has taken a beating. The outbreak of nCoV has led to a 20% dip in prices, and farmers are keeping their fingers crossed in this peak season of chilli exports beginning from February and ending in May.

The year 2019 witnessed an unusual phenomenon when the special varieties of chilli commanded a record high price in the low season, when the chilli stored in cold storages is exported. The price of special variety of chilli ‘Teja’ and ‘Badiga’ touched a staggering ₹20,000 per quintal, but since the beginning of a new year, the prices are coming down.

“We have asked commission agents and traders not to undersell chilli in the guise of outbreak of nCoV in China and we warn against such malpractices. This government is for farmers and we will ensure that farmers are paid better prices,” said AMC Chairman Chandragiri Yesuratnam.

Arrivals

The arrivals at the largest market yard are just peaking at 93,000 quintals per day, but the average price is said to have slid to ₹14,000 per quintal, creating a scare among farmers.

“After many years, the Guntur chilli got a record remunerative price in 2019. But the outbreak of nCoV in China has affected exports. Though these are early days, we are keeping our fingers crossed as there is a dip of ₹20 per kg already,” said commission agents’ association secretary Kothuri Sudhakar.

India is among the leading producers of chilli in the world, along with China, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Andhra Pradesh accounts for more than 65% of chilli production in the country. Of the 11 lakh tonnes produced in the country, 6.7 lakh is produced in Andhra Pradesh alone.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/drupgk/article30785795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-vj-chilli-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chilli-prices-crash-by-20-in-guntur/article30785796.ece
119,2020/02/10,Govt. eyes 250 acres private land in village for housing,"The Revenue Department is all set to issue land acquisition notification to acquire 250 acres of private land at Karagraharam village in Machilipatnam mandal in Krishna district.

The district authorities have set a target of gathering the respective extent of land for distribution among the poor for housing facility.

Transport Minister Perni Venkataramiah (Nani) and Joint Collector K. Madhavilatha on Monday held talks with private landowners of the village here, explaining the government’s plan of offering a remunerative price if they part with the proposed land voluntarily. The package per acre being offered is 2.5 times the basic government value.

“We have explored two ways to gather the land — voluntary method with the consent of the landowner and Compulsory Land Acquisition (CLA). We have started the exercise to issue the CLA notification. The financial package will be offered as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013,” Bandar Revenue Divisional Officer N. Sk. Khajavali told The Hindu.

However, the total extent of land required for the housing facility is 279 acres.

‘Payment within 4 weeks’

During the talks with the landowners, the revenue officials said the amount would be paid within the four weeks if the landowner gives the consent.

“I had to accept the proposal of gathering the land in the village as suitable land was not available. I have directed the officials concerned to persuade landowners to part with their land. However, I do not wish to go for the CLA,” said Mr. Venkataramaiah, according to an official release issued by the Information and Public Relations Department (I&PRD).",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cl3mc1/article30785576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJLANDACQUISITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-eyes-250-acres-private-land-in-village-for-housing/article30785577.ece
120,2020/02/10,₹105 crore allocated for bridge across the Krishna,"The State government has, in principle, allocated ₹105 crore for the construction of a bridge across the Krishna river channel near the confluence point of the river with the Bay of Bengal, connecting the five islands in the Krishna Estuary to the mainland in Diviseema.

The nearly 500-metre-long bridge will be constructed between Etimoga on the mainland front and Edurumondi island in Nagayalanka mandal of Krishna district.

Avanigadda MLA Simhadri Ramesh told The Hindu on Monday; “In October 2019, I discussed with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohhan Reddy the immediate need for construction of the Etimoga-Edurumondi bridge. He has, in-principle, granted ₹105 crore for the project, realising the need of the facility meant for above 10,000 population in the cut-off area.”

The Transportation Roads and Buildings (Tr&B) Department is said to have been entrusted with the job of preparing the ground for the design and execution of the project .

Access

The bridge will provide direct access to the mainland for the people living in the islands of Edurumondi, Nachukunta, Jinkapalem, Esupuram, and Brahmayyagarimula.

In the case of Eelachetladibba, the last island in a row of these islands, people from this island need to cross two channels of river Krishna to reach the mainland by boat.

Humanitarian gesture

“The State government’s initiative to construct the bridge should primarily be seen as a humanitarian gesture, as the residents have been deprived of such a facility to lead a comfortable life for decades. It will ensure them timely access to medical and healthcare,” said Mr. Ramesh.

The bridge has been the prime poll promise for political parties that were voted to power in the past few decades. Fishing in the estuary and Bay of Bengal, aquaculture, and agriculture are the prime livelihood for the people in the islands, and many families leave the islands in search of employment during agriculture season.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/75201a/article30785544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJKRISHNAESTUARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/105-crore-allocated-for-bridge-across-the-krishna/article30785545.ece

122,2020/02/10,Uncertainty haunts Group 1 candidates,"New Year began on a promising note for aspirants of Group 1 services, but their hopes quickly were dashed as the Mains examinations were put off for the third consecutive time after the new government took over the reins in May 2019.

The High Court’s order asking the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPPSC) to explore the possibility of conducting the examination again has created uncertainty among the candidates who had qualified for the mains. Many candidates, who are keen to give a shot at the UPSC Civil Services examination are in a Catch 22 situation as they are not sure if the mains would be held any time soon.

The preliminary examinations of Group 1 were supposed to be held in March last, but were held on May 26, and the mains was supposed to be held during June 10-22, but this was too deferred. Soon after the results of the preliminary examination were declared in November last, the APPSC announced a new schedule from December 2, but the mains were postponed again to February 2020.

HC order

The High Court in its order on January 28, stayed the conduct of the mains and asked the government to explore the possibility of conducting the examination all over again as they were many errors in the question paper.

“More than 80% of 8,351 candidates, who have qualified in the preliminary examinations, will be appearing for the UPSC Civil services preliminary examination to be held on May 31. There is lot of difference on how a candidates prepare for prelims which is objective and the mains which is written and subjective.

123,2020/02/10,"Intellectual property protection crucial in knowledge economy, says NRDC CMD","National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) Chairman and Managing Director H. Purushotham on Monday called for awareness on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and elaborated as to how intellectual property protection played a vital role in knowledge economy.

He was speaking at a national workshop on ‘Intellectual property protection and innovation management for competitiveness of academia and industries’ organised by the NRDC in association with School of Law, GITAM (deemed to be university), Department for Protection of Industry and Internal Trade, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, AP Innovation Society (APIS) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation.

Underlining the importance of respecting intellectual properties, he said any violation was unethical and uncalled for. He said the country had already unveiled National IPR Policy and described how the NRDC had facilitated filing of over 15 patents for GITAM.

He said the educational institutions should collaborate with the industries and research organisations to encourage students to set up startups and become entrepreneurs by showcasing their innovations.

Mr. Purushotham said the Union Budget presented recently had promised a fund of ₹10,000 crore to encourage startups and offer them income tax holiday for three consecutive years in a span of 10 years and create a credit guarantee fund.

With the decision to set up Executive capital in Visakhapatnam the startup ecosystem in the city would get a shot in the arm.

Patent protection

GITAM president M. Sri Bharat said the law in the country should protect the patents and called for creating an environment safer for innovators.

Finding fault with some for choosing short-cut methods to achieve success, he said the education system should always reward innovations and creativity and reiterated the commitment of GITAM to encourage showcasing out-of-the box ideas by the students from Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Bengaluru campuses.

He said to encourage students to pitch their ideas and convert them into commercial ventures they had recently set up a Venture Development Centre at Visakhapatnam campus.

GITAM Vice-Chancellor K. Sivaramakrishna said innovative approach was required for everyone to be successful in a career. NRDC Visakhapatnam unit manager B.K. Sahu explained about their progress on patenting.

124,2020/02/10,Farmers allege Palle usurped land for college,"Some SC and BC farmers, who were assigned excess lands under the Land Ceiling Act in 1976, on Monday alleged that former government whip Palle Raghunatha Reddy from the TDP usurped their lands forcibly though they were tilling them till 2018.

At a press conference at the office of the YSR Congress Party here, party Anantapur Parliament constituency in-charge H. Nadiem Ahmed, Madiga Subbarayudu, Kummari Ramakrishna and others showed their assignment documents and alleged that they were forcibly evicted by Mr. Raghunatha Reddy for setting up his agriculture college in Alumuru in the district.

The farmers sought either return of the land or payment of compensation. Mr. Nadiem alleged that no permission was taken for the construction of college and an application was submitted under the Building Regularisation Scheme now. He said he along with the farmers had met the District Collector on the issue.

‘Nothing illegal’

Responding to this, Mr. Raghunatha Reddy alleged that Mr. Nadiem Ahmed was trying to get some land by blackmailing him and instigated these farmers to file a complaint against him on the legally purchased land. At a press conference on Monday evening, Mr. Raghunath Reddy said that on July 25 and October 26 in 2016 he had purchased 117 acres and 67 acres respectively from former MP Saifullah and his brother Shafiullah by paying money for the establishment of a college. He said he had got it checked in 1B, Adangal, certified by MRO, RDO and the Collector and then purchased it.

These lands were sold by one Krishna Reddy to Rahamatullah, father of Saifullah and Shafiullah, in 1939, but in 1940 he sold to another person Khan Bahadur also and later those who purchased 59.89 acres of land from Khan Bahadur had unknowingly given as government patta lands to local people when it attracted the Land Ceiling Act provisions.

When Mr. Saifullah and Mr. Shafiullah came to know about the assigned lands, they went to the court and the court gave decision in their favour in 1995 annulling the 1940 second registration. But now Mr. Nadiem, who is nephew of Mr. Saifullah, is trying to get a share in that land and resorting to such tactics, Mr. Raghunath Reddy alleged.

129,2020/02/10,Three booked for ‘selling fake darshan tickets’ at Tirumala,"The Tirumala police on Monday registered a case against three persons for allegedly cheating the pilgrims with fake ‘darshan’ tickets and extorting huge amounts.

According to Two town Inspector Chandrasekhar, a pilgrim K.P. Ravinarayan from Chennai had purchased 18 ‘abhishekam’ and 10 ‘suprabhatam’ tickets from Latik and Rahul at ₹73,000 through his relative Bharat and also had transferred the amount to their account online.

The fraud came into light on December 13 when the TTD vigilance sleuths had found that the ‘abhishekam’ tickets carried by Mr. Ravinarayan were fake and questioned him.

After narrating the happenings, Mr. Ravinarayan sought some time to verify the facts from his end and at last gave in writing recounting all the facts based on which the TTD vigilance personnel lodged a complaint with the local police on February 5.

The police after having repeatedly failed to establish contacts with all the three accused registered a case. They also appealed to the devotees not to fall prey to touts and middlemen and instead book their tickets on the TTD’s official website only.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-booked-for-selling-fake-darshan-tickets-at-tirumala/article30783731.ece
130,2020/02/10,‘Convene all-party meet to resolve capital row’,"APCC president S. Sailajanath on Sunday asked Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to convene an all-party meeting to resolve the capital row.

“The capital of the State is no intra-party affair for the YSRCP supremo to act according to his whims and fancies. The capital should not be changed without any broad consensus among all the parties in the State,” he asserted at a media conference here after a party workers meeting. Moreover, after supporting the location of capital at Amaravati during the TDP rule, the YSRCP had no moral right to change it now, he said.

The YSRCP had neither included change of capital in its manifesto nor Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy revealed his intentions during his padayatra before coming to power, he added.

Council issue

Vehemently opposing the YSRCP government’s decision to abolish the Legislative Council after it did not toe the line of the ruling party on decentralised capital, he said locating the three arms of the State – the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary – at three places would not facilitate rapid progress in the State. It was the YSR government that had revived the Council in unified Andhra Pradesh, and doing away with it would amount to an insult to the late leader, he added.

‘What about SCS?’

The State in the present situation lacked conducive atmosphere to attract big industrial investments, Mr. Sailajanath pined, and promised to extend his party’s support to the Chief Minister if he led the fight in New Delhi for Special Category Status (SCS) and for implementation of all the promises made at the time of bifurcation.

It was unfortunate that the YSRCP chief, who had asked his MPs to put in their papers for SCS, chose to remain silent now, he said.

The party would contest on its own all the seats in the coming local body elections, he added. Accusing the YSRCP of shedding crocodile tears for minorities after supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act in Parliament, party State working president Mastan Wali dared the Jagan Mohan Reddy government to convene a special Assembly session and adopt a resolution against the Act, the NRC and the NPR.

It was unfortunate that the ruling YSRCP, as well as the TDP and the JSP vied with each other in backing the “communal” BJP at the Centre, former Union Minister J.D. Seelam alleged. He asked the partymen to step up campaign at the grass roots against the “sectarian agenda” of the Modi Government and the “nexus” among these parties.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dgfs2i/article30780547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPAGE4SAILAJANATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/convene-all-party-meet-to-resolve-capital-row/article30780548.ece
131,2020/02/10,14th annual Tirupati Book Festival comes to a grand close,"Digitisation holds the key to keep books alive forever and make them accessible for generations, speakers felt at the closing ceremony of the 14th annual Tirupati Book Festival, organised by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, at SV High School grounds here on Sunday.

A. Raghurama Raju, professor of philosophy at Indian Institute of Technology-Tirupati (IITT) said that only a third of literary content was available in the form of published books, while the rest continued to remain on palm leaf manuscripts and on copper plates.

New projects

Even among the published books, a mere 40% was available as digital content and on online medium, he said, indicating that much needed to be done in future in this regard. He also referred to a project undertaken by IIT Tirupati on developing an application downloadable on smartphones that could capture images of Telugu literary content and electronically archive it on its server, capturing the name of the uploader.

Prof. Raju said it would enable people having rare books, not available in stores, to share their content digitally so as to make it accessible to readers across the globe. “Centuries-old books can be recorded and archived by this application,” he added.

SVIMS Director and Vice-Chancellor B. Vengamma, who is also a professor or neurology, explained that book-reading habit would enhance the ability to read, concentrate and retain the content.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/14th-annual-tirupati-book-festival-comes-to-a-grand-close/article30778409.ece

133,2020/02/10,Police foil suicide bid by youth at Pakala,"The Pakala police on Sunday evening foiled the suicide bid of a 20-year-old youth by reaching to him in time while he was lying on a railway track.

According to information, a team led by Pakala Sub Inspector K. Rajasekhar swung into action after receiving a call on Dial 100 from a friend of his, who informed them that his friend was about to commit suicide on the railway track near Pakala.

Quick response

When the police contacted the youth, whose mobile number was provided by his friend, he gave incoherent answers, and later, switched off his mobile.

Locating the youth at Rompicherla Cross, police rushed towards the track at Muddalapalle village and found him lying there.

Mr Rajasekhar and two constables ran towards him and removed him from the track just in time, as a goods train passed the track a couple of minutes later.

The police said that the youth, an electrician, had fallen in love with a widow of his village and wanted to marry her. As the family members did not entertain the proposal, the youth, dejected over the turn of things, decided to take the extreme step.

The SI told The Hindu that as the youth had not completed the legal age of 21, counselling would be given to him and family members and the woman as well.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar complimented Mr Rajasekhar and his team on the timely response.

134,2020/02/10,Govt. acted in 24 hours on report against former Intelligence DG,"The State government has taken action against former Director General (Intelligence) A.B. Venkateswara Rao within 24 hours of receiving a report from the Director General of Police (DGP-Head of Police Force).

The DGP (HoPF) had sent a report to the government on the alleged misdeed and misconduct of Mr. Venkateswara Rao on February 7, and the government issued orders suspending the officer late on Saturday night.

The senior IPS officer of 1989 batch had resorted to gross misconduct while procuring security equipment when he worked as the Additional DGP and disciplinary action against the officer is pending, the order said.

The government has conducted a confidential inquiry against Mr. Venkateswara Rao on “irregularities in tenders, security breach, procedural lapses, ignoring the mandatory process in tenders and other formalities in procuring defence equipment and in awarding critical intelligence and surveillance contract to a private agency”.

Officers tight-lipped

The State government is likely to hand over the investigation against the DGP rank officer to the central investigation agency as an Israel-based defence equipment manufacturing firm was allegedly involved in the “fraud”.

Senior IPS officers and public representatives were tight-lipped on the action against the former DG.

A copy of the GO on suspension of Mr. Venkateswara Rao has been sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi.

It is alleged that Venkateswara Rao wilfully disclosed intelligence protocols of the police to the company which could give access to the secrets of the State and use of sub-standard equipment by the police force could put them in a dangerous situation.

Representatives of the foreign defence equipment manufacturing company and another firm, mediators and other bureaucrats are likely to be booked, it is said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-acted-in-24-hours-on-report-against-former-intelligence-dg/article30778330.ece
135,2020/02/10,Protect the country from fascist forces: Asaduddin Owaisi,"Hyderabad MP and AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday said the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is against the Constitution of the country.

Addressing a public meeting at the exhibition grounds here, Mr. Owaisi said: “This is the first time in the history of parliament that a law was made on the basis of religion. This country is not just of Hindus or Muslims or Christians. It is a union of all the beliefs. The country also takes in people who do not have a religion.”

On the protests raging across the country, Mr. Owaisi said that the fight is to protect the country.

He added that the country must be protected from “fascist forces”.

Mr. Owaisi then elaborated the process of National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and CAA.

Claiming that the government is lying to the people of the country, he said: “NPR and NRC are two sides of the same coin.”

Proof demanded

Reacting to the comments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about how he touched the feet of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, Mr. Owaisi questioned if there was a picture of the event.

Mr. Owaisi also criticised the Delhi police for remaining bystanders while a shooter fired at the protesters at Jamia Milia Islamia.

137,2020/02/10,Most newly inducted Ministers don’t get portfolios of their choice in Karnataka,"Most of the newly inducted Ministers, who were hoping that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would reward them with plum portfolios for helping it form government in the State through their defection, were in for a disappointment on Monday.

Of the 10 new Ministers, only three got “plum” portfolios. Even among them, only Ramesh Jarkiholi got the portfolio of his choice — Major and Medium Irrigation from Water Resources.

Though S.T. Somashekhar and Byrathi Basavaraj got important portfolios, they were not what they originally wanted. Mr. Somashekhar, who was reportedly keen on handling Bengaluru Development, got the Cooperation Department, while Mr. Basavaraj, who was said to be interested in the Transport portfolio, was given Urban Development, without major components such as Bengaluru Development, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB). Though these components come under the broader classification of Bengaluru City Development, the message is clear that the party is keen on reducing the importance of the Urban Development portfolio, as even regular components such as Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB), Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), and the Directorate of Town Planning too have been removed from it.

Sudhakar speaks up

The remaining seven new Ministers did not get the portfolios they had anticipated. K. Sudhakar, who was eyeing the Energy portfolio, had to make do with Medical Education. In fact, he hinted at his disappointment by telling mediapersons that the portfolio was “different” from what he had sought.

Similarly, Anand Singh, who was said to be hoping for the Mining portfolio, was given Food and Civil Supplies, while Gopalaiah was given Small Industries, as against his reported wish for Agriculture. Shrimanth Patil got Textiles, even though his choice was Sugar.

This is being interpreted in BJP circles as an “intentional exercise” to ensure that the newcomers in the party do not get undue importance as most of them lack administration experience. “Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has kept his promise by inducting 10 of the 11 defectors into the Cabinet. But he has also put in place checks and balances by not giving plum portfolios to most of them,” a source in the party said.

On their part, all the newly inducted Ministers, except Dr. Sudhakar, did not show their disappointment publicly and maintained that they were happy with whatever portfolio was given to them.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/most-newly-inducted-karnataka-ministers-do-not-get-portfolios-of-their-choice/article30786339.ece

According to them, the banks in Mandya district have been offering crop loans to only those who are economically/politically strong. Hence, the poor farmers are not getting benefits of various schemes of banks.

The agitators urged the financial institutions concerned to immediately approve loan applications submitted through Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation and Ambedkar Development Corporation.

139,2020/02/10,IAF’s helicopter base will not be shifted to Mysuru airport: Pratap Simha,"The Centre is believed to have dropped the proposal to shift the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) helicopter training division from Yelahanka in Bengaluru to Mysuru airport.

Pratap Simha, MP, who last week had requested the Centre to let Mysuru airport function purely as a civilian facility without any defence establishment, thanked Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday for accepting his request. “I sincerely thank @HardeepSPuri sir for giving heed to my request in deciding not to hand over Mysuru airport to Indian Airforce to make a helicopter air base. It will remain a civilian airport. Thank u all,” he Simha tweeted.

The erstwhile coalition government in the State had appealed to the Centre to shift IAF’s helicopter training division from Yelahanka to Mysuru airport. During his meeting with \then Union Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had urged the Centre to develop Mysuru airport on the lines of the airports in Pune, Chandigarh and Srinagar for both civilian and military purposes.

Mr. Kumaraswamy had even reasoned that the pressure on Kempegowda International Airport Ltd. in Bengaluru would also reduce if Mysuru airport was developed. He had urged the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which operates Mysuru airport, to permit IAF to shift its helicopter base to Mysuru and even gave the State government’s No-Objection Certificate for the purpose.

But, Mr. Simha, who opposed the proposal, made a representation to Mr. Puri on February 6 to let Mysuru airport function purely as a civilian airport without any defence establishment. Referring to IAF’s reported willingness to ‘take over’ Mysuru airport for its helicopter base, Mr. Simha said Mysuru airport was currently witnessing a surge in passenger traffic with the implementation of the Centre’s Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagarik (UDAN) scheme.

He claimed that passenger traffic from Mysuru had increased sevenfold after the implementation of the scheme. “Since Mysuru is known to be the cultural heritage capital of Karnataka, passengers are attracted to the tourism experience of the city,” he said to Mr. Puri. Additionally, Mysuru is attracting industries with the establishment of IT companies and various automotive ventures, he said.

If Mysuru airport was taken over by IAF and converted into a civil enclave, restrictions like ones in place at Pune and Bagdogra airports will have to be imposed, hindering civilian passenger traffic. Such restrictions are needed for safeguarding defence facilities that will be housed at the airport, he said.

Mr. Simha contended that aviation growth in Mysuru was ‘unstoppable’ in view of its tourism and business potential.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k2ua4t/article30786023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGMYSURUAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iafs-helicopter-base-will-not-be-shifted-to-mysuru-airport-pratap-simha/article30786024.ece
140,2020/02/10,Infant ferried in ambulance from Shivamogga to Bengaluru in 3 hours,"A 10-day-old old female baby, suffering from congenital heart disease, was ferried in an ambulance from Shivamogga to Bengaluru on Monday via zero traffic within three hours for treatment.

Sudha, a resident of Belimallur village in Honnali taluk had given birth to the baby at McGann Hospital, attached to Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences on January 31. The baby was suffering from congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.

Raghunandan R., District Surgeon, told The Hindu that, to save the baby, it was decided that she would be shifted to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Bengaluru for surgical intervention and other treatment. The Department of Police was apprised on the condition of the infant. The police immediately responded and arranged zero traffic for hassle-free movement of the advanced life support ambulance vehicle that carried the baby from Shivamogga to Bengaluru. The vehicle started from here at 8.30 a.m. and reached Bengaluru by 11.30 a.m. covering a distance of 302 km within three hours, he said.

C.N. Manjunath, director, Jayadeva Institute, said the premature baby weighing 1,500 g had three holes in the heart. “But as the infant did not require any cardiac intervention right now, she has been shifted to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health for neonatal care,” he said.

Baby shifted from Mangaluru undergoes surgery

A 40-day-old baby Saiful Ajman who was recently shifted from Father Muller Medical College Hospital in Mangaluru to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in a record 4.5 hours through zero traffic via ambulance has undergone surgery and is doing well.

A team of doctors, led by paediatric cardiologist Jayanth Kumar successfully performed the surgery on Saturday, said C. N. Manjunath, institute director.

Apart from Mr. Balasubramaniam and his team of singers and musicians, singer Divya Raghavan also performed at the event at KSOU Convocation Hall in Mysuru on Sunday. Swaranabhuthi 2020 was a ‘musical evening with a difference’ as it aimed to make a difference to those suffering from terminal illnesses.

In his introductory address, Praveen Kumar, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, SVYM, shed light on those in end-of-life situations. “When it comes to end-of-life situations, what matters most is that these patients are not only suffering from pain, but are also short on time. More than treatment and medicines, relief from pain, a social support system and dignity in death is needed,” he said. He hoped that Mysuru, known for its palaces and other tourist attractions, also becomes known as the go-to place for palliative care in Karnataka.

Mr. Balasubramaniam called the palliative care programme a ‘service to God’. Midway, two patients, who had recovered from cancer, shared their journey with SVYM’s programme.

The programme has supported more than 2,000 terminally ill patients in Mysuru in the last eleven years. It began in 2009-10 and presently serves close to 400 patients of cancer, HIV/AIDS, stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy among others, in Mysuru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/eg8vof/article30785928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGMYSURUSPB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/spb-regales-crowd-at-a-musical-evening-with-a-difference/article30785929.ece
142,2020/02/10,"Chinese students have not returned to Mysuru, varsity tells DHO","The University of Mysore has told a team of senior officials from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Mysuru, that 18 Chinese students currently on vacation in China have not returned to Mysuru and they had been personally told not to return as a precautionary measure until the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) scare eases.

A total of 120 students from China are pursuing courses at the university, particularly in the Department of Computer Science, and they are here as part of an understanding by the University with some universities in China. Among the 120, 18 had gone to their hometowns in China. Following the nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, they were asked to stay back. Other students, who were here, have continued with their courses.

The health team led by District Health Officer Venkatesh met Registrar Shivappa at his office in Crawford Hall here recently to know the Chinese students’ status and to urge the university to direct the students for continuing their stay until the scare eases. Prof. Shivappa told The Hindu that the DHO and others met him to know whether the students had returned. They had been messaged not to return immediately over the scare and the DHO was told the department would be informed once they return after the scare subsides, he said.

“The university has communicated to the students not to return to Mysuru until the situation becomes normal in their country. The Chinese students here, staying at the International Guest House, are in good health and pursuing their courses,” said District Health Education Officer Prasad, who accompanied the DHO.

20 beds at ED Hospital

In addition to setting aside five beds at the ICU-type isolation ward set up at the K.R. Hospital, another isolation ward had been set up at the Epidemic Diseases (ED) Hospital on KRS Road here. “Only in critical cases, we keep patients at the Coronavirus ward at the K R Hospital and the suspected cases would be treated first at the ED Hospital ward,” said DHO Dr Venkatesh.

The nine Community Health Centres and taluk hospitals had been asked to procure protective gear for their isolation wards set up following the virus scare. Two agencies had been identified for the procurement, according to the sources.

Committees constituted

Meanwhile, four committees had been set up for training, surveillance, quarantine and IEC activities for the prevention and control of 2019 nCoV. Health authorities here said N-95 masks are necessary to those dealing with the patients or suspected cases admitted to the isolation wards and the common public need not necessarily use this for precaution.

Replying to reports on the scarcity of masks, District Vector Borne Diseases Control Officer Chidambar said, “Some precautions are needed but the three-layered masks are advised to the doctors and nursing staff treating the cases at the isolation wards. The public, if they wish, can wear regular masks for their protection. It’s fine too if they keep distance from persons coughing and sneezing, or use a handkerchief as an alternative.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chinese-students-have-not-returned-to-mysuru-varsity-tells-dho/article30785909.ece

Staff deputed from the university for exam duty as well as conveners of the centres were directed to take necessary measures.

The employees, who staged a demonstration here on Monday protesting against such a proposal, expressed their apprehension that the KSIC will end-up as a “loss-making unit” if the Handloom Corporation and the Marketing Board, which are allegedly in loss, were merged with the “profit-making” KSIC.

With 18 outlets, the KSIC has an annual turnover of ₹200 crore and was spending ₹25-30 crore for its expansion. Instead of supporting the KSIC’s initiatives, the government had reportedly proposed the merger, they said and urged the government to drop the plan in the interest of the century-old silk factory.

The employees also sought an incentive of ₹15,000 promised to them which was pending since Dasara last year.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ij851t/article30785734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MYSKSIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ksic-employees-urge-govt-to-drop-merger-plan/article30785735.ece

Kumaraswamy and his elder brother H.D. Revanna with “swindling public money without authorisation by the legislature.”

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Puttaswamy said Mr. Kumaraswamy had been levelling baseless allegations against Mr. Yediyurappa who is struggling hard to bring economy that derailed the last seven years back on track.

He alleged that Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Revanna sanctioned works worth over ₹55,000 crore in the Public Works Department without any sanction from the legislature or the Finance Department.

147,2020/02/10,Indian classical music improves cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients: Study,"While the therapeutic effect of music has been acknowledged over the years, researchers from NIMHANS have found that listening to Indian classical music has beneficial effects in improving cognitive functions of patients with schizophrenia.

The study titled “Effect of music listening on P300 event-related potential in patients with schizophrenia: A pilot study” was recently published in Schizophrenia Research, a peer-reviewed journal. The study was carried out in the Music Cognition Laboratory at NIMHANS by a team of researchers led by Shantala Hegde, associate professor in Neuropsychology and faculty in charge of Music Cognition Laboratory.

The researchers, who claimed that this was a first of its kind study, examined the effects of Indian classical music on 20 male patients between 18 and 45 years diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patients were recruited from the out-patient and in-patient clinical services of the institute. They were made to listen to instrumental rendition Hindustani Classical Raag Bhoopali by musicians Pandit Shivkumar Sharma and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia for 10 minutes.

Brain electrical activity was recorded using 32 channels through Electroencephalograph – (EEG) – Evoked Response Potential (ERP) method. “This specific method is used to study how their attention improves when they listen to music known as P300. P300 is an indication of brain activity 300 milliseconds after a specific stimulus, indicating attention and working memory. Patients also showed improved reaction time and better performance on attention tasks after listening to music. There was an increase in amplitude in the electrodes in the temporal region,” Dr. Hegde told The Hindu.

“A trend of increased amplitude was noted across all electrodes in the music condition compared to the rest condition. Mean amplitude showed significant changes in the frontal and central electrode sites. Power spectral analysis indicated a slight increase in frontal and central alpha and theta activity during music listening,” she explained.

The authors of the study acknowledged that this is a very promising finding. “Future studies on similar lines can be helpful in providing a scientific basis for music-based interventions to target cognitive deficits and emotional deficit patients suffering from neuropsychiatric conditions. Improving cognitive functions is an important part of the treatment to help patients get back to their near normal or normal occupational and social functioning,” Dr. Hegde said.

“To the best of our knowledge, no study yet has examined the effect of one-time music listening on P300 in patients with schizophrenia. So far, music therapy in schizophrenia has been predominantly carried out from a social science model targeting overall mental health, quality of life as well as positive and negative symptoms and not much from a neuroscience model targeting cognitive functions,” she added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1jakpb/article30785284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bgschizophreniacol1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/indian-classical-music-improves-cognitive-functions-in-schizophrenia-patients-study/article30785285.ece
148,2020/02/10,‘Coastal Development Authority should focus on gap-filling work’,"State Planning Board deputy chairman B.J. Puttaswamy on Monday said the Coastal Development Authority (CDA) has to do gap-filling work, that is works not executed by other departments while assuring adequate budgetary allocation to all four area development authorities in the State.

Speaking after inaugurating an investors’ meet on economic development of coastal areas on Monday, Mr. Puttaswamy said the CDA must focus on constructing minor/pedestrian bridges across the coast besides enhancing tourist facilities in the region that is known for its scenic beauty.

Stating that Karnataka has abundant natural resources on offer to tourists, Mr. Puttaswamy noted that Gujarat, which does not have resources like Karnataka, attracts over 575 lakh tourists every year. On the other hand, Karnataka gets less than 5 lakh tourists, he said, adding that much needs to be done in the tourism sector. A road map for tourism development would be laid and discussions were being held with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he said.

Mr. Puttaswamy said that during the Budget session, he would convene a meeting of heads of all four authorities, in which jurisdictional MLAs are members, and present their demand before the Chief Minister.

Additional Chief Secretary to Government (Planning and Statistics Department) Shalini Rajneesh said the meet aimed at implementing sustainable development programme of the United Nations in the coastal districts. Projects of investors, benefits to public and problems being faced by investors would be discussed, she said.

Authority chairman Mattar Ratnakar Hegde, who took charge from Ms. Rajneesh on Monday, said everyone intends to leave an indelible mark when in power, and so was he. He wanted CDA to be a single-window agency to give clearances to projects being implemented in the coastal Karnataka, besides executing several projects needed by people in the area. He urged Mr. Puttaswamy to ensure that CDA gets at least ₹100 crore allocation in the Budget.

151,2020/02/10,High schools facing shortage of science teachers: Minister,"Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar on Monday said high schools in the State were facing shortage of science teachers since the number of people pursuing pure science for their career has been getting smaller.

“We need to overcome this trend and popularise basic sciences besides strengthening the efforts being made for promoting science education among high school students, especially those studying in government schools,” he added.

Speaking after inaugurating a science interaction programme with the children of government high schools at the Vijnana Bhavan in Manasagangotri here, the Minister lauded the University of Mysore and the Committee for the Development of Science in Schools (CDSS) for their efforts in developing inquisitiveness of children in science with their activities.

The University’ decision to throw open its science PG departments’ laboratories to the schoolchildren as part of encouraging talents in science was a pioneering effort and provides a good opportunity for them to skill in science, he felt.

“We need to push science learning with greater emphasis and generate awareness among the children. By responding to their curious questions and encouraging their interest, we are furthering their drive in science. The CDSS has been doing a commendable job and I congratulate them,” Mr. Kumar said.

In his speech, the Minister cited some inquisitive questions on science raised by the children and said he was amazed by their thoughts and reasoning.

CDSS president P. Venkataramaiah sought special grants to the University from the government for expanding the CDSS’s ongoing efforts to popularise science education and expanding the initiative, among PU students.

University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar, who presided, called upon the children to pursue their interests in science and mathematics and added that the university was available to offer counselling from its expert team in this regard.

The university, which has initiated the promotion of learning science and mathematics from the secondary school level in four districts, has planned to reach the students of secondary schools all over the State by organising science interaction programmes to telecast through the DD Chandana channel, Bengaluru.

In his address, Registrar H. Shivappa sought three more mobile science labs as the university had only one mobile lab which was catering to the needs of students of four districts - Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajnagar and Hassan. “It would be useful if we get one lab for each district for promoting the activities.”

Later, the Minister told the University and the CDSS to send their proposals on what they wanted from the government for strengthening the science education programmes at the secondary schools.

The inaugural programme was followed by the children’s interaction with the panel of experts which was recorded by DD Chandana. Students from the districts of Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajnagar and Hassan attended.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-schools-facing-shortage-of-science-teachers-minister/article30782865.ece
152,2020/02/10,"Students to get textbooks, uniforms on school reopening day: Minister","Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar on Monday said schoolchildren were expected to get textbooks and uniforms on the day of the school reopening after vacation this year. A committee had been constituted to ensure their availability to schools across the State.

Speaking to reporters here, he said that till nolw the textbooks and uniforms were not made available to the students immediately after the school reopening and the distribution process used to go on till November. Efforts had been made to streamline the system from this academic year.

He said the process of appointing 10,500 teachers had commenced and the second list of teachers had not been announced for some technical reasons. The CCTV surveillance in schools will be also strengthened, the Minister added.

On the demand for removing Tipu Sultan’s lessons from textbooks, he said no decision had been taken on the issue and the committee that studied the issue had sought for detailed consultations.

Asked about the incident involving a school teacher uploading a video of a child struggling to pronounce a Kannada word in Ballari district, Mr. Kumar said the teacher had met him and urged him to revoke his suspension.

No phone use in schools

“The question is about the attitude and mindset. I asked the teacher why he made the video in the first place and uploaded it on social media. The incident shows the teacher lacking sensibilities. It’s wrong to demean somebody on their learning deficiencies,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that he has directed teachers not to use mobile phones in school hours.

The Minister also spoke about the efforts for lessening the burden of carrying books to school and the initiative called “Bagless Day”.

Ministerial berth for Mysuru

On the demand from long-time and senior BJP MLAs for ministerial berths, he said their concerns and aspirations are expected to be addressed in the next Cabinet expansion. “There are many senior MLAs and their wish is genuine,” he replied.

He favoured a ministerial berth to Mysuru which was a large and an important district. “I know there is a demand from Mysuru and I believe it will be addressed in the next expansion.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/students-to-get-textbooks-uniforms-on-school-reopening-day-minister/article30782692.ece

154,2020/02/10,"RSS activists take out march, while Dalits stage protest against them","A month after holding a protest against the proposed Jesus statue at Kapalabetta near Kanakapura of Ramanagaram district, hundreds of volunteers of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) took out a march (patha sanchalana) in Ramanagaram town of the district on Sunday.

They had to face a ‘Go Back RSS’ protest by Dalits as the location from where the march commenced has the presence of the Dalit community. The march began from Balageri and Kempe Gowda Circle in Ramanagaram town and concluded at the district stadium after passing through Mahatma Gandhi Road, Balageri, Magadi Road and Junior College.

RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, while addressing the gathering at the stadium, said that the Hindu Samaja will not allow the district [Ramanagaram] to becoming a land for converting Hindus to other religions. Strongly opposing the proposed Jesus statue at Kapalabetta, the RSS leader said that the Hindus would not rest until they built a Muneeshwara temple on the hillock.

Mr. Bhat criticised former Congress Minister D. K. Shivakumar for helping in the installation of the Jesus statue at Kapalabetta and lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

155,2020/02/10,Delay in Upper Bhadra Project leaves villagers dependent on RO water,"With the Upper Bhadra project showing no sign of completion, most families in the drought-prone Chitradurga and Tumkaru districts are depending on reverse osmosis (RO) water plants for drinking water. Farmers, have left most of their land uncultivated. This is because the fluoride content is above permissible limits in the water from borewells here.

H.V. Mahalinga, a farmer of Hampayyanamalige in Chitradurga, told The Hindu, “My wife and children bring water from the RO plant at Hampayyanamalige Gollarahatti which is 1 km away from our village, for drinking and cooking.” He has 30 acres of land, but grows onions and flowers on just two acres. “I have a borewell which provides water for two acres. The remaining land has been left uncultivated as we do not get rains and there is no other source of water,” he said. For farmers, the water from the Upper Bhadra project would mean utilising the cultivable area.

At Pavagada, a perennially drought-hit taluk in Tumakuru, farmers are in distress. While those who have stayed back in the villages of Pavagada taluk are dependent on RO plants, many have left farming and migrated to cities, to work as construction workers, labourers in factories and security guards.

Nagendrappa, a farmer of Kariyammanapalya of Pavagada taluk, said, “I have four acres of land and I am completely dependent on rains for agriculture. I have not grown anything for over six years. Now, I do construction work in Bengaluru.” He used to grow groundnuts.

According to S. Shivaprasad, president, Pavagada taluk Neeravari Horata Vedike, “The fluoride content in the drinking water of 90% of the villages in Pavagada taluk is above permissible limits. This is affecting especially pregnant women and children.”

N. Arun Kumar, convener, Neeravari Horata Samiti, Chitradurga, said that land acquisition for the project was yet to begin here.

156,2020/02/10,Non-epileptic attack disorders a cause for concern: Neurologists,"When 22-year-old Shwetha (name changed) experienced frequent episodes of transient loss of consciousness in the last six months, the neurologist her parents consulted diagnosed it as epilepsy. However, on a detailed epilepsy work up it was found that her seizures were non-epileptic attacks. She was depressed as she had been forced her to quit her job. She displayed her resentment by resorting to seizure manifestation.

Similarly, 18-year-old Asha (name changed) was diagnosed with epilepsy and was started on anti-epileptic drugs four months ago, after she showed frequent episodes of transient loss of consciousness. Despite medication, her seizures were not controlled. In addition, she developed other complications. A detailed epilepsy work up found that she had pseudo-epileptic attacks. She was psychologically disturbed as her parents had not allowed her to join an air-hostess training course.

Wrongly diagnosed

These are just two examples of non-epileptic attack disorders that city-based neurologists are seeing. Doctors say that nearly 10% of patients, who come to the neurology out-patient department in hospitals are actually not suffering from seizure disorder. “Even in the best neurology units 5% to 10% of patients may be wrongly diagnosed as suffering from epilepsy. A majority of these will be suffering from pseudo-seizures medically referred to as paroxysmal non epileptic seizures (PNES),” said G.T. Subhas, immediate past president of Indian Epilepsy Association.

“Previously known as hysterical seizure or psychogenic seizure, non-epileptic seizures (NES) are paroxysmal events that appear similar to an epileptic seizure but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of neurons in the brain. Most of the times, this happens owing to psychological causes. There is lack of awareness about these,” said Dr. Subhas, who is also former dean and director, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI).

In defence personnel

P. Satish Chandra, Senior Consultant Neurologist, Apollo Hospitals, Jayanagar, said pesudo-seizures are more common in adolescents and young women. “I have also seen some defence personnel mimicking such seizures. The cases that I have seen are mainly due to the urge to get back home and a need to get leave for some days or permanently quit the armed forces,” he said.

“Such patients usually mimic any type of seizures but convulsive attacks are more common. Psychogenic attacks may be deliberate for gains and to control their environments. They can also be symptom of psychiatric illness or depression. Sometimes it is also a ‘cry for help’ subconsciously when there is a history of physical or sexual abuse. Early and proper diagnosis is important for proper treatment,” he said.

Recording attacks

“Sometimes, even known epileptic patients produce pseudo-seizures and it is challenging for doctors to differentiate between these. One needs to be careful in making a diagnosis and the most important thing is to get the history of the seizure from an eyewitness. We also ask the family members to record the attack on their phones as it is easy to differentiate if we see it,” explained Dr. Chandra, who is also former director of NIMHANS.

“People who show non-epileptic attacks usually do so in the presence of someone and not during sleep. Also they never get injured (as they try to protect themselves) and the tongue biting is only on the tip and not on the sides. Once identified, such cases need counselling and further treatment,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/jsey6r/article24242705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THiStock-610655320,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/non-epileptic-attack-disorders-a-cause-for-concern-neurologists/article30778497.ece
157,2020/02/10,Absence of fee regulatory committee irks many,"For over a year now, students from professional colleges as well as those aspiring for a seat in one have been left in the lurch due to the absence of a fee regulatory committee.

The tenure of Justice D.V. Shylendra Kumar, who headed the committee, ended in December 2018. Since then, no committee has been in place to look into issues pertaining to the fee structure of all professional colleges, including medical, dental, engineering and allied health science among others.

The role of the committee is to prescribe the fee structure after taking into account the expenditure the colleges have borne. “The idea is to ensure that students are not burdened with a steep fee hike. The committee looks into the accounts, decides if there needs to be hike and fixes a reasonable percentage that management can hike the fee by,” a source in the Higher Education Department said.

For the 2019-20 academic year, there was no fee regulatory committee in place and the State governments and associations of different professional colleges got into a consensual agreement regarding the fees. “The fees for professional courses was hiked exorbitantly, making it difficult for students from middle-class backgrounds to pursue these courses. Managements and the government work hand in glove with each other. We need a body that will look into the fee structure at least for 2020-21,” said Aishwarya S., a medical seat aspirant.

For 2018-19, the intervention of the committee ensured that the engineering fee structure was capped at 8%, even though the State government and college managements had decided on a 10% hike.

A department source said they had written to the High Court of Karnataka requesting it to nominate a retired HC judge to head the committee. “Once we receive a nomination, we will ensure that the appointment is done immediately,” the source said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/absence-of-fee-regulatory-committee-irks-many/article30778485.ece
158,2020/02/10,Separated elephant calf shifted to Dubare,"A two-week old male elephant calf, found abandoned by its herd, was shifted to Dubare elephant camp on Sunday. It was discovered by villagers on Tuesday close to Veeranahosahalli. The authorities made efforts to trace the herd to enable a reunion of the calf with its mother. But the herd could not be traced, nor did the mother return in search of the calf after five days. Hence it was decided to shift it to the camp.

Veterinarian Mujeeb, said a reunion normally occurred within 24 to 48 hours of the separation. Since there was no trace of the mother or the herd in five days, it was prudent to shift it to the camp. This would enable the camp authorities and the veterinarians to monitor its health.

Though the calf is apparently healthy and consuming milk, the authorities fear that lack of immunity may render it susceptible to infection. A diet chart of milk, lactogen and hot water has been prescribed. Dr. Mujeeb said they had four such incidents in the last two years during which they successfully reunited the calf with its mother twice. Two calves brought to the camp were doing well but they were atleast months old when found separated from the herd.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/separated-elephant-calf-shifted-to-dubare/article30778470.ece
159,2020/02/10,‘Govt. has agreed to set up expert panel to look into landslips’,"Considering the seriousness of landslips, the State government has agreed to constitute an expert panel to look into the matter and recommend steps to be taken to resolve this issue, said Karnataka Biodiversity Board (KBB) chairman Anant Hegde Ashisar.

Speaking to presspersons here recently, Mr. Ashisar said that KBB has made a suggestion to the State government and the latter is likely to make a formal announcement shortly.

Landslips are being reported frequently from the Western Ghats region, especially during the monsoon. This issue has taken a serious proportion in the recent times leading to loss of lives and property besides creating hurdles to traffic movement. Therefore, there is an ardent need to address this problem through scientific and comprehensive methods, he added.

Mr. Hegde said that the Biodiversity Act was a strong instrument in the hands of the people and it provides for taking steps to preserve and conserve locations of environmental importance. It also empowers the people to take steps for designing programmes for sustainable utilisation of natural resources.

KBB would initiate steps to constitute biodiversity management committees in the villages, towns and cities to document biodiversity and take steps to preserve and conserve them. The Act provides for declaring places of natural importance such as water sources, lakes, habitats of birds and animals and other such locations and Natural Heritage Sites. KBB has taken steps to observe this year’s World Biodiversity Day falling on May 22 in the village level by holding meaningful programmes. Even the State level awards would be given at a village level programme, he said. Referring to the steps taken to form biodiversity management committees in the district, the KBB official said that the committees have been formed in all the 144 gram panchayats in the district. People’s biodiversity registrar has been prepared in 32 gram panchayats, and this process is in progress in 25 gram panchayats. Mr. Hegde also held a meeting with Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa and zilla panchayat chief executive officer B.C. Satish where he received information about the implementation of different programmes.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-has-agreed-to-set-up-expert-panel-to-look-into-landslips/article30778377.ece
160,2020/02/10,Kharge urges Centre to appeal against Supreme Court order on reservation,"Accusing the BJP of trying to dilute reservation provided to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other backward classes, the former Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday urged the Union government to immediately intervene and protect the interests of the socially and economically backward sections of the country.

“The Social Justice Minister and the Home Minister should come forward to bring suitable amendments to protect the reservation for SC/ST people. The Union government should appeal against the order of the two judge Bench of the Supreme Court that stated reservation is not a fundamental right,” Mr. Kharge told presspersons here.

His comments came in the light of the recent Supreme Court order on a petition pertaining to reservation in promotion in Uttarakhand. The court also said that the issue was a State subject. “Since this is a constitutional matter, it should be referred to a Constitution Bench. Two judges cannot decide on the matter,” he added.

Expressing “shock” over the judgment, the veteran Congress leader pointed out that Article 16 (4) and (4A) of the constitution was clear about reservation. “This judgment is misleading the country, and provisions of the Constitution should not be manipulated. The provisions are clear,” he said.

Alleging that these things happen whenever the BJP was in power, Mr. Kharge said that such judgments do not come without instigation of the government. “The recent judgment will have a nationwide ramification and will be implemented in Uttar Pradesh too. They are attempting to remove the rights of the SC/ST people. It is their stated objective. In this specific case, Uttarakhand advocates did not argue for reservation. They [the BJP] are going step by step to withdraw reservation in jobs and reservation in promotion. RSS leaders have also clearly spoken in the past against reservation,” he said, and added that the Congress would fight for the rights of SC/ST people both inside and outside Parliament.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1daghm/article30778349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGKHARGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kharge-urges-centre-to-appeal-against-supreme-court-order-on-reservation/article30778351.ece
161,2020/02/10,Mysuru will be represented in Cabinet in next expansion: Vijayendra,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son and BJP leader B.Y. Vijayendra on Sunday said Mysuru region would be represented in the Ministry in the next round of Cabinet expansion.

Mr. Vijayendra, who is general secretary of the BJP Yuva Morcha’s State unit, told reporters here that six Cabinet berths were still vacant. They would be filled soon and Mysuru region would be represented in the Cabinet then, he said, and added that the Chief Minister would keep his promise made to the former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who along with N. Nagaraj (MTB), lost the recent bypolls to the Assembly. Reacting to JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy’s taunt on the longevity of the Yediyurappa government after the Cabinet expansion, Mr. Vijayendra said the former Chief Minister was “daydreaming”.

Ramdas confident

The former Minister S.A. Ramdas on Sunday told reporters here that he was also an aspirant for a ministerial berth, albeit indirectly. He, however, said he would not bring political pressure and resort to other means to secure a berth.

He said he was confident that Mr. Yediyurappa would take an “appropriate decision at an appropriate time”.

Mr. Ramdas, who had served as Minister for Medical Education in the previous BJP government, hoped that Mysuru would get a representation in the Cabinet after the next expansion. People feel that Mysuru had been given a short shrift. “There is a need for ministerial representation to Mysuru from the perspective of development as well as strengthening of the party,” Mr. Ramdas said and hoped that seniors in the party would be considered for the role.

162,2020/02/10,Upper Bhadra project: Cost surges over threefold,"For over a decade, as farmers in Central Karnataka have waited for waters from the Bhadra to irrigate their land, the cost of the project has escalated steeply. The revised estimates prepared by the Irrigation Department now pegs the cost at an estimated ₹20,852 crore, a steep increase from the original ₹5,985 crore in 2008.

Incidentally, this is the second cost revision for the project that once completed is expected to irrigate 2.25 lakh hectares in the water-parched Central Karnataka districts of Chitradruga, Tumakuru, Davangere, and parts of Chikkamagaluru, besides filling up 367 tanks to improve the groundwater position. Earlier, in 2015, the State government approved the escalated cost of ₹12,340 crore for the project that had begun in 2009.

Sources in the Irrigation Department said that the time and cost overruns of the project was owing to delay in receiving forest and wildlife clearances, especially in N.R. Pura and Tarikere areas in Chikkamagaluru. “The scope of the project has also expanded over the years with flow irrigation being replaced by drip irrigation. The extent of land in the command area has also doubled,” the official said. The cost of land acquisition post 2014 has also gone up, he added.

In 2008, when the project was launched, it was only meant to use 21.5 tmcft of water to irrigate 1.07 lakh hectares of land in Chitradurga and fill up 156 tanks. This would cost ₹5,985 crore based on the schedule of rates prevailing in 2006-07. However, as the scope of the project expanded, the cost also went up by 2015 when the second revision of project cost came up based on schedule of rates in 2012-13. While flow irrigation conceived originally was replaced by drip irrigation, the extent of land went up to 2.25 lakh hectares across Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga, Davangere, and Tumakuru districts.

Besides, the amount of water to be diverted to the project from the Bhadra also went up to 29.9 tmcft.

25% executed

Meanwhile, Irrigation Department sources said that of the current project cost of ₹12,340 crore, about 25% or ₹3,400 crore worth of work has been executed so far. According to an internal document, work on the Upper Bhadra project phase-I of lifting 17.4 tmcft from the Tunga to the Bhadra reservoir, the tunnelling work at Ajjampura that will carry the water from Bhadra reservoir, Tarikere lift irrigation project, and gravity canals in Chitradurga and Tumakuru are currently under progress.

“If funds come on time, the project will take at least four years to be completed. We now have necessary clearances, including forests and wildlife, for the project. Land acquisition is still under way at various places,” source said.

National project status pending

As the size of the project increased from irrigating 1.07 lakh hectares to 2.25 lakh hectares, Karnataka has urged the Centre to declare it a ‘national project’.

While the State government sought national project status in 2015, it is yet to be accorded. “A proposal has already been made to the Union government and it is with the Central Water Commission (CWC),” sources in the Irrigation Department said, adding that once it is declared so, the Centre would provide a huge quantum of funds.

Sources said that projects that are envisaged to irrigate over 2 lakh hectares qualify to be a national project.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2wp4dc/article30778286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGUPPERBHADRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/upper-bhadra-project-cost-surges-over-threefold/article30778287.ece

164,2020/02/10,I’m not ready to accept post of chairperson of board or corporation: Vishwanath,"The former Minister A.H. Vishwanath on Sunday said it was inappropriate to consider a person like him who had political experience for the post of chairperson of a State-run boards or corporations.

He told reporters after casting his vote in the Hunsur City Municipal Council (CMC) election that people like him, who had served as Ministers, should not be considered for such posts.

“I am also not ready to accept it,” said Mr. Vishwanath, who is seeking a berth in the B.S. Yediyurappa Ministry.

He, however, said he would not find anything wrong if MLA for Athani Mahesh Kumathalli was made the chairperson of a board or corporation.

Mr. Kumathalli had not yet served as a Minister, Mr. Vishwanath said, and added that if he was appointment as chairperson of a board or corporation, it would help him learn the ropes of administration in a public office.

Mr. Vishwanath said he had complete faith in Mr. Yediyurappa’s assurance to him. He is hoping for a nomination to the Legislative Council and becoming a Minister by this June.

He described Mr. Yediyurappa as an experienced administrator who would present a good budget for the State, which would also be favourable to farmers. If sought, Mr. Vishwanath said he would give his suggestions to the Chief Minister on budget preparation.

But young graduates should equip themselves with the skills needed in their profession of choice,” said K.K. Agarwal, chairman of the National Board of Accreditation, in Belagavi on Saturday. He was delivering the convocation address at the 19th convocation of Visvesvaraya Technological University at the Abdul Kalam Hall.

He urged youngsters to stay abreast of the latest developments in science, commerce, humanities and the industrial sector. “You should always strive for excellence on the skill front and for creative use of knowledge. There is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence. We have to make sure that we are ready to face the entry of this technology into society. We have to develop an emotional quotient along with other skills to ensure that an equitable and progressive society is built using science and technology. According to a study, the demand for an emotional quotient will be eight times more than now,” he said.

He said that the future of the country was in the hands of young engineers and scientists. “Apart from skills and professional qualifications, they should also inculcate qualities such as commitment and social service,” Dr. Agarwal said.

Karisiddappa, Vice-Chancellor of VTU, said the university would start courses on artificial intelligence and computer science. VTU has been selected to start a course on research and technology for railway.

A new e-education methodology of using audio-visual aids is being implemented to teach graduate and postgraduate students. VTU is also starting digital evaluation and a Gyan Yaan fellowship. “A national skill development academy and a training centre will be set up. We will also set up research centres under Skill India and Make in India,” he said.

169,2020/02/10,Bengaluru police use sports to tackle unemployment and crime,"In an economy where jobs are scarce and crime is on the rise, the police are stepping in to help unemployed youth.

The South Division police, which launched sports tournaments last Monday with the aim of reaching out to the underprivileged and more vulnerable members of society, has identified as many as 200 unemployed youth to help them get jobs as mechanics, mobile phone technicians and in security guard agencies.

Senior officials hope that this community initiative will serve the dual purpose of helping youth build their confidence and not get trapped in a life of crime. “It will also help us maintain law and order,” said a senior police official.

There are three steps under this initiative: building more trust in the police by organising cricket, kabaddi and other tournaments between police personnel and local youth, identifying their problems, providing them with vocational guidance or counselling, if required.

Rohini Katoch Sepat, DCP (South Division ) said, “As part of the second step, we have identified as many as 200 youth who are unemployed and willing to work. Based on their educational qualifications and areas of interest, we are providing them with vocational training.”

She added that the South Division police have roped in the National Skill Development Corporation for this initiative.

“The list has been prepared and the initial work will start from Monday,” said DCP Sepat.

As part of the initiative, the police will identify budding habitual offenders and rope in experts to counsel them. They will be part of a mentorship programme under a senior police officer.

“It’s an ongoing process and such programmes are being conducted in other areas as well to identify unemployed youth who may otherwise get involved antisocial activities,” said a police official.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-police-use-sports-to-tackle-unemployment-and-crime/article30777933.ece
170,2020/02/10,Interest on loans for farm implements to be waived,"After three waivers for crop loans over the last three years, farmers would see another round of waiver. For, Chief Minister B.S.

The total interest on loans borrowed by farmers over the years would be around ₹500 crore, he told presspersons at Mayagondanahalli near Halebid on Sunday. “The government has taken this decision for the first time in history. We have decided to waive it. Preparations for the budget are on. I will present the budget on March 5,” he said.

Speaking to reporters at Hubballi airport on Sunday, Mr. Yediyurappa said a large number of farmers were caught in debt trap as they were unable to pay interest on loans. Waiving the interest amount on loans would give them some relief. This would cause a burden of ₹400 crore on the exchequer. This apart, the government was mulling over providing some concession to farmers who repaid loans before March 31, 2020.

171,2020/02/10,End in sight to family’s struggle to retain right over land,"It is a new lease of life for this late farmer’s family which has been waging a long battle to regain right over his land for the past several years.

A meeting of senior officials convened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday directed the Wayanad District Collector to submit a detailed report on the issues facing Kanhirathinal George’s family.

K.K. James, George’s son-in-law, along with his wife and two children, has been staging an agitation in front of the collectorate here for the past five years to secure the family’s legal right over the land.

George had bought 12 acres in Kanhirangad village of Mananthavady taluk from Kuttanadan Cardamom Company in the late 1960s. It was later learnt that the land was ‘janmam patta’, which implied it had unquestionable status.

George’s ordeal began in 1983 when village officials declined to receive land tax from him as the Forest Department had declared the property a vested forest land.

Though he waged a protracted legal battle lasting three decades against the declaration, he could not succeed. After the LDF government came to power in 2006, the first Cabinet meeting decided to acknowledge the farmer’s claims over the land.

“Though we had paid land tax for the plot in 2007, the High Court banned all non-forest activities on the land after an environment organisation challenged the government’s decision,” Mr. James said. Officials stopped receiving tax on the direction of the Forest Department Secretary in 2008, he added. In the meantime, George and his wife died.

Mr. James said he had acquired several documents under the Right to Information Act which reportedly proved that some officials of the Forest Department had forged documents against the farmer.

The meeting discussed proposals submitted by officials on the land issue. Forest Minister K. Raju, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, C.K.

172,2020/02/10,Online taxi-hiring systems have revolutionised the way we travel,"Sixty-seven rupees. That was what the ride from the hotel to the Bhubaneswar airport cost on that August morning.

Granted, the distance covered was only about five kilometres. Still, it may be difficult to imagine for most people in this part of the world that one could hire an air-conditioned cab to the airport for as little.

The fact is the online taxi-hiring system, invented by Uber and introduced in India by Ola, has revolutionised the way we travel.

Till recently though, Kozhikode could not enjoy those comfortable, affordable rides – even after the drive became smooth in cities like Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, despite the roadblocks early on.

Things, however, are changing.

Three months ago, Kerala’s third biggest city finally started using the service that caters to more than 10 crore people across the globe.

If you wonder why Uber took so long to reach Kozhikode, you would get the answer from its rival. Ola has been here since 2016. But it has been a tough battle for survival.

The taxi drivers – the traditional ones, that is – feared the online companies would impact their business and even threaten their livelihood. So, they protested.

It did not take long for the protests to turn violent. The drivers signed up with online services, like Ola and Mango, were assaulted, their cars vandalised and the employees of the companies threatened (so much so, Ola has had to close down its Kozhikode office). Not even a female driver, at the Calicut airport, was spared.

The situation was not dissimilar in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi, and the drivers in other Indian cities had also tried to resist the arrival of Uber and Ola. But over a period of time, those protests died down. The resistance from drivers in Kozhikode proved much stronger. Little wonder why Uber kept its cars in the parking space for so long.

But finally, Uber is up and running in Kozhikode. So, Ola has got company. Last week, yet another online taxi company, Keracabs, was launched at Kozhikode. It is an initiative of drivers and taxi-car owners. If you cannot beat them, join them.

The arrival of Keracabs, which was first launched in Kannur and is soon expected to be introduced to the other cities, proves that you cannot stop change, you can only prolong it.

Remember how Kerala reacted to computers back in the 1980s? There were protests, out of fears that computers would take away the jobs from humans. Now, Kerala is the most computer-literate State in the country.

Successful experiments

Kerala may not be among the States that ferry the highest number of passengers through online taxi, but Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram have raised the hopes of Uber and Ola. There is no reason why this mode of transport will not succeed in Kozhikode, too.

It is true that the city does not have enough online taxi cars at the moment. There are only around 200, while that number is 5,000 in Kochi and 1,500 in Thiruvananthapuram.

The online taxi companies estimate Kozhikode would need something like 500; they are hopeful of reaching that number as more drivers are attaching their cars to the service. But even now you would not find it too difficult to book your ride on Uber or Ola. Since there are not that many cars across the city, you may have to wait for some time on occasions.

Since the companies do not seem to be keen to invest on marketing, few residents are aware that the online taxi has arrived in their city.

But those who visit Kozhikode from other parts of India use it extensively, so do frequent travellers of the city.

It should only be a matter of time before Kozhikode also begins to make full use of a service that has made life on the move a lot easier.

173,2020/02/10,Withering wetlands,"There is nothing much to cheer about for Ashtamudi and Sasthamcotta lakes and the Vembanad-Kole wetlands, the three Ramsar sites in Kerala.

As the world observed yet another World Wetlands Day early this week, experts are worried about the state of these sites. The conservation challenges, if left unattended, could sound the death knell for these wetlands of international significance.

Seventeen years after being designated as Ramsar sites, conservation and management challenges have taken a turn for the worse for these sites. Increased salinity, hydrological regime change, pollution, conversion of natural shorelines, and rampant reclamation are posing serious threats to the sites, they say.

The Ashtamudi lake system may become hyper saline if the reduced inflow of freshwater continues, warned Ritesh Kumar, Director, Wetlands International, South Asia, New Delhi.

Over the past one decade, there has been a reduction in inflow of freshwater up to 40%, leading to increased salinity in the system. The extent of the wetland has also been reduced. Dumping of waste into the lake system is an issue of serious concern, he said. The freshwater inflow has declined considerably since the Kallada dam became operational. The reduced inflow has in turn increased salinity in the estuary, leading to reduction in freshwater species, especially fish. Abattoir waste, along with other refuse, also reaches the system, leading to deterioration in water quality, he said.

It was the Wetlands International that prepared the management plans for the three Ramsar sites, which are managed by the State Wetlands Authority Kerala. The management plans were approved by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change last year. Funds have also started flowing in for implementing the management plans.

Sasthamcotta Lake

Sasthamcotta Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the State, is better off among the three though it faces some unique challenges. The abstraction of freshwater from the lake for meeting the drinking water needs of Kollam city has reached unsustainable levels, he said.

“If the drawing of water continues at the current level, the lake system will dry up in another 10 years. New water sources will have to be identified for quenching the thirst of the city, reducing the pressure on the system,” suggested Dr. Kumar.

The increased siltation of the lake, points out P.S. Harikumar, Senior Principal Scientist of the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, Kozhikode, has resulted in the reduction of capacity of the lake. The discharge of freshwater into the system has also come down.

The worst among the three is the Vembanad-Kole wetland system as its plagued by a host of ecological issues. The alarming rate of depletion of the waterbody has made ecologists sit up and take note of the emerging crisis. During the last 120 years, says B. Madhusoodana Kurup, former Vice Chancellor of the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, Kochi, the lake system has lost around 75% of its original extent.

Shrinking lake system

From its original extent of 40,000 ha, the lake has shrunk to a meagre 12,000 ha. If the depletion continues unabated, the lake will vanish in another 50 years, said Dr. Kurup, who had extensively studied the conservation and management issues of the lake system.

Earlier, as many as 40,000 fishermen earned their livelihood from the lake. These days, it has come down to less than 10,000 as most of the commercially important fish species have vanished. The lake was also considered as the biggest shrimp ground. It is no longer so. Pollution, agricultural run-off, and dumping of waste are killing the wetland, he says.

Large quantities of waste generated from the Udyogamandal region and Ernakulam is dumped into the Vembanad estuary, Dr. Kumar said. Ecological issues caused by the Thanneermukkom barrier and the impeded exchange of freshwater and saltwater in the system also needed to be looked into.

The large number of apartment complexes that have come up on the banks of the estuary reclaiming the wetlands have reduced the flood management capacity of the system. With the two back-to-back floods behind it, Kerala can no longer afford to allow such practices to continue. The Rebuild Kerala programme of the government should address such issues. Kerala should learn to respect the natural drainage and water storage functions of wetlands, he says.

At the same time, the demand to consider the Kole wetland system and Vembanad Lake as two entities for conservation measures is becoming louder.

P.O. Nameer, a special invitee to the State Wetland Authority, Kerala, feels that the Vembanad and Kole wetlands should be treated as separate ecological entities for all practical purposes of management. The demand has been put forward before the Wetland International since the original notification of the Ramsar sites for Kerala in 2002.

If the two need be well-managed for long-term conservation and sustainable utilisation of its resources, which is the mandate and motto of the Ramsar Convention, the cases of kole and Vembanad should be taken up separately.

The land use patterns of these two wetlands are totally different as the kole primarily is a paddyfield and the most part of Vembanad is a lake. The two should be treated as independent Ramsar sites and management plans prepared, he said in a communication.

The Union Ministry treats them as two separate wetlands and have prepared separate biodiversity conservation plans for them, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sdw1pr/article30786060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvPullazhiPhoto-KKNajeeb1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/withering/article30786059.ece
174,2020/02/10,Parameswaran cremated with State honours,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue P. Parameswaran was cremated with State honours at his native village Muhamma, near Cherthala, on Monday.

Parameswaran died early Sunday at a hospital near Ottappalam in Palakkad.

People from various walks of life paid homage to the right-wing Hindu theoretician when his body was kept at Thamarasseril Illam, his ancestral home at Kayippuram.

His body was brought to Muhamma from Thiruvananthapuram around 3 p.m.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan paid homage to the departed leader when his body was kept for public viewing in the capital.

Near alma mater

The vehicle carrying the mortal remains stopped for a brief period in front of K.P. Memorial Upper Primary School, Muhamma, where he completed his primary education.

Teachers and students paid homage to him.

Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, BJP leaders K. Surendran, P.K. Krishnadas, M.T. Ramesh, Kummanam Rajasekharan, and Shobha Surendran were among those who paid their last respects.

Mr. Chouhan said Parameswaran would always be remembered for his efforts for social and cultural reforms.

Born to Parameswaran Ilayathu and Savithri Antharjanam in 1927, he completed BA (Honours) in history from University College, Thiruvananthapuram, with a gold medal.

Parameswaran joined the RSS and his contact with M.S. Golwalkar led him to become a pracharak. He led an austere and spiritual way of life. The Vajpayee government honoured him with Padma Shri in 2004. In 2018, the BJP government awarded him Padma Vibhushan.

Parameswaran had served as director of the Bharathiya Vichara Kendram, a Hindu nationalist think tank, since 1982. He had also presided over the Vivekananda Kendra in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rx2a4/article30786056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvalRSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/parameswaran-cremated-with-state-honours/article30786051.ece
175,2020/02/10,"Vembanad stifling under human intervention, gasps for breath","Not less than three decades ago, local markets in upper Kuttanad regularly played host to scenes of live, loud, and fierce bidding wars between fishermen collectives.

The event used to be a good draw as the items for sale will be the indigenous fish species from polders along the Vembanad lake basin. Often bids used to attract prices as high as ₹50,000, depending on a host of factors, from season to proximity to the lake.

As time passed by, several of these markets became non-existent, so do the auctions they played host to.

For the majority who depend on it, Vembanad Lake now provides no more than a meagre living as the fish wealth is getting depleted by about 7,500 tonnes every year. As per estimates, about six to seven lakh people are dependent on the lake system for a living even as the number of fish species has declined markedly over the years.

The annual Vembanad Fish Count (VFC) conducted by the Ashoka Trust For Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), in collaboration with the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, in the past two years noted a steady decline in diversity of almost all kinds of fin and shell fishes.

Fall in fish species

While the VFC in 2018, carried out at six locations - three each on the north and south of the Thannermukkom bund- recorded 117 fish species, the number fell to 98 last year. Of the total species spotted in 2019, 50 were found in the northern side and 48 in the other.

“Even if seasonal and spatial factors are to be considered, the difference is huge when compared to the 153 species recorded in a study in 1980,” explained Anu Radhakrishnan, programme officer of ATREE.

This sharp fall is primarily attributed to the annual closure of the bund, which causes disruptions in the hydrological cycle, sedimentation, and compromises migration of fish from the ocean.

“The silt that reaches the lake bed through the river affects organisms in the deeper habitats, forcing them to move out . Adding to this is the widespread use of stake net in the Kochi side during high tide, which scoops up even the brooding organisms,” added Mr.Radhakrishnan.

Of greater concern are the unrestrained extraction of the fishery and high toxic situations caused by agro-chemicals in the run-off water and petrochemical exhausts from boats, leading to biodiversity loss.

A recent study by the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies in the 76.5 sq km Alappuzha-Thannermukkom sector of Vembanad reported 4,276 tonne of plastic garbage in the bottom sediments, which works out to 55.9 tonne per sq/km.

Shrinking depth profile

The study also pointed to the shrinking depth profile of the lake, from eight to nine metres in 1930s to the present 1.6 to 4.5 metres.

As Vembanad, stifling under human intervention, gasps for breath, experts have called for urgent intervention by the authorities concerned in conserving the wetland system, which covers an area of over 2,033.02 sq km.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nouvht/article30786052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvVembanadLake,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vembanad-stifling-under-human-intervention-gasps-for-breath/article30786050.ece
176,2020/02/10,Car theft probe leads to ‘terror link’,"A couple of days ago, the Kottayam West police busted a car theft racket and arrested two youths. The accused, Illyas (37), a native of Vadanappally in Thrissur, and K.A. Nishad (37) from Aluva, used to hire luxury cars using fake identity documents and sell them.

“They would approach vehicle owners through online portals and hire vehicles giving forged documents. We zeroed in on them while probing a case in connection with the theft of a luxury car from Kottayam,” said a police officer.

On identifying the accused, the police laid a trap giving an online advertisement seeking to rent out luxury cars in Pathanamthitta. “One of the accused approached us in the guise of hiring a luxury car, who was later taken into custody from Thiruvalla. Based on his statement, the second accused too was picked up,” the officer said.

Crime network

An investigation, however, blew the lid off a crime network supposedly having links with radical organisations. “All the cars they had taken possession of defrauding vehicle owners were sold to Muhammad Rafique, aka Bhai Rafique, a native of Coimbatore. An investigation showed that this man had been the member of a banned terror organisation and was convicted in the Coimbatore bomb blasts case. A search is on to trace Rafique and the cars he had purchased from the accused,” a top officer said.

The accused have confessed to have supplied at least 11 cars and a two-wheeler to Rafique. There is, however, no clarity as to the purpose for which he purchased the car.

The police, meanwhile, are exploring options of charging the accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

“An application seeking their custody has been filed and a decision with regard to imposing the UAPA will be made after an interrogation to establish their links with the banned outfit,” said R.Sreekumar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kottayam. Besides the police, Central agencies too have launched a probe in the case and are expected to interrogate the accused soon.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/car-theft-probe-leads-to-terror-link/article30786039.ece
177,2020/02/10,Greens weary of saline incursion,"Last month, inland fishers found parts of Ashtamudi teeming with mackerels, a surprise spotting that was first considered more of an accident. But the shoal did not vanish, and the fact that it remained in the brackish water for several days indicates an alarming change in the wetland ecosystem — escalating salinity of water.

With a considerable dip in the piscean population and its clam beds shrinking fast, the protected Ramsar site of Ashtamudi is already a matter of serious concern for environmentalists and authorities alike.

“Saline incursion during high tide makes it possible for marine shoals, especially pelagic ones, to survive. Some years back, oil sardines entered Ashatamudi and stayed there for some six months. Usually, marine varieties cannot survive in low-salinity levels, but now the water has become similar to that of the sea. If the marine regime continues, the entire aquatic environment will be affected,” says K.K. Appukuttan, marine fisheries expert and former scientist with Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).

While the increasing salinity and the presence of marine fauna will drive some estuarine fish species to the upper reaches of the lake, some others will perish. “But there are also some inland species that can tolerate both conditions and they will survive. At the same time, there can be competition for food among plankton feeders,” he says.

Freshwater inflow down

Over the years, the salinity of the water has steadily increased, mainly owing to the blocked inflow of freshwater after the construction of the Kallada dam.

Another major threat faced by Ashtamudi now is the presence of an invasive bivalve from South America. It started appearing in Vemband during early 2019 and currently it has colonised many creeks in Ashtamudi. The bivalves are around two centimetres long with very little meat, but they have been monopolising and altering the habitat.

“They are slowly eradicating the stock of Ashatmudi’s short-necked clam (Paphia malabarica), the only Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery in India. This year, the proper settlement of the clam has not taken place so far and one reason can be this invasive species. They have occupied the entire area and there is no space left for the Paphia malabarica larvae to settle,” he says.

Invasive bivalves

Though the invasive bivalves are edible with a chemical composition being almost similar to that of native ones, meat percentage and market value are low. “They must have reached Indian ports attached to ship hulls, but they multiply fast. They start early spawning and cover the area like a carpet, blocking the settlement of native clams and mussels. They can also cause a deficit of microalgae, the main food.”

It is not easy to control the new menace as the bivalve spreads too fast and has high tolerance threshold.

The variation in salinity level and the presence of invasive species can also affect the fish sanctuaries being set up in Ashtamudi and Vembanad by the Fisheries Department as part of a project to revive the inland fisheries sector. The department had identified a number of sites to conserve pearl spot and yellow clam, but the recent changes in the habitat may not be ideal for fish seed ranching and clam relaying.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cqxi6m/article30786040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvAshtamudiLake2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/greens-weary-of-saline-incursion/article30786037.ece
178,2020/02/10,Scheme for self-sufficiency in vegetables,"The government will come out with a scheme involving the Agriculture, Health, and Local Self-Government Departments to make the State self-sufficient in vegetables in 470 days and to help farmers.

Announcing this in the Assembly on Monday in reply to a discussion on the crisis in the agriculture sector, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said the measures taken to increase vegetable cultivation had started paying dividends and the production had gone up from six lakh to 12.75 lakh tonnes.

The Minister said the government was with the farmers and the crisis being faced by the sector was due to the wrong polices of the Centre. He called for united action to overcome the crisis and seek the support of the Centre.

Mr. Sunil Kumar drew the attention of the House to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech that the Centre would support those States that passed three laws in the agriculture sector. The laws were the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016; Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017; and the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services(Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.

Listing out the measures taken to reduce the impact of the crisis, the Minister said the Kerala State Farmers Debt Relief Commission had disbursed ₹82 crore to needy farmers.

Trade pact to hit ryots

He said the Assembly should pass a resolution to drop milk products from the Indo-U.S. trade negotiations as it would hit State livestock farmers.

Earlier, the Opposition was caught off guard after Mr. Sunil Kumar agreed to a discussion after the issue was raised by Sunny Joseph (Congress) as an adjournment motion.

Mr. Joseph, who represents Peravur, said the rubber subsidy had not been paid since March 2019. Banks were refusing to offer loans to farmers as Supplyco had failed to pay back the banks. The procurement of cashew had stopped, he said narrating the plight of farmers. The Opposition tried hard to get an assurance from the Minister to raise the minimum support price of raw coconut from ₹27 to ₹40 and the rubber subsidy from ₹150 to ₹ 200.

After Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan rejected the motion, United Democratic Front legislators, led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, walked out alleging that the government had failed to address the crisis and check 22 farmer suicides after the Left Democratic Front came to power.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/scheme-for-self-sufficiency-in-vegetables/article30786029.ece
179,2020/02/10,Mall with all-women crew struggles to stay afloat,"A year after its launch, the Mahila Mall here, claimed to be Asia’s first mall with an all-women crew, is in a crisis as most of the 50-odd woman entrepreneurs who set up shops in the mall have abandoned it. From disgruntled shop owners to defective management, the mall has been in the limelight for all the wrong reasons since its launch in November 2018.

A venture of the Unity Group under the Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree Community Development Society (CDS), it had shops run by 75 entrepreneurs or groups in the beginning. The Micro Bazaar on the basement was the first casualty. Lack of patronage led to its closure within a few months.

Soon the exodus started. “The management failed to fulfil many of the promises given to us even six months after the launch. With little walk-ins, we struggled to make ends meet,” an entrepreneur said.

The top floor of the six-storey building is an auditorium while the two floors below were recently converted into a training centre and hostel for DDUGKY, managed by the Techno World IT group of Kudumbashree. The ground floor is fully occupied. Though the shops that remained on the third floor after the exodus have been shifted to the floors below, they are still mostly empty. Around 25 shops are still there.

Marketing issues

The main complaint is that the mall management did not take enough initiative to market the mall. “We did not even have a Christmas and New Year programme this year. This mall was like a cemetery when the rest of the city did good business during the season,” a boutique owner said.

Kudumbashree is yet to figure out a way to keep the mall afloat. “It is located on a one-way road. That could be a reason for the low patronage,” said Kudumbasree project officer T.K. Prakashan.

Huge rent

“The rent is huge. We cannot sustain it in the present manner for long. We may give up a few floors,” he said, adding the auditorium and the training centre were profitable. The initiative taken by the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, recently to overhaul the marketing model of the mall has not earned any successful results yet. While the authorities are yet to figure out the modus operandi to sustain the mall, the exodus continues.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vy3kz9/article30786020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TVKZMALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mall-with-all-women-crew-struggles-to-stay-afloat/article30786021.ece
180,2020/02/10,KER amendment row heats up,"The government plan to amend the Kerala Education Rules (KER) to correct anomalies in the appointment of teachers to aided schools has generated much heat and pitted school managers and a section of teachers against the government.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Sunday asked aided school managers not to threaten the government and that since the government pays the salaries to the staff in such schools, it could take over their managements and pay their rent. Responding to Mr. Vijayan’s ‘threat’, the managements on Monday said they too were willing to opt for the arrangement provided they get reasonable rent.

A.A. Hameed, general secretary, Kerala Private Aided School Managers Association, says the government has for the past four years been denying salary to teachers appointed legally in these schools and making them run around seeking legal recourse. If any illegal teacher appointment has been made, it should be investigated. There are mechanisms in the KER for this.

Budget announcement

On the Budget announcement for a change in the creation of a new post even if the student ratio is exceeded by one student, Mr. Hameed says the teacher-student ratio has been laid down in the Schedule of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. The High Court and Supreme Court have directed that the State government must maintain the ratio. It is in contravention of this that the government is planning to act.

Kerala Pradesh School Teachers Association general secretary M. Salahudheen says the government move would not stand scrutiny by a court of law. In many countries abroad, the teacher-student ratio is 1:20. Fewer number of students in class is necessary to ensure quality education.

Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association general secretary S. Manoj says the Minister’s announcement of an increase of 5 lakh students would necessitate an increase in teachers’ posts. However, no teachers’ posts have been sanctioned in many years. Moreover, aided school managers still have the authority to make appointments as per the KER.

However, Harikumar K.J., president of the pro-government Kerala School Teachers’ Association, says the Right to Education (RTE) does not specify the minimum number of students required to create a new division in a class. This is being exploited by the managers to create a new post the moment one new student is enrolled in excess of the ratio. This is what the government wanted to review.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ker-amendment-row-heats-up/article30786018.ece
181,2020/02/10,HC for policy on segregating Vigilance cases,"A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday observed that the government should evolve a clear policy on segregating cases to be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act and to be dealt with by the Vigilance Tribunal. The Bench of Justice A. Hariprasad and Justice N. Anil Kumar, while dismissing a challenge against the constitution of the Vigilance Department, observed that Rule 4 of the Vigilance Tribunal Rules did not empower the State government to pick and choose arbitrarily some corruption cases involving government officials to be inquired into by the Vigilance Tribunal and some other cases to be prosecuted before the Court of Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge(Vigilance Court) under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Corruption cases

The Bench made the observations while disposing of a petition filed by K. Karunanidhi from Thiruvananthapuram and a village officer challenging the corruption cases registered against them by the Vigilance Department.

When the petition came up for hearing, senior government pleader Suman Chakravarthy submitted that the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) was nothing but a unit or branch of the police force assigned with the task of combating corruption and officials’ misconduct.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-for-policy-on-segregating-vigilance-cases/article30785921.ece
182,2020/02/10,Senior police officers to ring up petitioners to collect feedback,"Next time when you file a petition at a police station do not forget to give the contact number. For, the District Police Chief (DPC) may ring up to know about your experience at the station and whether you are satisfied with the action taken.

The State police are set to introduce a system whereby all DPCs will contact 10 petitioners at police stations within their limits every evening. Range Inspector Generals of Police and Inspector Generals of Police of each zone will do the same.

Besides, the Additional Director General of Police in charge of law and order and the State Police Chief themselves will get in touch with 10 petitioners from various districts. The only prerequisite being that the petitioners should attach their contact numbers with their petitions.

Service delivery centres

The system is likely to kick in as and when police stations are declared as service delivery centres.

Apart from registered cases, the police stations across the State receive thousands of complaints every day. Moves are afoot to digitise these cases. This will enable senior officers in the force to get access to details of cases as soon as they are registered.

It is in this context that the police have decided to bring about a system of personal interaction between petitioners and senior officers to gauge the response of the former.

Based on the feedback from petitioners, changes will be made in the functioning of the police stations and the formalities to be adopted in the wake of receipt of petitions. The decision, which the police posted in their official Facebook page, has largely evoked good response with the majority hailing it. However, there are expressions of disbelief and mistrust, while some have even given a comic spin to it cautioning that senior officers are exposing themselves to verbal abuse through Internet calls by petitioners on the wrong end of the justice delivery system.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/senior-police-officers-to-ring-up-petitioners-to-collect-feedback/article30785910.ece

Mr. Joseph alleged that out of the ₹500 crore apportioned for the price stability fund, the government had spent only ₹120 crore.

185,2020/02/10,Internal assessment: minimum marks go,"The system of fixing minimum marks for internal assessment could soon be a thing of the past. The government has initiated steps to scrap the prevalent system in arts and science colleges from next academic year.

The move comes a few months after the reform was introduced by APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University.

Directives

Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel, responding to a question raised by CPI(M) legislator T.V. Rajesh in the Assembly on Monday, said the universities concerned had been issued directives to implement the decision across arts and science colleges.

Opining that the reform must be ideally replicated in all other State universities, Dr. Jaleel said he had taken up the issue with Health Minister K.K. Shylaja to implement it in the Kerala University of Health Sciences.

“The State has witnessed numerous incidents of students being traumatised in the name of internal assessment. Students must not be made to plead for the benevolence of teachers for marks,” he said.

Accreditation

Dr. Jaleel said the government had adopted steps to ensure that all higher education institutions obtained accreditation from either the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) or the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) within two years. At present, 34 of the 66 government arts and science colleges had been accredited by the NAAC. Among the 191 aided arts and science colleges, 144 had been accredited with 11 colleges graded A++.

186,2020/02/10,NATPAC inspects Kottayam roads,"In view of the rising number of road accidents in Kottayam, a team of officials from the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) on Monday inspected major accident-prone locations in the district.

The NATPAC team, along with senior officials at the Public Works Department, the police, and Motor Vehicles Department, conducted joint inspections at 25 spots, predominantly along the MC Road.

The team, led by S. Shaheem, principal scientist and head of the Traffic and Transportation wing of NAPTAC, made a primary analysis during the inspection and will submit the final report to the District Collector after an inspection by its surveying team.

The inspection commenced from Perunna in Changanassery, proceeded through Mathumoola, Morkulangara, Thuruthi, Kurichi, Chinganavanam, the four-lane road at Kodimatha and ended at Kuravilangad Junction.

Officials attributed the rising number of accidents primarily to the absence of adequate security measures along the modernised stretches.

“The design of the junctions is unscientific in many areas while traffic signs and markings have not been implemented properly at several points where byroads join the main road. Speeding of vehicles also comes out as a major reason for the accidents,” said one official.

Earlier, District Collector P. K. Sudheer Babu had sent a letter to NATPAC seeking its assistance in reviewing the reasons behind the rising number of accidents and to suggest directions to prevent causalities on roads.

NATPAC technical officer T. Ramakrishnan, Enforcement Regional Transport Officer Tojo M. Thomas, PWD executive engineers, Motor Vehicle Inspectors and others participated in the inspection. Representatives of residents’ association also interacted with the NATPAC team and aired their opinion.

187,2020/02/10,Third Eye project to operationalise soon in Kerala,"Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran told the Assembly on Monday that the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) would soon operationalise its Third Eye project. It would enable the public to report violations of rules through a mobile application.

Replying to questions by Anil Akkara and A.P. Anil Kumar, the Minister said ambulances and school buses were required to be equipped with GPS-tracking devices by the end of this month. Referring to the death of a nine-year-old student after he fell off a school bus in Malappuram a few days ago, Mr. Saseendran said the MVD would suspend the licence of the driver. School buses unfit to transport students would not be permitted to operate services. Besides, the Education Department has been urged to withdraw the recognition of schools that turn a blind eye to such violations.

The number of casualties and road accidents is on the rise in the State. As many as 4,408 people were killed and 32,581 were injured in 41,153 accidents across the State in 2019. The statistics were markedly higher than the 4,303 deaths and 31,672 injuries in 40,181 incidents reported in 2018.

Responding to questions, the Minister said while there had been an increase in the number of casualties, various precautionary measures such as Safe Kerala, which was operationalised last November, had been effective in reining in the problem.

There had been a fall of 8% and 18.8% respectively when the fatalities in November and December 2019 were compared with the figures in the corresponding months in 2018.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tixwtf/article30786800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-accident2col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/third-eye-project-to-operationalise-soon-in-kerala/article30785869.ece

SSZ nodal officer since its inception in 2012 P.D. Sunilbabu, who submitted the Road Safety Vision Document to the government in June 2017, says the project envisages a broader vision to make Kerala a safe and secure State of law-abiding citizens by 2020.

With proper planning and concerted efforts, the project could be implemented with great success.

The vision document lays stress on the importance of making people properly aware of the need to develop civic sense and a constructive mindset to follow the rules of the land.

It proposes a coordinated team work by personnel attached to the departments of Motor Vehicles, Police, Fire and Rescue, Revenue, Public Works, Education, and Health.

More agencies such as paramilitary forces, Airports Authority of India, and Forest Department could be added to the stakeholder list as and when required.

Mr. Sukumaran says the road safety aspects have to be addressed in a holistic manner by providing safer roads, imparting proper training to drivers and ensuring effective management of vehicular traffic. Though the State Road Safety Authority came into force in 2007, Kerala is yet to fix the authority of its different stakeholders.

Recruitment

The government had recruited 10 Regional Transport Officers, 65 motor vehicle inspectors and 187 assistant motor vehicle inspectors exclusively for the project two years ago, said Mr. Sunilbabu.

“Once implemented, the Safe Kerala team will effectively control and regulate the State’s vehicular traffic round the clock. As many as 85 patrolling teams of the Motor Vehicles Department and 46 highway patrolling teams of the Kerala Police will cover more than 10,000 km of road distance on a daily basis. The State is also expected to get an annual revenue worth not less than ₹400 crore by way of compounding fee and penalty,” Mr. Sunilbabu says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7uqcir/article30786767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvpt-visiondocument,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/safe-kerala-project-remains-in-limbo/article30785858.ece

192,2020/02/10,Tribespeople to help combat wildfires,"The Forest Department has spent only a meagre portion of the amount sanctioned for fire-line clearance works with a change in its approach to participatory management to combat wildfires.

An official said over 90% of the wildfires were man-made and participatory management involved tribespeople in fire-control measures. It included awareness campaigns, controlled burning, and other measures to prevent wildfires with the support of communities depending on forests.

In the Thrissur circle, it has been decided not to spend the amount for fire-line clearance as it is found ineffective in preventing wildfires. Though crores of rupees are spent each year for fire-line clearance, it has been found ineffective in controlling fires.

The official said even if the fire line is cleared, it would be prone to fire again with dried grass and fallen leaves. However, it would be more effective if measures to prevent the cause of fires are taken. As Idukki has evergreen, deciduous, and dry deciduous forests and grasslands, with many bordering roads, hundreds of kilometres of fire lines are cleared each year. However, only 10% of the area has been cleared so far in the district.

Last year, over 200 ha of forestland at Vattavada, including eucalyptus plantations, were destroyed in wildfires.

There were allegations that the wildfires were man-made and it lasted for days causing damage to wildlife.

Grasslands

It has been found that the grasslands are burnt during summer season by people rearing cattle. Such incidents could be prevented if awareness campaigns are held involving tribal communities, the official said, adding that there are no curbs in releasing funds for fire-prevention measures.

As the amount is spent among the tribal communities, it would generate an income for them. He said campaigns would be held in each settlement in the forest.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tribespeople-to-help-combat-wildfires/article30785848.ece

Libin V.B., 31, from Thrissur was arrested by the police and later handed over the case to the Excise Department.

RPF officials said the seized ganja was worth ₹8.25 lakh.

RPF officials found Libin behaving suspiciously and, on questioning, found the ganja hidden in his shoulder bag. The RPF has intensified vigil against the movement of drugs and contraband through the Palakkad Junction Railway Station, which is the rail gateway from other States to Kerala.

194,2020/02/10,Matching steps with refugees,"Riyaz Ali has been walking for the last 10 days and has covered over 190 kilometres.

He will do more of the same for another 30 days by the end of which he would have reached Chennai treading over 1,000 kilometres.

Mr. Ali, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, started his walk from Kozhikode on February 1 after signing up for Step With Refugees, a campaign being organised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an expression of solidarity with the many travails of refugees globally.

Reading about the haunting story of Eva, a South Sudanese girl who at the age of nine had to walk 12 days covering 409 kilometres to reach the safety of Ethiopia after her family was killed in the civil war, was what prompted Mr. Ali to take up the mission.

“Initially, I planned to walk exactly the 409 kilometres that Eva had to flee in search of safety but then I decided to walk all the way to the Rohingya refugee camp in Kelambakkam in Chennai,” Mr. Ali said.

The campaign, Step with Refugee, aims to cover 2 billion kilometres, which is the approximate distance refugees cover worldwide every year to reach the nearest point of safety for survival. Participants could choose walking, cycling or running, and can join the movement through fitness apps Fitbit, Strava or GoogleFit and the kilometres they log will add automatically to the campaign. The campaign also lends the participants the assistance of an online coach.

“I cover on an average 25-30 kilometres a day walking about eight hours split between morning and evening. The campaign also facilitates setting a target as part of daily fitness and then adding those kilometres manually. But I felt that hitting the road upheld the spirit of being part of the campaign,” said Mr. Ali who reached the city on Monday.

Mr. Ali’s endeavour seems to have already captured the imagination of the society with a college in Malappuram and a combine in Ponnanni approaching him for becoming part of the campaign. Mr. Ali has agreed to organise a mini marathon for them once his mission is over.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/stttb3/article30784503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TVRIYAZALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/matching-steps-with-refugees/article30784505.ece
195,2020/02/10,Koodathayi: final chargesheet submitted in court,"The special police team probing the Koodathayi serial murder case filed the sixth and final chargesheet in the killing of Annamma Thomas before the Thamarassery Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II in Kozhikode district on Monday.

Unlike the previous chargesheets, only Jolly Joseph, the prime accused in all other cases, has been arraigned on the charge of killing her mother-in-law.

First murder

Annamma, a retired school and mother of her first husband Roy Thomas, was the first of the murders Jolly had carried out to get hold of the ancestral property.

The chargesheet, running into several hundred pages, said that Jolly had poisoned to death Annamma, after lacing her mutton soup with “Dog Kill” , a poison, on August 22, 2002.

The Koodathayi murders pertain to the six sensational cases in which the prime accused Jolly Joseph allegedly finished off two branches of the Ponnamattom ancestral family after giving them poison or cyanide-laced food or drink over a period of 14 years. Cyanide had not been used only in the case of Annamma.

The chargesheet said that the Jolly tricked Annamma into believing that she was an MCom graduate. Subsequently her mother-in-law persuaded her to undergo BEd course so as to take up teaching profession in future.

Thus Jolly was forced to stay at Pala to give the impression that she was doing her BEd course. She decided to kill Annamma when she suspected and questioned her about her educational qualifications.

Witnesses

A total of 129 witnesses’ names, including the doctors who prescribed the animal poison, have been submitted to the court.

Previously Jolly had told the investigators that she was well aware of the dangers of pesticides as she hailed from an agricultural family.

196,2020/02/10,Latest test comes out negative for India's first nCoV case in Kerala,"The latest test result of the woman medical student, who arrived in Thrissur from China’s Wuhan region and was the first positive case from India for the novel Coronavirus (nCoV), has come out negative, health officials said on Monday.

Her condition was “stable”, they said.

According to the State health department as of now, 34 people are in isolation wards across various hospitals in the state.

“The blood test result of the first patient from Thrissur, from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) testing centre at Alappuzha, shows a negative result. But we need confirmation from the NIV at Pune,” a senior medical officer told PTI.

After the first positive case was reported from Thrissur, two other Keralite students from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, had tested positive in Alappuzha and Kasaragod districts.

The health department had earlier said those in isolation wards of various hospitals in the state have come down to 34.

“A total of 3,252 are still under observation across the state, of which 3,218 are under home quarantine,” a release issued by the health department said.

198,2020/02/10,"Economic, caste quota in Guruvayur Devaswom","Opening the doors of the Guruvayur Devaswom for Dalits, Other Backward Community members, and economically backward Hindus, caste and economic reservations will be introduced in the recruitment to the temple board.

The Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board has invited applications to fill 14 posts, including that of religious propagandist, medical superintendent, and paramedics.

Reservation principles would be applied in the selection process. However, the posts of temple priests will remain out of bounds for the recruitment board and it will be filled in the customary way.

This is for the first time that any form of reservation is being introduced in the recruitment to the Devaswom. The notification ends the decades-old practice of appointing employees on temporary basis and later confirming their service. The economic reservation policy approved by the State government envisages setting aside 10% seats in jobs for the candidates hailing from the economically weaker sections of Hindu unreserved communities.

Vacancies in temple rituals-related posts would be notified shortly, said Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board chairman M. Rajagopalan Nair.

Qualifications

The applicants for the post of religious propagandist, which comes with a salary scale of ₹19,000-₹43,600, should be graduates who could deliver religious talks and have an in-depth knowledge in the Hindu holy texts like Bhagavat Gita and Narayaneeyam.

The vacancies of medical personnel and paramedical staff are for the Guruvayur Devaswom Medical Centre, says the notification.

Eligibility

A candidate from the Hindu unreserved communities should meet a few parameters, including that none from the family shall be employed in Central or State government services, to be eligible for economic reservation.

None in the family shall be a regular employee of educational institutions that receive financial aid from the State or Central governments and cooperative institutions. The monthly income of the family has been fixed as below ₹25,000. The family shall not own land above one acre and none shall be income tax assessees.

For the purpose of reservation, the family of the candidate has been defined as the parents, husband/wife, and siblings or children who have not completed 18 years of age.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/economic-caste-quota-in-guruvayur-devaswom/article30778110.ece
199,2020/02/10,Health department may get a Vigilance wing,"The State government is reportedly mulling over a proposal to set up a Vigilance wing in the Health Department. By some official accounts, a police officer is likely to head the unit.

Optimally, the Vigilance wing will detect private practice by medical education service doctors, crack down on quackery and unearth ethically dubious financial relationships, if any, between State doctors and diagnostic clinics, pharmacies and health care firms in the private sector.

It will also monitor health care advertising and flag false claims aired by health care companies to mass-market pharmaceutical and Ayurveda drugs without doctor’s prescription as off-the-shelf cures for a wide range of ailments.

The wing will also prosecute self-styled healers who exploit their influence in the social media to fuel unhealthy scepticism about government’s vaccination programmes and use their online heft to drum up resistance against the State’s efforts to prevent the spread of global viral outbreaks such as the Corona pandemic.

Two-year-old proposal

Principal Secretary, Health, Rajan Khobragade told The Hindu that the proposal was two years old. The directorate of health services has a Vigilance cell at the directorate-level.

“Most big departments, like the KSEB or the LSGD, have Vigilance cells to look into complaints. The medical community is a very sensitive one. However, still, there are occasions when more than an internal inquiry might be called for,” he said.

Plaints against doctors

He said there were complaints against doctors regarding the violation of private practice ban and matters involving medico-legal issues.

Mr. Khobragade said the proposed Vigilance cell would be under the Home Department and headed by a police officer. “However, in all medico-legal issues, domain inputs will be sought from the medical community itself,” he said.

Doctors’ response

The proposal appears not to have gone down well with the medical community. Many have objected to the government singling out doctors for intrusive vigilance inspections. Some felt the government has raked up the old proposal to arm-twist doctors against striking for wage revision. A senior doctor felt the timing of the move was suspicious as it comes at the fag end of the LDF’s term.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/health-dept-may-get-a-vigilance-wing/article30778075.ece
200,2020/02/10,The morbid morality of Parasite,"Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite is a wryly detailed and superbly scripted portrait of contemporary class rage. It tells the tale of lower-class South Korean family members scheming their way into an upper-class home by posing as unrelated domestic professionals. One by one, the poor Kim family hijacks key positions of caretaking in the rich Park household.

On a technical level, Parasite is thoughtful and sophisticated. The Park family’s privileged gaze is visually replicated by the interior design of their fancy bungalow: a glass wall separates the living room from the garden, making the outer world look like a wildlife documentary channel playing on a giant Plasma TV. The Kim family’s ramshackled semi-basement flat is half-buried into a dirty street, making it look like its occupants are perpetually gasping for air. The steep stairways connecting the city’s wealthy neighbourhoods to this area evoke the discriminatory pyramid of social hierarchy.

Layered storytelling

The film’s geopolitical layout is vivid, not once abandoning optical commentary in favour of a shaky-cam treatment of universal classism. In that sense Parasite takes a leaf out of Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda’s book of spatial storytelling: The physicality of the environment – cramped Asian homes, close-knit families – is choreographed to reflect, rather than verbalise, the muted dimensions of economic and emotional desperation.

But the wide acclaim of Parasite has more to do with its interactive subversion of genre filmmaking. Genre films use popcorn movie tropes to express a heightened version of life. But Parasite is a rare story that uses those tropes to express life itself. The entire first act is semi-satirical in tone. When the Kims begin to invade the unsuspecting Park household, Parasite adopts the language of a wicked con-artist comedy. The son, who has already been recommended as an experienced English tutor, passes off his sister as an eccentric “art therapist” – armed with philosophical swag – for the youngest Park. She, in turn, leaves her panties in the car to frame the existing driver (“He had sex in my car?” wonders his employer). The new chauffeur, the father, in turn sabotages the longtime housekeeper by exploiting her peach allergy to convince the paranoid owners of an infectious disease. He then passes off his wife as an efficient housemaid. None of these plans are Italian Job-level farfetched. They are systematically pulled off by ordinary people for whom hustling is second-nature – the execution is no different from, say, Indian street-vendors trying to fool naive white tourists.

Rooted in hyper reality

Most genre movies go on to amplify the ingenuity of the rustic underdog and elitism of the one-percenters. But the poker-faced Parasite eschews moral high-ground by constantly adapting to its rooted hyperrealism. Once all the Kims are in, the film effortlessly morphs into a dark survival drama. Another movie might have commemorated their coup, but this party is cut short by the cruel parity of life. The Kims discover that they weren’t the only ones with parasitic intentions. Simultaneously, they almost get caught by the Parks who return early from a camping trip – in a scene that is both funny for how sad it is, and sad for how funny it is. There’s nothing unfamiliar about the image of a family hiding under a table while their oblivious employers have sex on the couch above them. But again, this traditionally comical moment isn’t played for crude humour. The couple roleplay as ‘homeless vagabonds’ – their version of taboo daddy-schoolgirl fantasies – to achieve loud climax, while the people they fetishise are trapped (literally and figuratively) below them.

Every scene after this – flash-floods, accidental deaths, daylight murder – is conceived to punish the Kim family for daring to make Parasite resemble a popcorn movie. A heist, after all, looks sexy on screen because it almost always fails in real life. When all hell breaks loose in the final act, Parasite wears the face of an accidental zombie thriller. Still, the chaotic comedy-of-horrors madness appears to exist within the confines of circumstantial fate. It’s as if director Bong Joon-ho is trying to hammer home the truth that reality – when viewed through the prism of sociocultural prejudice – can be a cooler genre film than fiction.

Tragicomic treatment

The difference is in the sensory response that it elicits. The viewer, otherwise programmed to enjoy a slick genre movie, is forced to think twice while reacting the same way to Parasite. By laughing at the cons, smile-cringing at the sex, clenching at the unraveling, ogling at the bloodbath: By reacting like an average viewer, one only reiterates the tragicomic entitlement that distinguishes us from the sufferers of Parasite. It only reinforces our view of them as “characters” and “devices”. The film places us in an uncomfortable position where we are in fact reacting to the morbid serendipity of life. In doing so, Parasite reveals us – you, me, ours – to be recreational Parks in a world of disenfranchised Kims.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rpfagr/article30783137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Parasite,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-morbid-morality-of-parasite/article30783138.ece
201,2020/02/10,"‘World Famous Lover has an incredible script and is nothing like Arjun Reddy', says Izabelle Leite","Brazilian model Izabelle Leite has done two films in Bollywood — 16 and Purani Jeans about five years ago. World Famous Lover (WFL) is her third film that has her as one of the lead actors. After the trailer launch, Iza — that is how she is addressed — ooks calm and happy. She doesn’t want to disclose anything about the story, as the production and publicity team has given them a brief. She recalls her landing this film. “I had left India for good — at least that’s what I thought but within ten days of leaving I got back again. Director Kranti Madhav contacted me and asked if I could fly to Hyderabad as he wanted to narrate the script. And here I am.”

Speaking about what brought her to India, Izabelle says, “I came here because my father had lost his job and I wanted to earn some money. I signed a contract with an agency and did many modelling assignments in Mumbai. I have done many print shoots before films happened.”

Having been in India for eight years, Izabelle adds, “When I look back, it’s been a great journey. When I moved to India, I didn’t have money, just six pair of clothes; I couldn’t speak English and had only faith in myself that I would get some work.” It was a quite a task for her because when she got her first film 16, she wasn’t sure if she would be an actress. She confesses she’s shy and doesn’t speak in public. When she was called for auditions, she thought it must have been for some print shoot but when she learnt that it was for a movie, she left immediately. Then the director called her agency and they in turn got in touch with her. She returned, again reluctantly, to audition.

She shares, “I couldn’t speak English, I wouldn’t talk much to anyone. When I can’t speak in English how would they expect me to utter dialogues in Hindi. The director thought I was perfect for this role. In two weeks, I worked hard on English and Hindi for 16. I got really good reviews. From there I saw I could do that.”

Telugu connect

Izabelle says it is an honour for her to be working with Vijay Deverakonda of whom she heard so much. Though she had her doubts about herself, Kranti Madhav was very confident when they took her. They shot in France for 30 to 35 days as she plays a French pilot.

She talks about the comfort level she shared with the team, “I had read a lot about Arjun Reddy and people were saying it is similar. It isn’t actually. It is an incredible script. I am aware that I am doing my first south film with a big star . I was wondering if he would be nice, had lot of questions in my head. Now I can say that he is the best co-star, he is very patient and helping me with my scenes. Once I got comfortable, it was very easy to work with the team. We would joke on sets and laugh; all that helped a lot.”

Izabelle informs her mother is coming to Hyderabad to see WFL. She says her folks back home are not at all clued into the film industry and it will be an experience for her mother.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ku72ir/article30782904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy11-Izabelle,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/world-famous-lover-has-an-incredible-script-and-is-nothing-like-arjun-reddy-says-izabelle-leite/article30782906.ece
202,2020/02/10,Aishwarya Rajesh on ‘World Famous Lover’: 'The way Telugu directors visualise female leads has changed',"The Chennai-bred Telugu girl Aishwarya Rajesh made the Telugu film industry and the audience notice her with her performance in Kausalya Krishnamurthy. Next, she will be seen in director Kranti Madhav’s World Famous Lover that releases on February 14, where she stars alongside Vijay Deverakonda, Raashi Khanna, Izabelle Leite and Catherine Tresa. She has also been signed by director Shiva Nirvana for Tuck Jagadeesh starring Nani and Ritu Varma.

In an interview with MetroPlus, Aishwarya discloses that she was signed for World Famous Lover even before Kausalya Krishnamurthy. Aishwarya Rajesh is actor Rajesh’s daughter and comedian Srilakshmi’s niece. She debuted in 2010 and has done several Tamil and Malayalam films. A natural and an intense performer, she carved a niche for herself.

On her entry into Telugu cinema through Kausalya Krishnamurthy, she says, “Producer K S Rama Rao liked Kanaa (Tamil) and bought the remake rights for Telugu. We completed shooting in 45 days and released it.”

Still from ‘World Famous Lover’ with Seenayya (Vijay Deverakonda) and Suvarna (Aishwarya Rajesh)

While she was appreciated for her performance, the film didn’t fare well at the box office. Aishwaya admits that she was disappointed, “It released a little ahead of Saaho and it went out of theatres soon. People need at least one week to realise what a movie is about to come to the theatres. People think twice before spending time and money to watch a newcomer on screen. However, people who have seen it on television recently are loving it.”

She was busy in Tamil films but didn’t get many good offers from Telugu. She says candidly, “I was doing content-oriented films in other languages (Tamil and Malayalam). Times have changed, and now Telugu directors are approaching me. The way they visualise the female leads also has changed. Earlier I guess the stories in Telugu cinema mostly required glamorously decked-up girls. I wasn’t like that.”

Aishwarya observes that being glamorous is also a difficult job, involving rigorous workouts and diets. She says she doesn’t fit into that zone. Now directors call her only if there is scope for performance.

She is game for a conversation on cinema but the moment the topic shifts to her character in World Famous Lover, she measures her words. The producer and director have instructed the cast not to give away any hints. Aishwarya shares, “I play a simple village girl called Suvarna. The other girls in the film have roles with a lot of individuality, but the audience will know it’s a new role for me. People will love Suvarna, the middle class girl in Kothagudem. Her life revolves around her husband Seenaiyya (Vijay Deverakonda).” Ask her if Seenaiyya is a philanderer and Kausalya doesn’t say anything.

In Tuck Jagadeesh, she has a strong role. And Shiva Nirvana is known to develop the female character’s role quite well, cases in point being his earlier films Ninnu Kori and Majili. Aishwarya heaps praise on Nani and says Ritu Verma also has a strong role in the movie.

How are people in Chennai reacting to her signing more films in Hyderabad? “I have been reading comments on YouTube and Instagram; there are arguments among fans whether I am a Telugu or Tamil artiste. My mother wants me to do a lot of Telugu films. She says I should work with NTR and Ram Charan. We grew up watching Telugu films, I can speak, read and write Telugu. We celebrate festivals pertaining to both Telugu and Tamil culture.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/z1tf0w/article30782745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym07aishwarya,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/interview-aishwarya-rajesh-world-famous-lover-telugu-cinema/article30782747.ece

He has become the face of independent cinema in Malayalam with five movies of varying degrees — both thematically and structurally. But the tag ‘independent’ filmmaker does not bother him any more. “People call it ‘indie’ movie until they watch it. Once they step out of the theatre, it’s either a good or bad movie,” he says.

Sanal unabashedly admits what other filmmakers might find it unrealistic, “My characters are a reflection of me. If they are good, it’s me and if they’re bad, it’s still me.” His latest movie Chola — presented by Karthik Subbaraj in Tamil — is an exposition of a system called patriarchy. Excerpts:

‘Chola’ is being released by Karthik Subbaraj in Tamil. How did this collaboration happen?

I became acquainted with Karthik after meeting him at a film festival. My friend saw the first cut and said that Chola has potential to work in Tamil, since the story takes place in the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. Karthik’s name crossed my mind and I messaged him. He really liked the movie and wanted to present it through Stone Bench Indie.

Why release a dubbed version when there is an audience for Malayalam movies here? Is it because you couldn’t find distributors?

To an extent, yes. But the Tamil version [Alli] is different from Chola. We have trimmed and made some changes, which was an experiment for me as well.

Was it trimmed because of the violence?

It’s not just that. We changed the narrative style. I have a tendency to shoot long shots. There was an apprehension that this might not work with the Tamil audience. We have changed certain things in terms of pacing. In doing so, I was careful to not lose the essence of the movie.

What is interesting about your narratives — be it ‘S Durga’ or ‘Ozhivudivasathe Kali’ — is how you eschew the traditional approach of using suspense/surprise as a factor. There are no signs for the shocking final act…

Cinema has a set template and all of us are circling through it. Someday, somebody would come up with a new pattern, which we would adapt to. I’m a little wary of following the three-act structure and I don’t succumb to it. There are efforts being taken to stay away from the usual approach.

I wanted to bridge the gap between real life and fiction. Nobody would have thought about the climax because it’s not going to happen, right? But in our wild fantasy, we might think about ‘what if’ scenarios. We are not going to kill people in real life, obviously. But we may have thought about it or casually used it in our conversations. That’s what created a spark in me when I wrote Ozhivudivasathe Kali. It started with a thought and how it would escalate into action.

Your movies question several fundamental norms of society in a bold fashion. Patriarchy is a recurrent theme that you explore.

Yes. I’m aware of it. But knowingly or unknowingly, I keep revisiting these themes in my movies. Maybe it’s because of my family structure. I also feel that there’s a lot hiding inside me. I don’t think artistes are saints, but they have the ability to find something in sadness/happiness.

You mean to say that the gangsters that intimidate the couple in ‘S Durga’ are within you?

Yes. To what extent is what matters. I’m trying to polish myself to make sure I don’t become like them. I don’t have a problem with their thought process when I write. Because that would be such an ideal world, right?

What was running in your mind when you wrote ‘Chola’?

It’s a script I wrote in 2010 and later developed with KV Manikandan. I’ve been revisiting it over the last 10 years, and it was a revelation for me every time. In Malayalam, chola means wetland. It also means waterfall. Water is one of the powerful forces of Nature. It’s beautiful when it’s calm and violent when there’s a surge. In that sense, water is a metaphor for life.

But itseems like an extension of ‘S Durga’…

Yes, it’s connected to S Durga. The movies I have directed so far have a common thread. It’s the same thought/idea that I tend to develop in each of my movies.

The trailer seems to suggest that you take on patriarchy...

It talks about how patriarchy has seeped into the minds of women. First of all, what is patriarchy? It’s not a theory, but a system. It was created by men for benefits. But it’s the women who are propagating patriarchy.

How was the experience watching the movie along with an international audience at the Venice Film Festival?

It was a 1,200-seater theatre. My sales agent gave me a warning saying there won’t be more than 100 people. She said it might drop down to 50 (laughs). Fortunately for us, over 800 people turned up for the screening.

How did they react?

Most of them were foreigners and they were in a state of shock. The movie was too harsh for them. Chola ends by asking a cardinal question and people were curious to find answers. This is why I like Kieslowski. His movies do something inwards, but there’s no rational explanation. Sometimes, I’m compelled to explain what I intended, when the audience comes up with a reading that is totally against the idea.

You have never shied away from expressing your thoughts in matters concerning artistic freedom and right-wing politics. But does that affect your creative process?

Whatever I say/write on social media is part of my dialogue and I make no bones about it. Earlier, I used to react to every issue and engage with people on social media. But I’ve stopped doing that because it started affecting the release of my movies. Even for Chola, people who like my work but don’t like me, started working against the movie. My work doesn’t define me. I’m just making an art piece. If they don’t consider it as art, then it’s very strange.

In an interview you gave long back, you had said that you would stop making indie movies because you need to support your parents. That clearly hasn’t changed…

(Laughs) I remember saying that. I have certain ideologies even in filmmaking. Cinema is the most important thing for me. Yes, survival is also equally important. But now, survival is happening anyway, so that shouldn’t be an issue.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ykmzj9/article30781966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AlliMovieStills7JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sanal-kumar-sasidharan-interview/article30781967.ece
204,2020/02/10,Oscars 2020 poll: How did The Hindu readers’ predictions fare?,"The curtains have drawn on the awards season with today's Oscars. South Korean satire Parasite was the big winner and scored gold in a few surprise categories marked by stellar nominees.

Before the ceremony, using a data-driven model that checks key patterns over the 91 previous ceremonies, we had picked the winners in four categories of the 92nd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Actor, Actress and Director. Audiences were invited to vote for the winners in the same categories using polls. Now, with the results announced on Monday, did The Hindu’s predictions fare better when compared to the readers’ picks?

Our predictions, as can be viewed below, got only two right: Best Actor and Actress, though we did pick Parasite to be a dark horse.

However, the readers did exceedingly well, guessing correctly, three of the four winners in the categories polled!

Best Picture: Parasite

It was a close contest in the Oscars between Sam Mendes' gripping war movie 1917 and Bong Joon Ho's immersive commentary on class in Parasite. Our readers narrowly got this right, with 29% voting to pick the eventual winner Parasite, closely trailed by 1917 with 26% of the votes. Joker came in third, polling 17% of the votes.

Best Actor: Joaquin Phoenix

Joaquin Phoenix was everyone's unanimous choice for the best actor award despite some worthy performances from other nominees such as Adam Driver in Marriage Story. He was the runaway winner in our poll, garnering 83% of the votes. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Adam Driver tied second with 8% of the votes each.

Best Actress : Renee Zellweger

The only cateogry which the readers got wrong was Best Actress, with Renee Zellweger for Judy beating out Scarlett Johansson for Marriage Story. Our readers tipped the scales in favour of Scarlett's portrayal of an unhappy wife whose ambitions are stifled by a highly successful spouse in Marriage Story. While she polled 53% of the votes, Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland took home the Oscar, despite only 31% of our readers predicting her win.

Best Director: Bong Joon-ho

The filmography of each of the nominees for the Best Director category will figure in many best of the best lists, leading to a really close race at this year's Oscars. The buzz was that the choice is between Sam Mendes for 1917 and Bong Joon Ho for Parasite. Bong Joon-ho was the eventual winner, taking home his fourth Oscar of the night. He polled 42% of the votes by our readers, while Sam Mendes came second with 26%.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jo43oj/article30781307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-OSCARSBONGG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-2020-poll-how-did-the-hindu-readers-predictions-fare/article30781308.ece
205,2020/02/10,"Malayalam actor/scenarist Bibin George on his two loves, and working with Mammootty","Actor/scenarist Bibin George has wanted to be an actor even as a school boy, “Who doesn’t?”, he asks. It was his ambition all through, the Oru Pazhaya Bomb Kadha actor confesses, only that he took the script-writing route to the screen which started with television. His latest release is Shylock.

In the film, he is younger to Mammootty. He is upbeat, and in awe of his co-star Mammootty. “He is another level!”

One of his earliest memories of watching a film, in a theatre, is of Mammootty’s Valsalyam. He wasn’t meeting the veteran for the first time, he had met Mammootty when he and friend/co-writer Vishnu Unnikrishnan went to meet Dulquer Salman for the Oru Yamandan Pranaya Kadha narration. “But he is Mammootty. I wouldn’t act familiar with him, when it comes to him, it is all respect,” he says. Bibin acted in the film, one of his bigger films, in the negative role.

Bibin is best known for his collaboration with Vishnu – Amar Akbar Anthony, Kattapanayile Hrithik Roshan, and Oru Yamandan Pranaya Kadha.

Team work Working with Vishnu comes naturally. We have been collaborating for years now and we know each other very well. If we have a plot in our mind, we discuss it and develop it together. We create the story together.

Acting is my interest, one is recognised — in the literal sense. While we were working in television we were anonymous, as actors we are no longer unknown. That said, the creator of content — cinema or television — connects with the audience.

The duo is now working on their next script. It is a relationship that goes back to when they were in Class 6, which grew into writing scripts for comedy shows for television channels, as 17 year olds. “Mimicry and comedy is our thing – Comedy Cousins, Rasika Raja, Thillana Thillana and Badai Bungalow – for which we wrote the script,” says the 31 year old. The contacts and connections they made on television led them to films, first as scenarists and now, actors.

Small roles came his way, and one of them, in Welcome to Central Jail, landed him Role Models and eventually his lead role in Oru Pazhaya Bomb Kadha. “Raffi sir [director Role Models] who gave me the break. One film led to another and to Oru Pazhaya Bomb...” the 31 year-old says.

The film did well at the BO, running more than 100 days. His turn has Sreekuttan, a man with physical disabilities who plots revenge, with a friend, against a cop was appreciated and got him noticed.

He is grateful to the writers – Sunil Karma and Binu Joseph – for the script and the opportunity. The response was unexpected, “Being a hero in a film! It was a dream come true.”

Bibin doesn’t see his being affected by polio as a problem or a shortcoming, “Acceptance lies in the eyes of the audience, if my work is good they should not notice any thing else. Finally it boils down to how good I am at my job,” he says. He is only too glad if he inspires people to aspire for more and not be limited.

Although he got into the business of entertaining at 17, he managed to complete his post-graduation in education and earn an M.Phil in Hindi; he also taught temporarily at a school. “That was just to put my parents at ease, for them a secure job or rather being qualified enough for a job is big deal.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b94dzp/article30780934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpbg1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/acting-and-creating-content-are-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-for-the-actor-scenarist-bibin-george/article30780935.ece
206,2020/02/10,‘Parasite’ director Bong Joon-ho quotes Martin Scorsese in acceptance speech at Oscars,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho is the toast of Hollywood now, after Parasite became the first foreign film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

The filmmaker also won Best Director, and the film picked up wins for Best international Feature and Screenplay as well.

The 50-year-old beat several iconic directors such as fellow nominees Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Sam Mendes for 1917, Todd Phillips for Joker and Martin Scorsese for The Irishman in the cateogry.

During his speech, Bong Joon-ho remarked with help from his translator, “After winning best international feature, I thought I was done for the day and was ready to relax. When I was young and studying cinema, there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is that, ‘The most personal is the most creative.’”

He attributed the quote to the ‘great Martin Scorsese’ as the director stood up to applause from the audience.

Bong went on, “When I was in school, I studied Scorsese's films. Now, just to be nominated is a huge honor, but I never thought I’d win! Earlier, when people in the U.S. were not familiar with my films, Quentin always put my films on his list. Thank you so much Quentin, I love you.”

He added, “Todd and Sam are great directors that I admire. If the Academy allows, I would like to get a Texas chainsaw, split the award into five and share it with everyone. Thank you. I will drink until next morning now!”

Bong would eventually go up on stage once more with his team to receive Best Picture as well, but seemed too overwhelmed to speak then, letting his producers do the talking for the show’s conclusion.

207,2020/02/10,Oscars 2020: A.R Rahman’s ‘Jai Ho’ from ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ featured in song montage,"It was back in 2009 that Indian composer A.R. Rahman was honoured with two Oscars for his song Jai ho. Cut to 2020, the foot-tapping number made it to an original song montage at this year’s Oscars ceremony here.

Rahman had struck gold for original score and original song in Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire.

On Sunday night, American composer-lyricist-actor Lin-Manuel Miranda presented the montage that included hits from “Slumdog Millionaire”, “Titanic” and “Wayne’s World”.

The clip ended with Eminem from the 2002 film “8 Mile”. Then the rapper himself hit the stage to perform “Lose yourself”. He even got a standing ovation after his performance.

“Look, if you had another shot, another opportunity... Thanks for having me @TheAcademy. Sorry it took me 18 years to get here,” Eminem tweeted.

208,2020/02/10,Abhay Sopori’s music for Kashmiriyat in Hindi film Shikara,"Santoor maestro Abhay Rustum Sopori, is happy that Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s latest film Shikara tells the story of Kashmir’s Hindus who were forced to leave their homeland in 1990.

“This ‘ethnic cleansing’ should never happen again,” says Sopori, who was 11 years old then. “I was sure that we would return after a few days. It didn’t happen and I have stayed in Delhi since then,” he says, with some bitterness.

Sopori, of the 300-year-old Sufiana Gharana, now in its ninth generation, composed the music of the wedding song Shukrana Gul Khile and the love theme Dilbar Lagyo in Shikara. He designed a special santoor for the film, toning down the classical tones and textures, but staying true to the original Kashmiri instrument.

Before embarking on the project, Sopori told Chopra, a Punjabi who like him grew up in the Valley, that the traditional bhand performers of Kashmir had never got their due. The filmmaker roped them into the film in the wedding sequence.

“Recordings were done in the Valley as I wanted our folk musicians, from various villages, to work on this. So they worked on matka, sarangi with me,” he says, adding that the wedding song “highlights the syncretic traditions and the bond between Hindus and Muslims before the exodus.” Excerpts from a conversation.

How did you get this project?

Vidhu Vinod Chopra, whom I fondly call Vidhuji, saw my orchestral presentation with maestro Zubin Mehta in Kashmir in 2013, which was performed by 100 musicians comprising the Bavarian State Orchestra of Germany and my Kashmiri folk ensemble. And then we met in 2017. He always believed that one day that I would bring out the best of Kashmir through my music.

This is a subject close to my heart. I feel blessed that Vidhu believes in me. I am sure that Shikara will be one of the greatest films in world cinema as Kashmir has been presented in its truest narrative.

How would you describe your contribution to the film?

Vidhuji wanted me to compose an authentic Kashmiri wedding song, as it would have been in the 1980s. It was difficult, but weeks of preparation ensured that we now have an authentic Kashmiri wedding sequence.

The song with traditional instruments like rabab, sarangi, tumbak, and matka, is the highlight of the film. It’s for the first time that a complete Kashmiri song has been featured in a Hindi film. My efforts have always been to bring forward the rich and beautiful music and culture of my State. A live song is not something that Indian cinema tries too often now. I rehearsed with my musicians in Kashmir along with the Bachnagma dancer (men dressed as females) and Kashmiri Wanwun ladies as there was no scope for retakes.

Then we have the love theme in the movie where music from the santoor would make it a memorable experience for film buffs.

Classical musicians prefer to stay away from movies. What was the experience like, for you?

My classical santoor background is my greatest strength and it doesn’t stop me from spreading my wings. My grandfather Pandit Shamboo Nath Sopori, was hailed as the father of music in Kashmir.

Then, my father, the legendary musician Pandit Bhajan Sopori taught me classical — both Indian and Western, as well as Kashmiri Sufiana, Sufi, and folk. This combined knowledge helped me in composing the melodies for the film.

What is the message of this film

Shikara is a story that is woven around true events. My efforts have been to bring people together through music for a harmonious and peaceful society. This film gave me the platform to highlight this ideology through my music. I bring across the ethos of Kashmiri culture and music through this film. I believe that realisation is the first step towards transformation, correction and improvement.

What happeneded in Kashmir three decades ago were far removed from public memor. No matter how distant they may seem in space and time those horrific events are not hearsay. They did take place. Kashmiryat was torn apart on the night of January 19, 1990.

The Bhands

Five percussionists from the Bhand community — Manzoor-Ul-Haq, a 32-year-old who speaks fluent Hindi, Nariz Ahmed Baghat, Gulam Qadir Bhat, Abdul Ahad Baghat, Ghulam Ali Bhat — are shown playing their traditional instrument in the wedding song.

Bhands in Kashmir play the swarnai, akin to the shehnai. The Bhands, who are Muslims, also perform a special dance known as chhok. They have been ostracised now, after the Pandits left the Valley. Manzoor says: “or centuries, we have been engaged in the bhakti tradition in Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries. The Sufiana Kalam (devotional music) soothes the mind and is much needed now.” Their last big performance was in 2013 at the Kheer Bhawani temple, “but now as the situation in Kashmir has deteriorated we don’t have that many performances,” he says. Munir Ahmad Mir, the singer, also a Kashmiri, and the one in the song, says: “Muslims and Hindus shared a beautiful relationship, which made Kashmir so special. My Guru Pandit Bhajan Sopori would do so many concerts where this Kashmiryat (brotherhood) would resonate. Muslims singing bhajans and Hindus singing Muslim naats was a great bond of the Valley.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xjshob/article30770679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Abhay-Rustum-Sopori-4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/abhay-soporis-music-for-kashmiriyat-in-hindi-film-shikara/article30770681.ece
209,2020/02/10,"Joaquin Phoenix wins for ‘Joker’, bats for equality, veganism and the environment in speech","Continuing his clean sweep of all the awards for Joker, Joaquin Phoenix won his first Oscar for his now-iconic role of the deranged anti-villain from the Batman universe. Heath Ledger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar posthumously for portraying the same character in The Dark Knight (2008).

This is only the second time that two actors have won an Oscar for playing the same character. In 1972, Marlon Brando won the Best actor Oscar for playing Vito Corleone in The Godfather. Two years later, Robert De Niro won Best Supporting Actor for playing the younger version of the same character in The Godfather: Part II.

However, Phoenix used his time on the stage to arc the spotlight onto a number of issues which needed highlighting.

""I want to use this opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless. We face several distressing issues and champion different causes, but I see commonality in our fights, be it gender and equality, or racism or queer rights or animal rights. We are all in this fight against injustice,” he said.

The actor continued, “We are talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”

“We have become disconnected from the natural world and plunder it for its resources,” Phoenix said, adding that he hopes everyone gets a second chance at life to better: something which he got.

Phoenix also batted for veganism, and advisef everyone to use love and compassion as guiding principles. “I’ve been a scoundrel in my life. I’ve been selfish, I’ve been cruel at times, hard to work with, and I’m grateful that so many have given me a second chance. I think that’s when we’re at our best — when we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow, educate each other, and guide each other towards redemption,” he spoke to the crowd, holding his trophy.

He choked up during the conclusion of his speech, by quoting a lyric written by his late brother, River Phoenix, when he was 17 years old: “Run into the rescue with love, and peace will follow.”

The award is Phoenix’s first Oscar.

Mr. Anbumani said that there are more than 1200 movies that are yet to see the light of the day and that every year at least 100 movies out of the 300 movies that go under production, remain unreleased in cinemas. “Hundreds of producers and their families have been destroyed as they are unable to release their movies and continue to pay their debts with interest,” he said.

“There is film syndicate that seems to be wielding power over film industry, deciding which movie should get a release. This must be brought to an end,” he demanded.

“Big fish is swallowing the small fish. The influential people are ensuring that their movies alone get a good release in theatres. This should be brought to an end. Only then producers will come forward to movies,” he said.

Speaking at the commemoration ceremony of the enactment of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act organised by the International Justice Mission (IJM) and British Deputy High Commission, Chennai, he said, “Awareness should be constantly created to ensure that people are able to spot bonded labour when it is happening and speak about the rights of the persons who are trapped in it.”

“If we are not a part of the solution, we are a part of the problem. The wide gap between the haves and the have-nots is not desirable in a democracy like ours and organisations such as the IJM should continue to work towards bridging this gap to help eradicate bonded labour,” he said.

Within a period of six months, the one stop crisis teams across Tamil Nadu have rescued 122 victims of human trafficking.The highest number of victims rescued were 68 persons from Chennai followed by 28 persons rescued in Chengalpettu and 15 persons in Vellore.

“For Tamil Nadu to become completely bonded-labour free, stakeholders need to work in tandem with each other and the one stop crisis teams established under the TN State legal services authority has been playing an important part in the same ,” Justice Dr Kothari said.

The crisis team’s preventive strategies include creating awareness about the law and the dangers posed by prospective traffickers. They also map out vulnerable areas, inspect work sites periodically and ensure that government and rehabilitation schemes reach the victims.

Ravikumar has voiced his concern over the reduction in allocation of grants by the Union government to the Centrally administered Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) in Puducherry in the Union budget for 2020-21.

In a statement, he said that the Centre had been constantly bringing down the allocation of funds for Jipmer which only exposed the Centre’s bias against the institution. He called upon the Puducherry government to raise its voice against the Centre’s attitude.

While in 2019-20, Jipmer was allocated ₹1100 crore and it had spent ₹1053.48 crore, in the present budget the allocation has been brought down by ₹100 crore, he said.

Mr. Ravikumar said that Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, another centrally funded hospital had been earmarked ₹1426.53 crore in the current budget. The institute was allocated ₹1500 crores in the 2019-20 budget and it had spent ₹260 crore more than the allocated funds.

He charged the Centre with showing scant regard for the development of Jipmer by bringing down its allocation of grants every year.

Simultaneously, hundreds of persons were asked to remain under home quarantine for a period of 28 days. Health officials, while continuing their surveillance, insist that those under home quarantine should follow the home care guidelines.

Those under home quarantine should follow the advice provided and stay in isolation within their homes,” a public health officer said.

Apart from the two calls, local public health teams comprising a doctor and health inspector visit these persons at their homes whenever needed, he added.

As per the home care guidelines issued by the DPH, persons under quarantine should stay in a well-ventilated single room. The number of caregivers should be limited; ideally one person who is in a good health condition. There should be no visitors and household members should stay in a different room.

The persons should limit their movement and minimise the shared space. They should ensure that shared spaces such as kitchen and bathroom are well ventilated. The caregiver should wear a medical mask fitted tightly to the face when in the same room.

Surfaces such as bedside tables, bed frames and furniture should be cleaned and disinfected daily. Following respiratory hygiene – covering mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing - and hand hygiene is important. Persons with symptoms should remain at home until their symptoms are resolved and the health of all household members would be monitored.

215,2020/02/10,Withdraw notification on PCPIR: Vaiko,"Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) founder Vaiko on Monday urged the AIADMK government to withdraw its 2017 notification delineating certain villages in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts as Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR).

In a statement, Mr. Vaiko referred to the July 2017 notification of the State government to acquire over 57,000 acre of land in 45 villages for the PCPIR.

“If Tamil Nadu government is truly concerned about farmers and plans to declare the Special Protected Agriculture Zone in Cauvery delta, it should also withdraw the notification for the PCPIR,” Mr. Vaiko said.

While protecting the Cauvery delta, the government was attempting to set up petrochemical project along with Haldia petrochemicals in Cuddalore district at ₹50,000 crore, the Rajya Sabha MP noted.

Pointing out how the legislation passed in the Assembly against NEET in Tamil Nadu was ignored by the Centre, Mr. Vaiko said besides passing legislation for Special Protected Agriculture Zone, the government must be focused on implementing it.

The MDMK leader recalled how his party was among the first to protest against the methane project in the Cauvery delta, taking sides with the farmers. Even as early as 2011, his party staged protests against the methane project, he said.

Mr. Vaiko also recalled his party’s opposition to the hydrocarbon project in the Cauvery delta region. He recalled how MDMK actively participated in the 596 km long human chain along with opposition parties against hydrocarbon project on June 23, 2019.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jkegkw/article30780895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VAIKOMETHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/withdraw-notification-on-pcpir-vaiko/article30780896.ece
216,2020/02/10,Cauvery delta to be declared a protected agriculture zone,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday announced that the Cauvery delta region would be declared a Protected Special Agriculture Zone as a step towards ensuring food security of the State.

The announcement was widely hailed by political parties and farmers’ organisations, while the DMK termed it a “diversionary tactic”.

At an official function at Thalaivasal in his native Salem district, Mr. Palaniswami said the State government would never give its approval for projects such as hydrocarbon exploration in the delta region.

“I am a farmer and the State government would never give permission for any project that would affect the livelihood of farmers... At Neduvasal, whatever project the Centre may introduce, it cannot be implemented without NOC from the State government,” he said.

“The Cauvery delta region is an important agriculture region in Tamil Nadu and farmers continue to do agriculture, despite climate challenges. It is just and reasonable that projects like hydrocarbon exploration have raised concerns among farmers and other agriculture-based labourers. Since the delta region is close to the sea, there is a need to safeguard the region. To ensure that agriculture is not affected, the Cauvery delta regions in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Karur and Tiruchirapalli will be converted into a Protected Special Agriculture Zone,” he announced.

Mr. Palaniswami said the State government would hold consultations with legal experts, and steps would be taken to enact special legislation.

‘Spreading lies’

He alleged that DMK leader T.R. Baalu, who had served as the Union Minister of State for Petroleum in 1996, when methane gas was found in the Rajasthan desert, chose to get the project implemented in Tamil Nadu in 2010.

The DMK government in January 2011 signed a memorandum of understanding with the Great Eastern Energy Corporation to dig borewells and conduct explorations for four years in the region, he charged.

The MoU was signed when DMK president M.K. Stalin was the Deputy Chief Minister. But now the DMK was conducting protests in the region and spreading lies among the public, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wnlrgc/article30778694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cauvery-delta-to-be-declared-a-protected-agriculture-zone/article30778695.ece
217,2020/02/10,"Special agri zone’s features to be fine-tuned, says Minister","Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement that the Cauvery delta region will be declared a Special Agricultural Zone is expected not only to protect the interests of farmers, but also counter the “narrative of the Opposition parties against the AIADMK”, Agriculture Minister R. Doraikkannu said on Sunday.

Mr. Doraikkannu told The Hindu: “This is a major announcement by the Chief Minister, which will help the farmers in the State. Now, there can be no talk of any Opposition party trying to make this [allowing of projects deemed hazardous in the delta region] a political issue.”

Some of the political parties were attempting to instigate farmers over the issue, he alleged.

Senior officials in the Agriculture Department are expected to coordinate with their counterparts in the Environment and Forests and Law Departments to give final shape to the plan of notifying the delta region as a Special Agricultural Zone.

“The Chief Minister's office is working on various aspects of the project,” Mr. Doraikkannu said.

218,2020/02/10,Leaders hail move to protect delta districts,"Political leaders in Tamil Nadu have welcomed Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement that the Cauvery delta region will be declared a protected agricultural zone.

Welcoming the move, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said industries other than those that damage agriculture could be allowed in the region.

Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran said the State government had finally realised the extent of public anger after trying to suppress the protests against hydrocarbon and methane extraction.

Self-sufficiency

“The State government has finally succumbed to the anger of the people and has declared the delta region a protected agricultural zone. It should go beyond making a mere announcement and pass legislation in the Assembly. The State government must take steps to scrap the Salem-Chennai 8-lane expressway and the Neutrino Observatory,” he said.

Samathuva Makkal Katchi leader R. Sarathkumar welcomed the announcement and expressed the hope that it will result in Tamil Nadu becoming self-sufficient in food.

“This announcement will surely improve people’s quality of life. This will be a milestone. We welcome it,” he said.

Improving livelihood

Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan said the steps taken by CM Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy CM O. Panneerselvam and other Ministers were improving agriculture and the livelihood of farmers in Tamil Nadu. “This will also improve the lives of agricultural labourers,” he said.

Perambalur Member of Parliament T.R. Paarivendhar, the founder of the Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi, said the announcement made by Mr. Palaniswami had brought cheer to farmers in the delta region.

“The announcement has fulfilled the long-pending demand of farmers from Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Ariyalur, Karur and other delta regions,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/leaders-hail-move-to-protect-delta-districts/article30778433.ece
219,2020/02/10,DMK challenges Chief Minister to cancel hydrocarbon projects,"DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru on Sunday alleged that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had announced that the Cauvery delta region will be declared a protected agricultural zone only to divert the people’s attention from his government’s “betrayal of delta farmers”.

In a statement issued in Chennai, he said the Chief Minister should first adopt a resolution in the Assembly, stating that hydrocarbon exploration projects will not be allowed in the delta region, and cancel the projects awarded to the Vedanta group and the ONGC, particularly those in the delta region. “The Chief Minister should also withdraw the letter written by Environment Minister K.C. Karuppannan, in which he had stated that public hearings and environmental clearances were not necessary for such projects. Then, he can make the announcement designating the delta region as a protected agricultural zone in the Assembly,” the DMK leader said. Mr. Nehru alleged that the announcement was a diversionary tactic, since the government had already granted permission for hydrocarbon projects. “He is taking the farmers for granted, the same way he cheated the students of Tamil Nadu on the NEET issue,” he said.

The DMK leader said the Chief Minister’s announcement was a ‘farcical drama’, noting that his government had approached the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court’s direction on a farm loan waiver. “If the CM thinks people will forget about the suicide of 13 farmers and the police action against farmers, he is day-dreaming,” he added. He condemned the CM’s statement that it was the erstwhile DMK government that had granted permission for hydrocarbon exploration projects. “He lacks the courage to withdraw the permissions granted to Vedanta and the ONGC,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-challenges-chief-minister-to-cancel-hydrocarbon-projects/article30778361.ece
220,2020/02/10,CM lays foundation for international livestock research centre,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami laid the foundation for the Advanced Institute for Integrated Research on Livestock and Animal Sciences at Thalaivasal in Salem district on Sunday.

“The international park will host a veterinary institute of global standards, a processing centre for dairy and meat-based products, an incubation centre where people interested in starting livestock-based businesses could undergo training, and various other facilities,” the CM said. A dedicated water scheme to supply Cauvery water to the institute will be implemented, he added.

Mr. Palaniswami said the State’s livestock population had increased by 21% thanks to government schemes involving the free distribution of livestock.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said, “Schemes like the distribution of free cattle, which was launched by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, have helped improve the livelihood of village women. The government has distributed free cattle to 87,444 village women till date. The cattle, and the calves they have produced, numbering 1,76,153, have helped increase dairy production and improve the livelihood of the beneficiaries of the scheme. Milk production in the State has increased to 2.66 lakh litres per day.”

Dig at Opposition

Criticising the Opposition, Mr. Panneerselvam said that while the State government was working for the welfare of the people, some leaders were devising plans to peddle lies and mislead them. He asserted that the AIADMK will emerge the victor in the 2021 election.

Minister for Animal Husbandry Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan said the veterinary institute in Salem will be the fifth such institute in the State, and admissions will be provided to 40 students this academic year itself. He added that the number of seats on offer will subsequently be increased to 80.

Mr. Palaniswami also inaugurated a three-day livestock and agricultural exhibition in Thalaivasal.

221,2020/02/10,‘Protected agricultural zone’ status delights delta farmers,"A cross-section of residents of Neduvasal village in Pudukottai district, which had witnessed massive protests against hydrocarbon exploration projects in 2017, erupted in joy on Sunday after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced that the Cauvery delta region will be designated as a ‘protected agricultural zone’.

A section of farmers in the village, who had spearheaded the agitation, distributed sweets to the public in Keeramangalam. Some celebrated the announcement by bursting crackers.

“It is a victory for the Neduvasal protest. Right from the start, we have been demanding legislation to declare the delta region as a protected agricultural zone. It has now come true,” Neduvasal panchayat president K. Dakshinamurthy said.

A similar sense of elation pervaded villages right across the delta region, comprising Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and parts of Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Karur and Ariyalur districts.

Hours after the announcement, Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association, called the Chief Minister over the phone to convey his appreciation of the move. “It is a great, sweet news in 2020. It shows that the numerous protests against projects involving various forms of gas exploration have not gone waste. It (the ‘protected agricultural zone’ status) will rejuvenate and protect agriculture in the entire delta region,” Mr. Ranganathan told The Hindu.

He said the legislation promised by the Chief Minister should be enacted in the forthcoming Budget session of the Assembly. Moreover, all the cases registered against protesters should be withdrawn, he added.

N.V. Kannan, the president of the Thanjavur district unit of the Tamilnadu Vivasayigal Sangam, and S. Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association, called upon the State government to provide legal heft to the announcement by bringing in a Bill and getting it passed in the Assembly.

“The Bill should be drafted in such a way that it adds weight to the litigations opposing oil exploration projects in agricultural fields that are pending before various courts and tribunals. For this purpose, the Tamil Nadu government should convene a special Assembly session before the regular Budget session,” they demanded.

Another section of farmers were guarded in their reaction. “It is only a temporary relief to the delta farmers. Apprehensions among the people remain, as the Centre has, in the past, disregarded the laws enacted in the State Assembly on important issues. We hope that the proposed law will not face the same fate as the Bill that sought an exemption for T.N. from NEET,” said Mahadanapuram V. Rajaram, a farmer-leader. Mr. Dakshinamurthy observed that the Chief Minister's announcement will carry weight only after the Governor approves the proposed law.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/protected-agricultural-zone-status-delights-delta-farmers/article30778336.ece
222,2020/02/10,‘Only agricultural and allied industries should be allowed in delta region’,"PMK leader and Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss has expressed elation over Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement that the Cauvery delta region will be declared as a ‘Protected Special Agricultural Zone’ — a long-standing demand of his party. He says only agricultural and allied industries should be allowed to operate in the region. Excerpts:

The PMK has been demanding the declaration of the Cauvery delta region as a protected agricultural zone for a long time. How do you view the Chief Minister’s announcement?

We are very happy. The PMK was the first to raise the demand, and had even included it in its 2016 election manifesto. We have organised several protests and awareness programmes regarding the issue and, when we joined the AIADMK alliance in 2019, this (the ‘protected agricultural zone’ status) was our primary demand. Last year, I met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami twice regarding the issue. My party leader and I had urged him to declare the delta region as a protected agricultural zone. We are happy that all parties, including [the DMK, led by] Opposition leader M.K. Stalin, had endorsed the demand.

What do you expect from the government now?

We want legislation to be enacted in the forthcoming Assembly session, mandating that only agricultural and allied industries should be permitted to operate in the delta region. Other industries, like those related to petrochemicals and hydrocarbons, which pollute the environment, should be barred. A dyeing industrial unit in Erode was relocated to Parangipettai in the delta region. Similarly, a petrochemical park was brought in by the [erstwhile] DMK government. We have urged the AIADMK not to repeat the DMK’s mistakes. The delta is one of the most fertile regions in the country, and we cannot afford to destroy it by drilling it for hydrocarbons. With climate change expected to cause severe food shortage, it is important to protect the region.

Wouldn’t the announcement impact existing industries, investments and jobs?

We want only non-polluting industries. The rest should be shut down. The eco-system, agriculture and the environment are more important than revenue or job generation. The Sterlite factory may well provide employment and foreign exchange. But if it is polluting the environment, we don’t want it. I don’t see any problem with the existing industries. But if they are polluting the environment, they should be shut down.

The PMK had opposed land acquisition for the Salem-Chennai expressway. What is your view on the acquisition of agricultural land for infrastructure development?

There are four highways connecting Chennai and Salem.

Why do we need a fifth? In fact, we are suggesting the creation of a 10-lane highway between Chennai and Kanniyakumari. This will involve agricultural land, but we want to make the farmers who part with their land stakeholders in the project, so that the profits are shared with them for the next 25 years. That way, they will get more value and will be happy to give their land without protest.

Now that the AIADMK and the PMK see eye-to-eye on some key issues, would this alliance continue? There have been reports that the PMK may tie up with actor Rajinikanth’s proposed party…

We have submitted 10 demands to the AIADMK government, and we hope they will take a positive decision on them. On the NEET issue and on the release of the seven convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case, the State government is supporting us. On the issue of prohibition, we expect that more steps will be taken in due course. They are doing it, but it is taking some time.

With respect to [Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam leader] Mr. Tamilaruvi Manian’s claims that were reported today, I can say this: “We are in the AIADMK alliance. Mr. Manian has no right to talk about an alliance…about us…about my party. We remain a part of the AIADMK alliance, and the only person who could take a decision [on the matter] is my leader.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2slrq0/article30778324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10ANBUMANIRAMADOSSANDPMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/only-agricultural-and-allied-industries-should-be-allowed-in-delta-region/article30778325.ece

224,2020/02/10,Dumping of waste in quarry threatens wildlife at Mudumalai Tiger Reserve,"Dumping of plastic and chicken waste in an abandoned quarry in the heart of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) is posing a huge threat to the wildlife in the area, conservationists warn.

The quarry, now a series of small seasonal waterbodies, hosts a wide variety of wildlife, including the woolly-necked stork, several species of birds of prey and even a few freshwater turtles. Local residents said leopards and elephants visit the pools for water during summer months.

However, meat traders and residents have been using the quarry to dump huge quantities of waste generated in Masinagudi town.

Sindhu S, who lives near the quarry, said trucks carrying chicken waste enter the quarry every day and dump the waste there.

“The stench from the chicken waste is overwhelming at times, and there are hundreds of birds scavenging the waste,” said Ms. Sindhu, who added that people too come to discard waste at the site.

Conservationists say that the illegal dumping of waste in the quarry, located a few hundred metres from the town of Masinagudi, just off the road to Singara, puts the safety of animals inhabiting the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve at risk and has the potential to severely impact the entire ecosystem.

N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist, suspects hazardous waste too is getting dumped in the quarry, potentially poisoning the water in the area.

“This could impact the birds which inhabit the quarry and feed on the waste, while elephants and carnivores could drink the water which could be contaminated. Wildlife could accidentally ingest plastic waste or other dumped materials at the site,” said Mr. Mohanraj, who called up on the Forest Department to act swiftly to clean up the area and put a stop to the dumping of waste at the quarry.

When contacted, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), L.C.S.Srikanth, said he would look into the issue and take appropriate action against people and traders found to be dumping waste at the site.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ybthh4/article30778136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THQUARRYMTR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dumping-of-waste-in-quarry-threatens-wildlife-at-mudumalai-tiger-reserve/article30778137.ece

The survey, which began on February 1 will continue till 29th of this month, has asked people in the corporation limits to participate in the survey.

The launch was made by District Revenue Officer, J. Partheeban, on January 31 in the presence of Corporation officials but it evoked a poor response, according to sources from the Municipal Corporation.

As per the instructions from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs banners were set up at various places on the city, yet it failed to attract the urban population, what would be the case of rural segments?, asks Parthasarathi Narayanan, a retired bank official in Katpadi.

The survey is being conducted to ascertain the ability of people to live, their social upliftment, availability of quality education for children, health care, sanitation and maintenance, solid waste management, availability of protected drinking water, emergency services, women protection, recreation facilities, green spaces and electricity.

Corporation sources said that Corporation has been selected under the Smart City Mission in the second round and projects worth over ₹800 crore were being implemented in the city.

226,2020/02/10,TRS bags Nalgonda vice-chairman seat,"The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, slowly but eventually, won the vice-chairman seat of Nalgonda municipality, amid betrayal of trust claims by the Bharatiya Janata Party, here on Monday. With 20 ward councillors, an AIMIM and an Independent candidate on its side, the TRS numbers with the votes of five ex-officio members rose to 27, same as during the election of its chairman M. Saidi Reddy, to elect Abbagoni Ramesh on Monday.

The Congress, which had also won 20 wards, remained handicapped with no possibility of a post-poll alliance, the only option being to ally with BJP who won six wards, or had sufficient ex-officio options.

But by the time Chairman voting was about to begin on January 27, speculation was rife that the BJP was extending support, as ‘strategic silence’ during voting, to the TRS in lieu of vice-chairman seat. The BJP had also announced that its chairman candidate Bandaru Prasad would be elected the vice-chairman.

However, soon after the Chairperson election, all the 27 voters of the TRS walked out, postponing the proceedings for the vice-chairman election for lack of quorum.

Voting on the subsequent day, as directed by the State Election Commission, was also postponed for lack of quorum as councillors of the TRS and the BJP remained absent.

The six aggrieved councillors of the BJP who addressed the press after the voting on Monday, for the first time disclosed that it “entered into a written agreement with the TRS for chairperson and vice-Chairperson election.”

“We decided to support TRS, not for the vice-chairman seat, but for development of Nalgonda. TRS betrayed us, like they betrayed Sonia Gandhi,” the BJP leaders said.

When enquired, Mr. Prasad said he would disclose the written agreement to media later, and said Zilla Parishad Chairman Banda Narender Reddy, MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy and Kancharla Krishna Reddy held the consultations.

Mr. Rajeshwar Reddy, later speaking to press, rebutted all the claims of the BJP.

“We do not have any agreement with BJP.

Citing the history of the allotment of land for development of IT and allied sectors in the undivided State of Andhra Pradesh, the petitioner said the 31.35 acres of land was allowed to be transferred to M/s DLF Rayadurg Developers Private Limited in violation of rules.

The petitioner’s counsel said the government allowed even exchange of the original piece of land for another land albeit in the same area. The new land allotted to the company had higher market value. This land eventually landed in the hands of a company which was owned by a real estate developers having close links with the powers that be, the petitioner alleged.

IAS officers as varsity V-Cs

In another PIL petition challenging the State government’s decision appointing IAS officers as vice-chancellors of universities, the division bench issued notices to the government. It instructed the Principal Secretary of Higher Education, University Grants Commission along with the V-Cs and Registrars of universities to file a detailed counter affidavit on the matter within four weeks.

The petitioner and Osmania University Assistant Professor S. Karunakar Reddy filed the plea seeking to declare the office note issued by the Chief Minister’s office on July 24 last year over appointment of IAS officers as V-Cs as unilateral, illegal and arbitrary.

MLA’s citizenship issue

In a separate case, Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili on Monday directed ruling TRS party MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh, who approached Telangana High Court after the Centre cancelled his citizenship, to furnish papers confirming that he had abdicated German citizenship.

The Centre had annulled his Indian citizenship after finding that he had German citizenship when he contested as MLA. Challenging the order, he approached the HC which had stayed the Centre’s order on the matter and extended it. The matter was posted to February 24 for next hearing.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-notices-to-govt-on-raidurg-land-allotment/article30785982.ece
230,2020/02/10,Amazon plans two data centres near Hyderabad,"E-commerce major Amazon, a leader in cloud computing service with its Amazon Web Services (AWS), is considering setting up two data centres near Hyderabad with a total investment of ₹11,630 crore (around $1.6 billion).

One of the data centres is being proposed with an investment of ₹5,809 crore on over 48 acres (1,94,293 sq metres) in Meerkhanpet village under Kandukur mandal in neighbouring Rangareddy district.

The location of the facility will be a part of the Hyderabad Pharma City industrial area.

The other data centre will also come up in the neighbouring district on about 33 acres (1,37,033 sq metres), in Chandanvelly and Hythabad villages in Shabad mandal, entailing an investment of ₹5,821 crore.

Both the facilities are to be developed in a phased manner. Amazon moved a step closer towards establishing the facilities when it got approval for them from the Telangana State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) as well as Telangana State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority recently.

The SEIAA approval, which came a few days ago, is subject to the company giving undertaking on certain issues, including following green building concepts and make provision for maximum use of renewable energy.

According to documents forming part of the environmental clearance process, the project is being proposed through Amazon Data Services India. In a presentation, for each of the data centre, the company said data centre is the safe and secure storage, management and processing of customer data and information through cloud computing.

The decision of the company assumes significance in the context of upcoming data localisation norms in India that will make it mandatory for all data to be stored within the country. It will be equally important from a perspective of creating a backbone for the growing market for cloud computing services.

For Telangana, which has a policy on data centres in place, it will be the second major investment by Amazon.

231,2020/02/10,College girl found dead with throat slit,"In a bizarre incident, unidentified persons allegedly killed a college girl by slitting her throat in Vidyanagar locality in Karimnagar town on Monday.

Police said the girl studying intermediate first-year in a private college in Karimnagar town was found in a pool of blood with throat slit in her house near Venkateshwara temple area. Though the incident took place in the afternoon, it came to light only after her parents, who are farm labourers, returned home in the evening.

On information, the police rushed to the spot and collected all evidence by deploying dog squads and CLUES team. The police suspect the role of a tenant, who used to stay in their house in the first floor. Sources said the house owners had forced the tenant who was an alocholic to vacate the house following the nuisance created by him every day.

The police suspect that the tenant might have developed a grudge against the family and committed the offence. The police also visited the junior college where she was studying to gather information about her classmates and teachers. The police are also checking CCTV footages of the locality.

Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy told The Hindu that they had constituted special teams to nab the culprits involved in the murder. Assuring to nab the culprits within 24 hours, he said they were looking at the CCTV footage and collecting all evidence to nab the culprits at the earliest.

232,2020/02/10,Rains add to woes of chilli farmers,"Unseasonal rains that lashed Kusumanchi, Tirumalayapalem, Mudigonda and various other mandals in the district on Sunday aggravated the woes of chilli farmers, who are already distraught over the crash in price.

Intermittent spells of untimely rain drenched the harvested chilli produce of farmers mostly stocked in open fields in several villages in Khammam division on Sunday, sources said.

The unseasonal rains dealt a severe blow to chilli growers at a time when they are worried over the ‘downward trend’ in chilli prices in the market.

The price of red chilli suddenly crashed from ₹21,000 a quintal in the second week of January to ₹13,300 per quintal now in Khammam agricultural market, dashing the hopes of many chilli growers of reaping rich dividends.

In a statement, CPI (M) district secretary Nunna Nageswara Rao said chilli, cotton, maize and paddy growers bore the brunt of unseasonal rains that lashed several parts of the district in the last three days.

The district administration should immediately enumerate the crop damages suffered by the farmers due to nature’s fury and send a report to the government for sanction of compensation to the aggrieved farmers, he said.

He further demanded that the government should initiate urgent measures to help the distraught farmers cope with the situation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rains-add-to-woes-of-chilli-farmers/article30785057.ece
233,2020/02/10,A.P. power consumers to get details of subsidy in bills,"Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has directed the two distribution licensees in the State – APSPDCL and APEPDCL – to provide the details of cost of service, cross-subsidy and government subsidy on the overleaf of the monthly electricity bills issued to consumers from April.

Chairman of the Commission Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy while releasing the retail power supply tariff for 2020-21 here on Monday said the direction has been given as the Commission felt that the consumers should know such details. Further, the Discoms have been directed to print small booklets containing tariff schedule and other relevant information useful to the consumers in the vernacular language in adequate numbers and make them available in all their offices for sale on reasonable cost.

The Commission, however, rejected the Discoms proposal to procure (purchase) power from private producers (power plants) not having any binding agreements in view of the surplus power generation for 2020-21 after taking into account the energy available from wind and solar sources.

It has extended the benefit of limiting the penalties only to the extent of excess demand over contracted demand to the industry by suitably modifying the penalty condition. The licensees have been told to obtain permission of the Commission for their investment proposals.

It has also reduced the capacitor surcharge from the existing 25% to 10% to protect the interests of small consumers.

With a view to ensuring prompt action on the compensation claims by the farmers in whose lands the transmission lines are laid, the Commission has decided to sensitise the District Collectors since the district-level committee led by them decide on such compensation.

It has also told the Discoms to prepare a roadmap for implementation of energy conservation and energy efficiency measures by themselves and by the consumers on a large scale.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ap-power-consumers-to-get-details-of-subsidy-in-bills/article30784814.ece
234,2020/02/10,No change in tariff up to 500 units for domestic consumers in A.P.,"In a relief to majority of the domestic power consumers in Andhra Pradesh with a monthly consumption up to 500 units, the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has spared them from any increase in the tariff for 2020-21.

Besides, the telescopic billing for all domestic consumers would be based purely on the monthly billing and not on their annual consumption during the previous year.

The telescopic billing for domestic consumers even with monthly consumption up to 500 units was categorised into three groups – A, B and C for the current (2019-20) year.

In the retail supply tariff for 2020-21 released here on Monday, APERC Chairman Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy along with members P. Raghu and P. Ram Mohan stated that consumers with monthly consumption above 500 units would be charged higher at ₹9.95 per unit from the existing ₹9.05 per unit.

The Commission has also pruned the revenue gap estimated by the two distribution licensees – AP Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd and AP Eastern Power Distribution Company Ltd – and three RESCOs in their annual revenue requirement filed before it to ₹10,061 crore from ₹12,954 crore. The Commission stated that the State government would bear the entire revenue gap in the form of subsidy given for 9-hour free power supply to agriculture sector and other categories of consumers.

“The subsidy for free power to agriculture, sugar cane farmers and rural nurseries would be about ₹8,354 crore for 2020-21, 18% higher than ₹7,064 crore provided for 2019-20. It will benefit about 18 lakh farmers having pump sets for cultivation of crops”, the APERC Chairman said. He said that the new tariff had spared burden on the 99.07% (1,43,65,000) out of a total of 1,45,00,000 domestic consumers in the State.

Other takeaways in the new tariff including relief to government hospitals, government educational institutions and non-profit making organisations as they have been spared from the time of day (ToD) tariff and included in the HT general category from the existing LT commercial category. The free power supply to dhobi ghats would be continued in 2020-21 too.

Railways, EVs’ tariff

The traction tariff for railways has been fixed at ₹5.50 per unit against ₹6.50 per unit proposed by the Discoms. Similarly, the tariff for charging of electrical vehicles has been fixed at ₹6.70 per unit as against ₹12.25 per unit proposed by the Discoms.

235,2020/02/10,Government urged to cancel title deeds on temple land,"Former MLA and senior BJP leader Yendala Laxminarayana demanded the State government to cancel the title deeds of tenant farmers on a 25-acre land belonging to Nandigutta Sivalayam, and hand it over to the temple committee.

Talking to the media after visiting the land area at Nagaram on Sunday, he said that tenant farmers, with the help of endowment and revenue officers, got registered the land in their name and even sold it away to another party.

“Some private parties are carrying out mining works on the land. Action should be taken against the authorities who gave permission for mining on the land,” the BJP leader said.

“With blasting works near the temple, the structure developed cracks and if mining is not stopped immediately, it can fall entirely,” he said, and warned that his party would launch an agitation for the protection of temple land.

237,2020/02/10,"‘Media must be made better aware of environment, wildlife issues’","The media has come in for criticism for its reports on increased tiger movement in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, and Mancherial districts in the past few weeks, with experts and others pointing out the inherent ‘inadequacies’ in the reportage.

“Instead of making people celebrate the arrival of tigers into our territory, the media is ending up scaring the common man through its reportage,” said a senior Forest Department official. He cited a news report of a migrant tiger killing cattle in Tamsi and Bheempur mandals of Adilabad district.

Knowledge gap

“Sometimes, half-baked media reports put even poachers on the trail of wild animals, especially migrant tigers. Proper, informed reportage would ensure safety of wild animals, instead of scaring people,” the official on condition of anonymity added. He emphasised the need for better awareness on the subject among mediapersons.

V. Rakesh, a senior journalist with a Telugu news channel in the former composite Adilabad district, concurred with the official’s viewpoint. “Yes, many of us need to understand the importance of conservation in the proper perspective and an interaction with experts from the Forest Department will be of help,” he asserted.

Interactions needed

Ecologist Vidya Athreya narrated an experiment on improving interactions between experts and media, which centered on leopard movement around Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, in the wildlife and nature conservation portal, Conservation India. The article published on June 17, 2018, concluded that engagement with media changed the way human-wildlife interactions were reported.

Kawal Tiger Reserve Field director C.P. Vinod Kumar, who is also the Conservator of Forests, Adilabad Circle, welcomed the idea of continuing education on the subject for mediapersons. “We will try to organise awareness programmes for mediapersons at local level,” he affirmed.

State director of World Wildlife Fund for Nature-India, Farida Tampal recalled her organisation’s effort in organising workshops in media houses in Hyderabad a few years ago to put them on to proper websites for tapping information on environment, climate, wildlife etc. correctly. “The media is the best means when it comes to spreading awareness and it is better if is stays updated. Briefing programmes should be held twice or thrice a year,” she suggested.

Mr. Vinod Kumar pointed out, “There are issues like payment of compensation for cattle kills within two to three days of the incident which can be highlighted through the media to prevent locals from getting alarmed unnecessarily.”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gj42ao/article30777800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09-ADILA-TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/media-must-be-made-better-aware-of-environment-wildlife-issues/article30777796.ece
238,2020/02/10,The rise of live painting as a performance genre in Chennai,"Emotions, frozen in time, dominate any sketch made by Chennai-based cartoonist Kapil Shankar. Among two friends getting tipsy at a bar, there is uproarious laughter; with a mother hugging her toddler, there is a barely stifled one. With a boy and girl walking side by side with him glancing down at her hand, as if hoping to hold it, there is a sweet, delicate tension.

When the city’s independent musicians and comedians belt out their creative content in front of his eyes, there is only what Kapil (@artsy.kp) calls “the vibe”. It differs from performance to performance, he says. But no matter what it is, he usually has three minutes or less to capture it on paper. “When I make a comic strip, it usually takes me an hour. Here, though the vibe is very real, I have very little time to depict it,” he says. And therein lies the challenge of live art.

Drawing up a performance as and when it happens — complete with moods, stances and its idiosyncrasies — is a practice that artists in Chennai are slowly warming up to. Kapil, 20, has been doing it since September last year, ever since he accompanied a friend to a gig at Zostel and saw scope for art in that situation. “I had nothing else to do,” he shrugs and adds, “...but I did have some paper and my mechanical pencil and eraser.”

Since then, Kapil has committed to paper everything from the hilarious spontaneity and awkward exchanges of a roast to the dimly-lit soulfulness of acoustic duets. “The first thing I capture is body language. Everyone has a defining stance or gesture. Once I capture that, I can fill in the rest at leisure,” he says. Having done that, the sketch need not necessarily make it to the next step. Only the ones he is satisfied with are inked out, and even fewer see the light of the day on his Instagram.

Adapting to mood

Unlike Kapil, however, other live artists in the city enjoy an audience. Lotuzhead, a street artist and muralist based in Chennai, has been painting on walls since 2016. This, according to them, is also a form of live painting, where the artist has an audience who stray onto the scene out of curiosity. Today, the artist can be spotted in front of an empty canvas (mostly in The Leather Bar, The Park) donning a mask, his brushstrokes colliding with the “vibe” of the music doled out by the city’s indie talent.

“Professionally, I came into live painting in 2017, with a collective called the Urban Artist Network. Initially, the idea was suggested by musician Bjorn Surrao, who had wanted a visual component to the performances,” says Lotuzhead (@lotuzhead.goes.outdoors), whose penchant for using art as performance has him regularly painting for an audience.

“I don’t really plan anything, I go with the music and the mood it emanates. All I have control over is the size of the canvas and the materials used.” What the song is trying to say takes a backseat, while its rhythm and tenor that contribute to the mood and ambience translate onto the canvas. “During one of the gigs, I wanted to go with something dark and mysterious with my colours, but the musicians were playing a love song that night. Then I had to change quickly into something more mellow and romantic,” says the artist. If the song is more upbeat, his strokes are likely to be more rapid and strong. On the other hand, when the song is ambient and mellow, a gradient of colours can be spotted on the canvas.

Some graffiti artists try their hand at live painting but end up not sticking to it solely because of the presence of an audience. This is where Lotuzhead’s comfort lies. Theatrics, he believes, is a major component of his work. The fact that he is an anonymous artist and wears a mask adds to this aspect effortlessly. He also tries his hand at fire breathing (mostly onto the canvas) in between some performances. “I really enjoy the aspect that what I do fits in as a visual cue to the entire event. I am a very flamboyant person myself, so I like being that way,” says Lotuzhead, who also interacts with the audience at times, asking for a quote or an element that he can throw on to his canvas, to engage them. He also entertains viewers by making on-the-spot portraits of those who are interested.

Accessible performance

Engaging with the audience is not the only appeal of live art; the genre also lends itself to greater accessibility. LR Maduvanthi, a 24-year-old graphic designer, who does live sketches for SOFAR gigs, believes that live painting makes art accessible, especially for the viewers. She recalls how her family used to be the audience in her “live painting sessions” as a child. “The crowd and the vibe they give matters a lot, since art is essentially a tool for expression,” says Maduvanthi (@___sp_ace___).

As for the audience, watching a painting unfurl would help in visually interacting with the process, thereby stimulating their thoughts, according to the artist. This would also lead them to interpret the work together as a community.

“There is a sense of awe that they feel when they see someone paint, but the more you start interacting with them, the more you realise that they deem it accessible,” says Maduvanthi. How often do you get to interact with an artist who is knee-deep in his/her process? Live painting for Maduvanthi is a reaction to her observations, mostly. And because it is so, she also feels that the performance that happens alongside, plays a huge role in the work. Lately, she has been working on kinetic typography, which is, technically, lettering done to the backdrop of music. “Everything from the pace, style, to the volume of music affects the kinds of strokes used, the fonts and the entire transition of music you are listening to,” explains the artist.

Kapil, in contrast, focusses more on the creators than on their creations. But even as these artists differ in their approach and their intent, they leave behind the same result, the very moment when creative performers meet their audience: frozen to memory by strokes of the hand.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ba5mfy/article30783753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPLiveSketchInShot20190829030751070jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-rise-of-live-painting-as-a-performance-genre-in-chennai/article30783755.ece
239,2020/02/10,When artists come together,"Over the last two months, artists have come onto the streets in opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Performances such as MD Pallavi’s and Bindhumalini Naranswamy’s rendition of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge in Kannada Naavu Nodona (translated by Mamta Sagar) and the Italian resistance song Bella Ciao in Kannada (the lyrics of Bella Ciao were created from a collaboration between Rosy D’Souza and Sugata Srinivasaraju). Theatre practitioner and educator Nisha Abdulla has also actively participated in the protests, singing songs such as Paper Naavu Torsalla (a Kannada translation of Varun Grover’s poem, Hum Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge). Laxmi Priya, on the other hand, has used playback theatre to evolve a protest language. Last week, Wanandaf, comprising B Fab, Agaahi Raahi, Nex, and Dead Poet, performed at a panel discussion, organised by the Network of Women in Media, India at Institution of Agricultural Technologists, where B Fab rapped in Telugu and Dead Poet in English. Wanandaf shot to fame with their electric performance at the Burqa Bindi protest, held in honour of educators and social reformers Savitribhai Phule and Fatima Sheikh. “We are a hip-hop collective, we started in June 2019 to get the artists united, to give an identity for Bengaluru rappers,” says B Fab. “Rappers come together and rap about political issues,” Nex adds.

Artists have always responded to the times. Pallavi agrees and says: “Art has always pushed boundaries and raised uncomfortable questions.” She does not agree, though, that artists are the only ones playing a central role in the protests. “There are thousands of people who have come out on the streets. Artists comprise few of those thousands. We register our protest by doing what we can do in terms of art, and yes our voices do get amplified, but artists are not leading the movement, we are inspired by it.”

Naavu Nodona was sung by Pallavi and Bindhumalini at the Burqa Bindi protest. “Mamta told me that she has translated the song and asked if I could sing it, and I said yes. It conveys what the protesters on the streets today want to convey. When it was sung in Kannada it touched a chord with the people. After that it has been translated into many languages, and our regional languages are powerful to drive the point home.”

Nisha says: “When I decided to start my theatre group Qabila in 2018, I asked myself why I am in theatre and what I want to do with my group. What the protests have changed is that it has brought many more people into my circle. Earlier I had my own theatre circle, now I am able to engage with and access different kinds of artists and art works.”

Speaking of the importance of protest art, Nisha says: “We have reached a place where we can’t trust social media, we can’t always trust the media. So what can we trust? We can trust our own body and art. I don’t try to convert people who ask, ‘why are you protesting?’ I tell them to come and see what we do.”

How do artists transcend boundaries of community and language? Nisha says they are conscious that language should not divide. “And that is why we use Kannada, Tamil, English and Hindi. All these languages are representative of Bangalore and we should honour the city’s diversity.” She adds: “It is easier to come together on social media, so the question is how can we replicate that solidarity on the ground?.. It is through art. We are singing Hum Dekhenge in a language we know, we are all however singing the same tune, and that is how we can plug into the same solidarity. Poetry allows us to tap into that shared solidarity.”

But what has she to say to the argument that politics shouldn’t be brought into the artistic space? “What is art if it is not political? How can you create art without understanding the body you are in, the context you come from, your social relationships? How can one say then that they will not engage?”

She says protest art has transformed her as an artist. “I am now very comfortable with imperfect art. For example, I am doing a production on differences in the classroom, which I am taking to different spaces. I am taking it to government and private schools . Those spaces might not have all the elements required for a production. But my art can serve a larger purpose. The protest movement has made me acknowledge that if I want to create art that enables people to grapple with differences and not deny it, and provoke people into thinking and questioning, then I have to go to the people and deal with imperfect art.”

Laxmi says: “Art enables collective healing. This is required because we consume breaking news on loop, so there is a need to process what is happening around us. Playback allows for personal stories to be shared. You get to hear your own and others’ point of views.”

For Akash Narendran, a freelance playback theatre artist and musician, protest art is opening up a plethora of perspectives. He is engaged with a playback performance around stories of resistance by Bangalore Playback Ensemble. “As some of us were participating in the protests, we wondered why we weren’t doing playback, because for us it is our first go to in performance arts. We also felt there was a lack of sharing even within the community of protesters, of our perspectives so that was also an impetus.”

Bangalore Playback Ensemble have conducted three shows of An Ode to Resistance. “Even people who come to listen have felt a sense of connection. Sometimes there is a sense of catharsis. Sometimes it is hopeless and sometimes hopeful but in the shared feeling there is a lot of resonance, and that is always powerful.”

However what about those who are hesitant to vocal yet want to register their protest? Playwright and theatre director Kavya Srinivasan has kept them in mind. She organises a monthly event called Putting the Rest in Resistance, which uses different art forms, the recent one was community singing. “When we talk about resistance there is an analogy of war, of putting yourself out there and protesting. But what about war nurses? Resistance burn out is real. What about those who cannot go out and protest? I am wary of the argument: ‘why didn’t you show up?’ Not everyone can, due to mental health, or work, or family responsibilities, or disability. So Putting the Rest in Resistance is for people to just come together and be with people who feel the same way...to rest, to heal.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/e2vtbs/article30782237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bgmbangaloreplaybackensemble21jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/when-artists/article30782239.ece
240,2020/02/10,U.S. to monitor air quality in N. India,"The United States will monitor air quality in multiple locations across North India to help control pollution level, its embassy said in a statement on Monday.

The initiative will cover both urban locations and rural areas and is aimed at helping local communities take remedial measures to deal with the issue of increasing air pollution.

The move came months after the U.S. mission distributed 58 low-cost air-quality monitors and 14 weather stations to the Society for Indoor Environment, an Indian NGO which will be a partner in this project.

The low-cost monitoring is expected to help understand the reasons behind the recent smog-related pollution in North India that was partly blamed on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana.

“These units will be set up in educational institutions in select second and third-tier cities, as well as rural areas, across North India.

241,2020/02/10,"Where is the recession, asks BJP MP","“If there was recession, we would all have come wearing kurta and dhoti,” a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, Virendra Singh, told a gathering at Ballia in an apparent dig at the critics of the economic situation in the country.

Addressing an event in his constituency on Sunday, Mr. Virendra Singh ‘Mast’ said there were discussions about the “recession” in Delhi and other places.

242,2020/02/10,BJP fine-tunes Muslim outreach ahead of M.P. polls,"The BJP’s insouciant response — or the lack of it — to minority members quitting in droves over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a unique challenge it is grappling with in Madhya Pradesh, has propelled a spiralling spate of resignations showing no signs of abatement.

But faced with a sturdy Congress government treading cautiously on policy matters, recent setback in the Jhabua Assembly by-election and its inability to whip up a sustainable offensive, the BJP has at last shed its reluctance to soothe minority members, with the exigency of the local body elections this month in view.

Denial mode

During January, the BJP’s State unit remained in denial mode, looking away from simmering resentment among its Muslim members — snubbed for flagging their exclusion from awareness drives on the contentious law, communal remarks during rallies and non-addressal of complaints. A sense of betrayal gradually sank in, resulting in more than a thousand resignations in Indore, Bhopal, Khargone, Guna and Satna districts. The biggest shocker was Jabalpur, where 700 members quit, virtually dissolving the cell.

On Saturday, however, when the party’s only Muslim corporator in Indore quit over the CAA, its response was different. “If not the backbone, the cell is a major wing of the party. Several leaders have called me and are ready to talk. They said all differences could be resolved amicably,” Usman Patel, a member for 40 years, told The Hindu.

This contrasts with the party’s dismissive response to the resignations of cell’s State secretary Akram Khan and media chief Javed Baig, who claimed even the State party president ignored complaints, and democracy was subverted within the party.

Pamphlets in Urdu

Moreover, State BJP media chief Lokendra Parashar confirmed besides Hindi, the party would now distribute CAA pamphlets in Urdu too. “Muslims are being misled. Therefore it’s important to convince their elderly, who make decisions for the community and read Urdu,” he said. From February 3, the minority cell began hearing out its grassroots workers, explaining the law to them, as “If we don’t understand the law ourselves, how will we make others aware?” said the cell’s vice-president Nasir Shah.

However, the Muslim retreat, would not hurt BJP’s electoral prospects in the local elections, believes Yatindra Singh Sisodia, Director, Madhya Pradesh Institute of Social Science Research. “Muslim population is concentrated in certain pockets of urban areas. The BJP didn’t enjoy popular support from the community even before the CAA, which may in fact have consolidated its vote against it,” he explained.

As for political dividends for the BJP owing to a possible polarisation on religious lines after the minority members quit, he said elections to panchayats and urban bodies were fought primarily on local issues instead. “Candidates contest panchayat elections without using the symbol of a political party yet are endorsed by them. In Madhya Pradesh, the pattern largely has been that results of the Assembly elections are replicated in local elections,” he said.

‘Incomplete loan waiver’

“The smaller the electoral college, the more personality-centric the contest,” said Rasheed Kidwai, Visiting Fellow, the Observer Research Foundation. “Farmers, irrespective of their religious identity, at present feel the pinch due to an incomplete loan waiver promised by the Congress in the State.”

A virtual two-party system in the State however, added Mr. Kidwai, forecloses the BJP option for Muslim aspirants now.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6lcauj/article30785968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10-MINORITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-fine-tunes-muslim-outreach-ahead-of-mp-polls/article30785969.ece
243,2020/02/10,Sonia’s intervention sought to scrap power purchase pacts,"Accusing the ruling Congress government in Punjab of not fulfilling its election promise of scrapping or reviewing the Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with private thermal power plants, which were entered into by the previous SAD-BJP government, Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and MLA Aman Arora has sought Congress president Sonia Gandhi's intervention in the matter.

Mr. Arora in a letter to Ms. Gandhi has demanded that she should direct Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to fulfil the election promise and scrap the power agreements.

Mr. Arora said that Punjab Pradesh Congress Party had in its 2017 Vidhan Sabha election manifesto promised that the party upon forming government in the State shall scrap or review the Power Purchase Agreements with 3 private thermal power plants, which were entered into by the previous SAD-BJP regime.

“But nothing in this direction has been done even though the government is about to complete three years in power,” he said.

‘Govt. favouring firms’

In the letter, Mr. Arora said that the AAP has been raising this issue since the formation of the Congress government but instead of acting and safeguarding the interests of the people of the State, the government has chosen to protect the interests of the private companies, resulting in steep electricity tariff hike.

Mr. Arora added that even some Congress leaders have demanded scrapping of the power agreements yet the ruling government is indifferent towards the plight of people.

“I seek your intervention into the matter to prevail upon Chief Minister of Punjab to listen to at least his senior party and government colleagues..,if not us at AAP, to fulfill his manifesto promise by scrapping these power agreements, else the people of the State will scrap agreement of power given to the Congress in 2022,” the AAP leader said in the letter.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sonias-intervention-sought-to-scrap-power-purchase-pacts/article30785951.ece
244,2020/02/10,Surety bonds of AMU students seized by district administration,"The Aligarh district administration has seized the surety bonds of ₹1 lakh each of two students and two former students of AMU which they had signed prior to the December 15 violence on campus, when police action inside the university left several students injured.

Additional city magistrate Ranjit Singh said the students signed the surety bonds of ₹1 lakh each under Section 107 of the CrPC assuring that they would maintain peace in the city. However, they were allegedly found to be involved in the December 15 violence.

The former students whose bonds have been seized are former secretary of the AMU Students’ Union Huzaifa Aamir and its former vice-president Hamza Sufiyan. Those pursuing studies include Salman Imtiaz, former president of AMUSU, who is a research scholar at present.

While Mr. Sufiyan confirmed the notice has been served, Mr. Imtiaz said he was yet to receive it. “I am only an accused right now. The case is in High Court. The bond has been seized on mere apprehension.”

On Monday, students condemned the police action against anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters in Kanpur and Delhi.

In a related development, denying a report carried in a local newspaper, the AMU administration has clarified that the Vice-Chancellor didn’t participate in a videoconference with the U.P. Chief Minister on the situation in the university and the Shahjamal area.

Meanwhile, responding to the ongoing anti-CAA protests in the Shahjamal area of Aligarh, two BJP leaders have made offensive remarks.

MP Satish Gautam said social activist Sumaiyya Rana should go to Pakistan if she was feeling suffocated in India. He was responding to her comment while addressing protesting women at the Idgah ground of Shahjamal that the Uttar Pradesh government had used coercive measures in a bid to crush the anti-CAA stir. Mr. Gautam also said those students who were protesting in Aligarh Muslim University would not be seen in the next session.

Ban burqa: Minister

Earlier, Raghuraj Singh, Minister of State in the Yogi Adityanath government, said during a programme in Aligarh that “burqa should be banned”. Tracing the mythology of burqa, Mr. Singh said it was an Arab practice. “Those whose nose was cut by Lakshman [in Ramayana] follow this practice. They are descendants of demons.

245,2020/02/10,J&K govt.'s Public Safety Act dossier describes Omar Abdullah as radical,"The Jammu and Kashmir government’s Public Safety Act dossiers against National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti describe the former as a man of “radical methodology” and the latter as 14th century queen Kota Rani.

The dossier says that for her “dangerous and insidious machination and usurping nature”, Ms. Mufti is referred to as “Daddy’s girl” and “Kota Rani” by people. Kota Rani “rose to power by virtue of undertaking intrigues ranging from poisoning of her opponents to ponyardings,” it reads while mentioned her tweets opposing the Centre's moves on the issue of triple talaq.

'A scheming person'

The dossier describes her as “a hard-headed” and “scheming person”. “Her actions have been ranging from speeches glorifying militants to creating fears among the majority population based on cheap politics,” it read.

Scores of tweets have been mentioned in the dossier, which the J&K police alleged was aimed “at inciting masses to create issues of disturbance in public order and demoralising security forces by making unscrupulous statements”.

Omar Abdullah, who served as an External Affairs Minister in the National Democratic Alliance government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, according to the dossier, removed all curtains and resorted to dirty politics by adopting a radical methodology by way of instigating and provoking the general masses against the policies of the Centre and revocation of Article 370.

“Despite being a mainstream leader, he has been planning and projecting his activities against the union of India under the guise of politics, and while enjoying the support of gullible masses, he has been successful in execution of such activities,” it reads.

Meanwhile, Mr. Abdullah's sister Hinna Abdullah, reacting to the PSA, said: “What are you so scared of?”

Ms. Mufti’s daughter Iltija also reacted sharply to the wording of the dossier. “Since when has being a ‘Daddy's girl’ and encouraging people to vote become a crime against the nation? It’s pretty clear that the government has no basis for charging Mr. Abdullah and Ms. Mufti with the PSA. They must be freed,” said Ms. Iltija.

Hilarious, says Tarigami

CPI (M) leader M.Y. Tarigami termed the PSA dossier “hilarous”.

“Is it a crime to have influence over voters and convince them to vote despite threats by militants and separatists? It shows the BJP government has lost the plot in Kashmir and in desperation it is taking such steps,” said Mr. Tarigami",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xyrx3/article30785914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10-OMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mehboobas-daughter-reacts-sharply-to-jk-psa-dossier/article30785915.ece
246,2020/02/10,Woman driver in Navi Mumbai sacked over TikTok video,"The contract of a Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) driver was terminated after a TikTok video featuring her dance inside a bus, went viral. The driver, Yogita Mane, was terminated on January 31.

Ms. Mane, one of the two woman drivers for NMMT Tejaswini special buses, had reportedly danced inside the bus during her rest period after reaching Ghansoli depot.

“After we learnt of the video, we suspended the contract. The video was created during duty hours, in uniform and inside the bus, which is not acceptable. It is unprofessional conduct and gives out the wrong message,” Navi Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Annasaheb Misal said.

In the 18-second video, Ms. Mane is seen dancing to a Marathi folk song, ‘Aai babachi ladki mi gaura mala havay chikna navra’. The video is uploaded to an account under the name pritigawai43.

Meanwhile, Ms. Mane said, “The video was not made by me. Priti Gawai, a woman autorickshaw driver with whom we often chat during break time, had made the video and uploaded to her account. I had warned her before as well not to shoot my videos when I am in uniform, yet she did that. After this incident, she has deleted her TikTok account. None of the NMMT officers are ready to hear me out. I have been knocking on their doors, but no one pays attention. I am done begging before them. I am a woman driver of bus and am proud of my capability. I haven’t had a single accident in the last one year and my record is clean. I am sure I won’t be jobless for long.”

Ms. Mane had joined NMMT on contract basis last year when the Tejaswini buses were launched.

Meant to be women-only buses, the vehicles were to have women conductors and drivers, but received no response and ended up having only two female drivers, of which now one has been terminated.

The buses run only for women on seven routes during morning and evening peak hours, and are open for all during the rest of the day.

247,2020/02/10,Shaheen Bagh inspires Rajasthan towns,"Inspired by Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest, the indefinite sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Shaheed Smarak here entered 11th day on Monday, with the participating men being outnumbered by women. The protests have also been replicated in several towns of Rajasthan.

Held under the banner of Samvidhan Evum Loktantra Bachao Abhiyan, the protest in Jaipur has drawn the participants from the Walled City neighbourhoods as well as the posh residential colonies. Two young girls, Nishat Fatima and Hadiya, dressed in the national tricolour, were the centre of attraction at the venue.

Women take lead

Though the representatives of various groups have been coming to extend their support to protesters, women have taken the lead in managing the affairs at the venue, situated just outside the Police Commissioner’s office. After the initial scepticism, though permission was obtained through official channels, policemen watch the proceedings with interest and have ensured security of the park.

Creative ways

The participants have devised creative ways of protest every day and rendered poems, songs and slogans on different themes to make the agitation attractive. The protesters celebrated birthday of Guru Ravidas, the mystic poet-saint of the Bhakti movement, at the venue on Sunday.

Bhim Army leader Neelam Kranti said the BJP government at the Centre wanted to divide the citizens on religious lines through the CAA and the NRC, but the common people would not allow this to happen. “We are here not just to save our Constitution, but also to protect our diversity which has kept the country united after Independence,” she said.

Paudi Kumari from the Assam unit of All India Progressive Women’s Association threw light on the hardships faced by people in her State during the preparation of the NRC, which, she said, had turned out to be a “futile exercise.” Communist Party of India’s Sumitra Chopra said the agitation would continue until the government repealed the CAA and announced in clear terms that it had no intention to bring in NRC as well as the National Population Register.

Blood donation camp

Similar round-the-clock protests have started in the towns such as Chittorgarh, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Kota and Sikar. While a blood donation camp was organised at the protest venue in Kota, situated near Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s residence, a candle march was held and black balloons were released in the sky in Sikar.

Sikar-based activist Ashfaq Kayamkhani said the protesters were expecting the ruling Congress leaders to come and assure them of the State government’s support, especially after the Assembly passed a resolution against the CAA last month. While former CPI(M) MLA Amra Ram addressed the gathering in Sikar, Congress MLA Amin Kagzi came to Shaheed Smarak here on Sunday and delivered a speech.

Reading of Preamble

The iconic Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur is also a venue for two-hour anti-CAA protest every day. Braving chilly winds, women and children have been joining the protest every evening since January 2. Their agitation concludes with a reading of the Preamble to the Constitution in the presence of Indian and foreign tourists visiting the 130-year-old museum.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vc9sqs/article30785245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAIPURCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shaheen-bagh-inspires-rajasthan-towns/article30785246.ece
248,2020/02/10,Uttar Pradesh BJP leader seeks ban on burqa,"A BJP leader on Monday demanded a ban on burqa, calling it a security threat and provocatively linking it to demon king Ravana’s sister Surpanakha.

“Burqa should be banned in the country as has been done in several other countries,” Raghuraj Singh, who holds a rank equivalent to a Minister of State in the Uttar Pradesh government, told reporters.

Mr. Singh claimed burqa is not worn in countries such as Sri Lanka, China, the U.S. and Canada and said it should be banned in India as terrorists can take advantage of it.

The BJP leader said people are sporting burqas in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest against the new citizenship law, and added, the burqa helps terrorists, thieves and anti-socials elements to hide behind it.

“Burqa is a threat to national security and has to be banned to crush terrorism,” Mr. Singh said.

Without citing his source, Mr. Singh linked burqa to Surpanakha, the demon who has her face disfigured in Ramayana. According to Mr. Singh’s version, Surpanakha fled to hide in the Arab desert.

As her nose and ears were chopped, she used a burqa to hide her face,” he said, adding it is not necessary for humans.

“In Mecca, a shivalinga was set up by Guru Shukracharya, who was the guru of devils, and from there the burqa tradition started,” he said.

“This is Hindustan and it will be run as per traditions of the Hindus. This is our wish,” he said.

Mr. Singh, who is part of a cell attached to Uttar Pradesh government’s Labour Department, courted controversy earlier by threatening to bury alive Aligarh Muslim University students for raising slogans against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Bharatiya Janata Party’s Aligarh unit spokesperson said Mr. Singh holds the rank equivalent to a Minister of State in the Uttar Pradesh government.

249,2020/02/10,1993 Mumbai serial blasts accused nabbed by Gujarat ATS in drug case,"A prime accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, who is a close associate of the terror attack’s key conspirator Tiger Memon, was arrested from the airport in Maharashtra’s capital by the Gujarat ATS in a drug seizure case, a senior official said on Monday.

Munaf Halari was arrested from the Mumbai international airport on late Sunday night by a team of the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), he said.

The 55-year-old, travelling on a Pakistani passport, had arrived from Nairobi and was supposed to catch a Dubai- bound flight from Mumbai, said Assistant Commissioner of Police (ATS) K.K. Patel.

Halari is wanted in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts in which around 260 people were killed and more than 700 injured in what was one of the worst terror attacks in India.

Halari was on the radar of the Gujarat ATS following the arrest of five Pakistani nationals in January off the Gujarat coast with drugs worth ₹175 crore, he said.

The questioning of the Pakistani nationals had revealed the role of Halari in drug smuggling, the ACP told reporters at Gujarat ATS headquarters.

“Munaf Halari is also a prime accused in the Mumbai serial blasts case of 1993 in which a Red Corner Notice had been issued against him. He had played a vital role in the serial blasts. Halari is a close associate of Tiger Memon, one of the main conspirators of the serial blasts [Memon is yet to be arrested],” said Mr. Patel.

“Munaf Halari had procured three brand new scooters which were laden with explosives, of which one was parked at Zaveri Bazar [one of the blast sites in Mumbai].

“After the blasts, he first fled to Bangkok. Tiger Memon got a Pakistani passport prepared for Halari with the help of Pakistani authorities. His Pakistani passport is in the name of Anwar Muhammad,” said the Gujarat ATS officer.

Though a RCN had been issued against him, Halari entered India two times on Pakistani passport after going into hiding in 1993, he said.

A Red Corner Notice is a kind of international arrest warrant for fugitives where Interpol requests its member countries to arrest or detain them, Mr. Patel said.

Halari last entered India in 2014 from Pakistan through the Wagah-Attari border in Punjab and visited Mumbai, from where he hails, he said.

The Gujarat ATS has seized his Pakistani passport, which was renewed two times by authorities in the neighbouring country, said Mr. Patel.

“With the help of Tiger Memon, Halari then settled in Nairobi, the capital Kenya where he started a business under his new identity of a Pakistani National.

“On instructions of Tiger Memon, he entered into the business of export-import of foodgrains. However, his main intention behind starting this business was to smuggle explosives and contraband into India,” said the ATS officer.

The interrogation of the five Pakistani nationals arrested in January with drugs had revealed the consignment belonged to one Haji Hasan of Karachi, who was in touch with Halari, Mr. Patel said.

Hasan had even promised to smuggle explosives into Gujarat through the coast, said Mr. Patel.

The accused will be produced before a court for remand, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wrorks/article19635549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mumbai-blastjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1993-mumbai-serial-blasts-accused-nabbed-by-gujarat-ats-in-drug-case/article30784429.ece

The NHRC issued notices to the Chief Secretary of the UP government and the DGP on January 29, giving them six weeks to respond to the complaint given by the Congress delegation, including Ms. Vadra, who visited it on January 27. According to the proceedings, the Congress delegation asked for an enquiry into the police action.

“It is mentioned in the communication [Congress complaint] that the state of Uttar Pradesh has been at the centre of the movement against the alleged unconstitutional premise and implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC),” the NHRC observed.

252,2020/02/10,"After intense Pakistan firing, J&K authorities advise people to not touch mortar shells","Authorities on Monday asked the residents of Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district to avoid unnecessary movement during shelling and to not touch the mortar shells lying scattered in various localities, after two days of intense firing by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC).

The heavy shelling of mortar bombs from across the border killed a soldier on February 8. There was no report of ceasefire violation by Pakistan after 8 p.m. on February 9, officials said.

The heavy shelling of mortar bombs from across the border also triggered a forest fire in Mendhar sector and efforts are on to douse the flames, they said.

Naik Rajeev Singh Shekhawat, 36, was killed and three others were injured in the intense Pakistani firing in Degwar sector on February 8, while several residential houses and cattle sheds suffered damages in heavy shelling in Mendhar and Balakot sectors on the following day.

“The Pakistani guns fell silent around 8 p.m. and there was no report of ceasefire violation by Pakistan from anywhere along the LoC,” an army official said.

He said the Pakistan Army used artillery guns and long-range mortar bombs to target forward posts and villages in the three sectors in the past two days. The Indian Army retaliated befittingly, resulting in a number of casualties on Pakistani side.

He said the Army guarding the LoC are on high alert and keeping a close vigil as Pakistan is using the cross-border shelling to push terrorists into this side.

“The district administration has advised people to remain cautious and avoid unnecessary movement during shelling,” a police official said, adding that the local residents have also been directed to not touch the mortar shells lying scattered in different localities.

Nearly a dozen shells failed to explode during the cross-border shelling and are being defused by experts, he said.

“We are lucky to survive the intense shelling by Pakistan on Sunday. Life has become a virtual hell for the border residents due to frequent cross-border shelling,” Mohammad Aslam, 68, a resident of Drana village of Mendhar told the PTI on phone.

He said the situation is peaceful today but nobody knows when the guns start roaring again.

“We appeal to the government to speed up the work on the community and individual bunkers for our safety. The 15 community bunkers and a few individual bunkers have been sanctioned for our village but only one had got completed so far while the work on the others is going on,” he said.

Aslam said he, along with his family, hid inside their house to escape the intense shelling.

“It is the grace of the Almighty that nobody in our village was hit despite heavy shelling,” he said and demanded more individual bunkers to cover all residents in the village given its proximity to the LoC and frequent ceasefire violations from across the border.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r4ts18/article30783707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10IN-MORTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/after-intense-pakistan-firing-jk-authorities-advise-people-not-to-touch-mortar-shells/article30783630.ece

Discharge of duty

“In case any official supposed to give acknowledgement, during discharge of his or her duties, refuses to give acknowledgement, such conduct may be treated as misconduct and suitable action will be initiated,” the letter says.

This transformation in official dealings has not come about by itself. It is the result of one man’s 16-year-long struggle to hold the administration accountable. Meet Baghambar Patnaik, a septuagenarian Dalit rights activist, who single-handedly ensured the implementation of the Right To Acknowledgement in the State.

In 2004, the Puri district administration had denied receiving a letter from Mr. Patnaik, who was working on the issue of bonded labour issue. He smelt foul play and was of the firm view that the administration had played mischief and wilfully misplaced his application. On a subsequent occasion, the activist demanded acknowledgement of his letter, submitted at the office of the District Magistrate. The office refused to do so.

Similar situation

Mr. Patnaik found similar situations prevailing in almost all offices and public authorities. He knocked at the doors of the Lokpal, seeking a general direction for all offices to acknowledge receiving letters or documents. The Lokpal deemed that applications not kept in the concerned file, or lost, being the cause of maladministration, issued directions to offices to provide stamped slips containing diary numbers on receipt of applications, letters or documents from the general public. It forced the government to come up with a guideline.

To ensure that the Lokpal’s direction, and subsequent guidelines issued by the government, reached line departments, he kept filing hundreds of Right to Information (RTI) applications at State and District level offices, seeking to know if applications from the general public were acknowledged. This created pressure on departments for the issue of instructions to field level offices.

‘Important step’

“The right to acknowledgement is an important step in achieving transparency in administration. Without any proof of submission of the document, one cannot pursue one’s case,” said Mr. Patnaik.

However, over the years, complacency set in, with the administration again refusing to acknowledge the applications it received. Mr. Patnaik was not one to stay quiet. He again moved the Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC), which directed the State government to implement the Right To Acknowledgement in all offices.

In the wake of the OHRC’s stricture, the GAPGD issued a stern warning to treat refusal of acknowledgement as official misconduct.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article10534214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/offices,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/16-year-long-struggle-to-make-government-offices-accountable-pays-off-in-odisha/article30783368.ece
255,2020/02/10,"In a first, India Post to start digital parcel locker service","India Post has decided to help those who often miss out receiving parcels because they are away at work and have no one at home to receive the consignment on their behalf.

By the end of this month, the Kolkata Circle will launch a free digital parcel locker service in the city so that addressees can collect their packets from lockers in specified post offices at their convenience.

“The locker system is common in several countries in the southeast Asia and in Europe. Now it is going to be introduced in India, starting with Kolkata,” Postmaster General (Kolkata Circle) Amitabh Singh told The Hindu.

To begin with, the facility will be available in two post offices, one in New Town and another in Sector 5 of the Salt Lake City. These are two neighbourhoods where most I-T companies are concentrated and where hundreds of professionals from other cities live and work. They are usually not home when the postman arrives, and many of them don’t like to receive personal consignments at their workplaces.

“The service will save us the trouble of sending the postman to the same address with the same parcel again and again,” Mr. Singh said.

The addressee will have to give a locker number as the address, upon which India Post will drop the parcel into the locker. It will remain accessible for seven days — any time of the day — through an OTP. “There will be no human involvement. The receiver can just walk into the post office, any time of the day or night, and open the locker with the help of the OTP.”

The facility will be available, as of now, only for consignments received through registered post or speed post. “But going forward, we may consider extending it to even private courier companies. Just like you can use an ICICI card in a HDFC ATM, you can collect a consignment delivered by another courier from an India Post locker.”

Mr. Singh also didn’t rule out the possibility — in the near future — of buyers putting down a locker number as their address when making purchases from Amazon. India Post is already the most preferred courier agent for Amazon in eastern India and such a tie-up with Amazon will not only be beneficial to the customer but also bring revenue to the government. It will also save the Amazon delivery agent the trouble of returning to the addressee’s doorstep with the same consignment.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c63e09/article30783261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10IN-INDIAPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-a-first-india-post-to-start-digital-parcel-locker-service/article30783262.ece

Health Minister Naba Das announced the establishment of a burns unit at MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur after seven seriously injured persons could not be treated there for lack of facilities. They had to be taken to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.

Two of the suspended engineers were working for SOUTHCO Utility, a power distribution company, and the others were attached to the Rural Development Department.

After a high-level meeting in Bhubaneswar, Energy Minister Dibya Sankar Mishra said the height of all 11KV power cables would be increased to 20 feet.

The accident occurred at Mendarajpur when the bus was carrying 40 passengers from Dankalpadu to Chikarada for an engagement ceremony.

Transport Minister Padmanabh Behera blamed the Energy Department and the bus driver for the accident. SOUTHCO released a report, blaming the accident on the Rural Development Department. The report said the Rural Development Department had concretised the road in 2018, increasing its height by 3 to 4 feet, and since then, SOUTHCO had been asking it for the money required to increase the height of the cable.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n1glqa/article30783222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Odisha-Bus-accident,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ganjam-bus-tragedy-odisha-government-suspends-four-engineers/article30783148.ece
257,2020/02/10,"Cong. reneging on promise to scrap Power Purchase Agreements, says AAP","Accusing the Congress government in Punjab of not fulfilling its election promise of scrapping or reviewing the Power Purchase Agreements with private thermal power plants, which were entered into by the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janta Party, Aam Aadmi Party leader and MLA Aman Arora has sought Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s intervention in the matter.

Mr. Arora in a letter to Ms. Gandhi demanded that she should direct Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to fulfil the election promise and scrap the agreements.

Mr. Arora wrote that the Punjab Pradesh Congress Party had in its 2017 Vidhan Sabha election manifesto promised that it would scrap or review the anti-Punjab agreements with three private power plants but nothing in this direction had been done though the government was about to complete three years in power.

Mr. Arora said the AAP had been raising the issue since the formation of the Congress government but instead of securing the interests of the people of the State, the government had chosen to protect the interests of the private companies and follow the dotted lines drawn by the SAD-BJP dispensation, resulting in steep electricity tariff hike.

Mr. Arora said even a few Congress leaders had demanded scrapping of the agreements.

“I seek your indulgence in the matter to prevail upon and issue directions to the Chief Minister to listen to at least his senior party and government colleagues..if not us in the AAP, to fulfil his manifesto promise of scrapping these agreements. Otherwise, the people of the State will scrap the agreement of power given to the Congress in 2022,” he wrote to Ms. Gandhi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m36glg/article30783075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMANARORA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-reneging-on-promise-to-scrap-power-purchase-agreements-says-aap/article30783076.ece
258,2020/02/10,FIR lodged against 21 anti-CAA protesters at Lucknow,"Twenty-one persons, half of them women, have been booked for alleged rioting and assault during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at Lucknow’s Hussainabad Clocktower.

A First Information Report (FIR) was registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police against 21 persons and hundreds of unidentified persons for allegedly raising “provocative” slogans and holding up traffic during the ‘Lucknow chalo’ event at the protest site on Sunday.

Several activists had given the call for the ‘Lucknow chalo’ rally and asked people from outside to attend the protests, which have been going on since January 17.

‘Provocative slogans’

The police said that the event was being publicised on social media, and personally by people, for the past four-five days. On the morning of February 9, hundreds of men and women turned up at the venue and started protesting against the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the police said in its FIR.

The protesters also distributed pamphlets saying “Hallabol Lucknow” and “Lucknow chalo”, and caused a traffic jam near the Clocktower by parking their vehicles randomly, police said.

The protesters raised “provocative” and “inflammatory” slogans, led a march around the Clocktower, and when the police tried to stop them, they pushed the police personnel and moved ahead, the FIR said.

Caused ‘chaos’

This caused “chaos” and a traffic jam near the Ghantaghar (Clocktower), said the police FIR lodged at the Thakurganj Police Station.

Among those named in the FIR are advocate Mohammad Shoaib, who heads the civil rights group Rihai Manch, Congress worker Sadaf Jafar and Dalit leader P. C. Kureel.

The FIR invoked Sections 147 (rioting), 145 (joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing it has been commanded to disperse), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.

261,2020/02/10,"West Bengal budget | Pension for SCs and STs, free electricity for the poor in Bengal Budget","A year before West Bengal goes to the polls, Finance Minister Amit Mitra on Monday introduced new pension schemes for the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, free electricity to the poor and a housing scheme for the tea garden workers.

The highest allocation of ₹2,500 crore was made for the Bandhu Prakalpa for providing ₹1,000 as monthly pension to the persons from the SC community above 60 years not covered under any other pension scheme.

The allocation for pensions to the STs titled Jai Johar Prakalpa was ₹500 crore. Under the Hasir Alo scheme, no electricity tariff will be charged from customers whose quarterly consumption is less than 75 units (₹200 crore allocated) and ₹500 crore had been allocated for providing housing to workers of the tea gardens under the Chaa Sundari scheme.

The schemes in the last full Budget of the Trinamool Congress government before the 2021 Assembly polls targeted those who are living in areas where the ruling party had suffered losses in the Lok Sabha poll, Budget observers opined.

Mr. Mitra also made a provision for provident fund for the unorganised sector, incentives for the MSME and announced 100 MSME parks in the next three years to generate employment. The allocation to the newly announced schemes primarily targeting the social sector and creating employment through MSMEs was ₹5,165 crore. The Budget outlay for 2020-21 was ₹2,55,677 crore. Revenue receipts for 2019-2020 (revised numbers) was ₹1,63,259 crore which include State tax and non-tax revenue, share of Union taxes and duties and grants-in aid (from the Centre). Revenue receipts projections for 2020-21 stood at ₹1,79,398 crore.

For the current fiscal, the outstanding debt (including PF, Reserve Fund and Deposits) is expected to witness a 10% jump to ₹4,74,831 crore against the ₹4,31,786 crore for 2019-20.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described it as a “pro-people budget” and said not a single family would be “left behind” after the implementation of the pension schemes for the SC and the ST communities. She said the Centre had denied the State government ₹1 lakh crore in various segments which includes the GST dues and grants. She urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government to work together with the Opposition parties and refrain from the “politics of vendetta” to revive the economy.

266,2020/02/10,Woman lecturer set on fire by stalker dies in Nagpur,"The 25-year-old woman lecturer who was set on fire by a stalker in Maharashtra’s Wardha district last week died at a hospital in Nagpur on Monday morning, a police official said.

Ankita Pisudde, resident of Hinganghat town in Wardha, had been critical after sustaining 35 to 40% “grade III” burns on February 3 when she was set afire allegedly by one Vikesh Nagrale (27) while she was on way to her college, they said.

She was undergoing treatment at the Orange City Hospital & Research Centre here, located around 75 km from Wardha.

“Doctors at the hospital declared her dead at 6.55 a.m. today,” Hinganghat’s police inspector Satyaveer Bandiwar said.

The woman sustained deep burn injuries on scalp, face, right upper limb, left hand, upper back, neck and eyes along with severe inhalational injuries, the hospital said in a medical bulletin on Monday.

She died of “septicemic shock” after suffering from deep dermal burns along with severe inhalational injuries, respiratory distress and related complications, it said.

Around 4 a.m. on Monday, her oxygen levels deteriorated inspite of ventilator support, coupled with decreasing urine output and reduction in blood pressure, the hospital said.

Crowds look on as the body of Hinganghat lecturer from Wardha district Ankita Pissude is being brought out of a hospital after she died of burns, set afire allegedly by a stalker, Nagpur, February 10, 2020 | Photo Credit: The Hindu

As part of immediate resuscitation measures, medicines were escalated to maintain the blood pressure and all feasible steps were taken to improve the oxygen levels in blood, but the patient remained “extremely critical”, it said.

“Around 6.30 a.m., she had bradycardia and inspite of prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient could not be revived and was declared dead at 6.55 a.m.,” it said.

The probable cause of death was “septicemic shock”, the bulletin added.

During her treatment, she underwent tracheostomy (creating an opening in neck to place a tube into the windpipe to allow air to enter the lungs), burn dressings, debridement and escharotomies, the hospital informed.

Debridement is a medical procedure to remove dead, damaged or infected tissue, while escharotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat full-thickness (third-degree) circumferential burns.

The woman’s parents and uncle were kept informed about her deteriorating health condition and death, the hospital said, adding that the body was later handed over to police for postmortem and other formalities.

After the woman’s condition deteriorated, the hospital informed about her critical status to Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, Wardha Guardian Minister Sunil Kedar, Nagpur Divisional Commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, Police Commissioner Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, Wardha Collector Vivek Bhimanwar and Wardha Superintendent of Police Basavraj Teli.

Heavy security was deployed in Hinganghat to avoid any law and order problem following her death, the police said.

Several locals, mostly women and college students, took out a march in Wardha city last Thursday, demanding death penalty for the accused.

Home Minister Deshmukh visited the hospital on Tuesday and announced that the accused’s trial would be fast-tracked.

The State government last week flew Navi Mumbai-based National Burns Centre director Sunil Keswani to Nagpur to supervise the woman’s treatment.

It has also appointed well-known lawyer Ujjwal Nikam as special public prosecutor in the case.

According to the victim’s relatives, Nagrale, who was arrested within hours of the incident on February 3, had been harassing her for quite some time.

Nagrale and the woman were friends till two years ago when she severed ties with him due to his “irrational behaviour”, the police earlier said.

267,2020/02/10,Odisha plans projects in Naxal stronghold,"After the security forces made their presence felt in Swabhiman Anchal, a stronghold of CPI (Maoist), in Odisha’s Malkangiri district, the State government has lined up development projects, including livelihood programmes and irrigation facilities, besides critical road networks for the region.

Swabhiman Anchal remained outside the ambit of development for years due to its remoteness, poor connectivity, hilly and inhospitable terrain and above all the presence of outlawed left wing extremists.

Integrated farming

The administration has decided to promote turmeric cultivation by replacing prohibited cannabis cultivation while all nine gram panchayats will be covered under integrated farming.

Avoiding top-down approach in development, the government has taken a decision to listen to locals who understand ground situation better than others. A five-day workshop has been proposed at the Gopabandhu Academy of Administration at Bhubaneswar.

According to proceedings of a meeting held recently under the chairmanship of the State Development Commissioner, implementation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) will be given priority before embarking on path of development.

Approval and sanction of community forest rights (CFR) and individual forest rights (IFR) under the FRA will be taken up in the mission mode. Prompt sanction of titles under the FRA is seen as a confidence building measure in Swabhiman Anchal. The government will emulate model of Maharashtra where CFR has been granted in expeditious manner for making tribals partners in development. People of Swabhiman Anchal are likely to be taken to Maharashtra for field visit.

Millet cultivation

The administration is contemplating to take up millet cultivation in the region in a big way and procure surplus produces from villages. It is proposed to open a farmer resource centre at Badapada to help avail different scheme services in Swabhiman Anchal.

For overall development, a plan has been mooted to install lift irrigation points alongside the Balimela reservoir basin so that irrigation facilities could be made available round the year. The administration proposed to provide an 11-kv power line exclusively for irrigation projects.

The Odisha police have claimed to have established their domination in 70% of Swabhiman Anchal which was considered as a liberated zone by the Left ultras. Along with the Odisha police and their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh, paramilitary forces such as BSF and CRPF are deployed in the cut-off area consisting of 151 villages, encircled by a water channel from three sides.

One and half years ago, the Odisha government managed to construct a bridge over the Gurupriya River despite stiff resistance from the extremists, ending decades-old remoteness. The bridge linked the cut-off area with mainland. Security forces have been providing protection to lay roads in the region. As the pace of development picked up, villagers confronted with left wing extremists on January 25 and in the brawl, a Naxal had died.

In a statement, DGP Dinkar Gupta said the matter of banning the controversial movie was discussed with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday, along with a proposal from ADGP Intelligence Varinder Kumar to ban it. The movie trailer, released on January 18, suggested that the film was highly radical.

The Chief Minister had also directed the DGP to look into possible action that could be initiated against one of the producers, KV Dhillon, who had reportedly promised in writing, back in 2019, that he would shelve the movie, originally titled Sukha Khalwan. The DGP had also been asked to look into the role of the promoters, directors and actors.

The statement said the producer had earlier given his commitment after the Mohali police received a complaint about the movie glorifying gangster Kahlwan, who used to describe himself as ‘sharpshooter’ and was allegedly involved in more than 20 cases including murder, kidnapping and extortion.

269,2020/02/10,JKLF’s shutdown call hits life in Valley,"The authorities snapped the mobile Internet link in the Kashmir Valley on Sunday, as life was affected by the shut-down called by the banned Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hurriyat to mark the seventh anniversary of the execution of Parliament attack case convict Afzal Guru.

The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against the JKLF for calling the shut-down and circulating a statement on it.

Two journalists were also questioned for around five hours on Saturday for publishing the statement three days ago. It’s the first time since militancy broke out in the 1990s that journalists have been questioned for reporting the statements of banned separatist outfits.

“The JKLF is a banned organisation, and publishing its statement is a crime and would warrant an action from now. JKLF statements are aimed at creating a law and order situation, and threaten the peaceful atmosphere,” said Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir.

Mr. Vijay Kumar said the journalists were “questioned as required in the case registered against the JKLF” under Sections 10, 11 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

“The investigators sought details of our family, relatives and friends, besides information on how we received the statement,” said a journalist who was questioned.

The statement was circulated from the outfit’s official email account. The police said they were looking for JKLF affiliates that circulated “the statements, urging for violence in the forthcoming days”.

The JKLF was banned in March 2019 and its chief Yasin Malik was shifted to Tihar Jail. It resumed issuing statements a week ago, after remaining silent for around six months.

A police officer said the 2G Internet service was stopped “as a precaution”. The shut-down affected life in the Valley, where most markets remained closed and traffic thinned out.

270,2020/02/10,Nine-year-old girl in Shillong develops anti-bullying app,"Distraught over repeated bullying at school, a nine-year-old girl in Shillong has developed a mobile application which would enable a person to anonymously report such incidents to the authorities.

Meaidaibahun Majaw, a Class IV student, said she had taken it upon herself to find a solution to the menace after it started taking a toll on her well being.

“I experienced bullying in school since nursery. It affected me. I hated it so much that I was always on the lookout for a solution. No other child should have to go through the same,” Ms. Majaw said.

The app, which would soon be available on Google Play, allows victims, who do not want to reveal identities, to report their bullies to teachers, guardians and friends.

“Users can provide details of the incidents, including the name of the bully, and send the messages to individuals concerned. This allows the authorities to take necessary actions,” she explained.

Efforts appreciated

Her efforts have been appreciated by State Education Minister Lakmen Rymbui, who said that the girl would grow up to be a responsible citizen.

“I wish Meai the best in her endeavour to fight social ills. She will be a responsible citizen. I congratulate her parents too for guiding her,” Mr. Rymbui added.

A 2017 survey, conducted by The Teacher Foundation in association with Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS), found that 42% children in India are bullied in schools.

Recounting her experiences, the nine-year-old said that a group of students had once ganged up against her and asked other classmates to boycott her.

“One of them had stamped my feet,” she said, insisting that some of her friends too had faced similar predicaments at one point or the other.

Dasumarlin Majaw, her mother, said the girl had enrolled in an app-development course in September last year, and learned the skills within a few months.

Developed 40 apps

“She would attend classes for an hour every day. Before we knew, Meai had come up with 40 apps,” Ms. Dasumarlin, who runs a resort at Tyrna in East Khasi Hills, told PTI.

Ms. Majaw was hopeful that she would be among the young coding experts from India to have earned a scholarship for travelling to the Silicon Valley to meet investors.

“I have built another app which would help customers at our resort at Tyrna to place food orders without human intervention. There are several other apps that I am working on... Hopefully, experts will take note of my work,” the girl added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nine-year-old-girl-in-shillong-develops-anti-bullying-app/article30778492.ece

He said that his government has seized drugs worth over ₹2,000 crore in the last two and a half years. Besides, over five drug manufacturing makeshift factories were busted.

Over 100 drug offenders are in jail. He recalled how a foreign national was arrested in connection with the seizure of drugs valued over ₹400 crore.

272,2020/02/10,‘No harm in following tradition’,"Two days after he delivered his budget speech drafted by the State government, sticking to the convention, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday said there was no harm in following parampara (tradition), if all conditions are met with.

Speculation was rife that Mr. Dhankhar, who had frequent run-ins with the Mamata Banerjee government, might add or omit portions to the budget speech, after his request for changes in the text was rejected by the TMC government.

The Governor, while talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event, said the government had initially submitted the speech to him without any supporting document.

“I had said that it was not possible for me (to read out the speech) without going through those papers. The State Finance Minister [Amit Mitra] then met me and requested me to deliver the speech as per parampara (tradition) and the officials brought necessary documents,” he stated.

Mr. Dhankhar also insisted that he believed in “moving forward”. “There should be mutual trust between the two sides,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/zajkyk/article30778477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09DHANKHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-harm-in-following-tradition/article30778479.ece
273,2020/02/10,Omar Abdullah used politics to cover his radical ideology: Public Safety Act dossier,"Former Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah was “using politics as a cover for his radical ideology and for planning activities against the Union government” and “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths” posed a threat, according to the Public Safety Act (PSA) dossier prepared by the Jammu and Kashmir administration.

The PSA dossier, served to Mr. Abdullah on February 4, reads: “...Despite the fact that the subject has been a mainstream politician, he has been planning his activities against the Union of India under the guise of politics. And while enjoying the support of gullible masses, he has been successful in execution of such activities.”

Also Read Mehbooba Mufti was working with separatists: Public Safety Act dossier

Without citing any incidents or statements, the dossier accused Mr. Abdullah of “removing his cover and resorting to dirty politics, adopting a radical methodology by way of instigating general masses against the policies of the Central government” after the abrogation of Article 370 by the BJP-led Central government on August 5.

Mr. Abdullah, who in his tweet on August 4, 2019, appealed to people to maintain calm, was arrested on August 5 and remained in solitary confinement at the Hari Niwas palace, an infamous interrogation centre of 1990s that was turned into a sub-jail in August 2019.

To the people of Kashmir, we don’t know what is in store for us but I am a firm believer that what ever Almighty Allah has planned it is always for the better, we may not see it now but we must never doubt his ways. Good luck to everyone, stay safe & above all PLEASE STAY CALM. — Omar Abdullah (@OmarAbdullah) August 4, 2019

The capacity of Mr. Abdullah, 49, “to influence people for any cause can be gauged from the fact that he was able to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during peak of militancy and poll boycotts.”

Editorial | Extended folly: On invocation of PSA against Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti

With huge following on the micro blogging site Twitter, Mr. Abdullah’s dossier accused him of “opposing the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 and instigating people on Twitter against the unity and integrity of the nation.”

In jail for six months under Section 107 and 151, Mr. Abdullah under the PSA may be behind bars for from three months to two years without a trial.

274,2020/02/10,‘Only 82 trafficking survivors awarded relief in last 8 years’,"Highlighting the poor status of compensation awarded to survivors of human trafficking in the country, response obtained through RTI queries from 25 States and seven Union Territories reveal that between March 2011 and April 2019 only 82 such victims were awarded compensation.

However, between 2011 and 2018, the total number of cases of human trafficking recorded in the country, according to NCRB reports, was 35,983. This means, only 0.2% of all survivors of human trafficking received the compensation announced by the government in the last eight years.

The details of compensation awarded to survivors of trafficking have been ascertained on the basis of RTI applications filed by five lawyers across the country and the outcome of the response compiled in the form of report titled “UNCOMPENSATE VICTIMS”, which was released in Kolkata recently by Sanjog, a technical resource organisation that works to combat trafficking and gender-based violence.

Among the 82 survivors who were awarded compensation, only 77 received the relief amount. The State-wise details of the compensation awarded to the survivors show that 47 persons were awarded relief in Delhi, followed by 17 in Jharkhand, eight in Assam, three in West Bengal, two each in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Meghalaya. In Haryana, one survivor of trafficking was awarded compensation between 2011 and 2019.

“The Section 357-A of Code of Criminal Procedure has provisions to compensate victims who suffered because of a crime. In 2012, following the national outrage over the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, the government announced ₹1,000 crore fund to be used to combat sexual violence against persons – children or adults,” Pompi Banerjee, programme manager at Sanjog, said.

Nirbhaya fund

Ms. Banerjee, who is also a psychologist, added that part of the Nirbhaya fund is being used in the Victim Compensation Scheme – a national scheme to compensate survivors of rape, acid burns and trafficking among other forms of violence — for the last few years. The amount of compensation to victims of trafficking varies from State to State, she said, adding that in 2018, the Supreme Court directed NALSA (National Legal Services Authority ) to frame a standardised victim compensation scheme.

The study also reflects the number of trafficking survivors who applied for the victim compensation scheme to their respective legal services authority. While 107 individuals applied under the scheme, in 102 cases between 2011 and 2019, courts directed the authorities to release compensation. Twenty-eight persons applied for compensation in West Bengal, followed by 26 in Karnataka and Jharkhand. Fourteen persons in Assam applied for compensation while seven did the same in Delhi-NCR.

The study also suggests grave inconsistencies on the part of legal services authorities, which have provided the data.

“The data on Delhi is discrepant, with more survivors receiving compensation than those awarded compensation. Manipur’s 2019 victim compensation scheme does not even have an entry in the schedule corresponding to human trafficking,” Vipan Kumar, a lawyer who was part of the study, said.

Lack of awareness

The study also suggests that there remains a lack of information provided to survivors on victim compensation, lack of initiative on the part of legal services authority, low investment on part of legal aid that results in very few survivors having access to compensation.

In their study the researchers tracked the details of at least three case studies where the trafficking survivors had received compensation.

“Survivors were able to apply only when they were informed and a private lawyer was involved in assisting them in filing application for victim compensation,” the study said, highlighting that from their rescue till rehabilitation, the survivors are in touch with multiple agencies but none of them take any steps to help them get compensation. Researchers also pointed out that the “DLSA and SLSA’s response to the claims has been slow, and they hold the survivors’ claims with suspicion – often putting the burden of proof on the survivors themselves”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/t7fzdz/article30778463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/trafficking-case-786-cmx125-cmcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/only-82-trafficking-survivors-awarded-relief-in-last-8-years/article30778464.ece
275,2020/02/10,Punjab village fights drug addiction with youth power,"Punjab’s youth have opened a new front in the battle against drug addiction. Mansa district in the State is deploying youth energy to prevent idle time and potential addiction. They run campaigns on single-use plastics, stubble burning, tree planting, road safety, and against drugs. The motto: ‘mera pind-mera maan’ (my village, my pride).

About 10 km from the headquarters, in Bhai Desa village (population 1,700), the streets are clean and green, and the walls shout out positive messages — the work of youth volunteers.

Anti-plastic drive

At Bhai Desa, youngsters persuade a shopowner to discard plastic bags, to meet the village’s March target to go plastics-free.

They are members of Naujawaan Ekta Club. They are assured by Majorjeet Singh, the grocery shop owner, that his current stock of plastic bags will be his last. The club bagged the top award at the district level for community work on Republic Day.

“A year ago we decided to clean up, and paint the walls of all dwellings. Families contributed money. The sarpanch extended support. We planted over 5,000 trees, and started morning and evening walks to promote health. Women, children and elders joined in. Littering is prohibited,” says Balbir Singh, 40, the club’s patron.

“Drug addiction is a serious problem in Punjab. We want to save youth from its grip,” says Kewal Singh, 30, farmer, and club president. Deputy Commissioner Apneet Riyait launched the ‘mera pind-mera maan’ contests last year.

Mr. Kewal Singh says, “Already 70% of people here use cloth bags. Creating awareness of the hazardous effects of plastic is our priority. Also we are introducing scientific waste management. Mohali-based RoundGlass Foundation is giving us technological know-how. There are close to 270 houses in the village.”

Shopowner Majorjeet Singh believes that busy youngsters are not attracted to drugs. “We have six shops and none sells any tobacco-based products,” he says.

Applauding the club’s activities, sarpanch Harbans Singh says, “Youth in Punjab are trapped by drugs, but in my village there is negligible addiction.”

Stubble burning

“Stubble burning in the village is down by 60% in comparison to last season, and it is the result of the youth campaign,” he adds. There were similar contests last year too.

Ms. Riyait says wherever there was good synergy among the youth clubs and local panchayat or the sarpanch, the outcomes were encouraging. “Visits were made to the villages by government officials to monitor the work during the competition period, which ended on December 31,” she adds.

Naujawan Ekta Club Bhai Desa and Bhai Kanhaiya Club Burj Dhilwan were awarded certificates and cash prize of ₹ 5 lakh each on January 26.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/285u6a/article30778040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANSA-VILLAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-village-fights-drug-addiction-with-youth-power/article30778041.ece
276,2020/02/10,"The real challenge starts now, says Jwala","Yashasvi Jaiswal’s face on Sunday night after accepting the Player-of-the-Tournament award minutes after the ICC Under-19 World Cup final ended, told a story.

There wasn’t an iota of excitement on the teenager’s face. Instead, despite finishing the final against Bangladesh, and the tournament, as the highest run-getter, a disappointed look was written large over Jaiswal’s face. The pain of not holding the cup that mattered to future stars was evident on his face.

On Monday morning, however, Yashasvi was in a slightly cheerful mood, according to his mentor Jwala Singh. “When I spoke with him in the morning, he was obviously still upset with the team’s loss but he has seen so many ups and downs that I am sure he will be able to celebrate his individual achievement soon,” Jwala, a maidan cricketer-turned-coach, told The Hindu.

At a tender age, the boy who moved from Bhadohi near Varanasi to Mumbai to realise his dream of playing cricket on the biggest stage has seen more in life than most kids his age. With little financial support from his parents, Yashasvi would sleep in a tent at Azad Maidan, after training. At times, he would also sell chaat on pavements to make a quick buck and earn a meal.

Once Jwala spotted him, things changed. The coach spotted his talent, helped him get a home, and ensured he got the right support — technical and nutritional — and most importantly, exposure.

Still, with the kind of struggle Yashasvi has seen, his early days are often talked about more than his exploits on the field. Even before heading to South Africa with the Under-19 team, Yashasvi had shown a glimpse of talent at the highest level when he became the youngest List A double centurion in the world — he tore through a Jharkhand attack comprising Varun Aaron and Shahbaz Nadeem en route a classy 203 for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Jwala said he is “satisfied” with his ward’s performance — “both with the bat and the ball” — but insists it’s just the beginning. “The real challenge starts now. It’s the end of age-group cricket and he realises that we have to work harder to achieve the real goal (of playing for India). I am sure he has it him and we shall start working as soon as he returns on Wednesday.”

Despite the disappointment of missing out on the champion’s trophy, for now, Yashasvi can revel in having become the fifth Indian — all four of his predecessors went on to represent India in international cricket — to be crowned the Player-of-the-Tournament.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dccr2m/article30785726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11YASH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/the-real-challenge-starts-now-says-jwala/article30785727.ece
277,2020/02/10,Have presented a detailed account: India manager,"The scenes at the Senwes Park in Potchefstroom indicated that cricket will be far from being a gentleman’s game. After all, instead of shaking hands immediately after a thrilling Under-19 World Cup final, India and Bangladesh cricketers were involved in an ugly spat.

While the host broadcaster understandably didn’t show the footage, videos that surfaced on social media indicated that there wasn’t just some in-your-face celebration from Bangladesh cricketers but it was also followed up with pushing and shoving among players. In fact, the customary handshakes took place just before the official presentation, almost 15 minutes since the conclusion of the match.

While India Under-19 captain Priyam Garg termed his neighbours’ overzealous celebration as “dirty”, his Bangladesh counterpart Akbar Ali said “sorry” on behalf of his team in the post-match press conference.

Apology

While the India team manager had told ESPNcricinfo on Sunday that match referee Graeme Labrooy had apologised to him for the ugly scenes, Anil Patel confirmed on Monday that the match officials had a long meeting with both the team representatives on Monday morning to discuss the events after the final.

“We were asked to present a detailed account, which we have done. We have no further plan to initiate any complaint of action. Since the tournament is over, it’s up to the ICC to decide how to deal with it,” Anil told The Hindu over phone on Monday.

The Hindu understands that Labrooy, the former Sri Lanka pacer, will follow the protocol and submit a detailed report to ICC about the spat. However, considering the match saw the end of yet another biennial cycle of Under-19 cricket, it is unlikely that any cricketer is likely to face sanctions from the global governing body.

The final was a highly-charged affair with the colts from both the subcontinental neighbours carrying on their rivalry from the last year’s Asia Cup final. In fact, the manner in which abuses were hurled at each other right from the word go in the final just indicated that the youngsters don’t just pick up skills from their revered seniors.

No doubt the post-match brawl was sparked off by Bangladesh cricketers but the Indian juniors’ response was far from acceptable. With Rahul Dravid, at the forefront of maintaining sanctity of the game in the highly-competitive environment, heading Indian cricket’s talent development vertical, it would be imperative for him to ensure that Sunday night would not set a trend for generations to follow.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/have-presented-a-detailed-account-india-manager/article30785715.ece

279,2020/02/10,Pakistan crush Bangladesh by innings in first Test,"Pakistan completed a crushing innings and 44-run victory over Bangladesh on the fourth morning on Monday, taking a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series.

Bangladesh was bowled out for 168 in its second innings after resuming the day on 126 for six as Pakistan’s pace and spin attack was too hot to handle despite a flat pitch.

Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who at 16 years and 359 days became the youngest bowler to take a Test hat-trick on Sunday, finished with four for 26 and was Man-of-the-Match.

Despite Naseem being unavailable to bowl on Monday with rib pain, Pakistan mopped up the last four wickets in 90 minutes, inflicting its 10th defeat on Bangladesh in 11 matches with one draw.

Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque started the day confidently, square-driving paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi for his fifth boundary in the first over, but then fell leg-before in the same over for 41. Liton Das (29) and Rubel Hossain kept Pakistan at bay for 11.5 overs before Mohammad Abbas trapped Rubel leg-before for five.

Leg-spinner Yasir Shah dismissed Das lbw and had Abu Jayed for three to finish with four for 58 and complete the win.

With the victory, Pakistan gained 60 points in the World Test Championship, taking its tally to 140 points.

India lead the nine-team championship table with 360 points followed by Australia (246) and England 146.

Top two teams on the championship table will play the final at Lord’s in June 2021.

Pakistan’s victory was on the cards after it bowled Bangladesh out for 233 in the first innings and then piled up 445 in reply, with Babar Azam smashing 143 and Shan Masood 100.

This becomes Bangladesh’s sixth defeat in 14 months, including its fifth by an innings. It has yet to score a championship point in three Tests.

The second Test starts in Karachi —after a two months break —from April 5-9.

Bangladesh had only agreed to tour Pakistan in three phases due to security concerns over a long stay, first playing a three-match Twenty20 series last month.

It will also play a One-Day International in Karachi (April 3) before the second Test.

The scores: Bangladesh 233 & 168 in 62.2 overs (Mominul Haque 41, Naseem Shah 4/26, Yasir Shah 4/58) lost to Pakistan 445 in 122.5 overs (Shan Masood 100, Babar Azam 143, Haris Sohail 75, Asad Shafiq 65).

280,2020/02/10,Warner beats Smith by one vote to win Australian cricketer of the year award,"An emotional David Warner on Monday won the Australian cricketer of the year award beating teammate Steve Smith by one vote in their first season following the ball-tampering ban that brought their rollicking careers to a one-year halt.

Dashing opener Warner won his third Allan Border Medal with 194 votes, with former Test captain Smith getting 193 votes and fast bowler Pat Cummins coming third with 185.

Ellyse Perry claimed her second Belinda Clark Award at the Australian Cricket Awards in Melbourne.

Then vice-captain and captain — Warner and Smith — were each suspended for a year by Cricket Australia and opener Cameron Bancroft was banned for nine months for their involvement in the ball tampering scandal during a Test match in Cape Town in March 2018.

Considering his stunning return to the game following a year’s suspension, an emotional Warner held back tears during his acceptance speech.

“I couldn’t be any prouder to stand here and receive the award ... (and) to see the rest of the other guys doing so well,” Warner said, according to Cricket Australia.

“I really had a hunger and determination to come back and really put my foot forward ... so to have a summer like that really put a smile on my face.”

Warner had previously won the coveted individual prize in 2016 and 2017. He polled a total of 194 across the Test, ODI and T20I formats to finish ahead of former captain Smith and nine votes clear of Cummins.

Warner now joined a select list of multiple winners of the Allan Border Medal, which includes Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Smith.

Meanwhile, Perry won the Belinda Clark Award after her teammate Alyssa Healy bagged both the T20 and ODI Player of the Year awards for women’s cricketers.

281,2020/02/10,Bangladesh skipper Akbar Ali battled pain of sister’s death on way to U-19 World Cup triumph,"Bangladesh captain Akbar Ali battled the pain of losing his elder sister while steering his team to the U-19 World Cup triumph, the tragedy far outweighing the challenges thrown at him by his adversaries on the ground.

Sunday’s title triumph in Potchefstroom, South Africa was Bangladesh’s first in an ICC tournament.

At the forefront of the country’s win in the title clash against favourites and defending champions India was its 18-year-old skipper Akbar, whose elder sister Khadija Khatun died while giving birth to twins on January 22, according to a report in leading Bangladesh daily ‘Prothom Alo.’

Akbar was not informed about the tragedy back home but he found out through one of his brothers.

“Akbar was closest to his sister. She loved Akbar a lot,” Akbar’s father was quoted as saying by the newspaper.

“We did not want to inform him at first. He then called after the Pakistan match and questioned his brother why he was not kept in the loop. I did not have the courage to talk to him. I don’t know what to say,” his father added.

In a low-scoring final, Bangladesh first bowled out India for 177 in 47.2 overs and then did well enough to chase down a revised target of 170 in 42.1 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis method. They had three wickets in hand when the winning runs were scored.

Some Bangladeshi players got carried away while celebrating their historic three-wicket win over India in the final on Sunday. While their captain Akbar Ali apologised for the “unfortunate incident”, his Indian counterpart Priyam Garg said their reaction was “dirty.”

“We don’t know what actually happened,” Patel told ‘ESPNCricinfo’ on Sunday.

“Everybody was in a shock, absolutely, but we don’t know what happened exactly. The ICC officials are going to watch the footage of the last few minutes and they are going to let us know,” he said.

Even when the match was on, the Bangladesh players were overly aggressive while fielding and their lead pacer Shoriful Islam sledged the Indian batsmen after every delivery.

As soon as the match ended, it became tense with Bangladeshi players rushing to the ground and displaying aggressive body language. The two teams nearly came to blows before the situation was defused by the coaching staff and on-field officials.

Patel claimed that match referee Graeme Labrooy met him and expressed regret at what transpired on the field.

“The referee came to me. He was sorry about the incident. He clarified the ICC is going to take very seriously what has happened during the match and the last session. They are going to witness the footage and they will tell us in the morning (Monday).”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4gbxbw/article30782781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bangladesh,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-has-taken-it-very-seriously-indian-team-manager-on-bangladeshs-aggressive-celebrations/article30782782.ece
284,2020/02/10,NZ vs IND ODI: Southee credits helpful pitches for getting Kohli out most number of times,"He has dismissed Virat Kohli the most number of times in international cricket and New Zealand pacer Tim Southee on Monday credited helpful pitch conditions for the feat he “didn’t know” about.

Including Saturday’s ODI in Auckland, Southee has now dismissed Kohli nine times across formats.

“He is obviously a class player and doesn’t have many weaknesses. I think the wicket had a little bit of assistance with the new ball and if you put it in the right areas, there was enough there to ask a few questions. It is about assistance and the pitch conditions...,” Southee said on the eve of the third ODI here.

“It is your job to take wickets...And Virat is a great player and he has been in great form. Especially in run chases he is exceptional, so I guess it’s always nice to see the back of him. I didn’t know that was the most...,” he added.

Southee said his side’s 2-0 series win over India in the current three-match contest shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone as the Black Caps, consecutive ODI World Cup finalists, have been playing well in this format for a while now.

“...they have been two great games of cricket and the ODI side has played some good cricket for a while even though we have been missing some important guys,” he said referring to injuries to key players such as regular skipper Kane williamson.

“The guys have played great ODI cricket for a while now, although it was our first time since the World Cup. But the group has played well for a long time,” he added.

Southee played with a stomach bug in the second ODI but led the bowling attack bravely. He bowled Kohli with a sharp inswinger. The pacer seems to have recovered from his illness, while New Zealand have been further bolstered by Williamson’s return from injury.

Despite missing vital stars like Williamson, Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson, the hosts etched out an easy 2-0 lead.

Southee said it was a good sign of the pace wares as well as a domestic structure that threw up man-of-the-match debutant Kyle Jamieson in the time of need.

“It was pretty tough but you have made the commitment to play. So you have to crack on and not leave your teammates hanging. Try to do a job for the guys. It was just a 24-hour bug and couple of friends had it,” he said, trying to make light of his problem.

“...It is a pleasing sign of the environment as well. Kyle came up and played well on his debut, he was comfortable coming in than most people,” he added.

The Bay Oval ground is a regular park and things will be different from both Hamilton and Auckland. Southee said it is a challenge to adapt to grounds in New Zealand but the same holds true for any other cricket field.

“...it is part and parcel of playing in New Zealand. You have to adapt to different grounds, some are cricket grounds, and some are rugby grounds. It is about adapting to different challenges and adapting to surfaces as well as grounds,” he said.

“...it is the same with cricket (everywhere), you have different soils and pitches, obviously different sizes and dimensions at most grounds across the world. So as cricketers it is something you just have to adapt to,” he added.

India hadn’t lost an ODI bilateral series in almost a year, and their previous loss in New Zealand was back in 2013-14. Southee said the hosts were mindful of the statistic but needed to concentrate on what they do best.

When asked about if he would prefer bowler-friendly pitches for the upcoming Test series, Southee replied, “We always want pitches for the bowlers. Yeah I guess that’s our focus after the ODIs, we will turn to the Tests. It is nice to see a little bit of assistance for the bowlers...”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/iv4vf4/article30782376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHEE-KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-vs-india-odi-series-tim-southee-on-dismissing-virat-kohli/article30782377.ece
285,2020/02/10,England’s Eoin Morgan named captain of the year by ESPNcricinfo,"Eoin Morgan was on Monday named captain of the year by the ESPNcricinfo Awards jury for leading England to their maiden ODI World Cup triumph. After losing to Sri Lanka and Australia in the tournament, England needed to win four straight games to lift the trophy — which they did, winning the title after a tied thriller against New Zealand.

The ODI batting performance of the year award went to Ben Stokes for his nerveless performance in the World Cup final. He made an unbeaten 84 in the regulation 50 overs and a further seven in the Super Over.

Stokes’ epic rearguard in the Headingley Ashes Test lost out narrowly in the Test batting category to Kusal Perera who made a landmark 153 not out against South Africa in Durban to take the title.

Sri Lanka were 52 for three chasing a steep 304 to win when Kusal came in to bat in the fourth innings. With nine wickets down and 78 runs to chase, Perera played one of his greatest knocks to see them home.

Jofra Archer, who was voted the Debutant of the Year, also starred in the World Cup, with three-wicket hauls in five of England’s first six games. He finished the tournament as their leading wicket-taker, and took that form into the Ashes series that followed, producing six-fours in two Tests and finishing with 22 wickets at an average of 20.07.

Matt Henry, whose three-wicket spell in the World Cup semifinal knocked India out of the tournament, won the award for ODI Bowling performance of the year.

Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry of Australia won the women’s batting and bowling performances of the year awards, respectively.

Lanning was consistent with the bat through the year, but it was her unbeaten 133 off 63 balls in the first T20I at Chelmsford, at the time the highest score in women’s T20I cricket, that was her zenith.

Perry’s 7 for 22, also against England, were the best ODI bowling figures by an Australian woman cricketer.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/88j7jn/article30782340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MORGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/englands-eoin-morgan-named-captain-of-the-year-by-espncricinfo/article30782341.ece
286,2020/02/10,Rahane scores unbeaten century in drawn game against New Zealand A,"India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane warmed up for the Test series in New Zealand with an unbeaten 101 for the touring A side in the drawn four-day game against New Zealand A here on Monday.

In response to New Zealand A’s 386 for nine, India A reached 467 for five in 109.3 overs when the game ended in a draw on the fourth and final day. The end of the second unofficial Test also marked the end of the A tour.

Rahane stayed unbeaten on 101 off 148 balls and his knock comprised 15 fours and a six.

Shubman Gill, who has scored a double hundred in the first game at number four, continued his good run with the bat, making another hundred on day three, this time as an opener.

Resuming day four at 107, Gill, who too is part of the Test squad, went on to make 136. Rahane took over from there and got much needed time in the middle ahead of the first Test beginning in Wellington on February 21. A practice game will also be played before the series-opener.

Vijay Shankar also made a valuable contribution with a 66-run knock. Test number three Cheteshwar Pujara had made a solid half century on day three. He could only score a run on day four and was dismissed on 53.

Among the other Test regulars, off-spinner R. Aswhin bowled 37.5 overs in the New Zealand innings, conceding 98 runs for two wickets.

Brief scores

New Zealand A 1st innings: 386 for 9 in 131.5 overs (Daryl Mitchell 103, Glenn Phillips 65; Sandeep Warrier 2/50).

India A 1st innings: 467/5 in 109.3 overs (Shubman Gill 136, Cheteshwar Pujara 53, Ajinkya Rahane 101 not out; Blair Tickner 1/71, Ed Nuttall 2/98).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nx7x3d/article30781281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AJINKYARAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rahane-scores-unbeaten-century-in-drawn-game-against-new-zealand-a/article30781282.ece
287,2020/02/10,NZ vs Ind final ODI: India hopes for top order blitzkrieg to avoid 3-0 whitewash,"India would expect its top order to fire to avoid a series whitewash when it clashes with a high-flying New Zealand in the third and final One-day International, here on Tuesday.

Despite missing inspirational skipper Kane Williamson in the line-up due to a shoulder injury, the hosts shrugged off the T20 series debacle to claim the ODI series.

New Zealand, though, will have the experience and leadership of Williamson for the final game as he has passed the fitness test.

The major difference between the two sides has been the top-order’s impact.

With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan missing due to injuries, Virat Kohli missing out on scoring big and K.L. Rahul batting later in the order, India’s traditional ODI strength was neutralised without New Zealand having to do any hard work.

Openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal have shown only momentary flashes of brilliance and have not replicated the kind of starts the Indian batting has grown accustomed to from its top-order.

Rohit’s absence has been a major factor in India’s defeat in this series. The opener averaged 57.30 in ODI cricket in the past 12 months, having a major impact on Indian fortunes in this format.

In that light, the burden of scoring runs has been placed squarely on Kohli in this series. With 66 runs in two innings, he did not come through for once and the rest didn’t rise to the occasion either.

All of it resulted in reversal of fortunes on the limited-overs leg of this tour, as India had arrived here at Mt. Maunganui a week ago leading the T20I series by a 4-0 margin. They went on to drub the Black Caps 5-0, but now find themselves in the same position at the same ground.

It is also a reversal of results from the Men in Blue’s last visit here in 2019 when they won the ODI series 4-1 but lost the T20I series 2-1.

India’s previous ODI series loss in New Zealand was 4-1 on the 2014 tour here. Shreyas Iyer, with a hundred and a half-century, has mirrored Ross Taylor’s rich form in Hamilton and Auckland. But Iyer lacked the finishing touch as compared to Taylor’s experience. He couldn’t see India’s chase through in Auckland like the senior Kiwi batsman did in Hamilton.

India may also look to experiment a bit before the Test series.

Rahul, Shaw, Iyer, Kedar Jadhav and Yuzvendra Chahal did not take part in the optional practice session on Monday.

Kohli was first into the nets against both pace and spin. Manish Pandey was in the nets beside him, while Rishabh Pant had a long session once again.

Pant has not played limited-overs’ cricket since he suffered a concussion against Australia. If India goes as per routine plan, he is in danger of missing out entirely from playing white-ball cricket on this tour.

In the bowling department, all pacers were present for training, except Mohammed Shami.

New Zealand have added leg spinner Ish Sodhi and pacer Blair Tickner to the squad for this match. Sodhi played in the first ODI at Hamilton, bowling Kohli with a googly.

They were part of the New Zealand A team playing an unofficial Test against India A but did not take part on the fourth day’s proceedings. Tim Southee (stomach bug), Mitchell Santner (stomach bug) and Scott Kuggeleijn (viral fever) are hoping to recover in time for the third ODI.

288,2020/02/10,India captain Priyam Garg says Bangladesh’s reaction was ‘dirty’ following U-19 triumph,"India captain Priyam Garg has called the aggressive celebration of Bangladesh players as “dirty” following their maiden title triumph at the Under-19 World Cup in Potchefstroom.

Some of the Bangladeshi players got carried away with their celebration after their historic win over India in the final on Sunday.

While their captain Akbar Ali apologised for the “unfortunate incident”, his Indian counterpart Garg felt it is something that should not have happened.

“We were easy. We think it’s part and parcel of the game - you win some and you lose some. But their reaction was dirty. I think it shouldn’t have happened. But it’s okay,” Garg was quoted as saying by Cricinfo.

During the match, Bangladesh players were overtly aggressive while fielding with their lead pacer Shoriful Islam sledging the Indian batsmen after every delivery.

As Bangladesh approached the winning runs, Shoriful was seen swearing multiple times on camera.

However, his skipper Ali apologised on behalf of the players.

“What happened, it should not [have] happened. I don’t know what exactly happened. I didn’t ask what was going on. But, you know, in the final, emotion can come out, and sometimes the boys were getting pumped, and emotions were coming through.

“As a youngster, it shouldn’t happen. In any position, in any manner, we have to show the respect to the opponent, we should have respect for the game. Cricket is known for being a gentleman’s game. So I’ll say, I’ll be sorry for my team,” said Ali, who scored an unbeaten 43 in a high-pressure situation.

Over the past two years, both teams were involved in close games with India getting the better of them on two important occasions -- the Asia Cup final and tri-series final last year.

“I’ll say India-Bangladesh rivalry bring the part, and before the World Cup final, we lost the Asia Cup final to them a couple of months ago. So I think the boys are really pumped up and take a revenge. I won’t say it should have happened, but I will be sorry for my side,” said Ali.

A source close to the Indian team management told PTI that the emotions ran high during and after the game but “none of the Indian players was at fault”.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jtsa4t/article30780831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANGLAKBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-captain-priyam-garg-says-bangladeshs-reaction-was-dirty-following-u-19-triumph/article30780713.ece

291,2020/02/10,Corporation’s proposal to operate MCCs risks repetition of mistake,"In a few months from now, the Coimbatore Corporation could be repeating the mistake it committed in engaging with the waste management contract company that manages waste in Vellalore.

The civic body has engaged Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Co. Pvt. Ltd. to process 450 – 500 tonnes waste a day. The Corporation collects and delivers the waste to the company in Vellalore.

The agreement between the company and Corporation is that the latter has to deliver segregated waste – wet, organic waste and dry, recyclable waste. But the Corporation has failed to do so, resulting in the two trading allegations. They are engaged in legal battles as well.

Now, the Corporation could face a similar situation if it did not get it right on how to operate and maintain the 69 micro compost centres (MCCs), aimed at processing 300 to 400 tonnes waste a day.

The Corporation is building the 69 centres to decentralise waste collection and management. Of the 69, it had issued orders to start work at 35 places and of the 35, it had completed 12 MCCs.

To maintain and operate the MCCs, the Corporation had planned to engage contractors, who would receive the wet waste the Corporation delivered, process it into compost. The Corporation would provide the infrastructure, bear recurring expenses towards power and pay a fee to the contractor, just as it paid contractors who maintained street lights or parks, said an officer familiar with the development.

If the Corporation were to adopt such a model, it would be decentralising not just waste management but also the problem it faced with the Vellalore contractor and could be opening 69 new battle fronts, said solid waste management experts.

For, the complaint from the contractors of the 69 MCCs would very well be the same that the Corporation was not handing over waste in segregated fashion. This, in short, would be Corporation repeating its mistake committed in Vellalore, the experts pointed out.

They suggested that the Corporation widen the contractors’ role by tasking them with collecting waste in segregated fashion from areas assigned to the MCCs so that the Corporation could hold them accountable.

The officer said such an approach had its own set of problem as the contractors cannot enforce the residents in their service areas to segregate waste just as effectively as the Corporation workers did.

Besides, there was also the possibility that the contractors could blame the residents for non-cooperation to hide their inefficiency.

With the Coimbatore orporation contemplating different approaches to manage the MCCs, the next couple of months would be crucial for the city as what was at stake was not just the ₹ 7 crore investments made in the MCCs but 300 – 400 tonnes waste generated a day in the city, the experts added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/yfrcn7/article30786325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB11COMPOSTPIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporations-proposal-to-operate-mccs-risks-repetition-of-mistake/article30786326.ece

A team led by District Environment Engineer along with engineers carried out inspections in five dyeing units last week and found that they discharged effluents into drains. The issue was taken up with the District Coordinating Committee chairman and Collector C. Kathiravan who ordered disconnection of power supply to the units. Likewise, the team inspected two plastic manufacturing units that caused pollution. Based on the orders from Mr. Kathiravan, power supply was disrupted to those units.

The officials said many dyeing, printing and tannery units were functioning in the region. Many units had established zero liquid discharge effluent treatment plants and were reusing the water. However, a few units continued to function without treatment plants.

Under the Model City Programme, the Erode Corporation has proposed to improve infrastructure and services in 1.03 sq. km. of Panneerselvam Park and Periyar Nagar area. A study carried out by Chennai-based consultants revealed that there were 127 street vendors in the planning area - Meenatchi Sundaranar Road (51 numbers), Manikoondu Road (46), Nethaji Road (15), E.V.N. Road (12) and Gandhiji Road (3). Of these, 39% were vegetable vendors, 24% fruit vendors and 37 % flower vendors. Most of the vendors were present on Meenatchi Sundaranar Road that included Panneerselvam Park.

Most of the vendors were found running the carts either on road or on pavements, disrupting traffic and causing hindrance to the pedestrians.

Under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, the street vendors will be regulated and certificate of vending will be issued to them that enable them to carry out their business without hindrance. Each vendor unit that costs ₹ 98,000 will be distributed to vendors - fruit and vegetable vendors 80 numbers, food vendors 22 and flower vendors 25 at a total cost of ₹ 1.11 crore.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that vending zones would be created and the vendor would be asked to run his/her business only in the allotted space. He said that regulation of vendors would help in smooth flow of traffic and the movement of pedestrians without difficulty in the planned area.

297,2020/02/10,SHGs undergo training for e-commerce,"Representatives of self-help groups (SHGs) from four districts participated in a workshop on Monday to introduce their products online for e-commerce.

Titled “Workshop for Boarding of SHG Products on E-Commerce”, it was held at Tamil Nadu Institute of Urban Studies at Saibaba Colony. According to officials from Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women (TNCDW), 54 participants including 40 representatives of SHGs, their community organisers and Assistant Project Officers from Coimbatore, Tiruppur, the Nilgiris and Erode took part in the workshop.

The workshop was organised by e-commerce retailer Flipkart based on its partnership with the Central Government’s Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), officials said. The partnership aims to introduce small businesses and SHGs to e-commerce, allowing them to access and cater to a pan-India market.

TNCDW officials said the workshop was an introductory session by a trainer from Flipkart on the basics of e-commerce and packaging their products for e-commerce.

300,2020/02/10,Forest dept. steps up vigil to prevent illegal trekking in forest areas,"Following the death of a woman trekker near Palamalai on January 19, the Forest Department has stepped up vigil to control illegal trekking in forest areas and walking or jogging on roads passing through forests.

The Forest Department has begun posting staff at the checkpost at Palamalai foothills to guide people visiting the Ranganathar temple atop the hill, which is around four km from the checkpost.

The checkpost will be manned from dawn to dusk.

The 44-year-old woman was killed in the attack of a male wild elephant when she along with her husband and six others trekked to the temple through forest illegally and then descended through a mud road to Manguzhi tribal settlement.

The Periyanaickenpalayam forest range office had imposed a fine of ₹ 1,500 each on seven persons after the incident.

“The Department has decided to take severe action on persons who trespass into forests in the future. Senior officials have instructed us to register case against such offenders,” said S. Suresh, Forest Range Officer, Periyanaickenpalayam.

The staff at the checkpost are sensitising visitors to the illegality and risks involved in trekking.

They also sent back a few persons who had come to the foothills with a plan to trek to the temple.

Night patrolling

According to Mr. Suresh, deployment of staff at the checkpost at night was not required as only a few people visit the temple after sunset. However, anti-poaching watchers conduct patrols in the area at night.

Sources in the Department added that instructions were given to all forest range officers to prevent illegal trekking and to conduct patrols in areas prone to trespassing by people.

Frontline staff of the Department have also been instructed to advise people about the risks involved in going for walks or jogging on roads passing through forest areas such as Mangarai - Anaikatti stretch.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/forest-dept-steps-up-vigil-to-prevent-illegal-trekking-in-forest-areas/article30777950.ece
301,2020/02/10,Thirumavalavan calls for united effort to halt saffron march,"Organisations following Periyar and Ambedkar, and the Left parties should join hands to halt the march of the saffron party (Bharatiya Janata Party), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader and Member of Parliament Thol. Thirumavalavan said here on Sunday.

Speaking at a caste eradication meeting organised by Periyariya Unarvalargal Kootamaippu, he said, “Unless blue (Ambedkar organisations), black (Periyar organisations) and red (Left parties) joined hands, they cannot stop the march of the saffron party”.

The blue, black and red organisations were against casteism, Hinduism and their basis -- Hindu religious texts. As Tamils they were also against caste discrimination, he said, and urged people to be cautious against a few Tamil parties who, while espousing the Tamil cause, were in fact casteist.

Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani said the BJP was a brahminical party as it followed the orders from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were not brahmins, they were tools in the hands of the brahminical forces, he said.

The forces permeated all organs of the State and the Supreme Court was no exception, he said, and referred to an order that denied reservation in promotion in jobs, to underscore his point.

Social Democratic Party of India leader Tehlan Bagavi said Muslims had the right to talk about caste discrimination because they had embraced Islam to oppose caste oppression.

Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K. Ramakrishnan said eradication of caste discrimination would not be possible until Hinduism was annihilated.

In a resolution passed at the meeting, the parties condemned actor Rajinikanth for defaming protests organised in the State's interest and the organisations that spearheaded such protests. It called for a stop to such statements.

Another resolution said that the organisations that participated in the conference would burn copies of the Hindu book, Manu Smriti, on May 21 at various places in the State as it was the basis for caste discrimination.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/td9z3n/article30777907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB10-RALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/thirumavalavan-calls-for-united-effort-to-halt-saffron-march/article30777908.ece

Mr. Parasar, who is here to take part in a three-day State-level meeting of the Federation, said 42 % to 50 % of the postal employees come under the new scheme and there are uncertainties about the scheme. So the Federation plans to hold talks with the railway employees and other government employees and organise protests jointly.

The Department faces 35 % to

40 % shortage of workforce in all the cadre. This is a nation-wide problem. There is no real time study of the vacancies and recruitments get delayed.

The Department had recruited a large number of the people in the early 80s and they are retiring now. The shortage of workforce is a matter of concern.

He also said that the small-savings scheme implemented by the postal department had benefited many. But the Government is reducing the interest rate for it almost every quarter.

306,2020/02/10,Space availability a challenge for metro rail project planners,"On July 19, 2017, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced in the Assembly that the State Government would implement metro rail project in Coimbatore.

His announcement came long after the State missed an opportunity to give metro rail to the city, as the then Central Government under United Progressive Alliance had in 2011 identified Coimbatore as one of the cities eligible for a mass rapid transit project.

A few other cities like Kochi that were on the Government's list of Tier II cities for metro rail had taken up and also completed the project in the last nine years.

Consequent upon the July 2017 announcement, the State Government asked Chennai Metro Rail Limited to prepare a feasibility report and the latter had engaged Systra and RITES for the purpose.

Sources familiar with the development said the two organisations, Systra and RITES, had submitted a part of the report and were working to complete the rest.

The report at present had identified four corridors where the Government could establish metro rail network for 136 km.

The first corridor would be on Avinashi Road for 26 km, from Ukkadam to Kaniyur – identified red line; the second on Mettupalayam Road for 24 km, from Ukkadam to Bilichi, identified yellow line; the third on Trichy road for 42 km, from Thadagam Road to Karanampettai, identified blue line; and, the fourth on Perur Road and Sathyamangalam Road for 44 km, from Karunya Nagar to Ganesapuram, identified green line.

The sources said the proposal on hand was to implement the project in phases on the four identified corridors by not covering the entire stretch at one go.

For instance, the first phase of the project on blue line would be from Ondipudur to Ukkadam, on the red line it would be from Goldwyns to Ukkadam, on the green line it would be from Saravanampatti to Perur and the on the yellow line it would be from Periyanaickenpalayam to North Coimbatore.

As part of the proposal, the two consultant organisations had also proposed two rail depots or yards – one on Mettupalayam Road and another on Avinashi Road.

So far, so good. But if the organisations’ feasibility report should attain fruition by leading to a detail project report, more work needed to be done because there was not enough space available for metro rail, as proposed, in several stretches of the arterial roads, the sources said.

It appeared that the feasibility report suggested taking metro at grade – on the road – on Trichy Road and Avinashi Road. It would mean metro taking away seven metres (3.5 + 3.5 for two tracks) on the two roads with an average width of 15m each.

In other words, the space available for buses, cars, two-wheelers and other vehicles would be halved, the sources pointed out and added that it would only lead to traffic congestions, given the reduced carrying capacity.

Besides, at grade metro rail network would also require stations and the train movement would lead to stoppage of traffic.

Imagine metro train plying every minute or so on either direction bringing traffic to a halt on Avinashi Road or Trichy Road. It would lead to chaos, the sources said.

The alternative to at grade metro rail – either elevated or underground rail – had their set of problems as well. The cost of constructing a metro rail at grade worked to around ₹50 crore a km, ₹100 crore a km for elevated rail line and ₹150 crore to ₹200 crore a km for underground line.

Given the cost of investment and return on investment, there was a lot of thinking going on, said an officer privy to the development.

For the metro rail to be useful by taking away people from roads, the conversion rate should be at least 30% - that is around one-third of the people using roads should switch over to metro rail and that had not happened in bigger cities like Chennai.

In Coimbatore's context, at least 20,000 of the 60,000 people using either Avinashi Road or Trichy Road should travel by metro, he added.

Sixty thousand people or passenger car units had been studied as the vehicle movement in a day.

Now, with the State Government starting the ground work to construct an integrated bus terminus in Vellalore, the consultant organisations were studying how to link Ukkadam with Vellalore on the metro rail network.

It was studying if the line should pass through Athupalam or Nanjundapuram or Singanallur.

Commenting on the development, urban planner and architect Sarfarz S. Yaseen said given the city's spread, its road network, vehicle movement and other aspects, the best solution to address traffic woes would be to strengthen the city's bus network, improve bus shelters and bus stands and provide last mile connectivity.

But strengthening bus network did not mean bus rapid transit system as that was not feasible, either, as preliminary studies had shown. He argued that even if the city were to get metro rail last mile connectivity would still be a problem.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon suggested that from a layman's point of view it would be better if the metro rail network served people in the city's periphery because that was where the city would witness development in the next 15 – 20 years.

As metro rail came with heavy investment and was aimed at providing a solution in the long run, the consultant organisations should not look at the core city alone. And, in core city there was the problem of identifying land, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/space-availability-a-challenge-for-metro-rail-project-planners/article30777877.ece
307,2020/02/10,Activists call for cleaning up of Sandynallah Reservoir,"Accumulation of plastic wastes on the banks of the Sandynallah Reservoir outside Udhagamandalam town has prompted the activists to call on the district administration to clean the water body.

The reservoir, known to be an important habitat for a wide variety of bird life, is choking with waste from the Udhagamandalam town.

Local residents said that the Kodappamund Channel, which flows into the reservoir, brings most of the waste from the town and deposits it into the reservoir.

“When the reservoir is full, it does not seem like there is much waste or pollution as the waste is usually submerged. However, when the reservoir’s storage level drops, the waste gets deposited on the banks,” said Sowmesh D., a resident of Khandal, who goes to the reservoir for fishing.

He added that he has noticed that the catch has also decreased over the last few years.

“Previously, I used to catch anywhere between seven and 10 kg fish, but now that has decreased substantially, and I am lucky to catch five kg fish each day,” said Sowmesh, who sells the fish in Udhagamandalam.

He said that he has found plastics waste in some of the fish he had caught.

Threat to biodiversity

G. Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association, said that the Sandynallah Reservoir and most other water bodies in the Nilgiris were in a state of extreme peril due to pollution.

“Reservoirs, wetlands and lakes across the Nilgiris, home to a wide array of wildlife, are threatened by pollution on a massive scale. Unless immediate action is taken to protect these areas, they will become completely uninhabitable for wildlife, while the water is already pretty much unfit for human consumption,” said Mr. Janardhanan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/n6k0ci/article30777875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OT10SANDYNALLAHRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/activists-call-for-cleaning-up-of-sandynallah-reservoir/article30777876.ece

309,2020/02/10,Scuffle breaks out as police intercept anti-CAA march to Parliament,"A stand-off lasting for several hours, between Delhi Police personnel and protesters intending to march to the Parliament, took place on Monday near the Holy Family Hospital, as the hundreds who had gathered insisted on marching ahead.

The march to the Parliament called by the Jamia Coordination Committee saw hundreds of Jamia Milia Islamia students and locals participate even as the Delhi Police maintained that permission for the march had not been granted.

Soon after they were stopped near the Holy Family Hospital, protesters began climbing on the barricades which were placed near the hospital and were then dragged down by the force.

Amid heavy deployment of security personnel, with several in riot gears, protesters continued sloganeering some also carried banners like “Where is Komal?”, a reference to the January 5 incident which took place at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) where a masked mob attacked students and faculty members.

Continuing their movement against the CAA, protesters stood their ground and did not move despite repeated appeals from authorities including the JMI Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmad Khan.

“The message has been sent. Your protest has been registered. I appeal to the students in the crowd to go back to the University. Respect the law and go back,” Mr. Khan said.

During the stand-off, Delhi Police officials, perched on barricades themselves, continued appealing to protesters to return to Gate No. 7, which has been the epicentre of the anti-CAA protests in the area.

Towards late afternoon, the situation turned confrontational as security personnel tried to push the protesters back, while resorting to crowd control measures, who then resisted with some falling unconscious.

Khurshid, a middle-aged protester who was one of the people to be dragged out of the crowd said, “The police tried to hit me on my legs with lathis. We will continue protesting as we will not show our documents even if we have them. We are not ready to go anywhere.”

Shivangi Bhasin, another protester said, “I was on my way to Shaheen Bagh but came here after receiving a SOS message. It is really surprising that the cops are asking protesters to be peaceful while they are the ones being brutal. It is important for us to be present here in solidarity.”

Devesh Srivastava, Joint CP (Southern Range) said that the protest march called by Jamia Millia Islamia students was stopped near Holy Family Hospital. “Total nine students including two girls were detained and released after an hour. It all ended peacefully,” said Mr Srivastava.

He added that police has not sued any force on protesters. Protesters were only pushed back by security forces and prevented from climbing on police barricades.

As the crowd started swelling near the Sukhdev Vihar metro station, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) also closed entry and exit to the station.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/d8gmlv/article30782554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/anti-CAA-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-caa-march-to-parliament-stopped-protesters-detained/article30782555.ece

Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said that the complaint states that on February 6, during the fest, some persons barged into the college and molested the students.

""On the complaint of principal, FIR has been registered under sections of 452 (trespass), 354 (assault or criminal force internet to outrage modesty of women) and 509 (criminal intimidation) at Hauz Khas Police station,"" said Mr Thakur.

He added that they have requested the principal to ask the students to forward and record their statement.

Earlier in the day, a police team under supervision of Additional DCP Geetanjali Khandelwal was probing the incident. The team went to the college to record statements of students, bouncers, security guards and teachers.

They are also scanning CCTVs installed at the entrance gate to get any clues in the case.

Stringent punishment for culprits: Kejriwal

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said misbehavior with women students at Gargi College was “extremely unfortunate” and the accused must be given stringent punishment.

“The misbehaviour with our daughters at Gargi College is extremely unfortunate. This cannot be tolerated at all. The culprits should be given stringent punishment. It should be ensured that the children studying in our colleges are safe,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' says that ""outsiders"" were to blame for the molestation of students at Gargi College. He was responding to a question in the Lok Sabha. ""The incident has been carried out by outsiders, not students. But it is not a good thing. The college administration has been asked to take note of it and instructions have been given to take action against the culprits.""

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said the college administration should immediately provide CCTV camera footage of the campus to the police. “What happened at Gargi college is highly condemnable, culprits should be apprehended at the earliest. College admin should get CCTV footage and release the same to investigation agency and media on priority... so that culprits can be booked,” Mr. Tiwari tweeted.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra slammed the police and the government for “failing” to protect women. “I am very much anguished by the Gargi college incident. What could be more sorrowful that the girl students are not safe in their own college in the national capital. It’s highly shameful that Delhi Police silently watched the atrocities against women. The Centre and Kejriwal government cannot escape the responsibility of women safety,” Mr. Chopra said in a tweet.

Protest at gate

Meanwhile, scores of students of the all-women college staged a protest at its gate against the alleged incident, demanding strict action against the intruders.

Priya Singh, a witness to the incident, said, “The police force and the RAF did nothing to control the situation while the non-teaching staff turned a blind eye even as some inebriated men intruded the campus. Female students were harassed both verbally and sexually.”

A delegation of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) met officials of the Gargi College and demanded an inquiry into the incident. The students’ body also wrote to principals of all DU colleges urging authorities to ensure security of students during college fests.

Women panel’s notice

314,2020/02/10,‘Twitter account suspension between Hegde and site’,"The Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the issue of suspension of Senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde’s Twitter account was between him and the micro-blogging site.

In an affidavit, the Centre also clarified that it had not directed the suspension of Mr. Hegde’s Twitter account.

The Centre said it was “neither a necessary nor a proper party to this proceedings”.

The response of the Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology came on a petition filed by Mr. Hegde to frame guidelines for censorship on social media strictly in accordance with the provision of the Constitution.

Previously, the High Court had issued notices to the Ministry and Twitter on a plea by the senior advocate, whose account was permanently suspended on November 5 last year. The High Court has posted the case for further hearing on February 11.

Twitter had, in October last year, suspended the senior advocate’s account over the use of an image of August Landmesser on his page referring to it as “hateful imagery” and violation of the company’s rules.

The account was subsequently restored but was suspended again. This time over a tweet which was about two-and-half-years old. Mr. Hegde had tweeted to a post by Kavita Krishnan, Secretary of the All India Progressive Women’s Association, on Gorakh Pandey’s poem ‘Usko Phaansi do’ with its English translation ‘Hang Him’.

In his petition, Mr. Hegde also sought restoration of his Twitter account, with an interim plea for a direction to Twitter to refrain from deleting the data of his account.

“The arbitrariness of Respondent No.2’s [Twitter] conduct is clear from the fact that while the petitioner’s account was suspended for sharing a post/tweet by another user, no action has been taken against the user who wrote the original tweet. The same continues to be in public domain,” the plea said.

The senior advocate argued that the suspension of his account was against Twitter’s own rules and terms of use. Terming the suspension of his account as ‘illegal and arbitrary’,

Mr. Hegde had said it violated his rights under Article 19 of the Constitution, including his right to free speech and expression.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/twitter-account-suspension-between-hegde-and-site/article30778589.ece
315,2020/02/10,Man ends life at Haiderpur Badli metro station after killing children,"After killing his daughter and son, a 44-year-old man allegedly ended his life by jumping in front of a metro train at Haiderpur Badli Mor station on Sunday, police said.

The man used to stay with his wife and his 14-year-old daughter and six-year-old son at a rented house in north-west Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, they said.

No note has been recovered from him or from his house. However, police said that the deceased was in depression after his factory was shut due to financial crunch some six months ago.

The wife of the deceased was not at home when the incident took place. After killing his two children, he allegedly jumped in front of a train at Haiderpur Badli Mor station, said the police.

Police suspect that the man allegedly killed both his children by strangulating them. Post-mortem reports are awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death.

During investigation, wife of the deceased told the police that she had left home to visit a nearby market around 3 p.m. while her children were with her husband at home. On reaching home, she found the bodies of the children and her husband was missing, the officer added.

A case has been registered and investigation is on, said DCP (North-west) Vijayanta Arya.

Meanwhile, metro services were briefly delayed on the yellow line due to the incident.

316,2020/02/10,Two M.P. men arrested for supplying illegal weapons,"The Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested two persons for allegedly supplying illegal weapons to criminals based in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), police said on Sunday.

The accused have been identified as Santoshi (50) and Pritam Singh (20), both residents of Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district. They were arrested on Friday, they said. Eleven semi-automatic pistols and 10 single shot pistols with 50 live cartridges were recovered from the accused, the police said, adding that these were brought to the national capital to be supplied to criminals in Delhi and NCR.

“Santoshi and Pritam were apprehended from near Dilshad Garden Metro Station on Friday after a police team received information that two men were coming to deliver a consignment to criminals,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) P.S. Kushwah said.

A few years ago, Santoshi was arrested after he got into a scuffle with someone and was lodged in Morena jail. In the prison, he came in contact with illegal firearms suppliers. Later, he started procuring illegal arms from them for supplying to criminals , the DCP said.

The accused would primarily source weapons from Aligarh. He used to buy .32 bore pistols for ₹7,000- ₹8,000 each and single shot pistols for ₹2,000- ₹3,000. He would sell the .32 bore and single shot pistols for ₹20,000-₹25,000 and ₹4,000-₹5,000, respectively, he added.

Santoshi has been supplying arms and ammunition to criminals for the last four years. Previously, he was arrested in three cases under the Arms Act, Mr. Kushwah said. Pritam came in contact with Santoshi three months ago. He has been working with Santoshi to earn quick money, he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6crj66/article30778570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-PISTOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/two-mp-men-arrested-for-supplying-illegal-weapons/article30778571.ece
317,2020/02/10,Peak power demand sees 19% spike this winter,"Delhi’s peak power demand this winter set a new record, crossing last year’s high of 4,472 MW as consumption of electricity for heating purposes soared due to prolonged cold spells.

During the winter season (November to January), Delhi’s peak power demand increased by over 19% to set a new record of 5,343 MW. The peak demand this winter crossed last year’s peak power demand (of 4,472 MW) on 25 days — 8 days in December 2019 and 17 days in January 2020, discom officials said.

In every month this season, the peak power demand was higher than the corresponding months last year. In November, it was on 19 days, on 30 days in December and on 28 days in January.

Since last year (2018-2019), the highest increase in the peak power demand during the winter was witnessed in the BSES discom BRPL’s area of South and West Delhi (more than 17 percent), followed by TPDDL’ area of North Delhi (more than 15%) and BYPL’s area of East and Central Delhi (more than 5%), the discom said.

Discom officials said that heating load was the “main factor” behind enhanced power consumption during the winter in Delhi. According to estimates, over 40% of Delhi’s power demand in winter is because of the heating load (heaters and geysers), they added. A BSES spokesperson said discoms are fully geared to ensure adequate power availability during the winter.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/peak-power-demand-sees-19-spike-this-winter/article30778562.ece
318,2020/02/10,Judges move HC against ‘discriminatory’ pension scheme,"In a rare instance, the judges of Delhi’s district courts have knocked on the doors of the High Court against the current pension regime, which they said “is lacking in providing financial stability to judges post-retirement”.

The judges represented by the Delhi Judicial Services Association (DJSA) said they wanted to be placed under an old pension scheme, which was in vogue till December 31, 2003, that gave better retiral benefits to judges.

A Bench of Justice A.K. Chawla has issued notice to the Centre and Delhi government on the petition before posting the case for further hearing on August 7.

DJSA, a registered association of judicial officers of Delhi, in its plea sought direction to the government for restoration of old pension scheme as was applicable prior to January 1, 2004 to all judicial officers of Delhi Judicial Services or an option to choose between the two schemes.

Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan appeared with advocate Sachin Jain for the judges’ association before the High Court.

Root of the case

On December 22, 2003, the Centre introduced ‘New re-structured Defined Contributory Pension Scheme’ for new entrants to the Central government service appointed on or after January 1, 2004.

Three years later, the Delhi government issued a notification on July 19, 2006 stating that the employees working with the Delhi government are also governed by the condition of service applicable to the Central government employees.

The new pension scheme applies retrospectively to all the judicial officers who have been appointed on or after 2004. It also treats the judicial officers at par with civil servants of the State, a condition which the association said was against the 2003 judgment of the Supreme Court in All India Judges’ Association case.

The top court verdict had guaranteed a minimum of 50% of last pay drawn to judicial officers as pension, the plea argued. Additionally, it said the notification “erroneously” equates the services of the judicial officers of Delhi with that of civil servants of Delhi.

The scheme

The judges said the new pension scheme was “discriminatory, arbitrary, inconsistent with recommendations of the Justice Shetty Commission and Justice Padmanabhan Committee” and also in violation of various orders passed by the top court.

“The new pension scheme put draconian restriction on withdrawals from pension fund as it does not allow the judicial officers to withdraw complete pension fund even in times of dire need,” the plea stated.

They said the new pension scheme does not take into account their peculiar job conditions.

“The aloofness and the sacrifices of a judicial officer to maintain the independence of judiciary and to uphold the Constitution of India should be borne in mind while determining the financial benefits to such officers, especially post-retirement,” the plea said.

Representation unheard

The association said the Central government failed to consider its written representation in November 2018 seeking continuation of the old pension scheme.

The implementation of the new pension scheme to the judicial officers of Delhi has “grossly encroached upon their fundamental rights,” the petition said, adding it “would deprive them from the legitimate benefits to live their retired life with dignity”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nhblod/article30778560.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/judges-move-hc-against-discriminatory-pension-scheme/article30778561.ece
319,2020/02/10,Will not contest another election if I lose: BJP New Delhi candidate,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday continued to maintain that it would form the next government in the Capital.

This, even as Sunil Yadav, the candidate fielded by it against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from New Delhi constituency, declared he would not contest another election if he lost.

“Gratitude to Mr. Narendra Modi, Mr. Amit Shah, Mr. J.P. Nadda and the entire organization for reposing their faith in me. Mr. Kejriwal will lose New Delhi, that is for sure. If this does not work out, I will never contest another election and will associate myself only with organisational matter for life [sic],” Mr. Yadav tweeted.

“Arvind Kejriwal ji knows he is losing his election that is why he has started preparing the ground to blame EVMs on the 11th,” Mr. Yadav said in another tweet.

Second-lowest turnout

Counting of votes and the declaration of the election results will take place on Tuesday. Meanwhile, according to data released by Delhi Chief Electoral Officer, the New Delhi Assembly constituency recorded the second-lowest voter turnout at 52.15%.

BJP leaders sought to challenge exit poll results on news channels aired immediately after voting ended on Saturday which forecast a comfortable victory for the Aam Admi Party (AAP), on the basis of their timing and related technicalities.

Voting, they argued, had continued for two hours beyond the stipulated time till 6 p.m., while the exit poll results started being aired just after this time and even as polling was under way at an estimated 100 booth across the nation capital.

“We are confident of the figures not being run by television channels which are clearly half-baked but on the basis of information and inputs generated by our cadre from the very ground,” said a BJP leader. “Senior leaders, including Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari have already said the party will secure over 40 seats. In the worst-case scenario, the party expects to bag at least 32 seats,” another leader claimed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-not-contest-another-election-if-i-lose-bjp-new-delhi-candidate/article30778559.ece
320,2020/02/10,On road to relief from traffic nightmare,"Several ongoing infrastructure projects of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), including three underpasses, two flyovers, an elevated road, and an elevated U-turn, across the Millennium City are expected to be completed within two years. Once completed, the projects will improve vehicular movement at important intersections, reduce travel time and offer respite to commuters from frequent jams.

Among the projects, the four-lane underground U-turn near Ambience Mall and the elevated U-turn near Shankar Chowk, both NHAI projects, are likely to be completely first.

Construction ban

“Both the projects are running ahead of schedule. We hope to complete the underground U-turn by May 31 and the elevated U-turn by April. Both these projects as well as widening of Sohna Road, and an elevated five-km road project were delayed by over two months due to ban on construction activities for almost 45 days in November last year due to high levels of pollution,” said project director of NHAI (Gurugram) Ashok Kumar Sharma.

Motorists coming from the direction of Jaipur and going towards Ambience Mall and DLF Cyber Hub are forced to travel to Rajokri flyover in Delhi to take a U-turn. The 377-metre underground U-turn will help cut travel time and reduce traffic congestion at the Rajokri flyover. The NHAI has footed 50% cost of the ₹102.94-crore project, the rest has been equally shared by DLF and the owners of Ambience Mall.

Similarly, the elevated U-turn will reduce traffic on National Highway 48 as vehicles coming from the direction of DLF Cyber Hub and taking a U-turn towards Delhi will no longer have to use the highway. The 455-metre elevated U-turn is being built at a cost of ₹58.96 crore with the NHAI contributing 75% of the funds. The remaining cost will be borne by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. As per the contract, the two projects are to be completed before September this year.

For the six-laning and strengthening of a 22-km-long stretch of National Highway-248A, locally known as Sohna Road, starting from Rajiv Chowk, the NHAI has awarded two separate tenders. The first tender pertains to six-laning and strengthening of the road from 0.340 km to 9.28 km, starting from Rajiv Chowk and also includes a 4.75-km elevated road. The deadline is July 31, 2021. The second part of the project, which has a deadline of July 29, 2021, covers the remaining distance. A three-lane service road will also be constructed on both sides of the stretch.

Removing encroachments

“Both the packages of the project were delayed due to large-scale encroachment along the road. But the first package, measuring around 10 km, was the worst hit. Of the 404 structures required to be demolished, only 104 are left. Most of these structures are in the first package. As many as 11 cases are pending in the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” said Mr. Sharma.

The total cost of the project is around ₹1,700 crore.

He, however, added that both packages would be finished before the completion date, though the second package could be completed earlier than the first.

Thanks to unprecedented real estate development, including shopping malls, residential group housing societies and office space, Sohna Road has become one of the busiest stretches in Millennium City.

The Vatika Chowk, an intersection point of Sohna Road, Golf Course Extension Road and the Southern Peripheral Road, and the stretch passing through Badshahpur village, witness frequent jams and long traffic snarls. The five-km elevated road from Vatika Road till Badshahpur village is expected to bring a huge respite to the commuters.

The construction of flyovers and underpasses at the busy HUDA City Centre metro station intersection and Atul Kataria Chowk in Old Gurugram are two other important projects — both are being carried out by the GMDA.

The 246-metre flyover and 710-metre underpass at the HUDA City Centre intersection, being constructed at an estimated cost of ₹70 crore, are expected to provide a respite from the round-the-clock traffic congestion. A GMDA official, on condition of anonymity, said both projects would be completed by August.

“The work for the flyover is almost complete. Since the underpass was passing below the metro line, we had applied for a No Objection Certificate from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to avoid any harm to the metro structure. We received it two days back. We will work in close coordination with DMRC authorities regarding a 20-metre stretch of the underpass that is passing below the metro line,” said the official.

He added that the work for the flyover and underpass at Atul Kataria Chowk may be completed by the end of the year. “It is not the execution of the work but the shifting of the utilities that is the major challenge in any infrastructure work in Old Gurugram. But we hope to complete the project by the end of the year,” said the official. The ₹50-crore project comprises a flyover on Old Delhi Road connecting Kapashera to Mahavir Chowk and the underpass on Signature Tower Road to Mata Sheetla Road.

Widening road

The six-laning of a three-km stretch of arterial road from Umang Bhardwaj Chowk to Dwarka Expressway will also be completed by the end of the year. It is being built at an estimated cost of ₹110 crore.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal, in a meeting on April 15, 2017, had directed the widening of 5.6-km stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Dwarka Expressway.

A 2.6-km stretch on this road will be widened by the NHAI i.e. the first 2,200 metres and the last 400 metres.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vga0jw/article30778552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10DEKATARIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/on-road-to-relief-from-traffic-nightmare/article30778557.ece
321,2020/02/10,AAP questions EC delay in releasing voter turnout figures,"The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday hit out at the Election Commission for not announcing the final polling percentage even 24 hours after the polling was over. The Chief Electoral Officer announced the figure at a press conference at 7 p.m.

The Chief Elector Officer said the total turnout took long to collect and calculate and hence took time to be shared.

“Absolutely shocking. What is EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?” AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter commenting on the delay.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh, addressing the media in the afternoon, said the party feared a deep conspiracy. “Till now, whenever the elections were held, the Election Commission has declared the percentage of the voting almost immediately. It has been 24 hours since the voting of the Delhi Assembly completed, but the Election Commission is not ready to announce the voting percentage. This is pointing towards a deep conspiracy,” Mr. Singh said. The EC should explain the delay.

“This is the first time in the history of 70 years, the Election Commission is not ready to announce the voting percentage,” Mr. Singh also alleged.

“Any election, be it Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha, the EC used to announce the voting percentage on the same day. I remember that when the elections were held by the ballot papers, the Commission used to announce the voting percentage even at such times. But for the first time in the history of 70 years, such a strange thing happened,” Mr. Singh said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-questions-ec-delay-in-releasing-voter-turnout-figures/article30778546.ece
322,2020/02/10,Nuh defies prohibitory orders to hold protest,"Deen Mohmmad (55), a tailor, makes it a point to visit every day the ongoing indefinite sit-in agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Badkali Chowk here. Inspite of staying in Nuh for generations, he has no documents to prove the same. He fears that he might be deprived of India’s citizenship if the CAA and the NRC are implemented.

“I have no documents to prove that I belong to India. I come to this protest every day in the hope that the government will roll back its decision on CAA and not bring the NRC. There can be a delay, but I am sure the government will do no injustice to the poor and the illiterate,” said Mr. Mohammad who was present at the protest site on Sunday afternoon as well.

Jointly organised by Mewat Vikas Sabha and Mewat RTI Manch, the dharna began on January 30, coinciding with the Martyrs’ Day, and entered its 11th day on Sunday, defying the prohibitory orders in the district under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Manch’s convenor Rajuddin Meo, a former journalist, said the administration had made all-out efforts to force them to give up their protest, including lodging FIRs against the organisers. “The administration uprooted the tent on January 30 night and poured water at the protest site the next day to force us to leave. But we were not deterred. If that was not enough, the police registered four FIRs, booking 43 people under different sections of the IPC and slapped notices under Section 107 and 151 of the CrPC against many of us,” said Mr. Rajuddin. Prominent among those booked include Mewat Vikas Sabha president Salamudeen Meo, eminent lawyer Ramzan Chaudhary, historian Siddique Ahmad and Urdu journalist Sabir Kasmi.

Mr. Salamudeen said that Mewat had a long history of peace and communal harmony and no violent incidents were reported in the region even in the wake of demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and recent Supreme Court verdict on Ram Janambhoomi titile suit, but the local administration, acting under the directions from Haryana government, wanted to prevent holding of peaceful protests against the CAA and NRC and suppress our voice. “We assured that the protest would be completely peaceful, but they did not grant the permission. The administration is yet to reply to our application filed on January 28 seeking permission for the protest,” said Mr. Salamudeen.

Though the local BJP leaders from the Muslim community have preferred to stay away from it, all three local Congress MLAs have visited the site and lent support to the agitation. Nuh MLA and Deputy Leader of Opposition Aftab Ahmed, who visited the site on February 4, said that the CAA was against the spirit of the Constitution. “I met Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Home Secretary in connection with the prohibitory orders following which they provided some relaxation, but still protests are not allowed in city areas and within 3km of Gurgaon-Alwar Highway passing through Nuh,” said Mr. Ahmed.

The agitation, being held under the open sky from early morning till late in the evening, has been attracting crowd from across the district, including students, daily-wagers, religious leaders and even women. Sitting among the handful of women protesters, Neha Khan, a trainee journalist, said she had been a regular at the site from the Day One. “The aim of the CAA is to break the unity of the country and discriminate against the Muslim community. The government would do good to take it back or include all religious communities in it,” said Ms. Khan (21) who had her firmly covered. She said that 40-50 women were turning up at the site every day for the past couple of days. School students present poems and enact plays at the site to create awareness on the issue.

Pursuing doctorate from Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi, Irfan, who hails from Shikrawa village, said he along with his two friends had come to lend support to the movement and create awareness on the twin issues of the CAA and the NRC. “We have the right to protest peacefully against any law made by Parliament. It is sad that the present regime refrains from talking about the real issues such as unemployment, economy and the Gross Domestic Product. They are targetting the Muslims,” said Mr. Irfan (25). He said that people from all religions and communities were against the law. Another protester, Nasir (26), a fleet manager at a travel agency, said people from all religions would be impacted if the NRC was implemented. “It is because of widespread protests that the government has clarified in the Parliament that they have no immediate plans to implement the NRC. The government will be forced to rethink on the issues if the protests continue,” said Mr. Nasir.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/w34mpw/article30778535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10NUH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nuh-defies-prohibitory-orders-to-hold-protest/article30778536.ece
323,2020/02/10,India’s first ‘darknet’ narcotics operative held,"The Narcotics Control Bureau ( NCB) on Sunday said it has arrested the country’s first ‘darknet’ narcotics operative, who allegedly shipped hundreds of psychotropic drug parcels abroad in the garb of sex stimulation medicines.

Dipu Singh, 21, son of a retired Army officer, was arrested by the sleuths of the Delhi zonal unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) from Lucknow recently.

Darknet refers to the deep hidden internet platform that is used for narcotics sale, exchange of pornographic content and other illegal activities by using the secret alleys of the onion router (ToR) to stay away from the surveillance of law enforcement agencies. Owing to its end-to-end encryption, darknet is considered very tough to crack when it comes to investigating criminal activities being rendered over it, said NCB.

“Singh is a major player on the darknet. His listings were found in one of the biggest and reliable darknet markets like Empire Market and Majestic Garden,” NCB Deputy Director General (operations) Rajesh Nandan Srivastava said.

Singh initially began with shipping medicines related to erectile dysfunction and fitness supplements to overseas locations using the dark internet facility, but later shifted to transacting in psychotropic drugs seeing the profit margin in the illegal trade, the DDG added.

A Bachelor in Hotel Management from Amity University in Lucknow, Singh had “mastered the technique to disguise identity while making a shipment,” the NCB said in a statement.

He was arrested by the central anti-narcotics agency under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after raids were conducted at his residence in Lucknow’s Alam Bagh area.

While 12,000 tablets of various psychotropic drugs were seized from his residence, the NCB alleged that Singh is the “mastermind” of hundreds of drug parcels clandestinely couriered to countries like the U.S., U.K., Romania, Spain and some European nations using the dark web.

55,000 tablets seized

A total of 55,000 psychotropic tablets that includes tramadol, zolpidem and alprazolam have been seized as part of the two-month-long operation that was conducted with the co-operation of international agencies, NCB Delhi zonal director K.P.S Malhotra said.

Some other seizures in this case were made in Mumbai and the U.K. too. The NCB was part of a global ‘Operation Trance’, launched in December last year, entailing a joint intelligence gathering action on international postal, express mail and courier shipments containing psychotropic drugs (which can only be purchased on a doctor’s prescription) that are abused as sedatives and painkillers.

The latest darknet ring was unearthed as part of this operation, which is spread across the U.S. and Singapore. Services of global post offices and international couriers were used as logistics for the illicit trade, Mr. Srivastava said.

“The payment gateways of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins and Litecoin were used by the operators to conceal the transactions from regulatory agencies,” the NCB DDG said.

The orders were procured from darknet and routed through various wicker identities, WhatsApp and some business-to-business platforms. The investigation in the case is on as the NCB is looking into the links of Singh and others associated with him, Mr. Malhotra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5d407i/article30778533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10NARCOTICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/countrys-first-darknet-narcotics-operative-held/article30778534.ece
324,2020/02/10,Anti-CAA protesters back at Gate No. 7 of Jamia,"Two days after protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), held in front of Jamia Millia Islamia here, were shifted owing to the Delhi Assembly elections, demonstrators returned to Gate number 7 on Sunday.

Following directions from the police, the university had asked those protesting under the banner of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) to clear the area in view of the elections and to “avoid any untoward situation”. While agreeing to the demands of the authorities, the JCC, in a statement, condemned the university administration for “using the elections” as an excuse to have the protesters removed from the site. It, however, stated that they “recognise that the electoral process is an essential element of the democratic functioning of the state” and that they would “corporate fully in the free and fair conduct of the elections”.

Barricades which had blocked the road in front of the university since the beginning of December 2019 were removed, allowing free passage to vehicles and people. As a temporary arrangement, the protest was moved to Gate number 4 of the university, without occupying the road.

After the elections were held on Saturday, barricades and tents were put up at the site once more in the evening following dialogue with authorities, Armaz, a JCC volunteer, said.

While hundreds of people arrived at the site and scores of women from surrounding areas gathered near the stage, the number of people here on Sunday afternoon were fewer than on previous weekends.

Speakers appealed to the protesters that they must continue to take to the streets and register their protest until the CAA was repealed, even if they had doubts about how long the demonstrations would go on.

Some also arrived from Gujarat to stand in support of the movement.

Following the firing incident at the university, members of the JCC have now started frisking everyone before letting them go near the stage at the protest site. Apart from this, various art installations, such as a “detention centre”, a model of India Gate, various poster exhibitions, sections for reading books and newspapers have remained part of the demonstration.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/h1xwyy/article30778528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10JAMIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-caa-protesters-back-at-gate-no-7-of-jamia/article30778529.ece
325,2020/02/10,DU students allege they were groped and harassed at fest,"Scores of women of Delhi University’s Gargi College alleged that they were sexually harassed, groped and even stalked during the college’s annual festival ‘Reverie’ on Friday, the last day of the three-day event.

Around 4.30 p.m., hundreds of men allegedly barged into the college campus without valid ID or passes issued by the festival organising committee, students alleged. Videos from the day show scores of people pushing their way into the university and some even jumping the gates despite deployment of bouncers and security personnel.

Multiple students whom The Hindu spoke to, requesting anonymity, alleged that they were groped by men, catcalled and even stalked.

Chilling accounts

One student said that she complained about a group of men following her friend, but no serious action was taken following which they stalked her. The victim said that the men followed her to the metro station and got off at the same station along with her, but she managed to slip away. “The metro station is a place I go every day. It’s so scary, I am not sure what to do,” the student said, adding that she hadn’t decided whether to lodge a complaint or not.

Others told The Hindu that on the pretence that there were too many people and no space, men placed their hands on them, pushed and groped them. In a chilling account, shared via social media, a student alleged that men groped her and masturbated on her.

Students also said that they complained to principal Promila Kumar around the time hundreds of men made their way into the campus. Ms. Kumar said that she sent additional security to check on the situation but found that there was no issue.

Ms. Kumar said that she received no other complaint apart from two students who came to her in the afternoon. She said that she would speak to the students to understand what the problem was and wanted to assure them that their safety is her top priority. “We did our best to provide full security and were there throughout the day. We left only late at night,” Ms. Kumar said.

This is not the first time that such an incident had taken place, students said. Last year also similar incident took place and a complaint was filed with the Internal Complaints Committee with nearly 100 women alleging to have faced harassment, a student informed.

Keeping in view the issues faced last year, a separate barricade was set up this year to keep the crowd away, Ms. Kumar said.

‘No complaint received’

However, police said that no PCR call was made and they haven’t received any complaint regarding the incident.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qz46ay/article30778526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-COLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/du-students-allege-they-were-groped-and-harassed-at-fest/article30778527.ece
326,2020/02/10,How Bahlol Lodhi bought Delhi,"The tomb of Bahlol Lodhi is a forgotten monument in Chirag Delhi. It is situated near the shrine of Hazrat Nasiruddin Mahmud (after whom the area is known), for the 14th-century saint is regarded as ‘the lamp of Delhi’ by his devotees.

The story goes…

While still young, Bahlol and his friends met a dervish who asked each boy by turns if he would like to buy the kingdom of Delhi for 2,000 tankas. Only Bahlol agreed and was blessed by the dervish. His friends later made fun of him for being a ‘fool’. But Bahlol replied that it was not so, because if the dervish’s word was true he stood to gain a kingdom, and if it was not so he had done the right thing in giving a fakir what he desired.

Bahlol’s birth too was unusual. His mother died in a house collapse, but he was successfully taken out of her womb and nursed by his aunt and uncle. Sultan Shah, the uncle, saw signs of greatness in the boy and brought him up accordingly, not even scolding him for playing on his musallah (prayer mat).

The child grew into a fine man. At that time Mohammad Shah of the Sayyid dynasty was the ruler of Delhi. But his kingdom was in a mess. Bahlol managed to get himself appointed Governor of Punjab, and when Alam Shah came to the throne, he contrived to get the kingdom for himself.

The ascent

One day a group of his followers dressed as Mirasis (roadside musicians) tricked the guards into allowing them to enter the house of the powerful Wazir, Hamid Khan. They forced him to surrender and after that it was an easy job to oust Alam Shah, though the khutba (sermon) continued to be read in his name.

Alam Shah retired to Badaun, and Bahlol became the first ruler of the Lodhi dynasty in 1451.

Brave and generous, he was always fond of intellectuals and holy men. Being a good general, he conquered Jaunpur, Dholpur, and Kalpi. The Sarqis of Jaunpur were the lords of the east and their downfall was the Lodhi’s biggest gain.

But Bahlol never let success go to his head. He remained humble, never sitting on a throne, but on a carpet along with his nobles. He died in July 1489 after a long reign.

Bahlol’s tomb is a drab place compared to other mausoleums in the region. It is a square chamber with three arched openings on all sides, surmounted by five domes, the central one being the biggest.

Verses from the Quran are inscribed on the arches, but there is hardly any other ornamentation. Perhaps a tomb that reflects the times in which Bahlol lived — rugged and sans the sophistication of the later rulers. But he was the only one to ‘buy’ a kingdom from a dervish.

The descent

His son Sikandar Lodhi, who succeeded him, became the most powerful ruler of the dynasty. The tomb of Sikandar Lodhi, on the corner of Lodhi Garden, has a gash in its dome, the result of the plaster peeling off, but to a visitor it is a reminder of the fact that the Sultan’s dynasty had suffered a mortal blow. That was in the First Battle of Panipat when Barbar defeated his son Ibrahim Lodhi. Sikandar did not live to see that day. After ‘life’s fitful fever’ he sleeps in a place which is quiet and serene.

Nizam Khan Sikandar Lodhi, in whose reign Vasco da Gama landed in India, was the most powerful of the Lodhi rulers. He made conquests in Bihar and Bengal, subjugated Gwalior and founded the city of Agra in 1504. The story goes that the Sultan set out on horseback from Delhi and rode for three days sleeping in the forest at night and drinking from the wells under the neem trees.

Sikandar Lodhi and his party passed by Mathura and galloped for several Kos before they reined in their horses. Post lunch the Sultan and his Wazir set out in a boat over the Jamuna. When they had sailed for some time, the Sultan asked, ‘Where shall we found our new city?’ The Wazir thought and answered ‘On this bank’.

‘No’, said the Sultan, ‘that which is agar’ (ahead). Thus was the city of Agra founded. But the next year, there was a big earthquake in which most of its elegant buildings were destroyed and thousands of people were killed.

Ibrahim Lodhi was a child when he had felt the tremors in Delhi, for the capital also rocked. As he grew up he became haughty and the power that came into his hands when Sikandar Lodhi died in 1517, turned him insolent. He would keep his nobles standing for hours to show his contempt for them. Not only they but even his uncle Alam Khan revolted and the Mughals were able to establish an empire.

His father’s tomb, therefore, is of special interest to students of history, for had Ibrahim been like him, Babar would never have ventured into India.

When you see the octagonal tomb, a typical example of Lodhi architecture, with a covered verandah and symmetrical arches, remember that the man who lies buried in it was a great king but an unfortunate father.

327,2020/02/10,Pay Revision Commission to submit its report soon,"The Pay Revision Commission, the first pay commission appointed after the formation of the State, is gearing up to submit its final report to the government soon.

The Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal is said to have finalised its recommendations related to pay hike as well as modifications in the service rules. The term of the PRC, constituted in May 2018, had been extended more than twice and is expected to end on February 24 and the commission has intensified efforts to submit its report ahead of the expiry of its term.

The commission members held a series of discussions with secretaries and heads of different departments, including the Finance department, for understanding the State’s financial situation and the budgetary allocations it could make towards the cost of the employees once the report is submitted. The Commission, in the process, obtained details of the staffing pattern of all the departments, including the sanctioned strength and the number of employees actually working from all the departments.

The recent exercise by the Finance Department in finalising the staffing pattern in different departments from State level downwards incorporating details like number of regular employees, work charged staff and the employees on contract and outsourcing basis is said to have come in handy for the PRC members.

Report finalised

“The report is almost finalised. We are hopeful of submitting the report soon, may be within 10 days,” an official of the PRC told The Hindu.

Officials were, however, tightlipped on the quantum of fitment that would be offered to the employees at various levels while the employees are insisting on fitment of around 35% to 40%. The Commission, it is learnt, has in principle decided to submit more than one option for fitment benefit leaving the decision on finalisation of the fitment to the government.

The PRC had completed its study of the wage related aspects a few months ago which included a comparative study of the pay package offered in the southern States as well as States like Maharashtra and Bihar which are available online. Completion of the Commission’s final report along with recommendations is, however, delayed as it has also been given additional terms of reference. These included studying the scope for enhancement of age of superannuation, modification of business rules to bring about more clarity and expeditiousness in decision making process as well as modifications that are required in business rules in the context of formation of the new State as well as consequent political and administrative exigencies.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pay-revision-commission-to-submit-its-report-soon/article30786322.ece
328,2020/02/10,Administrative reforms to take governance closer to people,"After the completion of elections at different levels, the State government has now apparently focused on putting in place administrative reforms to take governance closer to the people.

The first step in this direction has been initiated on Sunday when the government posted 49 officers, recent recruits to the IAS as well as special grade deputy collectors, as additional collectors at the district-level.

Additional Collectors

Each district will henceforth have two officers in the rank of additional collectors – one assisting the district Collector in the revenue matters and the other on local bodies’ related issues.

The new posts are said to be a first step in the direction of phasing out the system of joint collectors who are assisting the district collectors on various matters, including revenue-related issues.

As a result, existing joint collectors are being asked to submit letters to the Collector and the State government asking them to relieve from the posts and they should simultaneously submit letters assuming charge as the additional collectors.

Overlapping of functions

“This is aimed to ensure there are dedicated officers to take care of revenue-related matters as also those related to local bodies,” a senior officer said.

There is no clarity however on whether the role of officers holding posts like district panchayat officer and zilla parishad chief executives, whose functions overlap with that of the new additional collectors, would undergo changes in the coming days.

CM to address Collectors

Senior officials said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who will address a meeting of the district Collectors and other senior officers at the district level on Tuesday, is expected to give clarity on the role that would be played by the newly appointed additional collectors.

New Revenue Act

The meeting had been convened to explain the officials concerned about the new Revenue Act that is expected to be introduced in the budget session of the Legislature and seek their feedback on the changes, if any, which should be made in the proposed Act.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, however, is learnt to have decided to brief the district Collectors about the future course of reforms that would be adopted to make sure that the administration is made more transparent and responsive to the people’s needs.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/administrative-reforms-to-take-governance-closer-to-people/article30786180.ece

330,2020/02/10,Kisan Sangharsh to stage protests,"All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) is planning to stage protests against Union Budget on February 13 to expose the cuts in allocation to primary sectors such as rural development and agriculture.

According to AIKSCC functionaries, the Union Budget had deceived farmers by imposing significant cuts in the support provided to agriculture and rural economy. In response to the nationwide call, the Telangana unit of AIKSCC would organise protest programmes in Hyderabad and in districts across the State.

A pamphlet highlighting how the budget had failed to announce measures to improve the income and purchasing power of farmers and rural households was released at a press meet held here on Monday. They came down heavily against the BJP government for reducing the share of rural economy in the budget from 9.83% in 2019-20 to 9.30% in 2020-21.

The 16-point programme announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech is an attempt to deceive farmers by drawing attention away from the cut in crucial allocations and failure to offer any package to boost the rural economy. It is a rehash of existing schemes, including failed schemes, and a couple of new announcements such as Kisan-Rail and Krishi-Udaan, which they said are not expected to increase the income of small and marginal farmers.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kisan-sangharsh-to-stage-protests/article30786128.ece

333,2020/02/10,61% of Hyderabadis are at risk of cyber crime: Study,"Only 45 % of Hyderabadis, who became the victims of cybercrime report the fraud, while 24 % feel that they don’t want to get into the hassle of dealing with police.

This was revealed in a survey conducted by OLX online market on the occasion of Safer Internet Day which will be observed on Tuesday. The survey also stated that 61 % of people living in the State capital are at risk of cybercrimes. “Over 51 % of Hyderabadis feel confident transacting offline than online and 45 % people often skip reading safety and privacy tips and terms on websites/apps as they feel they are too long and don’t have time,” it stated.

The survey report which is possession with The Hindu also revealed that 51 % of parents regularly monitor the kind of content their children are accessing on the Internet and 61 % people share their mobile numbers and addresses online. The study was conducted to understand the state of awareness and cyber safety preparedness, thereby raising the need towards creating a safer and inclusive internet for everyone.

It reveals a startling gap in digital literacy and cyber safety practices exercised by the netizens. “Safer Internet Day provides us with an opportunity to examine our online behaviour and emphasises upon the need to close the gap in digital literacy in general and cyber safety particularly. Cyber safety is a shared responsibility where Internet users, Internet companies, government and decision-makers are all in one ecosystem,” said Lavanya Chandan, General Counsel, OLX India.

Safeguarding ourselves and ensuring that we focus on making the Internet an inclusive place for all is our foremost vision and we aim to drive continuous conversations around the topic, he said. “It has been our continuous endeavour to advocate the cause of cyber safety into the mainstream consciousness and provide netizens with the right tools to safeguard their online presence,” Mr. Chandra said.

According to him, the overall survey indicates that even though we have come far in digital transformation in our daily lives, the majority of people in India prefer to transact offline and even if they do transact online, they do it for money transfer, online shopping and paying utility bills.

“Only 48% of the people surveyed across the country would want to report the fraud if they were defrauded and they accept having missed exercising basic precautionary measures like not sharing personal and confidential information publicly or reading safety privacy tips and terms on websites and apps,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/t34v5p/article30785804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11CYBER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/61-of-hyderabadis-are-at-risk-of-cyber-crime-study/article30785805.ece

339,2020/02/10,Ben Böhmer from Germany brings his ‘Breathing’ tour to south Asia,"As the standards of pop and EDM started to tragically sink in the 2010s, a new breed of musicians came into the mix. Active since 2015, Ben Böhmer is one of Germany’s must-see talents in the alternative music space and he is currently on tour, having just completed a leg in Mauritius and in Mumbai. He recently performed in Mumbai (Kitty Su), Hyderabad (Block 22) and Delhi (Auro).

In an email interview before his India gigs, the rising star says the tour has been exciting so far, the gig in Mauritius being wonderful. “I’m really excited about the next gigs in Asia, North America, Australia and Europe. It is the biggest tour I have ever planned. It is nice to see...that many cities were sold out within a short time. It is an indescribable feeling to reach so many people with the album Breathing.”

Dialling back a bit

Ben reminisces the value of his music-dense education, which commenced with a tryst with a synthesiser. But things really took off when he moved to Berlin from Göttingen. “It was the entry into the big world of electronic music, it was the playground to explore and learn more about the music and to make contacts. I was fortunate enough to play my first live shows in the iconic clubs Tresor and Magdalena. Little by little, I started my own label, Ton Töpferei, on which I released the Promise You EP.”

He says that at the time he did not know how a label works, how to market music or how to reach listeners. Promise You caught a few ears for its mellow and bass-heavy melodies. “After this, larger labels contacted me,” he recalls. “Then Anjunadeep (a UK-based record label) contacted me and the first tracks were released on this label,” he says. When BBC Radio 1’s disc jockey Pete Tong’s released the 2018 Essential New Tune playlist which featured Ben’s track ‘After Earth’, it soared in popularity.

Ben Böhmer performing in the United States

Anyone who thrives in Europe’s underground music scene would know ‘After Earth’ for its chart-topping placement. But Ben looks at the release of his November 2019 debut album Breathing as his biggest career landmark so far. On Spotify, he has 8,79,783 monthly listeners, if that offers up some perspective on his popularity. Tracks such as ‘Maelstrom’ and the eponymous track ‘Breathing’ remain favourites even months later, a triumph in the fickle music industry.

Musical magnetism

What about being a modern, young musician in the 2010s and 2020s? “A very good quality of a young musician is to have a lot of energy and passion for knowledge, which is very helpful for travelling the world,” he says, adding that we live in a diverse musical era. “Everything is possible and every sound is accepted. Many musicians no longer try to fit into a genre and focus on their own sound. This creates clever and creative ideas. I think that is great!”

Perhaps the fact that Ben often finds himself truly opening up to the world when he gets musical explains why he is magnetic. It is no secret that Berlin’s underground scene is a multi-sensory experience. If you are a musician in this realm, you are also an artiste. Ben says he usually adjusts his sets to his shows, though the list of tracks and the order are fixed.

“The room for improvisation is with each individual track, because I can work on the individual elements of the track separately; there are changes in the arrangement, in the effects and combinations of different tracks. In addition, I play a synthesiser, with whom I play melodies or improvise melodies.”

But it is not just opening up to the crowd; it is also opening up to the world’s different cultures. “It is a symbiosis that is important to me. By playing live I experience the emotions of the listeners live. A give and take arises and connects with the listeners. Playing live is also important to gather new impressions that can be poured into the music. Without this exchange, it would be harder for me to create.”

But being on tour around the world can be very challenging sometimes, in order to find the energy to create music across time zones. “So I like to take breaks to gain a focus on both elements. A great learning was to stay focused on myself. I learned a lot about making music for myself. This gives me emotional authenticity that the listener can feel. This focus helps immensely to find your way around the world and not to get lost,” he says.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kpkrcv/article30783379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07-ben-bohmer,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/interview-ben-bohmer-german-dj-and-producer-comes-to-india-for-breathing-tour/article30783381.ece
340,2020/02/10,The mridangam rapper who is re-imagining hip-hop,"Going purely by Shan Vincent de Paul’s videos, you expect him to be a fast-speaking, cocky young man. But over a phone call, the Toronto resident sounds calm and measured in thought. His eccentric series of ‘Mridangam Raps’ shot him to global fame, especially in the South Asian community, and kick-started his first India tour this week.

He recently débuted the Mridangam Raps series live at the VH1 Supersonic Festival in Pune with his collaborator Yanchan (Yawn-sin). Yanchan plays the mridangam — beats you would expect to hear in a sabha, alongside the konnakol. Except, the konnakol here is replaced by Shan’s raps. Bobbing his head to the beats, eyes closed, he throws bars about representing brown rappers, Tamil culture, and the immigrant experience.

The latter forms an integral part of his third and latest album: songs from which he will be playing at the India tour. “Made in Jaffna is the most autobiographical work I’ve done so far. It tells my story from Sri Lanka to Canada, on the war in Sri Lanka, my Catholic upbringing in Toronto and so on. I have touched upon these things in my previous work, but this is the first time I am finally telling my story and connecting with my Tamil and brown audience,” says Shan.

Escaping a war

Shan was six when his parents decided to leave Jaffna in 1986, right when the Sri Lankan Civil War was brewing. “We moved to Montreal as refugees, without any papers, relying on an underground network of immigrants,” he says. His family relied on the South Asian community, as they moved from Montreal to Toronto, who would help them in getting passports, jobs and other connections.

The youngest of five boys in his family, Shan recalls how his parents worked multiple jobs in restaurants and factories, and at one point, “my entire family delivered newspapers. We would take turns, waking up at 5 am.” Eventually, they established a furniture store, which became the family business. Music, Tamil or otherwise, however, was not a major part of the Vincent household. “Which is why hip hop was so special to me. It was something I discovered on my own,” he says.

Like many immigrant brown kids in the US and Canada before him, hip hop became an identity for Shan. “I remember watching a music video by DMX, and understood there was a whole different world, raw and rooted in authenticity,” he adds. Having been a creative child, whether it was drawing or writing short stories, the lyricism in hip hop drew him in. After graduating from the University of Toronto, he began rapping and recording videos professionally. “I didn’t grow up with any classical training. But with rap, you don’t need any of that to be able to tell your story.”

Getting the Classical on

Without a background in Classical music, his Mridangam Raps seem even more experimental. “I had worked with Yanchan before on a few tracks, and one day thought why don’t we try doing just the raps with him playing the mridangam. We recorded the video on an iPhone and just posted it. It immediately blew up, and we knew we were onto something,” says Shan. However, he did delve a little into Carnatic music before recording, and the one thing he found starkly different between his experience in rapping and Carnatic was less about the technicalities, and more about the attitude.

“Rap is a culture where you are bragging and boasting, trying to tell you are the best by being loud and abrasive,” he says, adding, “Carnatic, on the other hand, is humble. You perform sitting down on the ground. So rapping while I was entering that world, I learnt how humbling and spiritual it is. You can see it on the performers’ faces too, that they are tapped into this higher energy, connected to something greater.”

Despite Shan’s understanding of how different the two worlds are, his videos have received their share of flak from purists, clutching their pearls at the ‘divine’ mridangam being used next to curses so common in raps. “That’s inevitable, when someone’s world as they are used to is being interrupted,” says Shan, not too bothered. “But it is not even about the swear words, some come with their own prejudices against rapping and black culture, and I have no tolerance for that,” he adds.

February 12: Dharavi - Workshop @ Dharavi Rocks

The challenge now for Shan is to focus on how to evolve the series, both visually and sound-wise. “I don’t want to be stuck doing the same thing,” he says. Remarking that India was going through a renaissance of hip hop, he says, “The culture of rap fuses with South Asian culture effortlessly.” On this India tour, he looks forward to collaborating with the artistes he meets here.

For now though, he has a loyal collaborator and critic in his four-year-old daughter, Mimi, who spits bars in her toothy way, while he beatboxes. “If she has liked any of my songs, I will know it is good,” he adds.

Shan will be in Chennai at the Global Isai Festival on February 22, and at Bay 146, Savera, on February 29.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/iwucjd/article30783370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPSVDP-PhotobyAlexanderLam-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-mridangam-rapper-who-is-re-imagining-hip-hop/article30783374.ece
341,2020/02/10,Penn Masala’s new album ‘Musafir’ makes a catchy socio-cultural statement,"Ten full-length albums, an EP (extended play), and a compilation album. This might sound like an impressive body of work for a musical group to have put out in 24 years, but the talent in this one is a bit more fluid than most. Penn Masala, the a capella group of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, was formed in 1996 by South Asian-American students of the time. Today, the group of 10 comprises students from the batches 2020, 2021 and 2022. And yesterday, this group came out with their 11th full-length album.

This is not just any other collection of tracks by just any other band of college boys. Penn Masala blends everything from hiphop and jazz to old-school Bollywood into their work, creating statements out of each genre. Over the years, they have performed for international leaders, toured in countries around the globe, and even featured in the Hollywood film Pitch Perfect 2. For them, the new album Musafir is a stamp of their South Asian-American identity, as well as a retelling of their journey so far.

Ajay Vasisht, class of 2020, explains over a phone call from the US, “This album talks about many elements and topics that affect the diaspora. We have songs here that deal with societal pressures, social impact, and even mental health, which is something the community is not very open about discussing.”

The latter is addressed through a track that Penn Masala made in collaboration with Mumbai-based rapper and playback singer Benny Dayal. “It is a mash-up of ‘Everglow’ and ‘Kaise Mujhe’, a track from the Aamir Khan-starrer Ghajini,” adds Ajay. Because Benny is the voice behind the original Bollywood track, they thought of getting in touch with him for the a capella version as well. They reached out to Benny through his social media handles, and to their surprise, the celebrity singer responded. Two of them flew down to Mumbai to record the song with him; an experience that both Ajay and Pune man Shaunak Kulkarni describe as educational.

Another number to watch out for is a mash-up of DNCE’s ‘Cake By The Ocean’, Arijit Singh’s ‘Ghungroo’ and Kanye West’s ‘Stronger’, which is one of the few singles that the crew had released ahead of the album launch. Released on January 25, the track comes with a mildly nerdy, but playfully engaging video, and has already garnered more than one lakh views on YouTube. In sharp contrast is the pensive, bitter-sweet treatment given to a mix of ‘Bulleya’ (Pritam) and ‘Dusk till dawn’ (ZAYN ft. Sia) in a track and video released last December. Again different is ‘United By Music’, an ambitious mash-up of about 20 tracks, which is not only emotionally patriotic, but also a platform for the crew to showcase its breadth of regional Indian languages.

The album as a whole, took months to come to fruition. Says Harsh Meswani, class of 2021, “We started working on the album in July. Each song took about 25 to 30 hours of studio time to get right. Not all of them come with videos: we looked at the different vibes and the depth of emotion that each track has, and then decided what kind of treatment to give it.”

The online responses to the few tracks out already, is a testament to the following Penn Masala has built over the years. The group takes its feedback very seriously, garnering it both over social media and through direct interactions with fans when on tour. For this album in particular, it was important that the songs resonate. That, says Sachin Gali, “is what we find empowering.”

At the same time, nine have been released from home quarantine. As many as 313 persons are currently under home quarantine in the district.

A patient has been shifted to the isolation ward at Government Medical College, Kalamassery. A sample of the patient’s body fluid was sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology at Alappuzha on Sunday.

Meanwhile, there were fewer telephone calls to the District Control Room for coronavirus on Sunday. However, there are issues of people in the neighbourhood ostracising those under home quarantine. No one under home quarantine has been infected, the District Medical Office clarified.

Quarantine is part of a public safety step, and those placed under this safety net sacrifice their freedom of movement for the safety of others. Hence, it is important to ensure that people in quarantine are comfortable, said a statement from the office.

345,2020/02/10,Kochi's microbiology lab to help marine exporters,"Union Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Rameshwar Teli said here on Sunday that the new microbiology laboratory established by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPDA) in Kochi would help seafood exporters across the country handle the stiff competition in global market, especially on the quality front.

Inaugurating the lab, the Minister said the new facility would help ensure that exporters were not faced with rejection of consignments. He was accompanied by MPEDA Chairman K.S. Srinivas, who said seafood would be tested at the lab at different stages.

The inauguration of the facility was organised on the sidelines of the India International Seafood Show which concluded in Kochi on Sunday. The show is the showpiece event of seafood industry in the country.

Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Parkash visited the multi-species aquaculture complex under the MPEDA on Vallarpadam island on Saturday. He also gave away the 22nd Seafood Export awards on the occasion.

Mr. Parkash was accompanied by MPEDA Chairman Srinivas and secretary B. Sreekumar, according to a press release.

Addressing seafood show participants, he said, “There was an urgent need to make India the prime producer of seafood, going up from the fourth position it occupies now.”

The Minister acknowledged that the sector faced problems in its endeavour to achieve production and export targets without compromising on quality.

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma gave away MPEDA awards to 60 companies and individuals for excellence in exports.

347,2020/02/10,Garam Masala to spice up Lakme Fashion Week S/R 2020,"Gaurang Shah walks me through a preview of his new collection for Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) summer/resort 2020 edition, at his studio in Hyderabad. It’s a predominantly monochrome collection comprising 24 saris and 22 ensembles.

A cursory glance and it feels like Gaurang has opted for a colour detox. His collections for LFW are usually a melange of weaving techniques, and colours. Last year, he also brought out a special edition of khadi saris whose pallus had woven replications of Raja Ravi Varma paintings, and for this he used around 600 shades of natural dyes.

“I’ve been wanting to do a black and white collection for a year. Winter-festive edition was not the ideal time for it, so I am doing it now,” he says. The designer who specialises in Indian textile techniques has been travelling frequently and he makes time for this quick preview before flying out of town, again.

The collection is in association with Lakme Salon and the theme is Garam Masala. Tabu will be the showstopper and sport a Kanjivaram lehenga teamed with a sari draped like a dupatta. “I was in Mumbai just recently and showed her the ensemble; she loved it,” beams Gaurang, adding that the actor will recite Urdu poetry on stage, when curtains go up on the collection on February 14.

The monochrome line is by no means less complicated than his previous ones for the fashion week stage. Yet again, he will be showcasing a spectrum of woven textiles and jamdani will be the mainstay, done on geometric single and double ikats, paithani, pinhole bandhanis from Bhuj, Banarasi silk, Patan patolas, kalamkari, Kota, Telangana’s Puttapaka, uppada and Kashmir’s kani.

Models will walk the stage in two rows, one sporting ivory white ensembles and the other complementing it with the blacks. All the significant hues of ingredients that go into making garam masala are in the colour palette, in addition to a splash of deep red, beige, pomegranate pinks, and blues on motifs or borders.

Each of his collections involves weavers and craftspeople spending several months over a garment or sari, and Gaurang strives to create heirloom worthy pieces of wearable art.

He points at a dhakai jamdani sari that uses fine count (300) khadi yarn that takes a year to be woven: “The yarn is so fine that you won’t see it clearly with the naked eye,” he says. It’s gossamer, lightweight and bears surface techniques done with finesse.

Another sari has taken the artisans a year for its fine chikankari and another two years just to design the Parsi French knot floral embroidery border. Generous amounts of fabric have gone into some of the lehengas and anarkalis. Imagine eight to 10 metres of fine cotton for an ensemble that fits a 26-inch waist; the extra flare helps to create drama on stage when a lehenga is teamed with flowy kurtas or Anarkalis in contrasting textile technique and a sari draped like a dupatta. Does it ever get too much, outside of the ramp? “Not at all; a few clients buy them as separate pieces — and some of them like to mix and match, using their own saris as dupatta,” Gaurang sums up.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/svphgv/article30782467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gaurang-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/lakme-fashion-week-summerresort-2020-gaurang-shah-to-present-garam-masala-a-monochrome-collection/article30782468.ece
348,2020/02/10,‘There is more to nCoV than meets the eye’,"All inferences on the novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection being circulated right now are derived only based on the condition of the first 100 to 130 patients, and a lot more may come out in the coming days, participants at a panel discussion said here on Monday. The event was organised by the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium, Kozhikode, on its campus.

Pointing out that though around 40,000 cases of infection had been reported from across the globe so far, A.S. Anoop Kumar, consultant, department of critical medicine, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, said most observations were based on the examination of 100-odd patients. He added that though the mortality rate was only around 2%, the number of dead people could be higher as the number of infected patients were in thousands. “The infection need not be severe in around 80% of patients. Only around 20% of them may need hospitalisation. Only around 8% may have to be admitted to the intensive care unit,” Dr. Anoop Kumar said.

Concurring with this, A. Asuma, Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri, Malappuram, it was yet to be proved if a person without symptoms could spread the infection. “Studies and research on the subject are still going on,” she pointed out. “The mortality rate could also come down if we take out the number of patients from China from the total number of infected population. A large majority of infected patients are now in China itself, in Wuhan city of Hubei province,” Dr. Asuma said.

P.M. Anitha, Professor, Department of Microbiology, Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri, spoke about the testing of body fluid samples of patients. Jane Paul, Head Nurse, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, explained the infection control mechanisms being implemented in isolation wards.

350,2020/02/10,CAA shows Centre’s failure to honour poll promises: CPI(M),"The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre is trying to divide people in the name of the National Register of Citizens of India and the National Population Register as it cannot honour its electoral commitment to the voters, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Nilotpal Basu has alleged.

He was opening the golden jubilee celebrations of Calicut University Employees’ Union, a pro-Left service organisation, on the university campus on Monday.

“….Those who support the government always talk about the problems of soldiers who serve on the border. But a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General says there is 83% reduction in the nutritional and calorific levels of our soldiers. The government has no money [to spend on them],” Mr. Basu said. However, it could set aside ₹600 crore to provide security to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he alleged.

The CPI(M) leader accused the Centre of “breaking all constitutional and legal provisions” on a daily basis.

“At a meeting of State Police Chiefs, the Prime Minister and the Home Minister are reported to have asked them to penetrate into the social media accounts of students to know what they are thinking. This is happening at a time when there is no action against those who brutally attacked students on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus. Even 51 days after the incident, there had been no arrests or filing of First Information Report,” Mr. Basu said.

“We thought our younger generation was apolitical. But on the question of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, we saw thousands hitting the streets.... There were protests even on campuses such as St. Stephen’s College, New Delhi, and St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata, which had no history of students’ movements.” Students and teachers had come out even in Indian Institutes of Management and Indian Institutes of Technology.

Mr. Basu said there had been an assault on education, coupled with the high rate of unemployment. “The problem is not with money, but attitude. The government is spending only 3% of the Gross Domestic Product on education. Countries relatively smaller than India are spending more,” he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/caa-shows-centres-failure-to-honour-poll-promises-cpim/article30786163.ece
351,2020/02/10,Special squad formed to probe robbery in train,"The Government Railway Police (GRP) have constituted a special investigation team to probe the recent theft in two trains in which passengers complained of losing around 30 sovereigns of gold ornaments, cash to the tune of ₹22,000, and diamond jewellery.

Surveillance camera visuals from various railway stations and suspected spots have already been collected for close examination by the squad.

According to the GRP squad, two separate gangs are reportedly behind the thefts, which took place in the Chennai-Mangaluru Superfast Express and the Thiruvananthapuram-Mangaluru Malabar Express on February 8. “The robbers are suspected of following the passengers from the railway station itself, and the surveillance cameras are likely to give us concrete evidence to track the suspects,” the squad said.

In the first incident that took place in the Chennai-Mangaluru Superfast Express, the complainant, Ponnu Maran, had lost gold ornaments and diamonds worth ₹15 lakh. She had reportedly carried around 22 sovereigns of gold ornaments, cash worth ₹22,000, and diamond jewellery in a handbag. According to the police, the woman who boarded the train from Chennai came to know about the theft only when the train reached the Tirur station.

In the second incident, the complainant, Praveena Premanand, had lost 9.5 sovereigns of gold ornaments, including a chain, bangles, and ear rings, which she had kept inside her hand bag. She was travelling by the Malabar Express from Angamaly to Kanhangad. According to the GRP, the woman claimed a loss of around ₹3 lakh in the incident.

352,2020/02/10,HC takes note of poor cleanliness in observation home,"MADURAI

Taking cognisance of the fact that the Government Observation Home in Madurai and the block housing the Juvenile Justice Board were lacking in cleanliness, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed two petitioners to remit ₹15,000 so that conservancy workers could be engaged for cleaning the Home.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Karthik and Senthil, who sought anticipatory bail apprehending arrest for their involvement in illegal sand mining in Thirumangalam in Madurai district. After the court was informed that the accused were first-time offenders, the court granted them anticipatory bail.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan, who along with Justice T. Raja and Justice B. Pugalendhi inspected the observation home as a team recently, took notice of its poor upkeep and also the fact that there was no sanctioned post of conservancy workers there.

The team of judges also learnt that cleaning was done through outsourcing and a conservancy worker was engaged to clean the premises once in 15 days. Under these circumstances, Justice Swaminathan directed the petitioners to remit ₹7,500 each to the credit of the Home, so that two persons could be engaged for cleaning.

The court hoped that the State government would sanction two posts of conservancy workers for the Home and observed that the Jurisdictional Magistrate could monitor the attendance of the conservancy workers. The court said a certificate could be sent to the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court Bench every month on the attendance and the standard of work that was carried out.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-takes-note-of-poor-cleanliness-in-observation-home-madurai/article30786336.ece
353,2020/02/10,"Rioting students asked to clean up, literally!","It is not often that youth who have messed up get a chance to clean up their act.

But a novel judgment from the Madras High Court has given a group of 28 engineering students, charged with rioting and criminal intimidation, a chance to mend their ways — by actually mopping up a mess!

The order on Monday from Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira of the Madurai Bench of the High Court, came on a plea from the students to quash the FIR registered against them.

The judge directed the students to clean the general ward of the K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College in Tiruchi.

In a case of campus violence, two groups of students of the Oxford Engineering College at Pirattiyur in Tiruchi had attacked each other with with beer bottles and wooden logs in July last year. The violence left at least five students injured.

According to the police, the violence followed a warning from fourth year students to a group of third year students against eve teasing of fellow women students. What began as a warning turned into a wordy duel and soon escalated into a clash, and even spilled outside the campus.

All 28 students were arrested by the police based on separate complaints filed by both groups. The E. Pudur police registered a case under IPC Sections, including 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation).

A compromise

However, the two groups, having agreed to compromise, moved the High Court and sought the quashing of the FIR.

354,2020/02/10,MSU Registrar asked to forward harassment complaint to police,"MADURAI

Allowing the petition filed by a woman, who was a student of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University in Tirunelveli, alleging that she was sexual harassed by an Assistant Professor in 2015, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed Tirunelveli police to register a complaint and conduct an investigation.

The woman, in her petition, alleged that Assistant Professor Vinod Vincent Rajesh of History Department had sexually harassed girl students. Following a complaint filed by the woman and a some other students, a committee was constituted by the university to look into the charges and he was placed under suspension.

The committee found him guilty and the Syndicate passed a resolution accepting the report of the committee. However, he was reinstated later. The period of his suspension was treated as punishment and two increments with cumulative effect were stopped.

Rajesh was also warned not to repeat such act in the future, the petitioner said. However, the action of the university had been insufficient. It had failed to forward the complaint to the jurisdictional police, the woman said.

Section 11 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, mandated that the local committee should, if prima facie case existed, forward the complaint to the police.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan directed the Registrar of the university to forward the complaint along with committee’s report to the police. Tirunelveli Police should register an FIR on the complaint and conclude the investigation within three months, the court said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/msu-registrar-asked-to-forward-harassment-complaint-to-police-madurai-hc/article30785423.ece
355,2020/02/10,SSI murder: one more held under UAPA,"TENKASI

Tenkasi police have detained one more person, accused in the case of murder of SSI Y. Wilson at Market Road check-post in Kaliyakkavilai on January 8, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

When the investigators probing the gunning down of Wilson nabbed Abdul Shameem and his associate Thoufiq, they found that the duo had attended an ‘ideological camp’ organised in Tenkasi prior to the killing. Since the participants of the camp had reportedly discussed carrying out subversive activities in southern districts, the police arrested Mohamed Zackariah, Abdul Khader, Mohamed Ismail, all from Tenkasi; Al Habib of Pettai in Tirunelveli and Syed Khaja Kareem Nawaz of Melapalayam, under the UAPA.

Since the police also found that one Syed Ali, 30, alias Anish of Parasalai in Kerala had also attended the camp and helped Shameem and Thoufiq in taking a house on rent, he was detained a couple of days ago by Kanniyakumari police. He was handed over to Tenkasi police on Monday after interrogation.

356,2020/02/10,Conservancy workers seek increase in wages,"TIRUNELVELI

Appealing to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish to fix their wages at ₹500 a day, a group of conservancy workers engaged by Tirunelveli Corporation submitted a petition to her during the weekly grievances redressal meeting held at the Collectorate here on Monday.

In their petition, the conservancy workers, who staged a dharna at the Collectorate for a while, said those being hired by the Corporation through self-help groups were getting daily wages of ₹359. Since the State government revised daily wages of conservancy workers engaged by local bodies in April every year, the Collector should forward their demand to the government.

Besides ensuring the increased wages through a Government Order, the government should hike their daily dearness allowance to ₹134.69, they said.

A group of BJP functionaries, led by State farmers’ wing general secretary Ganeshkumar Adityan, submitted a petition to the Collector seeking action against police personnel who “assaulted” party functionary L. Thadikaran when he participated in a protest staged against opening of a liquor shop at Veeravanallur.

On behalf of Tirunelveli District Light Music Troupe Artistes Welfare Association, its president John Kennedy and others submitted a petition seeking permission to conduct programmes beyond 10 p.m. They said the police were denying permission for conducting light music programmes being organised during temple or church festivals beyond 10 p.m. This order had badly affected the livelihood of over 6,000 artistes, they said.

A group of people from Udaiyarpatti submitted a petition demanding removal of encroachment on a land belonging to the Corporation. The petitioners said the land was being used by people of all communities to organise public functions over the past several decades. However, a group of people had occupied the land and were threatening others against using it.

358,2020/02/10,"Sent home from Serbia, labourers seek balance salary from a private company","MADURAI

A group of construction labourers from Sivaganga and Madurai, who worked at Serbia for seven months, said that they were sent back to India without three months pay in February, for rebelling against their employer there.

Submitting a petition to district collector T. G. Vinay, R. Kannan from Sivaganga who was one of the employees of a private firm called ‘Idea Capital’ in Sweden, said that a set of 15 people who would regularly protest and demand wages were sent back. “The others would not stand up for their rights. They wanted to get rid of people raising their voices for justice,” he said.

He said that he did not mind being kicked out of the firm but merely asked for the salary due to each worker. “We worked overtime everyday despite sub zero temperatures because we wanted to ensure our families had a comfortable life. Apart from our monthly salaries of ₹25,000, we also would like for the amount owed overtime to be deposited to our accounts at the earliest. They owe at least ₹1 lakh to each of the 15 workers,” he said.

Mr. Kannan added that he could not reach the Indian Embassy for complaints as the 15 workers were fired and immediately booked on a plane back to India. According to him, a total of 150 Indians are still employed in the company and are being sent back to India without receiving the total salary due to them.

“All we did was ask them to follow rules. It is only appropriate that Idea Capital’s license is cancelled.

360,2020/02/10,"State showing cold shoulder to Madurai AIIMS project, says MP","Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan, has accused Tamil Nadu government of showing lackadaisical attitude towards setting up of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) project in Madurai. Besides, he condemned the Centre for allocating a measly sum of ₹12,000 for 10 railway projects worth around ₹12,000 crores in Tamil Nadu.

Talking to reporters here on Sunday, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said that as per the Centre’s plan, the AIIMS hospital and medical college buildings in Thoppur here would be commissioned by 2023 or 2024. But, before the construction work gets over, admission for the AIIMS medical college should begin at least three years in advance.

“For this to happen, the State government should provide a temporary building for the medical college and link a 300-bedded hospital to it so that the medical admission can begin at the earliest. In Jammu too where an AIIMS is coming up along with Tamil Nadu in 2023, the admission is likely to begin in August this year after the requisite facilities were provided by the Union Territory,” he said.

But, somehow Tamil Nadu government has showed cold shoulder in providing the basic facilities. “Even handing over of land for the project has been unduly delayed,” he said expressing suspicion that there was some force acting against AIIMS coming up here.

He said even part of Government Rajaji Hospital could be given for AIIMS medical college as a temporary arrangement. “If the State government is not going to provide these facilities so that the admissions can be started at least in the next academic year, then the commissioning of AIIMS might get delayed,” he added.

Centre ignoring TN

Accusing the Centre of ignoring new rail projects for Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget 2020, Mr. Venkatesan said that 10 such projects that had been included in the railway budget years back were allocated a meagre sum of ₹1,000 each.

“Against this backdrop, the Centre had allocated ₹7,000 crore for various railway projects around Uttar Pradesh,” he said.

Tamil Nadu being one of the highest contributor to the State exchequer through GST collections was given a step-motherly treatment, he accused.

All like-minded forces should come forward to condemn this. “The State government that has been in the forefront of implementing all the Centre’s policies, should intervene and get Tamil Nadu its due,” Mr. Venkatesan said.

The MP also said that after doubling work between Chennai and Madurai was completed years back only one new train had been introduced.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/en5g0r/article30780141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MACITY-SUVENKATESAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/state-showing-cold-shoulder-for-madurai-aiims-project/article30780142.ece
361,2020/02/10,A show of man’s best friend,"Gandhi Memorial Museum ground here was buzzing with activity on Sunday as around 200 dogs wooed the audience during the 33rd and 34th All Breeds Championship Dog Show. Native breeds like Kombai, Rajapalayam, Kanni and Mandhai grabbed the limelight with their agility and posture.

The annual dog show organised by Madurai Canine Club was a treat for dog lovers and residents of Madurai as the dogs were paraded by their proud owners in two arenas. A total of 221 dogs were registered from across the country.

The Manthai breed, also known as ‘Mandai,’ which is a native breed of Ramanathapuram, was the show stealer. “This breed which is ferocious in nature is used for hunting and protecting farmlands from the attack of wild animals. It also helps a shepherd in managing a herd of goats,” said P. Venkatachalapathy from Therkuvasal who breeds seven Manthai dogs. The show is helpful in creating awareness of native breeds which are declining in number, he added.

Foreign breeds such as Chihuahua, Dogue de Bordeaux, Great Dane, Labrador Retriever, Beagle, German Shepherd, Miniature Pinscher, Shih Tzu and St. Bernard also took part in the show.

Among the rare breeds that competed in the show, Baazaa, a black-coloured miniature Pinscher, was a major attraction among dog lovers. “This breed, with an average height of 12 cm, is an ideal choice for a pet animal in congested urban spaces,” said Sudhesh S. Kumar from Kochi, who breeds two miniature Pinschers.

The shows aims to encourage dog-rearing among people and create an awareness of the different breeds of dogs, said president of Madurai Canine Club S. Vinayaga Moorthy. “We also sensitise people on practices that they need to adopt to ensure healthy growth of dogs,” he said.

“The show is an eye-opener as I came to know about the different types of native breeds,” said J.

363,2020/02/10,He single-handedly nurtures 150 saplings,"It is a few minutes past six in the morning and 67-year-old M. Valavanthan, who is carrying a red plastic pot, is busy watering saplings on Tirupparankundram Road along the banks of Thenkal tank. Pointing to the row of tall trees next to the saplings, he says, “these 40 new saplings will also soon grow like those trees.”

Mr. Valavanthan, who has been living on streets, has been single-handedly growing and nurturing about 150 trees on Tirupparankundram Road for the past two years.

He starts his work as early as 5 a.m., says V. Loganathan, a tea stall owner near the tank. “Irrespective of weather conditions, Mr. Valavanthan never misses watering and nurturing the trees,” he says.

After nurturing the trees up to 9 a.m., Mr. Valavanthan baths at the Saravana Poigai and heads to Subramaniya Swamy Temple at Tirupparankundram. He finishes his breakfast and carries food for dinner from the Annadanam (free food) provided at the temple. In the evening, he again undertakes the maintenance of trees for three hours.

“Initially, he had no equipment with him. He used to dig up soil using stones and used to carry a two-litre plastic water bottle for watering the plants. It used to be disheartening to watch him walk to the tank several times to fetch water. During times when there was less water at the tank, he walks for a long distance to fetch water,” says a woman who sells fish on the bank of the tank.

Moved by his dedication, few residents and volunteers have sponsored three plastic pots and other tree planting equipment.

Mr. Valavanthan, who is a B.A. Economics graduate, says that he feels content by growing trees. “I got my three daughters married and my wife died nine years ago. I sold my house and soda manufacturing factory. Now I sleep outside a temple, located opposite the tank. Growing the plants has given me new hope in life,” he says.

The stretch is lined with tall native species such as neem, pungai, peepal, banyan, guava and jamun trees. “I pluck saplings found amid waste and plant them along roadside,” he says.

Mr. Valavanthan says that he runs errands to make his ends meet, but however, rejects offers that are at a far location. “If I travel far I would not be able to take care of these trees,” he says.

P.R. Vishwanathan, a resident of Tirunagar, says that Mr. Valavanthan has inspired many youngsters to plant trees. “A college student now regularly helps in watering the trees in the evenings. His enduring spirit motivates people to take up small work,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/yb3xaw/article30780102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MACITY-VAALAVANTHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/this-man-single-handedly-nurtures-150-roadside-saplings/article30780103.ece
364,2020/02/10,Gandhi Museum deserves a better deal to match the footfall,"On a normal day close to 1,000 persons visit Gandhi Memorial Museum, an architectural landmark in an otherwise nondescript north Madurai. On weekends and holidays, the numbers double.

However, lack of basic infrastructural facilities and manpower shortage on the sprawling 13-acre campus has come in for criticism from visitors. “We are not asking for air-conditioners in the museum, but at least, the authorities can provide fans in the library,” said Anitha Rajan, who visits the premises regularly.

The anguish expressed by Ms. Anitha seems to be not an isolated voice, but one among many. Many research scholars from Gandhigram Rural Institute and other cities pursuing doctorate on Gandhian studies suggest that an user-friendly index at the library will enable them to locate the journals/reference books easily. There are close to 40,000 rare books, manuscripts and articles dating back to four to five decades. The authorities should preserve them by using the latest technology available, the scholars say.

With the World Tamil Sangam situated close to Gandhi Memorial Museum, many foreign tourists, especially Tamil-speaking people from countries such as Canada, UK, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Singapore visit the museum.

“After seeing the Keeladi artefacts displayed on the Sangam campus, when we visited the museum, there is no rest room facility. When I peeped into the rest room, a staff said, there is no water,” Jagadeesan Veerasingh Arunachalam from Colombo, said. “I was born in Thoothukudi, but now live in Sri Lanka. My roots are still in south Tamil Nadu. I will be glad to build rest rooms with water facility here,” he told The Hindu and offered to give funds to the museum.

Likewise, many students from schools and colleges from far and near Madurai visit the museum campus as a part of educational tour. “When we take them to Gandhi Museum for the first time, they should have a good impression so that it will last their lifetime. But the situation here is such that even refreshments are not available for the children on the campus,” a teacher, accompanying students from a school in Virudhunagar district, said.

A faculty member from Madurai Kamaraj University said that the library authorities can install a user-friendly online search facility at the library so that users can easily locate the book or material.

Admitting that the museum required a facelift, an executive committee member of the Gandhi Museum said that recently some officials from Ahmedabad Gandhi Heritage visited the campus and suggested certain steps to improve the amenities. A new proposal to give a facelift to the Peace Park, the Gandhi Kudil and the open-air auditorium were discussed at the meeting, he said.

Gandhi Museum Director (Administration) Nanda Rao said that they have prepared separate proposals for fund mobilisation and to execute works at the Museum’s library and other wings on the campus. Collector T.G. Vinay is keen on improving the facilities and has sought a proposal to this effect, he said.

The Guest House with about 10 rooms, situated behind the Main Museum, would be refurbished without disturbing the structure. “We have engaged an architect who visited the campus recently. We are in the process of re-doing the premises, without changing the heritage values,” he added.

Better salaries

After the demise of museum secretary M.P. Gurusamy, the authorities are yet to nominate a regular secretary, the EC member said and added that the staff salary structure needed revision. The museum has to appoint new staff since the vacancies have resulted in work pressure for the empoloyees.

During Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao’s time, Gandhi Museums across the country received a one-time grant of ₹one crore each. With the money being deposited in the bank, the interest earned helped, to some extent, to meet monthly bills, he said.

The State government also gave ₹3 lakh per annum. But it is meagre. Like the Centre, the Tamil Nadu government should give more grants to the museum. “Gandhi Museum is not a business venture. We are not here for making profits. We are propagating the ideals of of the Bapu (Mahatma). With some of the noted industrialists on Board and as Executive Committee members, the museum should get a new look in the next few months,” said Mr. Nanda Rao.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/4lieow/article30780091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MACITY-GANDHIMUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/gandhi-museum-needs-better-facilities-to-match-the-footfall/article30780092.ece

Speaking at a panel discussion on “Education, Nation and Culture” on the last day of the three-day State-level ABVP conference, Mr. Shrilalu said that presently, the education system was not reflecting the ethos, culture and diverse traditions that the country stands for.

“If the education system is not Indianised, then it will be difficult for the country to resolve its problems. Education should help build pride among the youth for the country they live in. The Draft National Education Policy does not reflect this aspect,” he said.

“If we become aware of our cultural identity, then no force on earth can root out the regard we have for legends such as Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar,” he said and expressed the need to think beyond region and caste lines.

370,2020/02/10,"CAA is really worrisome, says writer Boluvaru Kunhi","Expressing concern about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the the proposed National Register of Citizens, writer Boluvaru Mohammed Kunhi said on Sunday that it would be distressing for a writer who has stood for solidarity to have to prove his Indian citizenship.

Speaking after receiving the Sandesha award instituted by the Sandesha Foundation for Culture and Education, Mr. Kunhi said that by expressing his concern, he will probably be pursued as a spokesperson of Muslims. “It is an unfortunate state we are living in. We are branding people without properly understanding what is being said,” he said.

He said an impression was being created that those speaking against CAA were all Muslims. “If I speak against CAA, well-known writers whom I know tell me that they will stand by me. Who are they to say it? Is this not my country?” he asked.

Mr. Kunhi said that he was born in 1951 and his father was born before the formation of Pakistan and Bangladesh. “When this fact is known, it hurts if I am asked to prove myself an Indian citizen. Through my writings, I have always stood in solidarity with India,” he said.

Karnataka Sahitya Academy president B.V. Vasanth Kumar said that comparing the minority communities persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, for whom citizenship is being proposed, with Indian Muslims was an insult and injustice to the latter.

He said that by stating falsehoods about CAA, which does not say anything about sending Indian Muslims out, those opposing the amended Act were trying to recreate barriers between communities. “There is a need for writers to closely study the Act and stop telling lies,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Bishop of Ballari Henry D’Souza conferred the award on Mr. Kunhi and six others — Valli Vagga (Valerian D’Souza) of Bantwal, engineer Shiv Kumar from Bengaluru, Helen Correa nee D’Cruz, psychiatrist K.S. Pavithra, Justin D’Souza from Siddaganga Education Institution in Davangere, and bodybuilder Vincent Prakash Carlo.

371,2020/02/10,Wholesale PV sales crash on rising costs,"Continuing a downward trend, wholesale passenger vehicles sales in the country declined by 6.2% to over 2.62 lakh units in January 2020, as rising cost of vehicle ownership and slower GDP growth continued to put pressure on consumer demand, industry body SIAM said on Monday.

The domestic passenger vehicle sales, which includes sales of cars, utility vehicles and vans, stood at over 2.8 lakh units in January 2019. As per the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, car sales fell 8.1% to over 1.64 lakh units in January 2020 as against over 1.79 lakh units in the same month last year.

Sales of utility vehicles were up 2.57% to 84,929 units, while that of vans fell by 27.68% to 12,992 units in the last month.

Rajan Wadhera, president at SIAM, said, “Sales of vehicles continue to be stressed due to rising cost of vehicle ownership and slower growth in GDP.”

He added that the industry was hopeful that the recent announcement of the government on infrastructure and rural economy would support growth of vehicle sales going forward, especially commercial vehicles and the two-wheeler segment. The total two-wheeler sales in January 2020 declined by 16.06% to over 13.41 lakh units as compared to over 15.97 lakh units in the same month last year. While sales of motorcycles declined by 15.17% to more than 8.71 lakh units, scooter sales were down 16.21% to more than 4.16 lakh units.

The data showed that wholesale sales of commercial vehicles, which are seen as one of the indicators of economic activity in the country, fell by 14.04% to 75,289 units in January 2020, as compared to 87,591 in January 2019. Under commercial vehicles segment, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles fell 34.64% to 22,534 units, while that of light commercial vehicles were down 0.68% to 52,755 units.

SIAM director general Rajesh Menon noted that wholesale sales continued to dip in all segments, barring the three-wheeler segment, which saw a growth of 12.69% to over 60,903 units.

Vehicle sales across categories registered a decline of 13.83% to over 17.39 lakh units, down from sales of more than 20.19 lakh units in January 2019. “We are hopeful that the response that we have received to the ongoing Auto Expo will help further improve consumer sentiment.

372,2020/02/10,Royal Enfield eyes global markets for apparel business,"Royal Enfield is eyeing international markets, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, to grow its nearly five-year-old apparel and accessories business, and is looking at catering to the increasing demand within India, a senior company official said.

“Royal Enfield motorcycles sell in a large number of countries and that gives us a platform to cater to the customers there and representation in those countries. The plan that we are working on right now is to build a stronger portfolio that could cater to specific international markets,” Puneet Sood, head, Apparel Business at Royal Enfield, told The Hindu.

Mr. Sood believes that the international market would be one of the areas that would drive growth for the company’s apparel and accessories business.

Asked about the target markets, he said, “One of our objectives is to build high impact, which means that wherever our motorcycle presence iS strong, those are the markets we will start focussing on. For example, Europe is a heritage market for us. We are a known brand there. This is one of the markets we will focus on, the U.K, specifically. APAC is another market, which we believe, holds huge potential for us.”

While Mr. Sood did not share any numbers, he said that in the last two years, the business segment had seen a significant growth. “We are in higher double-digit growth right now. So, we are definitely growing at a faster pace in that market, which itself is growing at a good pace in India.”

Mr. Sood pointed out that riding conditions and product certifications vary from market to market. “For example, a helmet in Thailand will require different certification vs. helmet sold in India, vs. what is sold in Europe... so that is another bit that we are working on. Plus, in an apparel business, the fit also differs from market to market...we are working on.”

He added that while currently the company’s range was focussed on India, most riding products met international norms, and were supplied to international markets as well. Mr. Sood said that specifically for India, the company intended to introduce products that are value for money, and are competitive in terms of pricing and suitable for the Indian terrain.

Under the segment, the company sells protective gear such as helmets, riding jackets, gloves, trousers, shoes, besides products like shirts, t-shirts, key chain, mugs, belts and wallets. Mr. Sood said that the company had invested a lot of time in developing products specially for India as the weather and terrain here were different than in other markets.

“One of our objectives is that keep improving the product portfolio that we have. We are working with riding groups very very closely... there are market needs that are emerging... we are currently researching products that can be offered to cater to that need,” Mr. Sood said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/px7m9t/article30785574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUENFIELD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/royal-enfield-eyes-global-markets-for-apparel-business/article30785575.ece

Metrodecker electric buses are designed and built at Optare’s facility in Sherburn, near Leeds. It is the third major contract for Metrodecker EVs. By the end of 2020, 100 units of the bus will be in service in the English capital.

“These 37 Metrodecker EVs will save more than 1,800 tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions well-to-wheel in each year of operation versus a Euro VI bus,” said Vipin Sondhi, managing director and chief executive officer, Ashok Leyland Ltd. (ALL).

374,2020/02/10,"IOB Q3 loss widens to ₹6,075 cr. on higher provisions","Public sector lender Indian Overseas Bank’s (IOB) net loss for the third quarter ended December 2019 widened to ₹6,075 crore on higher provisioning of ₹6,664 crore for non-performing assets (NPAs) and investments.

In the year-earlier period, provisioning stood at ₹2,075 crore.

During the period under review, total income stood at ₹5,198 crore (₹5,689 crore), net interest income at ₹1,279 crore (₹1,384 crore) and total expenditure at ₹4,436 crore (₹4,222 crore). Net interest margin (NIM) stood at 1.94%.

IOB brought down its gross NPAs to ₹23,734 crore with a ratio of 17.12% against ₹35,787 crore with a ratio of 23.76% in the year-earlier period. Net NPAs were contained to ₹7,087 crore with a ratio of 5.81% against ₹17,988 crore with a ratio of 13.56%. Provision coverage ratio improved to 86.20% (64.23%).

Fresh slippages during the period stood at ₹1,648 crore (₹1,700 crore) and recovery, including technical write-offs, was ₹7,085 crore (₹3,723 crore).

“To come out of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) of the RBI, we have to cross two major hurdles. One is to keep the net NPAs below 6% and another is to make a profit. We have brought down the net NPAs to 5.81%. Our next objective is to make profit every quarter and make it sustainable,” said Karnam Sekar, MD & CEO, Indian Overseas Bank.

“This is the year of resurgence. We plan to come out of the PCA by focusing on recovery, low-cost deposits and less capital-consuming advances,” he said.

Stating they were hoping to make profit from the next quarter onwards, he pointed out that IOB had been incurring losses for almost five years.

“Going forward, we do not want to be aggressive in the corporate sector. We will be in retail in a big way. Currently, the split between corporate and retail is 28% and 72% respectively. The slippages in the corporate sector accounts have been fully exhausted. We don’t foresee any fresh slippages. The slippage in fourth quarter towards corporate accounts will be almost zero,” he said.

NCLT accounts

Mr. Sekar also said exposure towards telecom sector was nil and slippages in retail, agriculture, MSME (RAM) sector was coming down to an average of ₹500-600 crore per quarter. He also expected to recover a huge sum from two huge NCLT accounts.

“We have a net NPA of about ₹7,000 crore and this could be provided for within three years.

“With conviction and confidence, I can say we will sustain net profit as we will be making a profit of ₹3,000 crore every year and with this, the net NPAs could be taken care off,” he said.

Mr. Sekar said that they had made provisions of 86% towards bad debts, which is one of the highest in the industry, and efforts were on to recover the balance.

With regard to huge provisioning of ₹45,000 crore made in the last six years, he said even 1% recovery amounted to a conservative sum of ₹450 crore and that would strengthen the bank’s balance sheet.

NIM at 1.94% is still a concern and this would increase to above 2% in the coming quarters, he said.

Total deposits marginally increased to ₹2,21,290 crore from ₹2,20,311 crore while gross advances stood at ₹1,38,643 crore (₹1,50,590 crore).",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/b7akok/article30785508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUIOB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/iob-q3-loss-widens-to-6075-cr-on-higher-provisions/article30785509.ece
375,2020/02/10,Amazon challenges India antitrust probe in court,"Amazon.com Inc has begun legal action in India to quash an antitrust investigation against the company, saying it could cause “irreparable” loss and damage to its reputation, according to its court filing seen by Reuters.

Last month the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered an investigation of Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices.

Amazon and Flipkart have faced mounting criticism from India’s brick-and-mortar retailers, which accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law by racking up billions of dollars of losses to fund deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers. The companies deny the allegations.

The CCI ordered its probe after a New Delhi-based trader group complained that the e-commerce giants were promoting select sellers and in turn hurting business for other smaller players in one of the world’s biggest online shopping markets.

“The entire order passed by (the CCI) ... is bereft of any foundation,” Amazon said in a February 10 filing to a court in the city of Bengaluru, rejecting the allegations levelled against the company.

“(The investigation order) suffers from non-application of mind as it appears to contain no reference to the finding of an appreciable adverse effect on competition.”

Amazon declined a Reuters request for comment, saying the matter was going through the courts. The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Flipkart said after the CCI ordered the probe that it was ”fully compliant” with all laws in India.

The Bengaluru court is likely to hear Amazon’s petition later this week and the complainant trader group, Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, has been informed about it, a lawyer involved in the matter said.

The trader group will defend its case to ensure the antitrust probe is not quashed or put on hold, the lawyer added.

More stringent foreign investment rules in India have also affected Amazon.

Last month, after the CCI probe was launched, India’s trade minister said Amazon wasn’t doing any “great favour” by announcing a new $1 billion investment, laying bare the tensions with the U.S. online retailer.

“The (CCI) investigation also has reputational consequences for the petitioner, being a global company and a part of the internationally reputed Amazon Group,” the e-commerce giant said in its filing.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/asxxxs/article30783905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/amazon-challenges-india-antitrust-probe-in-court/article30783906.ece
376,2020/02/10,Auto industry apprehensive over coronavirus impact on component supply from China: SIAM,"The Indian automotive industry is apprehensive about coronavirus outbreak disrupting component supplies from China, but a clear picture will emerge only in the next few days after factories in the country reopen, SIAM said on Monday.

Auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said it will be collecting information and data from its members in the next couple of days to understand if there could be disruptions, and to what extent, if there are any.

“It is still slightly early to comment on it. The only thing I can say is that there are apprehensions and everybody is waiting to see as today is the day when China (market) is supposed to open up post their Chinese New Year holidays,” SIAM Director General Rajesh Menon told reporters here.

He was responding to a query on whether the coronavirus outbreak would disrupt supplies from China and, if that happens, how it could affect transition to BS-VI emission norm from BS-IV from April 1.

“We will get clarity on the exact nature of impact and the possible implications. What is clear is that there are apprehensions. To what extent the problem will be, we will come to know in the next few days,” Menon reiterated.

When asked if there would be a need for SIAM to make a representation to the Supreme Court to extend the BS-VI transition deadline in the wake of possible supply disruption due to coronavirus, Menon said, “It is too early (to comment on that). We have to wait from our member companies to decide on that. In two or three days we will have a better idea.”

He said the supply chain in the auto industry ranges from Tier I to Tier II and III suppliers, and information has to come from across.

“We are in touch with member companies and we will see what needs to be done once we have more data in hand,” Menon said.

He further said it was too early to assess how much of components come from China would see disruption.

When asked about the problem posed by coronavirus, Maruti Suzuki Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa told PTI, “Nobody knows at this moment.”

He further said it was unclear at the moment as to how long the outbreak would last and what sort of impact it could have.

“Some people say it is very serious and some people say may be three months later it will be fine,” Ayukawa said, adding that the situation needed to be assessed.

Last week, Tata Motors CEO and Managing Director Guenter Butschek had said that clarity about supply constraints of components from China will only emerge when workers in the coronavirus-hit country rejoin work (expected from Monday).

The company, which imports certain components for both Nexon EV and other traditional models from China, said if the workers don’t join work next week, then it could lead to supply issues for not only for Tata Motors but for the entire global automobile industry.

The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent advisories on Chinese travelling into India has had an impact on the attendance of officials from participating companies at the Auto Expo here.

China’s largest SUV manufacturer Great Wall Motor (GWM), which announced $1 billion in India, stated that its leadership team from the headquarter could not make it here due to the outbreak and the subsequent travel advisories.

China’s FAW Group firm automaker Haima Automobile also cancelled its scheduled press conference as top leadership team of the company could not make it to India.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/d5x9it/article30781683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/auto-industry-apprehensive-over-coronavirus-impact-on-component-supply-from-china-siam/article30781684.ece
377,2020/02/10,MF assets rise to record highs in January,"The average assets under management of mutual funds hit an all-time high of ₹28.18 lakh crore in January, as flows into debt funds increased significantly, while mid-cap and small-cap funds saw a revival in investor interest.

According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), net inflows in the month of January was pegged at ₹1.20 lakh crore, as against outflows of nearly ₹61,810 crore in December 2019.

Further, the total assets under management (AUM) touched ₹27.86 lakh crore in January.

Further, flows into income and debt category turned positive in January with net inflows of ₹1.09 lakh crore, as against the previous month’s outflows of nearly ₹78,427 crore. Such categories of funds typically see a spurt in outflows at the end of every quarter.

Within the equity segment, both mid-cap and small-cap categories of funds saw net inflows of over ₹1,000 crore each, with the mid-cap category registering flows of nearly ₹1,800 crore in January.

Incidentally, the BSE Midcap index gained a little over 3% in January after losing ground in December. Further, the gains in the broader index came even as the benchmark Sensex lost nearly 1.30% in January.

“While the small-cap funds have not been in favour during the last few months, the recent market rally seems to have driven the inflows into small and midcap fund inflows. As a result, the small cap AUM has also seen the biggest jump in the last nine months,” said Sundeep Sikka, ED and CEO, Nippon Life India Asset Management.

“With the Union Budget 2020 and subsequent RBI policy leading to several structural changes, we will continue to stay optimistic on the market outlook. The retail investors may continue investing in the markets through SIPs [systematic investment plans], while staying balanced in their investing approach between different asset classes,” added Mr. Sikka.

Meanwhile, the number of SIP folios crossed the three-crore mark, with the number of such folios pegged at 3.04 crore in January – the month saw addition of 12.07 lakh folios.

Further, the flows through SIPs was ₹8,531.90 crore in January with the AUM pegged at ₹3.25 lakh crore.

According to N.S. Venkatesh, chief executive, AMFI, the SIP contribution and the AUM is a proof that retail investors have accepted mutual funds as a long term wealth creation avenue.

“We expect this positive growth momentum in mutual fund AUMs to continue, driven by growth-oriented Budget and RBI stance on continuing benign interest rate cycle, resulting in 15- 20% growth for the mutual fund industry this fiscal,” said Mr. Venkatesh.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/87u3kl/article30785609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11Mutualcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/mf-assets-rise-to-record-highs-in-jan/article30785610.ece

380,2020/02/10,Malawi at the crossroads,"The annulment of last May’s presidential elections by Malawi’s constitutional court could have far-reaching consequences for the continent’s democratic process, often marred by controversy over the political longevity of several leaders. Lilongwe’s unanimous verdict has imposed a return to the status quo prior to the polls and a re-run of the vote within 150 days. The decision also means that President Peter Mutharika’s former vice-president Saulos Chilima is to be reinstated in that position. Mr. Chilima finished a distant third in the May contest, heading the United Transformation Movement. The sensational ruling in the southern African state comes less than three years since the top court in Nairobi invalidated the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ordered a repoll within 60 days.

Many irregularities

Mr. Mutharika’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been found complicit in widespread and systematic irregularities, which the Justices have opined compromised the integrity of the polls. Directly implicating the electoral commission, they noted that three-fourths of the tally sheets were not audited and correction fluid had been used extensively to tinker with the ballot, dubbed the Tipp-Ex election. Curiously, results were declared last May despite more than a hundred complaints of poll fraud registered with the Malawian electoral commission. The legal reversal is equally an embarrassment for international poll monitors who gave a clean chit to the authorities.

The court’s other recommendation that parliament replace the electoral commission also has a ring of familiarity with the Kenyan situation following the 2017 polls. On that occasion, the opposition boycotted the October re-run, objecting to the absence of meaningful reforms to the electoral body that left President Kenyata’s ruling party to claim victory without a serious challenge.

The Lilongwe court was evidently troubled by the meagre proportion of the vote secured by Mr. Mutharika. Under the current first-past-the-post system, Mr. Mutharika was declared winner, with just over 38% of the vote, against 35% for his rival Lazarus Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party. The court has therefore proposed a radical reform, requiring the nation’s president to be elected in a runoff, if the winning candidate fails to garner more than 50% of the popular vote in the first instance. Such an alteration could potentially render Malawi’s multi-party system far more credible and genuinely competitive.

The President’s narrow margin of victory in a multi-cornered race, as well as the ruling party’s poor showing in the National Assembly, winning just 63 out of the 193 seats, encouraged Mr. Chakwera and Mr. Chilima to challenge the results. Mr. Mutharika’s 2014 first term election was similarly disputed by his predecessor Joyce Banda, but eventually resolved in his favour. The 79-year-old President’s second-term bid last year was also resisted by sections within the DPP, including the widow of former President Bingu wa Mutharika, the incumbent’s brother.

A crucial test

The recent legal setback is therefore likely to invigorate the President’s detractors. Meanwhile, Mr. Mutharika, a former professor of law, has said that he will appeal the verdict, describing it as “a serious miscarriage of justice”. The judgment also seems to have prompted calls for the courts to revisit the results of the National Assembly polls. The coming few weeks will thus prove to be a crucial test of judicial independence and legislative authority over the political executive in Malawi.

In the tense atmosphere following the historic 2017 verdict, an official in Kenya’s electoral body fled the country, expressing doubts about a free and fair poll. Malawians would be wise to exercise caution and restraint in the circumstances. It is easy to exaggerate the importance of the recent legal landmark, given the widespread prevalence of one-party dominance in Africa. But the Nairobi and Lilongwe rulings inspire optimism about the continent’s democratic future.

381,2020/02/10,Seeking a more progressive abortion law,"Recent reports have shown that more than 10 women die everyday due to unsafe abortions in India, and backward abortion laws only contribute to women seeking illegal and unsafe options. The Cabinet has recently approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (MTP Bill, 2020) which will soon be tabled in Parliament. It seeks to amend the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (MTP Act) and follows the MTP Bills of 2014, 2017 and 2018, all of which previously lapsed in Parliament.

The MTP Act divides its regulatory framework for allowing abortions into categories, according to the gestational age of the foetus. Under Section 3, for foetuses that are aged up to 12 weeks, only one medical practitioner’s opinion is required to the effect that the continuance of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the life of the mother or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health; or there is a substantial risk that if the child is born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. But if the foetus is aged between 12 weeks and 20 weeks, at least two medical practitioners’ opinions conforming to either of the two conditions are required.

The MTP Act also specifies that ‘grave injury’ may be explained as the anguish caused by a pregnancy arising out of rape, or the anguish caused by an unwanted pregnancy arising out of the failure of a contraceptive used by a married woman or her husband. Beyond 20 weeks, termination may be carried out where it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.

Issues with the current law

Several issues arise from the current framework under the MTP Act. First, at all stages of the pregnancy, the healthcare providers, rather than the women seeking abortion, have the final say on whether the abortion can be carried out. This is unlike the abortion laws in 67 countries, including Iceland, France, Canada, South Africa and Uruguay, where a woman can get an abortion ‘on request’ with or without a specific gestational limit (which is usually 12 weeks).

It is true that factors such as failure of contraceptives or grave injury are not required to be proved under the MTP Act. However, to get a pregnancy terminated solely based on her will, the woman may be compelled to lie or plead with the doctor. Thus, at present, pregnant women lack autonomy in making the decision to terminate their pregnancy, and have to bear additional mental stress, as well as the financial burden of getting a doctor’s approval.

Restrictive interpretation

Second, the MTP Act embodies a clear prejudice against unmarried women. According to ‘Explanation 2’ provided under Section 3(2) of the Act, where a pregnancy occurs due to failure of any birth control device or method used by any “married woman or her husband”, the anguish caused is presumed to constitute a “grave injury” to the mental health of the pregnant woman. While the applicability of this provision to unmarried women is contested, there is always the danger of a more restrictive interpretation, especially when the final decision rests with the doctor and not the woman herself.

Third, due to advancements in science, foetal abnormalities can now be detected even after 20 weeks. However, the MTP Act presently allows abortion post 20 weeks only where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. This means that even if a substantial foetal abnormality is detected and the mother doesn’t want to bear life-long caregiving responsibilities and the mental agony associated with it, the law gives her no recourse unless there is a prospect of her death.

In 2008, the Bombay High Court was petitioned by Haresh and Niketa Mehta to allow them to abort their foetus that had been diagnosed with a heart defect in its 22nd week. While the case got nationwide attention, the Mehtas’ plea was turned down, and Niketa Mehta eventually suffered a miscarriage in the 27th week of her pregnancy.

Several cases have followed since. Only in some of them has the Supreme Court allowed the termination of a pregnancy beyond 20 weeks, based on the advice by the Medical Board regarding the threat to the mother’s life.

While the MTP Bill, 2020, is a step in the right direction, it still fails to address most of the problems with the MTP Act. First, it doesn’t allow abortion on request at any point after the pregnancy. Second, it doesn’t take a step towards removing the prejudice against unmarried women by amending the relevant provision. And finally, it enhances the gestational limit for legal abortion from 20 to 24 weeks only for specific categories of women such as survivors of rape, victims of incest, and minors. This means that a woman who does not fall into these categories would not be able to seek an abortion beyond 20 weeks, even if she suffers from grave physical or mental injury due to the pregnancy.

In case of foetal abnormality

However, the Bill does make the upper gestational limit irrelevant in procuring an abortion if there are substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by the Medical Board. This means that even if there is no threat to the mother’s life, she would be able to procure an abortion as soon as a substantial foetal abnormality comes to light. While this is an important step and would have in the past helped many women who fought long battles in Court without recourse, it is crucial that it is accompanied by appropriate rules for the Medical Boards that guard against unnecessary delays, which only increase the risks associated with a late abortion.

The Supreme Court has recognised women’s right to make reproductive choices and their decision to abort as a dimension of their personal liberty (in Mrs. X v. Union of India, 2017) and as falling within the realm of the fundamental right to privacy (in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, 2017). Yet, current abortion laws fail to allow the exercise of this right. While it is hoped that MTP Bill, 2020 will not lapse in Parliament like its predecessors, it is evident that it does not do enough to secure women’s interests, and there is still a long road ahead for progressive abortion laws.

382,2020/02/10,Searching for a solution: On Bodo accord,"New Delhi’s third attempt at conflict resolution with Assam’s Bodos came out of the blue. The State had been more in the news for the sustained protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, one that pre-dates the pan-India ferment after the Bill’s passage in Parliament. The signing of the peace accord on January 27 shifted attention after the Prime Minister had to abort two planned trips to Guwahati for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on December 15 and the inauguration of the Khelo India Games on January 10. The new deal offers more hope than the 1993 and 2003 accords; some of the most potent factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland that had stayed away from earlier agreements are now on board. More significantly, the stakeholders have agreed that the updated political arrangements would remain confined to the realm of wider autonomy within the State of Assam, giving statehood and Union Territory demands a final burial. The generous terms promise an expanded area to be renamed as Bodoland Territorial Region, a ₹1,500-crore development package, and greater contiguity of Bodo-populated areas. There is also an offer of general amnesty for militants, with heinous crimes likely to be benignly reviewed, and ₹5 lakh each to the families of those killed during the Bodo movement — it claimed nearly 4,000 lives. On a success scale, the agreement falls somewhere between the Naga framework agreement of August 2015, shrouded in secrecy, and the January 16 Bru settlement to permanently settle around 34,000 people displaced from Mizoram in 1997 in Tripura. While it empowers Bodos, the question of an enduring peace remains moot.

With newer claimants to a share of spoils, the current bonhomie could be severely tested when the expanded Bodoland Territorial Council goes to the polls soon. It has been dominated since inception in 2003 by the Bodoland Peoples Front, comprising former Bodo Liberation Tigers cadre, but the new batches of surrendered militants as well as the All Bodo Students’ Union intend to enter the fray. Of greater concern are inter-tribal and community ties. The Bodos comprise not more than 30% of the population in the BTR region, and the central munificence has deepened the insecurity among Koch Rajbongshis, Adivasis and Muslims. The politics of deferring to such identity-based movements is part of an old playbook of internal security in the Northeast — the Bru solution betrays shades of it, and one can trace it back to the Mizo insurgency and Laldenga becoming the Chief Minister of Mizoram. The Kokrajhar MP, a non-Bodo, has appealed to the government to ensure that a Bodo solution does not engender a non-Bodo problem. The accord’s success will lie in the stakeholders working out a power-sharing arrangement in the proposed BTR that privileges equity over hegemony.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/searching-for-a-solution-the-hindu-editorial-on-bodo-accord/article30777398.ece
383,2020/02/10,Cat conundrum: On cheetahs in Indian forests,"The Supreme Court’s order enabling the introduction of exotic cheetahs to an Indian habitat on an experimental basis has naturally led to renewed enthusiasm among wildlife lovers, who see in it a potential bulwark against creeping pressures on habitats. As a graceful animal that was hunted and extirpated in the country in the 20th century, the cat has periodically inspired campaigns for a fresh introduction mainly inspired by the nationalistic sense of loss. Remarkably, the antiquity of the high-speed hunter that formed part of Mughal hunting groups has been a matter of scientific debate, with much literature tracing the origins of the Asiatic cheetah to about 200,000 years ago, and one recent hypothesis arguing, in contrast, that it appears to be a relatively modern alien import to India. With a group surviving in Iran, there is growing interest in preserving the Asian population. Whatever its origins, it is illogical to expect that a new population, whether from Africa or Iran, will fare better today than in the past. It is worth recalling that the same court observed in its 2013 order restraining the Environment Ministry from importing African cheetahs into Kuno, Madhya Pradesh, that there are many seriously threatened Indian species such as the lion, the Great Indian Bustard, Bengal florican, the dugong, and Manipur brow-antlered deer which deserve immediate conservation action.

Also read: What drove the charismatic cheetah to extinction in India?

Any move to rewild India’s threatened natural spaces with cheetahs, which require large grassland ranges, should consider the viability of such a programme. Man-animal conflicts is an area of concern, as a growing human population lives cheek by jowl with tigers, leopards and long-ranging creatures such as elephants. While the Court has appointed an expert committee to guide and direct the experiment proposed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, it needs a broader scientific inquiry into the added pressures that a small group of introduced predators will impose on an ecosystem, crucially on the prey base that currently sustains tigers and leopards. Any attempt at expensive rewilding will be negated by parallel efforts to liberalise environmental clearances for extractive industries in and around forests. Material extraction including minerals is going on close to protected areas, and fresh roads are sought to be built through even tiger territory, making pristine rewilding an incongruous concept. Moreover, cheetahs are genetically fragile and lose cubs in a litter prematurely, affecting the establishment of a viable population. Restoring ecology and diverse species cannot be a serious goal in the absence of iron-clad protections to existing parks, sanctuaries, migratory corridors, and buffer areas. Preserving wild spaces with surviving species should be the first order priority.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cat-conundrum-the-hindu-editorial-on-cheetahs-in-indian-forests/article30777417.ece
384,2020/02/10,Bangladeshi nationals caught trying to fly to Malaysia using Indian passports,"Immigration officials, on Friday, caught two Bangladeshi nationals trying to board a flight to Malaysia using valid Indian passports.

One of the accused has been identified as Tiual Barua Das Arnab, 21, a native of Chittagong, who had come to India on a tourist visa in August 2019.

Arnab approached a local agent who got him an Indian passport with forged IDs and sent him to a mutt in Nagpur where he stayed for some time before getting a visa to Malaysia. He reached Bengaluru and submitted the documents for immigration check to board a flight to Malaysia.

On suspicion, the immigration officials detained him and a detailed questioning led him to confess to the crime, officials said.

The same day, the officials caught 28-year-old Akel Barua Roy Tanmoy, who had submitted the papers for immigration clearance before boarding a flight to Malaysia. Roy confessed to the officials that he is a native of Bangladesh and a high school dropout. He came to India by crossing the porous border and stayed in Kolkata for some time where he got a valid Indian passport through a tout.

Based on his instruction, Roy was sent to a mutt in Nagpur where he stayed for some time before procuring a Malaysian visa, immigration officials said.

Gopalakrishna B.N., police constable attached to the V.V. Puram station, was returning to the station after the night round when a man approached him and alerted him about a suspicious object protruding from the ground.

Gopal Krishna went to the spot, and recovered what turned out to be a rusted double-barrel gun. He alerted his seniors and cleaned the rust and mud to find a name plate mentioning S. Insaf Ali and Sons along with a number inscription on the metal plate attached to the butt of the gun.

The weapon was later handed over to the senior officials, who in turn, sent it to the ballistic division of the Forensic Science Laboratory for analysis.

According to the police, the weapon could have been lying buried for more than two decades but said they are awaiting the detailed analysis from experts. The recovery of the weapon has baffled the police who are probing the reason behind burying the weapon in the backyard of the hospital.

The V.V. Puram police have taken up a case under the Arms Act, and are trying to track down the owner of the weapon. The police are also checking the armoury shop to question the owner.

The police are also checking old records to find whether there were any complaints or cases filed related to the recovered weapon.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-find-gun-buried-in-victoria-hospital-backyard/article30786346.ece
386,2020/02/10,"Schools demanding money to issue TCs, complain parents","With the academic year coming to an end, several parents are running from pillar to post to get a transfer certificate (TC) for their children. Parents allege that school managements are asking them to pay money for the TC.

Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said they received several complaints in this regard. “Parents have filed complaints before the commission and we are directing officers of the Department of Public Instruction to issue notices to schools and ensure that the students get the transfer certificate,” he said. Sources in the commission said many parents had applied for transfer certificate because either they wanted to change the child’s school as they were not satisfied with the quality of education or they were relocating to other areas in the city. “One school has demanded as high as ₹20,000 to issue a transfer certificate even though all the parents have paid all the dues,” a source in the commission said.

While some school managements are claiming that the dues by the parents have to be cleared, other managements admit that they are asking parents to pay money as it is too late for them to admit other students in the same class.

Suraj S., a parent who is awaiting for his daughter’s transfer certificate said although the Department of Public Instruction has made the process of issuing transfer certificates easier, it still had not benefited the parents. “The department in 2016 had stated that the transfer certificate no longer needs to have a countersignature by the jurisdictional Block Education Officer, but what does one do when the school itself doesn’t issue a certificate?” he asked. An official in the Department of Public Instruction, however, stated that such complaints will be immediately addressed and a show-cause notice will be issued to the school if the parents give a written complaint against the school management.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/schools-demanding-money-to-issue-tcs-complain-parents/article30786332.ece
387,2020/02/10,"Bagaluru lake springs back to life, thanks to treated water from city","Bagaluru lake, located on the outskirts of the city, is now filled to the brim after three decades; and it’s treated water from the city that has helped the lake spring back to life.

This is the first lake to receive treated water from the Hebbal-Nagawara Valley project, which aims to lift 210 MLD of secondary treated water from sewerage treatment plants to fill 65 tanks located in Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural and Chikkaballapur.

Bagaluru lake, located 12 km from the Kempegowda International Airport, will act as an impounded reservoir to supply water to 11 other lakes in the region.

Farmers in the area are happy, hoping that the project will push up the water table. Sanjaya, who grows mint in his agriculture land near the lake, said, “I have never seen the lake full like this. The land is fertile in this region, and people grow various types of vegetables and commercial crops that are supplied to Bengaluru markets. We are hoping that ground water will get recharged in the coming days and help farmers.”

Muniyappa, another farmer said, “Farmers heavily depend on borewell water to irrigate their farm lands. There are many instances of farmers not getting underground water even after reaching 1,300 feet depth. On the other hand, rain is unpredictable. We have absolutely no water source and we have to feel contended with what we are getting.”

Ramachandra, a farmer from Chikkajala, said, “I have come here to see the lake, as through the project, even Chikkajala lake will also get treated water. Over the years, due to increased urbanisation, people in the region are shifting to other professions. But a large number of people still rely on farming in the region and this will help them.”

The authorities have prohibited direct use of treated water for drinking and agricultural purposes.

Precautions taken

Byatarayanapura MLA and former minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the project is aimed at helping farmers in the regions hit by drought and depleting groundwater. The MLA said, “As per set standards of of the Central Government and norms backed by the WHO, water is being treated at STPs and released into lakes. The process is environmental compliant. Sampling tests and monitoring are done regularly. If there are discrepancies, supply would be stopped and resumed after taking the required measures.”

No other alternative

Referring to apprehensions raised over the K.C. Valley project that supplies treated water to Kolar district, he said, “People who are opposing the release of treated water should realise that drought-hit regions have no other alternative. By and large, all safety measures have been taken while implementing the project. Accidents may happen due to extraneous reasons. The project should be seen in a holistic sense, you should not single out a particular incident.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xhg7cr/article30786298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BG-LAKE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bagaluru-lake-springs-back-to-life-thanks-to-treated-water-from-city/article30786301.ece
388,2020/02/10,25 years and still spinning,"Charkha, the spinning wheel immortalised by Mahatma Gandhi, has also been the name of a quiet handloom revolution taking place in a village in Karnataka. That movement has now turned 25 years old.

The Charaka Women’s Multipurpose Industrial Co-operative Society, located in Bheemanakone, Shivamogga, was founded in 1994 with the dream of setting up an environmentally-friendly rural industry to generate local employment as an alternative to intensive agriculture and large industries. Started with two looms and two sewing machines in a small shelter on the Heggodu-Varadamoola road, it has since grown into a large production facility with multiple units employing over 700 villagers, most of whom are women.

In addition, it has the distinction of being one of the largest producers of naturally dyed handloom fabric in the country, currently producing over 30,000 metres of fabric per month.

Theatre personality Prasanna, the founder of Charaka, told The Hindu that it was an experiment which has taken 25 years to become a “substantial model.”

“It is not easy to make rural women free in their mind. When you show all systems needed to run a cooperative, they get frightened. They want somebody to run it for them. The exercise is to make the system adopt their needs. I didn’t really start it as a women’s movement; it became one,” he said.

Speaking about lessons from Charaka, he said, “Everybody is starting from the market end, but we started from the production end. Rural production has not collapsed because of lack of skill. They are hardworking and extraordinary skilled. The earlier system involving family and community work was inadequate. It could easily slip into caste system. If you want to take it from that abyss, you have to give them a new system. This was the biggest challenge. This is what Gandhiji tried.”

The great successes of the monster economy, he said, is the system of inventory, HR, quality control, book keeping and leadership. “When we were at the end of the 22nd year, crisis hit us in the form of demonetisation and GST. I sat on a hunger strike. It was hitting my organisation. Since then, we have taken a major decision to accept that this is going to stay. We should learn to deal with the crisis: cut wastage and costs, maintain quality. There are reforms going on in Charaka; we appointed a CEO, set up an R&D centre,” Mr. Prasanna explained.

The future

The cooperative, which focussed on garments the first 18 years, is now looking at fabric sales, which has a huge market. “The notion is that fine fabric is in demand in the handmade bracket. But thicker fabric is in huge demand for garments, towels, interiors. We have started systematically holding buyer seller meets between weavers and designers, corporate houses, etc,” Mr. Prasanna added.

The Charaka Utsava 2020 will be held from February 14 to 16 at Heggodu village.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hdepwf/article30786149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BG-CJARKHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/25-years-and-still-spinning/article30786151.ece

390,2020/02/10,Prepare comprehensive scheme in a month to rehabilitate those evicted in Bellandur: HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to come out with a comprehensive scheme, within a month, to rehabilitate several people, who were evicted from their shanties erected on a private property in Bellandur based on a notice issued by the Marathalli police to the land owner.

The court also directed the government to take steps to identify the evicted persons and make arrangements for providing immediate temporary monetary assistance or shelter to such persons within two weeks.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties - Karnataka, which contended that the eviction was illegal.

Meanwhile, the Bench said it is open for the petitioner to help the affected persons to make proper representation, seeking relief from the government, as the petitioner had submitted the names of around 130 persons evicted from the land, bearing survey number 35/2 of Kariyammana Agrahara, Bellandur, behind Mantri Espana apartments in Marathahalli police limits.

Though both the government and the BBMP denied having demolished shanties on the private land, the owners of the land claimed that the occupants left the shanties in response to polite requests made by them to vacate. However, the court declined to accept the land owners’ contention.

As many people lost shelter, based on the notice issued by the police without an authority in law, and the government had not placed any record to show that the police had visited the land or made any inquiry on allegation that illegal immigrants from Bangladesh were staying there, the Bench said it is the responsibility of the government to rehabilitate the affected persons as the eviction deprived them of a right to have a shelter.

The notice, issued by the police, had asked one of the land owners to remove the illegal structures and inform the police about any illegal immigrant from Bangladesh residing in the shanties.

Meanwhile, the government counsel told the court that the Marathahalli police inspector, who had issued the notice to one of the land owners, has been placed under suspension pending inquiry.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/6vilyz/article30785196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGBELANDUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/prepare-comprehensive-scheme-in-a-month-to-rehabilitate-those-evicted-in-bellandur-hc/article30785197.ece
391,2020/02/10,‘Over 1 lakh apartments vacant in city owing to water scarcity’,"Water scarcity is looming in Bengaluru, with nearly 35% of the population dependent on borewells. Over 1 lakh apartments are vacant in the city, as people are not moving in owing to the water scarcity, said Minister for Housing V. Somanna.

Speaking at the curtain-raiser of the Sustainable Water and Sanitation Summit here on Monday, Mr. Somanna, while pointing out to the over-exploitation of groundwater and mismanagement of water resources, said many schemes, envisaged to provide clean, drinking water, have remained on paper.

Pressing for a holistic approach to solving water issues, Anjum Parwez, Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department, said every drop of water can be used five times.

Sewage water was being treated and used to fill tanks and lakes in Kolar. Stating that providing underground drainage may not be possible in all villages and towns, he said the government had already implemented faecal sludge management projects in 52 towns in the State. By shifting from flood irrigation to micro-irrigation, and hydel projects to renewable energy projects, nearly 30% of water can be saved. This, he said, could be utilised for drinking.

Deputy Chief Minister Govind M. Karjol said Halagali, a village with a population of 6,000 in Mudhol constituency, now has only metered water connections, helping the gram panchayat earn ₹10 lakh in revenue, besides bringing down the water usage by one-third.

Mr. Karjol said the pilot project was now being extended to other surrounding villages that get water from the Krishna.

He called upon the organisers of the summit to identify one village in each district and make it a model in rainwater harvesting and open-defecation free, besides promising government assistance in achieving the same.

The theme of the fifth national summit is access to safe drinking water, ground water conservation and sanitation. The summit is scheduled on April 16 and 17, and will see participation from top non-government organisations from eight different countries, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said Aishvarya Nandyappa, founder and president of Confederation of Women’s Chambers of Commerce and Industry.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/water-scarcity-is-looming-in-bengaluru/article30785095.ece
392,2020/02/10,HC notice to govt. on plea questioning city’s taxi fares,"The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning the taxi fares fixed in 2018 by categorising the vehicles based on their cost in the Bengaluru city within the 25-km radius of the BBMP limits.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order on the petition filed by Mahammed Dastagir, a resident of Mysuru, and former law officer of the Transport Department.

The petitioner stated that a notification was issued on March 3, 2018, categorising as A, B, C and D the vehicles. The basis for this categorisation was the cost of the vehicles, with category A above ₹16 lakh and category D up to ₹5 lakh.

The petitioner contended that the State government has no power to issue a notification under Section 67(1)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and hence the March 3, 2018, notification was illegal as it interfered with the power vested with the Regional Transport Authority to fix fares under the MV Act.

Neither there was any basis for fixing fares based on the cost of the vehicles nor any public hearing held before bringing in a steep increase in the fares from the earlier fare of ₹14.50 per km. There was also no way a passenger could make out which category the vehicle belonged to, irrespective of whether the taxi was being operated on an aggregator’s platform or by any other operator.

The petitioner also complained that taxis plying in the city or any other part of the State were not fitted with the fare meter as mandated in Rule 129 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-notice-to-govt-on-plea-questioning-citys-taxi-fares/article30785008.ece

The police have issued notices to organisers of protests seeking bonds under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. This gives powers to magistrates to seek a bond from a person they have information that will likely commit a breach of peace.

Earlier, the police used to seek a bond of up to ₹10,000, and only in special cases. But four months ago, when a rally caused large-scale damage to public property, the order was amended to allow for a bond up to ₹10 lakh. “The practice instituted by the city police also violates the law,” claimed Maitreyi Krishnan, an advocate with Manthan Law and an activist taking part in several anti Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests adding that it violates Section 107 of CrPC.

“The law clearly states that the magistrate must have got information that the person will likely commit an offence, and the magistrate before asking for such a bond must have sufficient grounds to proceed. But the police have made signing these bonds a prerequisite for permission to protest in an arbitrary fashion.”

“The action by the police creates a dangerous false equivalence between holding a democratic protest to breach of peace and committing an offence,” said activist Vinay Sreenivasa, who recently signed two bonds of ₹10 lakh seeking permission for anti-CAA protests.

The city police, however, have defended their decision. Chetan Singh Rathore, DCP (Central) said the bond is only an undertaking and neither involves paying up any money nor giving any guarantee.

“It dissolves itself if there is no violence or damage to public property by the protesters. The bond will be executed if an inquiry proves that the protesters carried out violence and breached peace. It makes the organisers more responsible but in no way is a clampdown on protests,” said DCP Rathore.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tao89c/article30780278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGPROTESTBOND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10-lakh-bond-to-hold-protests-riles-activists/article30780279.ece
394,2020/02/10,BBMP wants to get more businesses under ambit of trade licence,"Among the few revenue sources for the BBMP is trade licences that are issued for over 70 different kinds of businesses in the city. However, the number of such licences has not crossed 55,000 in the recent past, which civic officials admitted, was a fraction of the number of commercial power connections in the city.

To increase revenue by plugging leakage, the BBMP wants to bring more trades under its ambit, and has sent a proposal to the government, which has sought a justification for this. The BBMP is preparing a report to be submitted to the government. “The report will have to be approved by the Standing Committee for Health. We stand a good chance of being allowed to cover more trades,” sources said.

The BBMP has collected data on commercial connections from Bescom, which has around 5.30 lakh such connections in BBMP area. “When we applied a filter – same name and address – and there were around 3.63 lakh connections left,” said a source in the BBMP. Commercial establishments in industrial areas, Special Economic Zones and tech parks, do not require BBMP’s trade licence, while small-scale industries under the Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association are exempt.

The BBMP is also trying to regulate trades in residential areas. Civic Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had said they had sought an amendment in zoning regulations to allow some essential trades in residential zones, such as neighbourhood provision stores, pharmacies, etc.

However, it will not issue trade licence for businesses and establishments on roads less than 40 ft wide that have been opened after 2015. Similarly, the licence will not be issued if the trade occupies more than 20% of the built-up area in a building on a road that is over 40-ft wide.

Getting a trade licence is now simple

The BBMP has simplified the process of getting new trade licence or applying for renewals. Under the new process, which came into effect on February 1, the application process, including payment of registration/ renewal fee is online. Traders need to submit two documents – rent/ lease agreement and electricity bill.

For new applications and renewals, the licence fee is to be paid without penalty till February 29; with a fine of 25% of the renewal fee from March 1 to 31. From April, the licence fee will have to be paid with a fine of 100%.

According to senior BBMP officials, traders can also choose the duration of validity of the licences from one to five years. “They can track the application, and it will get an intimation when it has been processed and the licence can be downloaded online. The entire process had been streamlined,” said a civic official.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/uc8lg6/article30780301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/B10BG-BBMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-wants-to-get-more-businesses-under-ambit-of-trade-licence/article30778316.ece
395,2020/02/10,"Lake revival: For CSR to work, public participation is equally vital","The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, which is now the custodian of 207 lakes, needs ₹1,253 crore for their maintenance and rejuvenation. To date, the civic body has developed around 75 lakes, and the rejuvenation of another 20 is currently in progress. Another 55 lakes are yet to be developed.

However, plagued by lack of funds and staff, the civic body is increasingly looking at corporate funding and CSR as an option. “A single body cannot revive all the lakes in the city, due to the financial and staff limitations,” said a senior civic official.

A majority of lake activists, officials and citizens believe the only way ahead for the rejuvenation of Bengaluru’s water bodies is through collaborative efforts between agencies, residents’ welfare associations and the public. However, many RWAs fear the process will not be transparent and they will be kept out of the process.

A Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) official said that since each lake in the city is different, they have unique advantages and problems. “Hence, rejuvenation projects should not be generalised. Also, many lakes are inter-connected and hence, rejuvenation should begin with upstream lakes.

Companies coming forward to fund rejuvenation should also look into such details,” said the KTCDA official. “If we can show a few success stories, more corporates will come up for funding or restoration of other lakes.”

V. Ramaprasad, co-founder and convenor of Friends of Lakes, said that the government and the BBMP with the KTCDA should prepare robust guidelines to ensure that they are the custodians of the lake. “Corporates coming up for restoration of lakes should not concentrate on beautification alone. A tripartite agreement between the civic body, locals and the private agency should be signed. It should not become a civil engineering project,” said V. Ramaprasad.

STP at Doddabommasandra lake

Barring a few, most of the lakes in the city do not have sewage treatment plants (STPs). To fill this gap, the Bharat Electronics Limited, a public sector undertaking, is setting up a 10 MLD STP at the 124-acre Doddabommasandra lake under its CSR programme.

As rainfall is the only source of water, BEL plans to restore the lake with treated water. Such a plant will ensure reduction of sewage into the lake, recharge groundwater in and around the lake, and provide a conducive atmosphere for the enrichment of flora and fauna, said officials.

According to Mr. Ramaprasad, the primary rule for resuscitating a lake is to ensure good quality water and a rich biodiversity. “Authorities are just involved in beautification of lakes as they see it as a civil engineering project. At such a juncture, setting up an STP in the lake is a game-changing move ,” he said.

A partnership at Jakkur lake

The story of the revival of 160-acre Jakkur lake has a happy ending. The citizen group Jal Poshan signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the BBMP for the maintenance of the lake. What initially began as a weekly clean-up drive took the shape of a crowd-funding and then a productive CSR initiative. For their collaborative approach, Jal Poshan, in 2019, won second prize for ‘promotion of citizen and State action for water conservation’ by National Water Mission for the revival of the lake.

Annapurna Kamat of Jal Poshan said collaboration was the key to success. “The core rejuvenation was done by the BBMP and BDA. There is an STP built by the BWSSB. We have crowd-funded a few projects and have got CSR funding for other eco-friendly activities in the lake area,” she said.

A second chance for Hebbagodi lake

In 2018, Biocon Foundation revived the 35-acre Hebbagodi lake near Electronics City, and also built a children’s park, walkways for recreational activities and a drinking facility with RO technology.

Nandeesh Reddy, an engineer in Biocon, who was involved in the rejuvenation project, said that a few miscreants have broken parts of the fence twice. “We repaired it twice and it is unfortunate. We are now planning to fix surveillance cameras. The lake is receiving more sewage than expected which is also worrying,” he said.

According to a senior KTCDA official, there is an inlet that is still letting sewage into it. “Locals and other government agencies should work with people who revive lakes. Otherwise, there is no point in such projects,” the official said and added

Ramani, who lives in the area, stressed on the need to maintain the lake. “I have lived here for 35 years and there was a time when we could even drink the lake water. Due to unplanned urbanization, the lake got contaminated. Now, with CSR funding, the lake has been revived. But it is not what it was three decades ago,” she said.

396,2020/02/10,Gang of six arrested in kidney scam,"The Banaswadi police have arrested six people, including three foreign nationals, who allegedly duped over 200 people in a kidney racket. They promised to buy and sell kidneys and would cut off communication after families paid them an initial token amount to the start the process.

The gang had a website which claimed that they had the authorisation of WHO and also misused the name of a super-speciality hospital as well as reputed doctors to lure people.

“They ran a cheating scam under the guise of offering kidneys to patients in need, and also offering to buy kidneys from donors. Our initial investigations revealed that they cheated as many as 200 people of anywhere between ₹50,000 and ₹60,000 each which they charged as insurance and registration fees,” said the police.

One of the victims of the scam said they offered to sell his kidney for ₹2.5 crore. However, they first asked him to pay ₹40,000 as registration fees. The scam came to light when the victim did not receive any communication from them, after which he approached the hospital listed on their website seeking a clarification. This prompted the hospital to make enquiries.

Based on a complaint filed by Dr. Shafiq M.M., director of the hospital, the Banaswadi police tracked down the gang through their website and mobile numbers that they had published. The accused have been identified as Esene Lovely, 29, from Nigeria; Mohamed Ahmed Ismail, 24, and Marwan Faisal, 27, both from Sudan; Herendra, 25, and Jatin Kumar, 25, from from Tripura; and Kami Ranjan, 21, from Bommanahalli in Bengaluru.

The police were able to track down one of the accused, Herendra, who had given his bank account details to the victim. “He worked in a garment factory and said the other gang members offered them ₹5,000 per month for sharing his bank account details to potential victims of the scam,” the police added.

The rest of the gang were apprehended at a coffee shop in HRBR Layout, which they frequently visited. Esene Lovely, Ismail and Marwan had come to Bengauru on a study visa, but overstayed. “Investigations are on to ascertain the total number of people they have cheated in this manner,” Sharanappa, SD, DCP (East Division) said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/gang-of-six-arrested-in-kidney-scam/article30778215.ece
397,2020/02/10,‘Promoting ideal cardiovascular health best way to prevent stroke’,"Promoting ideal cardiovascular health is the best way to prevent strokes, vascular dementia and consequently maintain brain health, said Ralph L. Sacco, Professor and Olemberg Family Chair in Neurological Disorders, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, here on Sunday.

Delivering the 40th T.S. Srinivasan Endowment Oration, he said that though other advancements in medicine, particularly in the fields of neuroscience, genetics, and regenerative medicine, can bring considerable change in preventing and treating stroke, promotion of cardiovascular health was the most efficient way that did not require much of an investment.

Highlighting the ‘Life Simple 7’ formulated by American Heart Association to improve cardiovascular health by focussing on things like eating better, engaging in physical activity, avoiding smoking and managing cholestrol, blood pressure and sugar, he said that following these can directly address the major risk factors that can lead to stroke.

He added that consuming two drinks of alcohol per day (for men), and one drink a day (for women), was found to have positive effect in preventing risk factors associated with stroke. However, he added that any amount of increased consumption has been found to sharply increase the risks.

Citing data from the Northern Manhattan Study, which involved studying stroke risk factors among the people in Northern Manhattan, Dr Sacco said that it had shown direct correlation between addressing of risk factors and improvement in brain health.

To a question on genetic predisposition being a cause of non-communicable diseases, including some types of stroke, he said that it was not the key factor in majority of the cases. “In the US, we are seeing an increase in stroke at young age. They are not related to genetics. Genetics does not explain the majority (of the cases), only the minority,” he said.

On discussions around the connection between gut flora and brain health, he said that it was a promising area of intervention in the future although strong evidence has not emerged yet.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7w4clo/article30781315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VENUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/promoting-ideal-cardiovascular-health-best-way-to-prevent-stroke/article30781316.ece

400,2020/02/10,New police recruits to be sensitised to hazards of pollution,"With the exposure to inclement weather conditions for long hours taking a toll on the health of police personnel, the Tamil Nadu police have included hazards of pollution in the training module for new recruits.

The Police Training College has included pollution as a subject in the training protocol to create awareness about the safety aspects.

Data generated by the annual health check-up done for the one lakh plus personnel over the years pointed to a sharp increase in ailments such as hypertension and diabetes, a senior police officer said on Sunday.

Training for about 8,773 Grade-II police constables, including 2,432 women and transgenders, who cleared the recruitment process conducted by the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, would commence soon at 32 centres across the State.

“The training module covers aspects such as balanced diet, stress management and healthy lifestyle. We want the force to be more health-conscious. It is just not protecting themselves from the air and noise, but also enforcing laws to protect the environment,” the officer said.

Considering the need to build a more healthy police-public relationship, psychologists, retired police officers and academicians would be roped in to sensitise the trainees on their behaviour towards the public, particularly senior citizens, women, children, media persons and petitioners.

Awareness about new welfare schemes of the government would be given, besides educating the police on their duties.

With more cybercrime cases emerging at different levels, educating new recruits about the challenges had become imperative. Investigating cyber offences would be part of the coaching on Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) and other digital platforms.

The focus would be on keeping the police abreast of the latest developments in investigation and technology, besides fine-tuning their attitude and approach towards the common man, the official said. After the one year training, the police personnel would be posted to the Armed Reserve strength and Tamil Nadu Special Police battalions.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gl64lc/article30778387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THPOLICEMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-police-recruits-to-be-sensitised-to-hazards-of-pollution/article30778388.ece
401,2020/02/10,"School dropouts complete tailoring, beautician courses","To prevent child marriages in Tiruvallur district, the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission, along with an NGO — Integrated Rural Community Development Society (IRCDS) — has provided tailoring and beautician training for girls who drop out of schools.

In 2018, a total of 47 cases of child marriage were stopped in Tiruvallur, and in 2019, 59 cases were stopped. “We get complaints mainly from Tiruttani, R.K. Pet and Pallipattu,” said B. Senthil, district child protection officer.

According to P. Stephen, programme manager, IRCDS, in January, they along with the district child protection unit, identified 100 school dropouts in seven villages in Poondi block. All girls were below the age of 18.

“This is the age when school dropouts are vulnerable to marriage. Along with the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission, we arranged an orientation programme for them, on how they can continue their education. Many took our guidance and started pursuing higher education in Chennai, but few could not travel that far,” said Mr. Stephen.

For 20 girls, they provided three-month training in beautician and tailoring courses. “The girls received certificates recently. We will be providing them free sewing machines and beautician kits. We will also provide them jobs,” he said.

The NGO has also been conducting awareness programmes on prevention of child marriage among community leaders, astrologers, priests, marriage hall owners and others. Y.

405,2020/02/10,Private security personnel posted at seven MRTS stations,"For the first time, Southern Railway has posted private security personnel on the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) to enhance security at the stations.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has deputed more than 15 ex-servicemen at the stations. The proposal was mooted a few years ago.

The need to have private security personnel in the MRTS section was felt after incidents of sexual harassment of women commuters and several thefts were registered at the Taramani, Indira Nagar, Velachery and Chindatripet stations.

A senior official of the RPF's Chennai division said a total of 16 private security persons have been posted a few days ago. Two persons each have been posted at the Perungudi, Taramani, Thiruvanmiyur, Indira Nagar, Greenways Road, Chepauk, and Chintadripet MRTS stations. In Thirumailai and Velachery, RPF stations headed by an Inspector and sub-inspector are functioning. The private securitymen would be working on two shifts — from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.

While commuters welcomed the move, they pointed out that more personnel were needed to improve security. Huge stations need a minimum of three to four security persons per shift to man the two entrances and the platform area, the commuters said. They also wanted the Southern Railway to install CCTV cameras in Perungudi, Taramani, Thiruvanmiyur, Indira Nagar and Kasturba Nagar stations.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kbqbes/article30778292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THPRIVATESECURITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/private-security-personnel-posted-at-seven-mrts-stations/article30778293.ece
406,2020/02/10,Hike in auto LPG prices worries drivers,"A hike in the price of auto liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by ₹7.37 a litre this month has worried autorickshaw drivers in the city. Though most three-wheelers have the capability to use petrol as fuel, drivers opt for LPG since the fuel is cheaper than petrol.

“A litre of petrol costs ₹76, whereas LPG costs ₹49.70. So we will naturally opt for LPG, the cheaper option. But when its price too goes up, we cannot afford to get paid the same for trips. Every week we also have to buy oil that costs ₹180 a litre,” said Yuvaraj, an autorickshaw driver.

In September 2019, a litre of auto LPG in the city cost ₹36.23; it went up marginally to ₹36.76 in October, climbed up to ₹40.43 a litre in November and in December it was at ₹41.34. This year, last month, it increased to ₹42.33 a litre. Last February, a litre of auto LPG was priced at ₹39.95. Last year’s maximum was in June, when a litre cost ₹45.43. But this year, the price of auto LPG has climbed way beyond that, and this is happening at a time when petrol and diesel rates are coming down every day.

Many autorickshaw drivers have opted to drive for private companies such as Ola and Uber, hoping that they will get at least a few trips every day.

“I drive for both companies and sometimes take regular trips as well. With the companies, the rate is low, since the rate they pay us is based on the last meter rate fixed by the State government, which was in 2013. Petrol and diesel prices get revised every day, and auto LPG, every month. We need a rethinking of meter rates,” said Karunakaran, a driver.

With competition from two-wheeler services, regular autorickshaws, cars and feeder services from Metro, these autorickshaw drivers said that their only hope was the State government.

“We cannot ask Uber or Ola for a hike. If the government had started similar apps, it would have helped us. It would also have earned a revenue like the apps do now. Our unions don’t do a good job of raising issues on our behalf,” said Chandrasekar, an autorickshaw driver, who was driving cars till about six months ago.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7873n0/article30778284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hike-in-auto-lpg-prices-worries-drivers/article30778285.ece
407,2020/02/10,Amendments to building rules to boost affordable housing in city,"Amendments made to the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules last week are expected to boost affordable housing in the city.

P.S.J. Palanirajan, president, Greater Chennai Corporation Licensed Surveyors’ Association (GCCLSA), said the area for affordable housing units had been increased from 40 sq m to 60 sq m of carpet area in the Chennai city limits, and to 90 sq m in the rest of the State.

Creating awareness

“The number of files processed by the Chennai Corporation is expected to increase. More residents in the affordable housing segment are expected to benefit,” he said.

“Registered engineers have started creating awareness among residents to make use of the amendments to TNCBDR with 2 FSI (Floor Space Index). They should not deviate from the approved plan. They can get stilt plus three floors instead of stilt plus two floors. Residents should be careful, as completion certificate is mandatory,” said Mr. Palanirajan.

Urban planner and disaster management expert N. Mathavan said that the number of building violations had already reduced in the past one year because of the new rules.

“The new amendments have provided a boost to affordable housing in Chennai. Now, a reasonably-sized double-bedroom house can be categorised as affordable, with GST benefits for the buyers. GST is not 5%, but 1% for houses less than 60 sq m of carpet area in Chennai,” he said.

CREDAI Tamil Nadu chairman S. Sridharan said city residents buying affordable housing units of less than 60 sq m would also be able to reap the benefits of premium FSI for the structures.

“More builders will start opting for the affordable housing segment. It will create demand for affordable housing in the industry,” he said.

Increase in projects

“People are price conscious now. We expect a drastic increase in the launch of affordable housing projects in the coming months, which is a positive factor for the housing industry. The amendment has also clarified on the definition of built-up area by clearly stating it as ‘carpet area’, avoiding any confusion. The number of affordable housing units is over 30% of the total supply in Chennai. We expect almost a 100% increase in affordable housing units because of the amendment,” he said.

“The developer also gets an advantage as premium FSI availed is free for affordable housing. The main advantage is the subsidy under the PMAY scheme and the 1% GST. Increase in the number of launches will give a better choice for residents who do not own a house in the city,” said Mr. Sridharan.

According to data compiled by the Housing and Urban Development Department, over 49% Chennai residents do not own a house and live in rental accommodation. The new rules will benefit such residents.

Currently, the registered value of an affordable house has an upper limit of ₹45 lakh.

408,2020/02/10,Metro’s 31-storey edifice to house hotels on top floors,"Sitting in a restaurant on the 31st floor, residents and visitors can take in a panoramic view of the city. They also can have a bird’s eye view of the iconic heritage buildings below, such as the Central Railway Station, Victoria Public Hall and Ripon Buildings lined up on one side and the bustling streets on the other side.

Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is building a massive Central Square near the Central station with a 31- storey building.

Now, the CMRL has decided that top few floors of the building will house hotels. There will also be a host of options for people to dine in one of the top floors, sources said.

Central Square has been planned in such a way that commuters can seamlessly switch from one mode of transport to another. They will have several choices to travel.

There will be exclusive bus bays, underground parking lots, option to travel from MRTS or suburban or Metro or outstation bound trains.

“We thought there should also a nice option for people visiting the city to stay and dine in this heritage area. We want to make it a transport and commercial hub that offers commuters everything. Apart from a hotel and restaurant, we may have most of the floors for office space,” an official said.

The CMRL has got no-objection certificate from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) already and is awaiting two more mandatory clearances.

“First, we got the nod from AAI for the 31-storey building as there are obstructions and safety issues in the flight path. Now, we are working to get approvals from CMDA and Fire and Rescue Services Department. As soon as the approvals come, we should be able to call for tenders to begin the construction,” the official said.

The CMRL is also in the process of having a museum at Central Square that will exhibit how Chennai Metro was built in the city.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/29galv/article30778246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Travelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metros-31-storey-edifice-to-house-hotels-on-top-floors/article30778247.ece
409,2020/02/10,‘A few municipalities continue to violate norms’,"Registered engineers allege that a few municipalities in the Chennai Metropolitan Area continue to charge higher for registration, violating the existing rules.

For instance, municipalities of Pallavaram and Tambaram continue to charge higher than the stipulated amount of ₹5,000 from registered engineers, in violation of the existing rules, they charge.

Registered engineers said the violations at the registration level was leading to widespread discontent, as a number of new changes had been made relating to registered engineers, who were earlier called licensed surveyors, for getting their support in reducing building plan violations. The registered engineers have demanded a single registration for them across the State, for uniformity and better urban planning.

Previously, ITI holders were eligible to prepare plans for buildings up to 9 m (Stilt+2). The new government order has made changes for ITI holders too.

‘More responsibilities’

“ITI holders who have already been practising in local bodies of the State are placed as Registered Engineer Grade-III and have been permitted to prepare plans up to 12 m (Stilt +3). This will give us more responsibilities. We will play a better role in improving and promoting urban planning,” said S. Rajasekaran, licensed surveyor, Greater Chennai Corporation.

The new amendments have also provided benefits to corner plots, as a splay up to 12 m in the dimension of 1.5 mx1.5 m is enough. Previously, it was up to 7.2 m. For a requirement of 20 car parking spaces, a single driveway is enough.

410,2020/02/10,MoUs signed at GIM begin to bear fruit,"Within a period of one year, around 59 memorandums of understanding (MoUs), signed during the second edition of Global Investor’s Meet (GIM) 2019, have started bearing fruit and 209 deals are under various stages of implementation.

Of the 59 projects that have fructified, 18 are in the Industries Department, 36 in higher education, 4 in the energy sector and 1 project in information and technology sector.

The Tamil Nadu government organised the second edition of GIM in January 2019. Around 304 MoUs across various sectors were signed, entailing investments to the tune of ₹ 3,00,501 crore in sectors including manufacturing, IT, energy, tourism, agriculture and education.

According to data from the Guidance Bureau Tamil Nadu, the nodal agency for bringing in investments into the State, only 36 projects out of the 304 MoUs are yet to commence activity or in the process.

Of the 36 projects, 14 are in the industries segment and 16 are housing projects, while the remaining 6 are in the tourism, IT and energy sectors. Due to the gestation period, some projects are still in pipeline, officials also said.

Industrialists across the State said that the government is actively following up on the MoUs signed during the second as well as the first investors’ meet.

“There are more talks happening between the industry and the government. They are even open to ideas and suggestions that we are giving,” said an industrialist, who wished to remain anonymous.

“The State needs to promote itself more in international markets. Politicians and officials in Telangana market their State so well and attract investments. Even now, when I visit clients abroad they have this wrong perception that Tamil Nadu is a State which has frequent protests and labour unrest. This mindset should change and the State government should take it up as a top priority,” the official added. It is learnt from four different industrialists, who are part of chambers of commerce, that the Palanisamy government is aggressively pushing for projects and are giving quick clearances through the single-window portal. Apart from the 304 MoUs, the State government inked deals for 12,360 projects in the MSME space. These projects involve investments of ₹32,205 crore with 4,739 firms having started commercial production and the remaining 7,621 projects being in progress.

A source from the MSME Department said that work is on to speed up clearances and other approvals for the remaining projects.

Details by the end of FY

About employment provided and details on investment made by the firms that have started operations, the department, to an RTI reply, said the exact investment made and employment provided will be furnished by the companies only at the end of the financial year.

411,2020/02/10,A nation for the persecuted,"In his historic address to the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago in 1893, Swami Vivekananda declared, “I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.” It is ironical that a political party which conspicuously proclaims its allegiance to Swami Vivekananda has restricted by law, about 127 years later, citizenship to people on the grounds of both religion and nation.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, or CAA, 2019, passionately contested by people across the country, by placing these filters of religion and nation, reminds us urgently of the moral imperative of an expansive and humane refugee law. This must conform to what is finest in India’s civilisational ethos, and to the morality of India’s Constitution. This urgency is underlined further by the decision, in October 2018, of the Indian executive to send back seven Rohingya men — the Supreme Court of India refused to stop their deportation — who had been detained in Assam since 2012, to Myanmar.

Looking back, it is pertinent to ask why Jawaharlal Nehru, an international statesperson and a leading moral voice in the community of nations, refused to sign the 1951 Refugee Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Scholars suggest that whereas he was committed to the principles enshrined in the Convention, he was unwilling to legally bind the country to its obligations.

The Convention first defines refugees as persons fleeing persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion. Refugees get legal rights, most important of which are “non-refoulement”, which prevents states from sending back refugees to persecution in their home countries. They also get secondary rights, such as to education, work and property.

Policy and discrimination

India has long argued that even without signing the Convention, in practice it is one of the leading refugee-receiving countries. Refugees include Sri Lankan Tamils, Tibetans from China, Chin minorities from Burma/Myanmar, and Hindus from Bangladesh and Pakistan. It may be legitimately asked that if in practice India has been hospitable to refugees, why does it need a refugee law which conforms to the Refugee Convention?

The answer lies in discrimination in the recognition of refugees and the award of citizenship, embedded sometimes in laws and rules, and at other times in official practice. These include the morally indefensible, indeed shameful decision of the Indian government to send back Rohingyas to conditions which the International Court of Justice has recently deemed to be genocidal, and changes in passport rules even prior to the passage of the CAA which in effect discriminated between people on the basis of their religion.

There are many problems with Indian law relating to refugees. The first of these is that our law does not distinguish between “foreigners” and “refugees”. This means that refugees depend on state discretion, indeed “benevolence” rather than inherent rights. The second is that these assume that the executive will act on principles of humanism and non-discrimination. This may have been true of an India led by Nehru. Governments which followed his have had mixed records. It is certainly not true of a government as we have today which is driven by right-wing ideology, which is hostile to Muslims, and which believes that India should be the natural home of persecuted Hindus, but not Muslims.

The Rohingya case

In the absence of explicit recognition in Indian law of the category of refugees, or of their legally binding rights, even the guarantees of fundamental rights to equality and non-discrimination and humanitarian obligations did not prevent India from violating the core principle of non-refoulement, of not sending back a person to situations of persecution, such as those faced by Rohingyas. Let us rewind to the litigation in India’s Supreme Court, challenging the government’s proposed deportation of seven Rohingya in 2018. When seven repatriated Rohingya men were only hours away from the border with Myanmar, rights activists who has just come to know of this, made a dramatic urgent intervention in the Court, pleading that their being thrown mercilessly into a genocidal situation be stopped immediately.

The Supreme Court bench, which included the then Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, refused to stay their deportation, basing its ruling primarily on a brief Union government affidavit which claimed that Myanmar had accepted the refugees as “citizens” and the men had orally agreed to be repatriated. The Court unconscionably refused to stop the deportation despite the transparent unreliability of these claims, since the men did not have access to legal counsel nor to the UNHCR to determine whether their consent was freely expressed. Also, that they may have chosen the risks only because the only option they were given to deportation was to indefinitely remain in detention. The media later reported that these men had been detained in Myanmar for “illegal entry” and had been given the controversial National Verification Cards (that does not recognise their religion or ethnicity), not citizenship. We do not know what happened to them since.

Message from the ICJ verdict

The moral culpability of these decisions, both of the Union government and the top court, are further illuminated by the recent unanimous judgment of the International Court of Justice on January 23 that concludes that the Rohingya face genocidal intent. The case against Myanmar was brought to the international court by a small west African Muslim nation, The Gambia. It rejected Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s testimony on behalf of her government, where she described the allegations brought by The Gambia as “an incomplete and misleading factual picture” of the prevailing conditions in Rakhine State.

The world court warned the Myanmar military against any conspiracy to commit genocide, and directed Myanmar authorities to take steps to protect its minority Rohingya population from genocide.

For the Indian government and the Supreme Court, this judgment should be a moment for both introspection and atonement. But this it will not be. The government has never referred to the Rohingya as refugees but as illegal immigrants, security threats and potential terror threats. They have not been included as eligible for citizenship under the 2019 amendment, because of their religion and country of origin. Instead, they are often the subject of communally charged political stigmatisation by the ruling party, amid calls for the expulsion from India of the desperately impoverished tiny population of around 40,000 Rohingyas; they are subsisting by picking rags and lowest-end labour in dismal shanties unsupported by the Indian state.

For a framework

India’s treatment of the Rohingya, and the discriminatory CAA must compel Indians committed to India as a humane inclusive country to fight not just for the abrogation of the CAA-NRIC-NPR trinity — CAA-National Register of Indian Citizens-National Population Register — but also for India to bring in a refugee law which conforms to international conventions. This would, first, recognise eligible undocumented immigrants as refugees, based on evidence determined by due process of their persecution in their home countries. This would also assure them a set of binding rights. The most important of these is the guarantee that they would not be forced to return to the conditions of persecution, threatening their lives and liberty, which they escaped. The second is that they would be assured lives of dignity within India, with education, health care and livelihoods. Only then would India become the country which Swami Vivekananda was so proud of: a haven to the persecuted of the world, untainted by discrimination based on religion or nation.

412,2020/02/10,Oxford honours Constitution,"It is an uplifting feeling that the Oxford University Press has chosen ’Samvidhan’ (Constitution) as the Hindi word of 2019. Azadi or freedom may well have ended up as the runner-up. The Indian Constitution is among the world’s best Constitutions. It is not just a written text; it is an imagination and a dream. The notions of justice and freedom form the cornerstones of the Constitution and give it is majesty.

It embodies India’s collective genius and manifests it and bears witness to it. It not only puts humanity above everything else but also breaks the ‘narrow domestic walls’, to borrow a phrase from Rabindranath Tagore’s Gitanjali. It is a tribute to B.R.Ambedkar and other founding fathers of the Republic. In linguistic grandeur it reads like the Authorised Version of the Bible.

Nowadays the Preamble to the Constitution is recited at the Anti-CAA sits-ins and rallies. It has become an inseparable part of the ongoing people’s movement to regain ‘space’ for all. ‘All’ means ‘all’ not just privileged and elite classes. The Constitution makes it unambiguously and abundantly clear that the ‘human flotsam and jetsam’ are not expendable. It is inspiring to listen to the Preamble being recited soulfully at the protests.

It is the best possible document for a country disparate in races and religions. Predicated on human equality, the Constitution has the needed strength to guarantee and ensure human dignity to all in our caste-ridden society. The spirit of the Constitution imbibed by the people is the inoculation against the misuse of powers by the government of the day whatever its political or ideological hue.

“We, the People” — two key words written in the Preamble — clearly establish and express the sovereignty of the people. People are no ‘subjects’ for political parties or governments to treat them as they wish. They cannot be dominated or dictated to on how they should live. They cannot be deprived of their constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and rights.

The Parliament, simply because the party in power has majority, cannot enact laws which are antithetical to the tenets of the Constitution. The CAA, the NRC and the NPR are inconsistent with the Constitution. The Hindutva ideology does not sit comfortably with the Constitution. It is not enough to say that the Constitution is the ‘holy Book’. The Modi government should rescind the discriminatory and unconstitutional CAA if it has a semblance of respect for the Constitution.

413,2020/02/10,Negating Nehru’s legacy,"It has been more than five-and-half years since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in power at the Centre and we have been witnessing the complete vilification, demonisation and obfuscation of many of the party’s adversaries, all great leaders of the anti-colonial struggle. Last week in Parliament, after predictably digging up the past of Jawaharlal Nehru and berating Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi replayed the old RSS trope and trotted out the catchphrases that have become synonymous with the BJP-led NDA government. Giving away his complete ignorance of history, Mr. Modi also blamed Nehru and the Congress for Partition, evoking jeering from his MPs. This needless desk-thumping by the BJP MPs only strengthens the perception that the BJP always lives in the past and uses and misuses it to cover their own follies and disastrous decisions like demonetisation and the badly implemented GST. It also shows the complete disregard that the BJP has for the progress India has made in the past seven decades.

After all, we live in times when Nehru’s contribution to modern Indian society is often questioned and derided outright. The scrubbing of Nehru’s name from state-sponsored history textbooks in schools is the culmination of a motivated smear campaign. In November 2018, during rallies being held for State Assembly elections, Mr. Modi derisively referred to Nehru as a “leader who wore a rose” but was ignorant of the plight of farmers. Let’s ignore the fact that with his bespoke, monogrammed suits, the current Prime Minister is just as much a fashion victim as Nehru was. Let’s also conveniently forget how he tried to co-opt the ‘Nehru vest’ by renaming it the ‘Modi vest’ while gifting it to foreign heads of state. But we can’t ignore how the Green Revolution began in India under Nehru, and how he fought for farmers’ issues during the Independence struggle. It’s this denial of historical facts that characterises contemporary criticism of Nehru, more than half a century after his death.

It’s not just the Prime Minister who feels the need to attack a long-dead leader, his party buddies also succumb to the same temptation from time to time. Attacking Nehru’s legacy is yet another area where the Prime Minister has collaborated with his bestie, Amit Shah, proving that they truly are the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp combo of Indian politics. Shah has been a long-time critic of Nehru, but in 2018 he added the accusation that Nehru and Gandhi routinely humiliated B.R. Ambedkar during their lifetimes. Together, the Modi-Shah twosome have composed the tune, and their tens of thousands of followers have merrily sung along. On social media, particularly the Holy Grail of WhatsApp, along with legitimate historical debates, right-wing influencers and trolls alike present alt-facts and accusations that present Nehru as a Westernised degenerate, who embodied the opposite of what an ideal Indian should be. The claims found online are baffling in their outlandishness. But this sort of vilification is to be expected from those with majoritarian tendencies.

Leaders of other nations loved and respected Nehru, who was the quintessential democrat and welcomed criticism as bonafide, responding to it thoughtfully. Unlike the Prime Ministers of our time, Nehru engaged in meaningful discourse, not vindictive revenge. He debated in Parliament with full accountability with a detail that is now surrendered to brute majorities and chaos. Nehru, ideally viewed religion rationally so that people do not fall prey to its ills. It is impossible to imagine anyone accusing him of a communal conflagration. Nehru was wary of judicial power, but he nurtured an independent judiciary and the rule of law. To make him the target of electoral jibes is churlish.

Nehru played a crucial role in achieving India’s Independence, and then went on to help a newly divided country find its feet on the world stage; the victories that Nehru has won will dwarf anything that any government is able to achieve. Perhaps Vajpayee better understood Nehru’s legacy than any of his successors. Even as they actively try to tear down the legacy of one of India’s greatest sons, Congress’s rivals will be well-served to remember Vajpayee’s thoughts on Nehru. “In spite of a difference of opinion we have nothing but respect for his great ideals, his integrity, his love for the country and his indomitable courage. With these words, I pay my humble homage to that great soul.” That said, it is clear that trying to erase Nehru’s imprint on the country is a tall order because he is part of modern India’s DNA. Throw Nehru out of the equation and you end up undermining India.

But, it seems they have failed in their endeavour, as evidenced by the findings of the pollsters that Mr. Trump’s approval rating has actually gone up by a few points. This only shows that the American society is deeply divided along the party lines and is willing to ignore even grave indiscretions by its leaders. Any Democratic candidate will now face an uphill task in the upcoming presidential election in November. They need to reinvent themselves and mount a campaign, including on social media, that captures the imagination of the voters on important issues such as Medicare, social security, climate change, immigration, etc. to have a fighting chance against Mr. Trump.

415,2020/02/10,NPR and NRC,"The BJP has been telling people that the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are two different things. However, the term ‘population’ has not been used anywhere in the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, even in its present form after the preparation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. The expression NPR was introduced in the statute for the first time only in the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The NPR was prescribed in the said Rules as a step in the preparation of NRC. It has been categorically stated that an NRC will be prepared only by verifying and scrutinising the particulars in the NPR. Rule 4 (4) makes it more obvious by saying: “During the verification process, particulars of such individuals, whose Citizenship is doubtful, shall be entered by the Local Registrar with the appropriate remark in the Population Register for further inquiry.” These facts make it clear that Modi government has started up-gradation of the NPR only as of the first step in the preparation of NRC and hence there is every justification for examining the NPR process to anticipate its possible effects on the NRC.

Whether the company would be allowed to rescue companies like ONGC in the future after its stakes go into private hands is anybody’s guess. Hitherto, LIC invested hugely on welfare projects linked to the fields of electricity, water, roads and housing. Post IPO, the company may not follow its motto of ‘people’s money for people’s welfare’. The proposal to sell the family silver is bound to do more harm than good.

Punditry does not confer authority on legal experts to pontificate to judges about due sentencing processes and sneer at the public for lacking the patience to appreciate the nuances of the law (Editorial page, “Upholding the fairness of the sentencing process,” Feb. 9). The authors seem to show a shocking insensitivity to the victim in the Nirbhaya case and an extraordinary solicitude to the rights of the convicts. According to the layperson’s basic understanding of the law, based on common sense, unpunished crime plants the seeds for creating a dystopian society. A perpetrator-centric criminal justice system exposes society to the depredations of sociopaths and psychopaths.

Different courts and judges examined the facts and circumstances of the Nirbhaya case and imposed the death sentence on the convicts because it passed the ‘rarest of the rare’ test. Judicial sagacity found no extenuating circumstance to mitigate the brutality of the crime and consider awarding the alternative of the life sentence. It is dangerous to propose the socioeconomic background of criminals as a mitigating factor. It demeans the dignity of millions of law-abiding poor people because.

417,2020/02/10,J&K leaders’ detention,"The decision of the Central government to detain two former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah under the draconian Public Safety Act (PSA) is clearly a retrograde step that will only aggravate the already volatile situation in the Valley that is already reeling under a clampdown imposed in the wake of the dilution of Article 370 (Editorial, “Extended folly,” Feb. 8). The move clearly signals that the government has no intention of bringing even a shred of normalcy to the Valley. The detention of popular leaders, which is now into its seventh month, and the uncertainty about their future does not augur well for the erstwhile State’s future.

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

The detention of former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Chief Ministers and other leaders under Public Safety Act is against all tenets of democratic principles. Though the changes made by the government to Article 370 are under the Supreme Court’s consideration, the slow speed and the scarce interest shown by the court towards the issue is discouraging. It has also not commented on the prolonged detention of the leaders indefinitely without framing any charges. In the meantime, the government is organising a second visit by foreign diplomats to Jammu and Kashmir (“Govt. set to host another visit by foreign diplomats to J&K,” Feb. 8). One is at a loss to understand what purpose will be be served by such visits with regard to real situation in the Valley, when the visitors are to meet only the designated officers and politicians in J&K chosen by the government. It is amusing that the visitors would be denied visits to the detained politicians on the ground that they have been charged under the PSA.

418,2020/02/10,AAP again?,"This refers to the report, “Exit polls predict AAP’s return in Delhi” (Feb. 9). If this turns out to be true, it will be a massive blow to the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo’s arrogance and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Delhi campaign. After realising that the Modi wave didn’t work in the earlier Assembly polls, the BJP went back to its tried and trusted formula of aggressive polarisation, in a bid to win the Delhi election. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on the other hand, kept the focus of his campaign on his incumbent government’s welfare model. The Delhi voters seem to have preferred water, power and jobs to citizenship based on religion. The BJP’s carpet-bombing efforts may have proved unsuccessful.

Apart from a win for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the projections also forecast a rout for the Congress and an improvement in the BJP’s tally. If the exit polls prove correct, that would suggest that the BJP’s high-voltage polarising campaign had limited success, while the AAP’s strategy of focussing on its good governance record in the last five years has paid off.

419,2020/02/10,Journalism in the time of an epidemic,"The web edition of this newspaper had an erroneous headline linking the novel coronavirus to a study on bats and bat-hunters in Nagaland. The headline of the story in the print edition was: “Study on bats and bat-hunters of Nagaland comes under scanner” (February 3). Before the correction was made, the headline in the online version read, “Coronavirus: Wuhan institute’s study on bats and bat hunters in Nagaland to be probed”. The report had nothing to do either with the novel coronavirus or with the research collaboration between India and China. Further, the headline was in antithesis to all the rules of reporting an epidemic. During an epidemic journalists should inform readers, not create unnecessary panic. Their work should not be the basis for wild conspiracy theories.

Problem with headline, infographic

Unfortunately the wrong headline in the web edition, along with an unrelated reference to coronavirus in the story, deflected attention from the epidemic. It also shifted focus from the issues that led to the probe on the team that studied the bats and bat-hunters in Nagaland. To make matters worse, the infographic alluded to secrecy, while the study itself is available as an open access article. The web edition was corrected with a disclaimer: “An earlier version of the headline of this article had mentioned coronavirus which is not directly linked to the story and also focused on Wuhan Institute, which is only one of the participants in the story. The headline has been suitably revised.”

While readers can criticise the report for its shortcomings in the headline and the infographic, it is important to point out that The Hindu did try to contact the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS). As the report mentions, NCBS authorities were not available for an immediate response. On February 5, the newspaper carried a follow-up report that clarified the NCBS’s position. It explained the relationship between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the study: “They were listed co-authors only because they supplied reagents. This is a standard practice for scientific authorship.”

When the report on the study by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the NCBS and a few other foreign universities on the filovirus appeared, many readers raised pertinent questions. The guiding principle for a news ombudsman is to start from a position that all complaints are made in good faith and, equally, that no journalist comes to work to mislead readers. It means that journalists can err due to many reasons and it is the duty of the news organisations to effect visible mending when an error happens.

In the last four decades, journalists learned to distinguish between science communication and science journalism. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dan Fagin has spoken about this crucial difference. “It’s really any kind of communicating of science, and that can have all sorts of agendas. It can encourage people to become scientists, or encourage scientists to talk about science, or encourage a particular policy, or advance the interests of whichever group is paying for the communication,” he observed. Brooke Borel, an Adjunct Faculty of The Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University, spelled out the difference clearly. She wrote: “Science journalists may write about science, but it’s also our job to look beyond wonders, hypotheses and data. It is to look at the people doing the science and whether they have conflicts of interest, or trace where their money is coming from.”

Role of the science editor

Reporters and sub-editors sometimes invoke these issues to justify references to unrelated subjects, which are topical at a given moment, in the name of providing context. The role of the science editor does not end with assigning stories to reporters. Some stories may lie in the intersection of science, technology and policy. Apart from checking the story for its facts and authenticity, the science editor must clear the headline, the second deck that summarises the story, and the accompanying infographic. The task cannot be left to the desk, which may not have the necessary domain expertise. This requirement is non-negotiable, irrespective of the platform in which the story appears.

On February 9, The Hindu carried a detailed explainer, “A window into novel coronavirus transmission”, and an in-depth look at “How bats harbour several harmful viruses without falling sick”. These reports worked because there were no unrelated references. Journalism at the time of an epidemic needs additional caution.

420,2020/02/10,Visually-challenged filmmaker Benoy K Behl on how yoga helped him cope,"Five years ago, filmmaker Benoy K Behl almost went blind. “It happened quite suddenly in the winter of 2015 when I was at home (in Delhi). By the time the swelling in my eyes had subsided, the damage to my optic nerve was already done,” says Behl.

At All India Institute of Medical Sciences, doctors found that the internal eye pressure was extremely high, and the optic nerve was badly damaged. It led to 90% blindness. As he underwent treatment, doctors suggested he see a yoga instructor, who could help him cope with his new reality.

“I was completely shattered,” says Benoy, who travels around the globe to give lectures on Indian mythology and Buddhism. To help him cope, Dr Tanuj Dada, professor of ophthalmology and senior doctor at RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences at AIIMS, sent him to the yoga department. “Yoga gave me inner strength and the ability to fight negativity,” says the filmmaker, who wasn’t unfamiliar with the practice, having already made two documentaries on it, Yoga: An Ancient Vision of Life and Sivananda Yoga: Health Educator Training.

Taking a cue from his personal experience, the 63-year-old, now a regular yoga practitioner, travelled to 10 countries spanning four continents to make Yoga for Health & Global Harmony. It was first shown at the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico last December.

The film shows people from around the globe performing various asanas, talking about how it has benefited them, interspersed with the expert view. For instance, Anu Ramaswamy at Sivananda Yoga Farm, in the US, talks about the neuromuscular restless leg syndrome, and how meditation and pranayama helps her. Maria Adelaida Lopez, working with an NGO in Bagota, reveals that Colombia has about seven million victims of armed conflict. She feels yoga is a useful tool to help those affected by it.

Ananda Balayogi, a medical doctor and yoga teacher from Puducherry, Dr Sat Bir Khalsa who is a yoga researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Dr BN Gangadhar, Director at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, are some of the experts quoted. Edited excerpts from a conversation.

What propelled you to direct another film on yoga?

Yoga is India’s greatest gift to the world. It cuts across all political boundaries and is enormously beneficial to human beings everywhere. As stress-related health problems have been growing around the globe, people are turning more and more to yoga. I wanted to make a film which showed the universal acceptance of yoga.

Was there a period when you just couldn’t work?

Not really. However, the winter of 2015 was extremely challenging, and sometimes I felt quite lost. When I first sat down to write a script in early 2016, I was dismayed, as I could not even see two words on the page in front of me. However, I took a second breath and concentrated, while I constantly kept moving my eyes left and right, to be able to see more words. The first time I had to go out to give an illustrated talk, in the winter of 2016, I was disheartened, because I could not see most of what was on the screen. However, I have slowly got used to managing the eyesight which I have. When I look at your left eye, I cannot see your forehead, your right eye or your lips. It is through concentration and through the grace of nature, that all is well and I am continuing my humble service to propagate the fine values of Indian philosophy and culture.

How do you manage your eyesight?

The treatment is still going on in three departments: under the departments of Glaucoma, Neurology, and Yoga Therapy. The attempt is to preserve the remaining 10%. They say that no restoration is possible. I am taking Omega 3 in natural state, like walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, fish like salmon and tuna. Eye drops are administered thrice a day. The doctor changes my eye drops every month. There are two types of eye drops: the first drains out excess fluid in the eye, the second retards development of excess fluid.

What sort of asanas has the yoga therapist prescribed?

Our focus is on meditation. Asanas are a step to meditation. But in my case, doctors asked me to go straight to meditation. My pranayama and meditation are now for longer periods and are deeper, for 45 minutes each, which I do at home. I have been practising Karma yoga, selfless action, where you lose your ego, for a number of years. It helps to give peace and depth to my existence.

What does yoga give the world?

Yoga reduces the confusion and false perceptions of practitioners. It helps them to have a clearer understanding of themselves, their own emotions and thoughts. Therefore, a better perspective and understanding of the world around them. The film highlights how yoga practitioners have become kinder, generous and compassionate. This transformation means better behaviour, a better mental attitude and a better perspective on life. It means less violence, less crime, less war. So as a consequence, when you change the individual, you change society.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/aigu6i/article30781332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Benoy-K-Behl-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/visually-challenged-filmmaker-benoy-k-behl-on-how-yoga-helped-him-cope/article30781334.ece
421,2020/02/10,The effectiveness of dry salt therapy,"Is salt therapy truly next-level steam inhalation? The claim is that dry salt therapy, or halotherapy, a drug-free, natural therapy that uses micro-particles of salt, promotes better breathing, healthier skin, improved sleep, physical fitness, endurance, and overall wellness. There are also claims that it helps in respiratory illnesses (asthma, bronchitis) and in skin infections (psoriasis, eczema).

Mitali Sanghi, at Hyderabad’s recently-opened Salt World, explains that salt therapy uses “pharmaceutical-grade dry salt in a comfortable, controlled environment.” Within the ‘cave’, a device called a halogenerator disperses microscopic salt particles into the room. During the process, tiny particles go deep into the airways and lungs and will also land on the skin.

“Natural salt dispersed through micronised inhalers makes the sputum thin and less viscid (sticky),” says Dr Mallikarjun Rao S, Hyderabad-based senior consultant pulmonologist. However, he adds that it should be limited to once a week for six-eight weeks, alongside regular medication. “I would suggest caution in high blood pressure patients, and for people to consult their pulmonologist/physician before going for a session.”

“Halotherapy is a blend of western medicine with naturopathy practices used as a cosmetic treatment for the skin. It nourishes the skin and has an effect in treating the symptoms of eczema and rosacea, besides ageing changes. It has a natural anti-inflammatory property, which can help control psoriasis and other skin conditions, plus it can make skin texture younger-looking and brighter,” says Dr G Manmohan, Hyderabad-based consultant dermatologist.

But, he adds, it could be the result of a placebo effect. There are many ways of delivering the salt into the body for therapeutic purposes, such as saline solution inhalation, dry salt aerosol inhalation, irrigation, saline lavage and brine baths (creno therapy), he says.

In fact, a literature review of 151 studies published in the International Journal of COPD said, “From this review, recommendations for inclusion of halotherapy as a therapy for COPD cannot be made at this point, and there is a need for high quality studies to determine the effectiveness of this therapy.”

In Dr Manmohan’s words, “Publicity cannot be taken as proof for treatment purposes.”

422,2020/02/10,What’s a Mogambo roll ?,"Living in a city which swears by its shawarma, one approaches the chicken sheekh roll at Fanoos warily. Wrapped in butter paper, outwardly it resembles the Arabian roll. But with subtly spiced chicken sheekh and crunchy slivers of onion neatly encased in a rumali roti, it is a burst of flavour very different from a shawarma’s blandness. And thankfully, this isn’t blanketed in mayonnaise!

Hotel Fanoos, opened in 1975 by the late Ajaz Husain, began as a kebab kiosk in Bengaluru and a loyal following for its kebab rolls. Over the years it found a place in the hearts of Malayalis too, whether they lived in Bengaluru, or ate at one of the outlets when they travelled there.

So, right from when this 16-seater restaurant opened its first Kerala outpost on Kaloor-Kadvanthra road, it has been packed. Dominic Tharakan, who runs the franchise, says “I try to squeeze in a trip to Fanoos each time I am in Bengaluru,” explaining why he chose this chain for Kochi.

A planter (rubber), who went to college in Bengaluru, Dominic decided to get into the restaurant business as diversification. Fanoos, he says, was a good choice since the food is different from what is available in the city.

The restaurant’s no fuss interiors are done in brown and white, and the small space cleverly manipulated so that it does not feel congested. The cooks/kitchen staff were trained in making the rolls at Bengaluru for two weeks before the launch to ensure that they got the flavours right.

Seekh kebab is made of ground meat, flavoured with spices and then barbecued, and it goes into almost everything at Fanoos. One of Dominic’s concerns was the quality of meat. “Getting the right meat is everything, it has to be sourced carefully. Especially since the menu is meat-based,” he says. So he brought a butcher from Bengaluru to whet the meat and help choose a vendor, especially for beef rather. After a four-five day recce they found two places, in Kaloor and Thoppumpady.

The menu is the same as Bengaluru Fanoos’, even the spice mix (masala) is brought from there. Kebabs and rotis are made in house. The rolls, interestingly come in six ‘sizes’ — regular, Jumbo, Mumbo, Rambo, Sambo and Mogambo — depending on the number of kebabs packed inside. The names were also picked by Ajaz, except Mogambo, which his sons chose. The popular rolls here are beef sheekh, beef Irani and chilli chicken roll.

While regular has a single seekh kebab, Mogambo, the largest, has six. The most popular size is Jumbo, Dominic says. “With two kebabs, the meat-rumali roti ratio is just right. With these the carbohydrate-meat ratio tends to be work with the health conscious.” The rolls are priced between ₹ 70 and ₹345.

For those looking to eat a meal of rice for lunch, Dominic has added three rice-based combinations — tomato rice-chicken curry, ghee rice-Koduva chicken curry and mutton kheema biriyani. “All sourced from recipes of friends and family.” The Koduva chicken curry is his mother-in-law’s. With tangy tamarind and mango chutney, as the dish is served in Koduva households. The curry is simple, so is the combination. The mutton kheema biryani is a tangy affair, perhaps from the tomatoes. Unlike regular biriyani, the mutton used is mince not pieces, The mutton to rice ratio is 1:1, which makes it meaty.

Desserts are home made, by Dominic’s mother, and include chocolate cake and coconut burfi. The drinks on the menu are black tea (cardamom, ginger and lime), hibiscus juice and virgin Mojito, a must try.

“The workers admitted that one of them had poured the waste water into the nearby canal, although they have not made it clear whether this is a usual practice.

He said that it was an attempt to mislead the public.

The MLA added that the government has failed to ensure the completion of the Vizhinjam international seaport project within 1,000 days. Besides, while the previous United Democratic Front government had completed the first phase of the Karamana-Kaliyikkavila NH development within a year, the LDF government had been unable to take the project forward during four years of its rule.

426,2020/02/10,Top priority for capital development: Minister,"The development initiatives kicked off in the capital district under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is ‘unparalleled’, Minister for Tourism and Cooperation Kadakampally Surendran has said. It took into account the future needs of the citizens and ushered in overall development of the capital, Mr. Surendran added.

“The development of the State capital has been the priority of the LDF government and it has been accorded the due importance,” the Minister said on Sunday, denying allegations that the 2020-2021 Budget presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had sidelined the capital district.

“It is true that a Thiruvananthapuram package was not announced as in the case of Kochi and other places. But, key projects for the overall development of the major sectors of the capital district had been announced and token provision made in the Budget,” the Minister said at a press conference here.

The Minister said procedural delays were leading to dragging of the projects.

Centre’s neglect

Lashing out at the Bharatiya Janata Party and district president V.V. Rajesh, the Minister said the party should burn the Prime Minister in effigy for not fulfilling the assurances given to the State in the past years and for sidelining Kerala in the 2020-2021 Union Budget.

“No Union government has neglected Kerala like this,” the Minister added.

Listing out project details, the Minister, who is in charge of the capital district, said public works to the tune of ₹1,696 crore had been included in the Budget and ₹42 crore token advance made. The development of the Kattakada township at a cost of ₹100 crore tops the list and 48 projects that cost ₹10 crore to ₹50 crore had been included in the State Budget and this would cost ₹969 crore.

427,2020/02/10,Salt production begins on an insipid note,"Only a few hundreds among the about 1,500 salt manufacturers of Vedaranyam have commenced production work after the monsoon.

The manufacturers are waiting for a further rise in intensity of sun for the brine to crystallise into salt from a month from now.

The works began in recent weeks with the usual poojas in the pans along the coastline of Agasthiyampalli, Kodiakadu, and Vedaranyam.

Salt production could not be carried out last year, as the pans were inundated with slush brought in by Cyclone Gaja in 2018. A combined stock of nearly one lakh tonnes of salt produced during the preceding seven to eight months was completely washed away by the flood triggered by Gaja, Sivakumar, a salt producer in Vedaranyam said.

Unfortunately for the manufacturers, neither the Centre nor the State Government had responded to the request made by the Vedaranyam Salt Manufacturers and Merchants Association and the Indian Salt Manufacturers' Association for providing relief to resume production.

Left to fend for themselves, a section of the manufacturers produced salt only to the extent of 25 percent of their capacity.

“The off-season storage was exhausted last November. Though the Salt Department has acknowledged comprehensive damage to the pans, there has been no support from the Central and State governments,”A. Vedaratnam, president of Vedaranyam Salt Manufactuers and Merchant's Association, said.

The pans that were cleared for production activities during January were inundated a fortnight back due to unexpected rainfall. The manufacturers are now pinning their hopes on the summer season.

The salt producers have another problem to contend with. Due to closure of the pans over the last couple of years, most of the workforce has migrated elsewhere in search of jobs, and the existing workers were also more inclined to take up work as farm hands, said Kumar, another manufacturer.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2nazw9/article30785297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11SALTTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/salt-production-begins-on-an-insipid-note/article30785299.ece

The Government has already released the funds for the combined transport office, which will also house the offices of Regional Transport Office (East) and the Deputy Transport Commissioner with jurisdiction over four districts: Tiruchi, Karur, Perambalur and Ariyalur.

The integrated testing centre will ensure testing of suspension, electrical aspects, tyre strength, and other aspects of vehicle maintenance at one go, an official said.

In case of private vehicles the fitness certificates are valid for 15 years from the date of registration and thereafter renewed every five years. The fitness is checked and certified by the registering authority.

As for transport vehicles the fitness certificate is issued for a new vehicle for two years and subsequently renewed every year.

Fitness certificate is meant to check the pollution caused by the emission of smoke from the vehicles, to maintain the vehicle in proper condition and to avoid accidents. The necessity for automated testing of vehicles has arisen to eliminate errors that are otherwise caused by manual evaluation of fitness, the sources said.

The pilot project envisages equipping the testing centre with sensors, electronic motors, speedometers, vibration plates and beam testers. The full report of a vehicle subjected to testing will be readied in print form within an hour.

The road worthiness of the vehicles will be determined through parameters such as noise levels of exhaust, accuracy of speedometer, brake impact and suspension, alignment and intensity of the headlight and auxiliary light, sources added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/integrated-testing-centre-on-the-anvil-at-combined-transport-office-complex/article30785281.ece
429,2020/02/10,Govt. teachers resent unrealistic workload for practical exams,"Post-Graduate teachers handling science subjects in government schools in Tiruchi district lament that they find themselves in a peculiar situation of having to handle three to four batches of students for practical examinations that are under way for Plus One and Plus Two students.

For every teacher, handling two batches - one each in the morning and afternoon sessions of three-hour durations - has been a norm.

The teachers complain they spend close to 12 hours in the schools from 8 a.m. onwards for handling three to four batches.

“We have been instructed to conduct the practicals in two-hour sessions, so as to accommodate more batches of students. This is unfair for the students,” a headmaster of a school in a rural location, who did not wish to be identified, said.

Ideally, the number of laboratories ought to have been increased in proportion to the number of students, to ensure three-hour duration of practical session for every batch. The private schools have been able to do this and hence, there was no level playing field. The worst sufferers would be the top-performers in the government higher secondary schools who entirely pin their hopes on meritorious performance for admission into prestigious institutions, another headmaster said with a sense of frustration.

There has been an apparent lapse in planning too. The number of days for the practicals got restricted due to wastage of substantial time for planning. At least three additional days could have been utilised for conduct of the practical exams had the planning been made beforehand, teachers pointed out. The students in government schools must be a worried lot as there would be apprehensions about the mindset of the teachers valuing their papers. “It is unreasonable for the administrators to expect a teacher to evaluate more than 60 papers - 30 each for two batches. A workload beyond that is bound to cause a dent in the efficacy of evaluation”, a senior teacher sought to explain.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e113ia/article30614682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH--SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/govt-teachers-resent-unrealistic-workload-for-practical-exams/article30785272.ece
430,2020/02/10,Probe launched into alleged sale of two male babies,"The Tiruverambur Police here has launched investigation into alleged sale of two male babies who were rescued a few days ago by the police and district child protection unit based on an information.

The police have detained three persons in connection with the two separate cases. In one instance, the baby was allegedly bought by a woman of Tiruverumbur area who was a mother of two girl children and had the desire to raise a male child.

The woman is said to have been approached by a broker who allegedly obtained ₹1 lakh and handed over a male child to the former for illegal adoption, sources said.

In the second instance, a woman construction labourer of a village near Uppilliyapuram had delivered a male child at the Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital here.

The woman already had two children and allegedly gave the infant to her relative who is said to have bought it by giving her a promisory note.

The woman labourer had been working at Arasankudi near Tiruverumbur and had allegedly given a wrong name at the hospital. The alleged illegal adoption came to light through a field-level health staff of a primary health centre at Arasankudi who had been monitoring the woman’s health condition.

Based on information, the Anti Human Traffic Unit of the Tiruchi Rural Police conducted inquiries during which the alleged sale of babies came to light. The District Child Protection Unit also conducted inquiries in this regard.

The rescued infants were produced before the Child Welfare Committee and accommodated in a service organisation for few days.

The babies were sent to an adoption centre at Elakurichi in Ariyalur district on Monday, said Child Welfare Committee sources.

431,2020/02/10,Officials blamed for malpractices in DPCs,"THANJAVUR: The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation Employees Union and TNCSC Loadmen Union have blamed TNCSC officials for the alleged malpractices in the direct procurement centres set up to procure paddy from the farmers in the State.

Holding the TNCSC officials responsible for the `misdeeds’ reportedly taking place in the DPCs, the TNCSC Employees Union and the TNCSC Loadmen Union has claimed that the field workers were only executing their duties as per the instructions, they receive from the officials.

However, they were held responsible for the weight loss due to delay in transportation of paddy bags from the DPCs to the storage points and during transportation an act in which the DPC workers had no role to play. Instead of pulling up the transportation contractors for the delay in picking up paddy bags from the DPC and weight loss during transportation, the officials `calculate the loss amount’ and collect it from the DPC staff.

In addition to the `weight loss’ fine imposed on the DPC staff, the procurement workers unofficially shell out over ₹1000 per trip to the lorry drivers to move the paddy bags from their DPC to the storage point. And this `extra amount’ collected by the transporters would vary and go up to ₹1500 depending on the distance between the DPC and the storage point.

Further, the workers engaged for the procurement exercise were being paid a paltry wages of ₹1.62 per bag while workers engaged by private parties for the same work was paid ₹10 per bag.

Discussing the remedial measures to be adopted by the Corporation in order to ensure smooth and fair procurement of paddy from farmers, the meeting held in Thanjavur on Sunday, suggested the formation of separate wings for distribution of gunny bags, thread and other materials required for procurement from the modern rice mills or the godowns to DPCs, and for transportation of procured paddy, holding the transport contractors responsible for the delay in the movement of paddy from DPCs to storage points, issuing of allotment orders to the millers and movement to other districts in advance would help to eliminate the alleged malpractices in the process of paddy procurement through DPCs.

432,2020/02/10,Plea to protect the livelihood of local fishermen,"The Thanjavur District Mechanised Vessel Fishermen Association has called upon the Fisheries Department to ensure that the livelihood of local fishermen were not affected by the activities of fishermen of neighbouring coastal districts.

At a meeting held at Mallipattinam on Sunday, the association claimed that the livelihood of Thanjavur district fishermen was affected since the fishermen from neighbouring Nagapattinam and Karaikal areas used to catch fish in the sea off Thanjavur district coast using their speed vessels.

As they used to anchor in the area where the Thanjavur district fishermen used to catch fish for more than 24 hours, the local fishermen were not able to get sufficient catch and most of the time they used to return with a low catch or empty-handed.

Hence, the association urged the Fisheries Department to direct the neighbouring district fishermen to look for fish in their own area and not to trespass into neighbouring areas.

Stating that the country boat and mechanised vessel fishermen in Thanjavur district has entered into an agreement that the former would venture into the sea for four days in a week and the latter three days so that both of them could get a good catch, the association claimed that intrusion of neighbouring district fishermen into Thanjavur district sea had badly affected the catch.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/plea-to-protect-the-livelihood-of-local-fishermen/article30783794.ece
433,2020/02/10,Construction industry slowdown renders unskilled workers jobless,"Slowdown in the construction industry has constricted the livelihood opportunities among unskilled construction workers in Tiruchi.

Thousands of workers in Tiruchi district depend on the construction industry and nearly 60% of them come to the city from rural areas such as Mannachanllur, Thottiam, Musiri, Manapparai, Kuzhumani and Samayapuram. The remaining 40% of them go for work in the respective towns near to their villages.

The unskilled workers generally assemble at various labour markets such as Woraiyur, Thiruvanaikoil, Puthur, Crawford, Samayapuram and Kattur in the city around 8 a.m. daily to find jobs. Each point will have around 500 to 1,000 workers looking for daily construction work, from where they are assigned work by agents. The workers associated with construction companies report for duty directly.

Industry sources say that due to poor construction activities, the number of workers turning at labour markets has come down by 50% in recent months. They come to markets only when called by agents.

“There were days when we used to go to work on Sunday too. But now I get work for just one or two days a week. The poor job market has raised a question mark over our livelihood,” says T. Govindaraj of Samayapuram, a mason.

The declining trend in construction activities that began about three-four years ago is yet to see a reversal. Builders and civil engineers, who were seeing hectic activities till 2015, find it difficult to launch new projects and get individual construction works.

“I had a pool of about 50 construction workers till a few years ago. I would invariably give them employment almost on a daily basis. Now, I am unable to take in even four or five workers,” said S. Selvakumar, a civil engineer in Srirangam.

“We welcome and appreciate the Chief Minister’s announcement. We have been placing the demand since 2014 as the hydrocarbon projects will have disastrous consequences in the Cauvery delta. We urge the Chief Minister to enact a law to implement the decision,” said T. Jayaraman, Chief Coordinator, Anti-Methane Project Federation, who has been in the forefront in the protests in Kadiramangalam and other places in the delta.

“The Centre and MNCs will mount pressure on the government. The State must not succumb and should remain firm,” he said.

The Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee urged the Chief Minister to enact legislation banning new hydrocarbon extraction projects in the delta region. While welcoming his announcement, the Committee coordinator, P.Maniarasan pointed out that the reasons listed out by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa while issuing a government order banning the extraction of methane in Cauvery delta would hold good for hydrocarbon projects also.

At the same time, he said, allowing an American company to set up an oil refinery in Cuddalore district at a massive investment, contradicted the announcement made by the Chief Minister. Though setting up of a massive oil refinery could be justified by claiming that it would create jobs, the fact that such large scale oil refining activity would have a negative impact on the environment, particularly groundwater table, could not be ruled out, he alleged.

Further, the projected employment opportunities in this petroleum industry have not brought any succour to the Tamil youth as their job opportunities have been usurped by North Indians, he said by pointing out that North Indians have been employed in large numbers in the refineries functioning at Ennore, Narimanam, Panangudi and other areas.

Moreover, international studies have also pointed out agro-based industrial activities provided more job opportunities than chemical-based industries, he added.

Mr. Maniarasan also urged the State government to withdraw cases booked against those who had staged protests demanding declaration of the delta region as protected agriculture zone and against the hydrocarbon projects in the region earlier.

Koundampatti S. Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, also sought legislative protection to ensure that the Chief Minister’s decision was enforced.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/i4ndm8/article30783736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11PADDYTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/enact-law-to-implement-decision-on-declaring-delta-as-protected-zone/article30783737.ece
435,2020/02/10,‘Resume animal birth control programme’,"The Tiruchi City Care Group, a division of a citizens’ forum, has sought the intervention of the Collector to resume animal birth control programme to check the growing population of stray dogs.

“The population of stray dogs has multiplied rapidly in the city and may pose a grave threat to the people of the city,” said M. Sekaran, president of the group in a representation addressed to the Collector S. Sivarasu.

Mr. Sekaran regretted that despite several representations, the programme has not resumed. Corporation officials had assured recently that the programme would resume within a week. But it was yet to be revived.

Since the Corporation has removed garbage bins public places, the stray dogs were also facing problems in getting food. Hence, they were attacking children who carry things in bags. Hence it was essential that the dogs were sterilised and also immunised.

If the demand was not fulfilled soon, the organisation members would resort to a fast and also hand over puppies to the Corporation, Mr. Sekaran said.

The Tiruchi Corporation, in February 2019, inaugurated an Animal Birth Control Centre at Konakkarai with pre-operative and post-operative wards to carry out least 30 sterilisation procedure a day but it was shut down after a few months due to lack of doctors and technical help.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/resume-animal-birth-control-programme/article30783728.ece
436,2020/02/10,A tale of two ‘smart’ streets at Veereswaram,"A few months after completion of first ‘smart’ road — Veereswaram East Street — in Tiruchi, the Corporation has begun work on the second ‘smart’ road — Veereswaram West Street — in Srirangam.

Construction of rainwater harvesting structure, covered cable ducts and stormwater drain are among the chief features of the smart road project to be implemented at an estimate of ₹80 lakh.

Besides, the 275-metre-long West Street inVeereswaram will have a cement road from end to end. The civic body has planned to complete the project within two months.

But residents of Veereswaram, who were apprehensive of the quality of work on the smart road laid on East Street, have demanded that the Corporation officials ensure quality of work on West Street.

The smart road on East Street, laid at an estimated ₹48 lakh, has a rainwater harvesting mechanism and stormwater drain. The concrete road with storm water drain was thrown open to the public in August. The scheme was implemented on a pilot basis by the Corporation.

The smart road on Veereswaram East Street has been laid end to end covering almost the entire road space. While nearly 80% of the space is covered by concrete, a portion of the roadside has been devoted for underground drainage and drinking water connections to buildings.

There are rainwater harvesting boxes on the concrete road, thereby enabling the water to flow into the earth through holes drilled for a depth of about 20 feet.

Before laying the road, all underground drainage and water connections were given to all residents.

Just seven months have passed since the completion of the smart road project. But, local residents point out the emergence of well-developed cracks at various places on the road.

“We thought it was really a smart road in the initial stage. But, it is like any other road. Within a short span of time, we find damages at various locations,” says C. Kumar, a long-time resident of Veereswaram East Street.

“The civic officials should make sure to ensure quality of work on West Street,” he pointed out.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/uv694w/article30780158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KEEZHAVEERESWARAMSMARTROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/a-tale-of-two-smart-streets-at-veereswaram/article30780164.ece

438,2020/02/10,Messi orchestrates Barca fightback,"Lionel Messi gave a hat-trick of assists on Sunday as Barcelona ended its turbulent week with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Real Betis to stay in touch with Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.

Madrid’s 4-1 win at Osasuna earlier in the day put pressure on Barca to respond, only for Betis to twice lead at the Benito Villamarin through a penalty from Sergio Canales and brilliant solo effort from Nabil Fekir.

Yet both times Barcelona hit back as Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets pulled it level before Clement Lenglet headed in with 18 minutes left, all three goals teed up by Messi.

Fekir and Lenglet were then sent off in a frantic contest by the end of which, Barca had the victory it so desperately needed following a difficult few days for the club.

Political spat

Messi had put himself at the heart of a political spat this week by publicly taking exception to comments made by sporting director Eric Abidal, who suggested the players were the cause of the decision to sack Ernesto Valverde last month.

Barcelona was then beaten by Athletic Bilbao and knocked out of the Copa del Rey before the semifinals for the first time in 10 years on Thursday.

“In Bilbao we played well but they knocked us out,” said Barca coach Quique Setien. “This win will give us motivation and extra energy for the future.”

Making matters worse

To make matters worse, winger Ousmane Dembele suffered another hamstring injury, which is likely to keep him out for the rest of the season, while centre-back Samuel Umtiti appeared in court too, for alleged damages to a rented villa.

It meant defeat against Betis was unthinkable, particularly for Setien, who could ill-afford another setback against the team he managed for two years between 2017 and 2019.

Instead, Barca turned the tide, with a chaotic performance that might have been punished by better opponents, but that keeps it three points behind Real Madrid.

Storming back

Inter Milan moved top of Serie A on Sunday after storming back from two goals down to snatch a 4-2 win over AC Milan in a pulsating derby at the San Siro.

Inter pulls level on 54 points with Juventus, which lost 2-1 at Hellas Verona on Saturday, but is ahead of the champion on goal difference thanks to a exhilarating second half turnaround after Ante Rebic and Zlatan Ibrahimovic had put Milan 2-0 up at the break.

Hard-fought

Lazio is just a point behind in third after Felipe Caicedo scored the only goal in a hard-fought win at Parma earlier on Sunday.

Milan’s collapse means it missed the chance to move into the Europa League places and sits 10th.

442,2020/02/10,Gaurs on the cusp of something special,"When Mumbai City FC arrives in Margao for an away match against FC Goa in ISL’s season six, visiting captain Amrinder Singh will find a familiar face in the home team dugout — Derrick Pereira. The ex-India defender was head coach at Pune FC where Amrinder guarded the goal. Career moves have taken them down different paths and they will be in rival camps at the Nehru stadium on Wednesday.

Pereira — an AFC Pro Coaching Licence holder and FCG’s technical director — has a huge task ahead after accepting a call two weeks ago from the management to take charge after popular chief coach, Sergio Lobera from Spain, was suddenly asked to leave. Team captain Mandar Dessai expressed surprise at Lobera’s exit, while fans reacted with shock.

Belief in players

Replying to a query if the players trust him to deliver as coach and whether the fans believe in his capability to get the best performances, Pereira, 57, said: “I think one of the key reasons that the management was able to make this call was because we believed in our players — not only to perform on the pitch but always able to give their best off it. Change is always hard and it takes a little time to get adjusted. The FC Goa dressing room has been buzzing with positive energy.”

He added: “We are on the cusp of something special — becoming the first Indian team to ever play in the AFC Champions League proper — that’s what everyone in the dressing room is focussed on. Everything else is just noise.”

The ISL clubs have foreign coaches in each team. Pereira is the exception, directing operations in tandem with interim coach, Clifford Miranda. For football fans in Goa, both are familiar faces put into an unexpected situation.

Home support

Asked if he expects fans to continue supporting the Gaurs for the home games, Pereira replied, “I am completely confident. In the past few years, FC Goa has truly become a symbol that all Goans have been able to identify themselves with. The kind of reaction we got recently from Sergio (Lobera) leaving is a sign that the people really care about the club. Players and managers come and go, the club will remain and what will remain is the Goan’s love for football.”

Coming back to the match against MCFC, he agreed about the quality in Amrinder and Goa-born Borges. “Both of them are really great talents. They are Indian internationals for a reason and also a big reason why Mumbai City FC is in the play-off hunt. Either of them can change the course of a game with their play. We cannot just focus on certain individuals, what we really want to do is play our style of football. We have to see obstacles that hinder us from doing so and devise plans to overcome them.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/d72ct5/article30784703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11PEREIRA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/gaurs-on-the-cusp-of-something-special/article30784063.ece
443,2020/02/10,I-League | Mohun Bagan downs Punjab FC,"Mohun Bagan cruised to its fourth consecutive win, downing Punjab FC by a solitary goal in the I-League at its home ground Kalyani Stadium on Sunday.

The win helped Mohun Bagan consolidate its position on top of the table, opening up a nine-point lead over its closest challenger — Punjab FC.

Senegalese striker Babacar Diawara found the only goal of the encounter late in the first half to see the 2015 champion collect the full quota of points and extend its unbeaten run to nine matches. Bagan now tallies 26 points from 11 matches.

The host went for the kill early and opened up the flanks in an effort to feed the Senegalese forward in the box, but the Punjab defence held strong. V.P. Suhair, partnering Diawara, came close to finishing first but saw his header, on a Joseba Beitia corner, going over in the 20th minute.

Bagan almost found the target again in the 39th minute when Punjab’s Nepalese goalkeeper Kiran Limbu fumbled while trying to clear a cross from Ashutosh Mehta. Suhair tried a snap header on goal as the ball rebounded off the ’keeper. But doughty Brazilian midfielder Danilo Augusto cut it off from the line.

The Punjab defence finally succumbed to the relentless Bagan efforts in the 42nd minute when Diawara reached a long throw from Dhanachandra Singh and nodded home.

Bagan went for greater glory after the break but failed despite its best efforts. The host did find the mark for the second time in the 61st minute when its defender Francisco Morante flicked home a Beitia free-kick. But the goal was disallowed for off-side.

Beitia had another good chance in the 77th minute but the Spaniard remained wayward and shot over from close.

444,2020/02/10,Real Betis vs FC Barcelona: Lionel Messi leads Barca revival in thrilling win at Betis,"Lionel Messi produced a hat-trick of assists as Barcelona pulled off a gutsy 3-2 win away to Real Betis in La Liga on February 9 after trailing twice in an enthralling match as coach Quique Setien enjoyed a winning return to his former club.

French defender Clement Lenglet headed home the decisive goal in the 72nd minute from a Messi freekick but was then sent off for two bookings, moments after Betis’ Nabil Fekir had been dismissed for earning two yellow cards in the space of a minute.

Barca had fallen behind in the sixth minute to a penalty from Sergio Canales after a VAR review showed Lenglet had handled the ball, but Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong promptly equalised with the help of a lofted pass from Messi.

Betis restored their lead with a strike from World Cup-winning forward Fekir in the 26th minute but Barca struck back again right before halftime when Messi found Sergio Busquets with a freekick and the midfielder converted from close range.

Lenglet’s headed goal earned second-placed Barca a first away win in the league in four matches and allowed them to cut the deficit behind league leaders Real Madrid back to three points with 23 games played after Real beat Osasuna 4-1 earlier.

The topsy-turvy encounter was a fitting end to a dramatic week for Barca in which Ousmane Dembele sustained a serious injury, Messi lashed out at sporting director Eric Abidal and the team lost 1-0 to Athletic Bilbao to exit the Copa del Rey.

“It was so important for us to win after losing in the Cup in the last minute but we just had to keep playing in the same way and that’s what we did,” said Barca’s Sergi Roberto.

“It was vital that we found our form and started winning away from home again so we go home feeling happy.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/r6br9q/article30780030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MESSI-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/real-betis-vs-fc-barcelona-lionel-messi-leads-barca-revival-in-thrilling-win-at-betis/article30780031.ece
445,2020/02/10,Rugose whitefly resurfaces in Andhra Pradesh,"An invasive pest known as rugose whitefly has rapidly infested palm oil and coconut plantations in the State. The severity of the rugose whitefly infestation, which showed a downward trend in the State during December 2019, reappeared last month.

According to sources, it was first reported at Kadiyam in East Godavari district in the nursery gardens during late December 2016. The pest may have entered the State through infested coconut seedlings obtained from Kerala. The incidence and severity have reduced subsequently.

The dreaded whitefly has surfaced again and devoured the palm oil and coconut plantations in East and West Godavari, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and Visakhapatnam districts. The palm oil plantations are ‘more affected’ compared to coconut.

The yield is likely to come down by 15 to 20%. As part of the measures to control the spread of infestation, the government has been supplying Isaria Fumosorosea, a fungus and bio-pesticide, to farmers through the Horticulture Department.

The officials say that East and West Godavari districts had a severe incidence of the whitefly pest in 2019 in an area of 1,535 hectares of coconut and 2,461 hectares of palm oil. Later, the pest has reduced in both incidence and intensity. The pest infested in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and Visakhapatnam in February 2019. The recent surveys indicate an increase in the area affected by the rugose whitefly in these districts, they say.

When contacted, AP Agriculture Mission vice-chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy says the spread of the pest in different places could be attributed mainly to the distribution of infested seedlings, as well as transporting vehicles. The pest could establish in coconut and oil palm plantations. The impact was more in oil palm.

Awareness campaign

The State government has initiated awareness campaign against the pest and the efforts are yielding results, he says.

The awareness programmes, including practical demonstrations, are being conducted at village level by the horticulture officials. Also, awareness meetings are being organised at mandal level by involving scientists from IIOPR(Pedavegi), Coconut Research Station (Ambajipet), and scientists from Dr. YSR Health University, Venkataramannagudem, he says.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/pkq2pz/article30780612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-VU-RUGOSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/rugose-whitefly-resurfaces-in-andhra-pradesh/article30780613.ece

He also blamed the Leader of Opposition for “rumours on eviction of a reputed IT company from Millennium Tower and sanctioning of funds to finish the construction on another tower at Rushikonda”.

447,2020/02/10,Precautionary steps can help check nCoV spread: experts,"Saying that there is no need to panic about the novel coronavirus (nCoV), experts at an awareness programme organised by Praja Aarogya Vedika (PAV) at the Public Library here on Sunday advised people to remain alert and take help of doctors for symptomatic treatment.

K.V.V. Vijay Kumar, HoD of Pulmonary Medicine, Andhra Medical College and Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases Superintendent P. Rama Rao, PAV State vice-president and IMA president Malladi S. Sharma and secretary K. Phanindra, and PAV president Kameswara Rao spoke.

Dr. Vijay Kumar said novel coronavirus was first detected, after several cases of pneumonia were detected during the New Year celebrations at Wuhan city of Hubei province of China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) was alerted as the virus did not match with any known ones.

“As many as 4,593 confirmed cases of nCoV have been detected globally till date and of them 4,573 cases were reported from Wuhan and its neighbouring places in China. Outside China, there were only 56 confirmed cases reported,” he said while quoting the WHO figures.

Major symptoms

The common symptoms of the virus include headache, running nose, muscle pain, sore throat, cough and cold, while the potential complications are high fever, trouble in breathing, pneumonia and sepsis. “There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus. Only symptomatic treatment such as drugs for fever control and ventilator support are available at present. Washing hands with soap after visiting public places and before eating, covering nose and mouth while coughing and sneezing, avoiding unprotected contact with anyone with cold and flu symptoms, thorough cooking of meat and safe disposal of used tissue and wearing masks are some of the precautionary measures,” said Dr. Vijay Kumar.

One should give up the habit of frequently touching eyes, nose and mouth and avoid close contact with animals. Those employed in slaughter houses and meat stalls should wear protective gowns, gloves and masks. “One need not panic if they have symptoms such as cold and cough as it could be normal flu. They must go for complete evaluation,” he said.

Accusing TDP leaders Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu, Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy, Ganta Srinivasa Rao, Peela Govinda Satyanarayana of indulging in land scams in the district, Mr. Reddy told the media that the YSRCP government was doing everything transparently.

Mr. Prasad Reddy claimed that a senior revenue officer had recommended action against Mr. Govinda Satyanarayana on charge of encroaching 100 acres.

“Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu is not only indulged in illegal laterite mining and ganja smuggling in Narsipatnam area, but has grabbed valuable land when he was a Minister. Mr. Ganta Srinivasa Rao had brought pressure on then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to evade action against his ill-gotten land,” he alleged.

He said there was no comparison between the LPS initiated by the YSRCP government and the one launched in Amaravati during the TDP tenure.

“We are offering developed plots in lieu of surrendered assigned land with the permission to sell it whenever the beneficiaries want,” said the YSRCP leader.

‘No insider trading’

The YSRCP leader alleged that Mr. Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu had purchased land after the decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital.

“There is no truth in the allegations that MP V. Vijay Sai Reddy has purchased land in the city before the decision on three capitals was taken,” he said.

He claimed that no YSRCP leader had bought a single inch of land in Visakhapatnam as part of the alleged ‘insider trading’.

“The allegations that the ruling party leaders are trying to grab land belonging to Waltair Club and missionary organisations near Hotel Tycoon is nothing but a travesty of truth,” Mr. Prasad Reddy said.

YSRCP leaders Rongali Jagannadham, Pakki Diwakar and Ravi Reddy were also present on the occasion.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/siipwt/article30780489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VZ3KOYYAPRASADREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/people-offering-land-voluntarily-for-house-sites-for-the-poor/article30778033.ece
449,2020/02/10,Delhi Assembly elections: Tight security in place ahead of counting on Tuesday,"Tight security arrangements have been put in place at various centres across the national capital where the counting of votes polled in the high-stakes February 8 Delhi Assembly elections will take place on Tuesday.

The curiosity among people to know the outcome of the elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly has heightened post-exit polls, that has forecast a big win for the ruling AAP, and the delay in announcement of the final voter turnout by authorities.

The election, largely seen as a battle between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP, which went aggressive during the high-octane campaign, was held on Saturday, sealing the fate of 672 candidates -- 593 men and 79 women.

Nearly 24 hours after the polling ended in Delhi, the Election Commission on Sunday announced that the final voter turnout was 62.59%, five per cent less than 2015, and asserted that it followed the laid down process to compile data, after the AAP questioned the “delay”.

Authorities in the Delhi CEO Office are gearing up for the counting of votes and adequate arrangements have been made at the centres spread across 21 location in the national capital, spanning 11 districts, officials said.

The counting centres are located at CWG Sports Complex in East Delhi, NSIT Dwarka in West Delhi, Meerabai Institute of Technology and G B Pant Institute of Technology in Southeast Delhi, Sir CV Raman ITI, Dheerpur in Central Delhi, and Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana in North Delhi, among other places.

There will be 33 counting observers, officials said.

There were 13,780 polling booths where every vote was accounted for by the presiding officers which is a time-consuming exercise, Sandeep Saxena, Senior Deputy Election Commissioner, said at a press conference on Sunday.

Critical and vulnerable polling locations, numbered 545 and spanned 3,843 booths.

In view of the ongoing anti-citizenship law protest in Shaheen Bagh, the Delhi CEO’s Office had put all five polling stations in the area under the “critical” category.

Security personnel kept guard at strong rooms storing electronic voting machines (EVMs).

Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh, a day ahead of the polls, had said all EVMs have been tested and they are “foolproof and non-tamperable”.

Exit polls on Saturday predicted an easy win for the AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.

Looking to capture power after 22 years, the BJP had mounted one of the most aggressive campaigns in the Delhi Assembly polls, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah leading the saffron charge on its planks of Hindutva and nationalism, and its strident opposition to Shaheen Bagh protests.

The issue often dominated the political discourse during the campaign, with many BJP leaders targeting the ruling AAP, and the Congress, accusing them of “misleading people” holding anti-CAA protests in Delhi.

A section of voters on Saturday claimed that the prolonged street agitation demanding revocation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was “not an issue in the beginning of the campaign” but “political parties had slowly turned it into one“.

Ballimaran constituency recorded the highest voter turnout of 71.6% among all the 70 assembly seats in the national capital, while Delhi Cantonment brought up the rear in polling percentage, according to data shared by officials on Sunday.

Okhla constituency recorded 58.84 per cent. Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar fall in Okhla assembly constituency, where hectic polling had taken place till late afternoon.

Shaheen Bagh has been the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Delhi, running into over 50 days now.

Protesters had taken turns on polling day on Saturday to cast votes to keep the agitation alive.

Seelampur constituency recorded a turnout of 71.2%, according to the data.

The turnout in the 2015 Assembly polls stood at 67.47%.

Over 1.47 crore people were eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, including 2,32,815 in the age group of 18-19.

Voters in various categories included males (81,05,236), females (66,80,277), service voters (11,608), third gender voters (869), and senior citizens (aged 80 and above) voters (2,04,830), officials said.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/kuhf65/article30784621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHICOUNTING,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/delhi-assembly-elections-tight-security-in-place-ahead-of-counting-on-tuesday/article30784622.ece

451,2020/02/10,"Crafts Council India’s annual meet in Coimbatore discusses Sustainability, ethics and art","Crafts Council India (CCI) held its annual meet at Coimbatore this year and underpinning the discussions in the day long conference were the matter of funding and CSR. Eminent people who worked with artisans in areas of design, technology and marketing shared their experiences.

Gita Ram, Chairperson CCI came straight to the point in her opening address: “We have to shift gears about how we look at craft. It is the entire eco-system of craft that needs help, be it in design intervention, marketing or just awareness about it.” CCI tried to address these issues through its initiatives, and speaking of one of them she said, “CCI engages with at least 200 children of craftspeople at any given time. We have to educate to sustain and we have met with some success in places like Pathamadai in Tamil Nadu and parts of Bengal where experts conduct weekend classes for the children on design to keep them interested in the craft of their parents.”

Speakers Manish Saxena (he heads the CSR initiatives of Aditya Birla) and Sharda Gautam (Tata Trust) shard their experiences of how Corporate intervention grows craft. Manish said of the weave of Varanasi, Bhuj and Pochampalli with which he is associated, “With design inputs that do not tamper with its authenticity, we have taken these age old crafts to the international stage.” Both he and Sharda emphasised the need for sensitivity to local craft, craft recognition and providing monetary as well as emotional support to the craftspeople. Sudha Shivkumar, treasurer CCI, made a strong case for addressing the real challenges. She said, mere subsidy was not the answer. “Markets had transformed beyond recognition and it was time to acknowledge that there was pitiful infrastructure, inadequate avenues to sell and non-availability of raw materials to help artisans. It was essential to have strong policies to leverage skills and create opportunities.”

Design to lead Ashoke Chatterjee, former director of National Institute of Design and Honorary President of CCI for many years, pulled no punches when he wrapped up the session. “Globalisation is out, it is the era for localisation. It is about local artists, local material, and even local CSR. The young want to hear powerful stories. The millennial demands socially responsible products that have a care for the planet and those who are less advantaged. Everything that CCI is doing here answers that. We have such fabulous stories such as the Aranmula Kannadi one. Go out and share them.

Joint Treasurer CCI, Sudha Ravi shared a heart-warming account of how CCI responded in time of disaster and helped Aranmula Kannadi makers get back on their feet post the Kerala Floods. CCI brought in design expert Aayush Kasliwal who suggested ways to reinvent the craft.

Summing up, Sharda Gautam made a poignant statement about the status of craftspeople in the country. He said: “The kaarigar and the kalakaar (artists) are now mere majdoors (labourers).",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pnps70/article30781344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAMBAALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/crafts-council-indias-annual-meet-in-coimbatore-discusses-sustainability-ethics-and-art/article30781348.ece
452,2020/02/10,The matter on a platter : Thambaalam exhibition begins in the city,"P Gopalakrishnan, one of the founder president’s of CCTN, curated Thambaalam, an exhibition that was inaugurated on the occasion of Crafts Council India’s conference in the city. The work began in July last year, he said “There were 75 plates, trays and salvers we sourced from private collection and we commissioned 120 more from artisans from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. The oldest display is the silver tray that was made in the 1850s in Madras as a farewell gift to a British Officer. It found its way to a private collection and we managed to borrow it for this exhibition,” he said.

The exhibition reiterated the importance of design intervention and making relevant traditional craft, said Gopalakrishnan and gave the example of P Thirupathi whose stone plates grace the exhibition. Tirupathi comes from a family that makes kalchettis used for cooking, but, for Thambaalam, he came up with such exquisite plates. Someone saw it at Tambaalam and has ordered six pieces! This is how craft will continue to survive.”

Craftspeople from across the country were asked to imagine, design and execute those salvers and trays. “They have sent in their beauties from Hoshiyarpur, Kanyamukari, Nagercoil, Madhubani, Bastar, Bidar, Tanjore, Kumbakonam, Udaipur, Jaipur and so many other places.” He drew attention to the trays from Crafts Council of Assam. “One of them is made of water hyacinth and the other of bamboo. These are traditional crafts with a design makeover and natural dyes have been used.” Craftsman, Prashant Moharana of Raghurajpur sent in plates with the Dasavatharam and some with forest scenes. These are normally done on silk or paper but he made them on local wood called Ghambari found in Orissa.

Jayashree Ravi, President CCTN described Thambaalam as “an initiative that will be close to our hearts.” She said the idea was to debunk the myth that art and craft was merely for decoration. “We had beautiful workmanship that was part and parcel of our everyday life, be they combs, vessels we cooked in or the trays we have here. For crafts to survive, we must make art indispensable to our lives.”

One of the most important takeaways from the CCI meet was use of CSR funding, Jayashree added. “It is not just about getting money, which of course is very important, but it is also about using those funds to make changes that endure. CSR should extend to helping Crafts Councils nurture the eco-system of craftsmanship, provide design inputs and streamline archiving and documentation.” She said reviving arts and crafts was a time consuming affair and one that needed to be sustained and extended. “It is not something to just superficially dabble in and move on.”

Thambaalam is open to the public on February 10 and 11 between 10 am and 7 pm at Kudam, 334 Puliakulam Road (Opposite Carmel Garden School)",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/8tph5n/article30781077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAMBAALAM1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-matter-on-a-platter-thambaalam-exhibition-begins-in-coimbatore/article30781078.ece
453,2020/02/10,Dos and Don’ts for coronavirus,"A lot of people ask me about coronavirus. Since I write about health for The Hindu, they seem to feel that I should know. It’s only fair that I share my knowledge.

First and foremost, I would like to point out that eating Chinese food does not put you at risk. Most of them buy their supplies locally. Some high-end restaurants may be importing from China, so only the rich are in danger. This is not a bad thing.

Regarding things that are strictly forbidden, do not eat bats. This is not an attempt to mock Chinese eating habits. All of us are mystified by what other people eat. There must be people in Norway who find sambar hilarious. Just because the Chinese are fond of consuming a wide variety of innocent woodland creatures, directly from the woods, we should not rush to judge them. Nevertheless, caution is called for.

Many people in India are adventurous when it comes to food items, which is why YouTube is full of videos on how to make paneer chowmein. Now is not the time for such adventures. Paneer chowmein in particular should be avoided at all times, even when there is no fear of contagion. Some people would argue that paneer itself is a contagion, but despite this rising threat, we must not allow ourselves to be distracted.

We should focus on elementary precautions to reduce the risk from coronavirus. For one thing, mummy was right, even though we ignored her when she said so. We need to wash our hands regularly, especially before cooking or eating. We need to follow what is known as coughing etiquette, which means, do not cough on other people, even if you don’t like them.

Sneezing etiquette is also extremely important. As a young boy in the UK, I was thoroughly schooled in the use of handkerchiefs, but I was misled. Do not ever sneeze into a handkerchief. It makes no sense to carefully preserve germs and carry them around in your pocket or handbag. The British can’t help it. After spending years with them in India, we know that they tend to grab and keep whatever they can lay their hands on, including bodily fluids. The rest of us should eschew this practice.

Instead, use a tissue, and carefully dispose of it afterwards. Then you should wash your hands, or use a hand sanitiser. You could also wear a mask, which has the additional benefit of making you harder to identify, but only if you’re coughing and sneezing, or live in Delhi. When you remove it at the end of the day, hold it by the strings and don’t touch the icky bits. Remember to wash your hands. Try to avoid crowded places, which gives you a good excuse for missing parties you don’t want to go to. If you are in a crowded place, and someone is coughing, quietly shuffle away until there’s a gap of at least three feet between you. Do it slowly in order to avoid being obvious.

We all hope that the outbreak ends soon, both in China and the rest of the world. But if you follow these simple precautions, you should be a safer, cleaner person.

454,2020/02/10,Scar support: A breast cancer survivor encourages people to get checked,"As February sets in, it evokes a lot of unpleasant feelings. It takes me back to the year 2013, when I was diagnosed with cancer and survived it.

Between 2005 and 2010, I lost two of my colleagues to cancer. Being an occasional caretaker to them during chemotherapy, I saw their pain and suffering. The family was overwhelmed by the costs and the uncertainty involved in treating cancer. When they died, I was certain that I would never tell anyone if I ever got the big C. So for more than a year I kept my symptoms quiet, until a call from my son one morning in February 2013. “Mamiji has been diagnosed with cancer,” he said, sounding shocked. It jolted me to confess that the other address for cancer in the family, could be me.

I had lived on a steady diet of hopelessness, fear and myths, delaying my diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Stage 3 cancer in the left breast could have gone rogue, despite my going to the best oncologists. An early diagnosis may have spared me the eight chemotherapy cycles and 33 radiation sessions. This regret stemming from incomplete information so often surfaces in my breast cancer awareness sessions in offices, colleges and women’s meet-ups.

One good way to raise awareness, I thought, was to have medical expertise intersect with the experience of a survivor. Ideally, medical teams should involve multidisciplinary consultations with a surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist. Over the next three weeks, I will engage in dialogue with doctors from these specialisations.

Our first conversation is with Dr Kumar Prabhash, Prof and HoD, Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.

Why is chemotherapy the scariest part of cancer treatment?

It has significant toxicity. Yet in most cases, it is also the most effective part of the treatment.

What is the principle of chemotherapy and what is the difference between primary, adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy?

Chemotherapy works on DNA and the cell cycle, which leads to cell dying. It affects both the dividing cancer cell and the healthy cell, but it kills cancer cells more than healthy cells. Primary chemotherapy is if we use chemotherapy as the only treatment, such as in leukaemia, and lymphoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy is when we use it after surgery to remove micro metastatic disease (a small collection of cancer cells that has moved to another part of the body). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is when we use it before surgery or radiotherapy to increase a person’s life or to shrink the size of a tumour before surgery.

Is chemotherapy a must for all kinds of treatment?

Chemotherapy or systemic therapy is useful in most tumours but not in all. Some, such as low grade adult sarcomas (in connective tissue), early stage low grade neuroendocrine tumours, early stage thymoma (occurring in the thymus in the chest), do not require it.

Can chemotherapy be a standalone cure for cancer?

Yes, for many cancers, such as leukaemia, lymphoma, germ cell tumours (forming from reproductive cells).

What are the side-effects of chemotherapy on the body?

Chemotherapy affects healthy dividing cells. Side-effects could include hair loss, mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes lining the digestive tract), infections, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia.

How does the medical team help to minimise the side-effects of chemotherapy? How can the person and their family manage the side-effects better?

It starts with anticipation. Counselling the patients and care givers, giving pre-medications, picking up side-effects early and providing immediate treatment minimises the impact. Manifestation of side-effects depends on age, overall health condition and the type of chemotherapy. Patients and care givers are very important in managing side-effects. If they find worsening side-effects they should immediately report them to the treating doctor. For example, unmanaged diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, chest pain, and high fever should all be reported.

What is metastatic cancer? Is chemotherapy effective in metastatic cancer?

When the tumor goes beyond the tumor organ and regional lymph node, we call it a metastatic disease. Chemotherapy is the only treatment which primarily works in metastatic disease, curing or increasing life, or improving symptoms.

What is maintenance chemotherapy?

When we have to provide treatment after a few cycles, we call it maintenance chemotherapy, like in leukemia in childhood.

Is chemotherapy effective when there is a relapse of cancer immediately or even after years?

Usually it is less effective if it comes back early.

I received chemotherapy every 21 days. But there are instances when chemo is given every week or even daily. Please explain these variations in cycles.

There are many different ways to give chemotherapy. They are developed based on toxicity and efficacy, and a lot depends on the disease. For instance, the same drug, methotrexate, is given weekly in osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer) but once in three weeks in breast cancer.

Chemotherapy treatment in breast cancer leads to hair loss. This is not the case when chemo is used in treatment for other cancers. Why is this different?

Some drugs lead to hair fall, some don’t, while some lead to some hair fall. Unfortunately, in breast cancer, the drugs which are effective lead to hair fall.

A close up photo of a woman holding a brochure promoting breast cancer awareness.

When and how fast does hair start growing?

For most people, hair regrows after chemotherapy, usually after a few months. After radiotherapy, it usually does not regrow.

Is chemo induced cataract and pre-mature falling of teeth a myth or reality?

A myth.

How can a cancer patient best manage bone fatigue?

Exercise and a healthy, balanced diet.

What does cancer prognosis mean?

Prognosis means the chance of a patient’s recovery and survival after diagnosis of the disease. It estimates average life and what the chances are, for the disease to come back. It is very important for doctors to discuss the prognosis.

Chemotherapy is very expensive? Are there any subsidies being offered by government?

Some chemotherapy drugs are expensive, some are not. Many are made available free by the government. Drugs like paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU, Antracycline, imatinib, gefitinib etc are not expensive and available free through many government schemes.

Is chemotherapy given in a private hospital better than in a government hospital, because of the quality of drugs?

All drugs are approved by regulator so we don’t expect any difference.

Are there instances where chemotherapy can do a lot of harm, that in fact a person may die of chemo drugs?

There are instances where it can harm and can have life threatening complications. In most, the patient is safe.

A person is asked to choose between a port and an intravenous (IV) method to receive chemo drugs. What is really better for both the patient and the medical team?

It will depend on the type of therapy, duration of therapy and patient’s choice. Port is a surgical procedure which needs to be done in an operation theatre and comes with its own risks. This requires some training and also needs regular hospital visits. However, this requires access to the vein for years, if required. Repeated vein puncture can then be avoided.

What are some advances in medical oncology?

There are many new developments. The most important has been immunotherapy. There has been development also in targeted therapy (targeted at the tumour). In lung cancer, targeted therapy has improved the outcome significantly. The average life of a patient used to be 6-8 months, which has now increased to 40-50 months, if they have known mutations and they receive targeted therapy.

What is immunotherapy?

When a drug uses the immune mechanism for an anti-cancer effect, we call it immunotherapy. The most important immunotherapy is called checkpoint inhibitors. It can be given with chemotherapy in some tumours like lung cancer, head and neck cancer.

Do drugs have an effect on behaviour?

They do affect behaviour and relationships. Physical impact also has an emotional impact. Counsellors and support group members are available in many hospitals to offer help. The cancer community in general is getting much better at recognising the psychological impact.

After completion of treatment, doctors say you are in a state of remission. We seldom get to hear one is cured of cancer. Can you please help us understand this better?

In some, the disease comes back after treatment. This makes the word remission more reflective of the situation than cure. Clinicians talk in terms of five year remission (being cancer-free) in percentages which means if 100 patients are treated, than what is the number of patients who will remain in remission. It is important to remember that this is a probability and we don’t have information which can tell us in absolute terms the chances of remission for an individual.

How important is a follow up after cancer treatment?

It is very important. It helps in detecting a relapse or new disease early and also in managing the side-effects better.

When are patients included in clinical trials?

There are clinical trials for all situations starting from screening, early stage disease, advanced stage disease. If clinical trials are available then patients are encouraged to participate in them. This is the opinion of reputed international groups like National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also.
