4,2020/01/03,5 tech trends set to explode in your life this decade,"The average time-frame of tech disruption in our lives has significantly diminished and things are changing at a rapid scale. In a span of few years, gadgets such as MP3 players, compact digital cameras, scanners, CDs, fax machines and several others have more or less disappeared.

On the other hand, new-age technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), content streaming, automation, robotics and 5G have been growing in leaps and bounds to make our lives better.

Let’s take a look at five tech trends that are expected to explode in the decade that has just begun.

Quantum computing

Imagine a chip that can perform target computation in 200 seconds, which would otherwise take the world’s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years.

A quantum computer can solve complex problems that would otherwise take billions of years for today’s computers to solve. This has massive implications for research in health care, energy, environmental systems, smart materials and more.

The team at Google AI has achieved sort of “quantum supremacy” with developing such chip — a new 54-qubit processor named ‘Sycamore’ that comprises fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates in order to perform the benchmark testing.

Not just Google but several tech giants like Microsoft, IBM and Intel have joined the race to build a scalable quantum computer. IBM recently unveiled its quantum computer with 53 qubits.

The current bits in computers store information as either 1 or 0, thus limiting the potential to make sense when faced with gigantic volumes of data.

If all goes well, Microsoft is also confident about having one such scalable super machine within the next five years.

“We are looking at a five-year time-frame to build a quantum computer and what we need are roughly 100-200 good qubits with a low-error rate,” Krysta Svore, Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Quantum Computing, told IANS recently.

Microsoft has also partnered with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee to conduct lectures on quantum computing for a full semester.

Self-driving ‘electric’ cars

The global revenues from “connected” cars — the precursor to fully-autonomous or self-driving cars — are growing at an annual rate of 27.5% and are expected to touch $21 billion by 2020.

Tesla helped create that market and remains an industry leader. The Elon Musk-run company surprised Wall Street by registering a profitable third quarter last year with a total revenue of $6.3 billion, riding on sales of its Model S, Model X and Model 3 electric cars.

Tesla is expected to deliver between 3,60,000 and 4,00,000 vehicles in 2019, representing a 45-65% growth.

Other automobiles expected to join Tesla sooner than later are Audi e-Tron Sportback, BMW iX3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Mercedes EQC 400 4Matic, Porsche’s Taycan 4S, Volvo XC40 Recharge and Byton M-Byte SUV to name a few.

India is also planning to replace a significant portion of its conventional internal combustion engine fleet with electric vehicles in the next decade, particularly with the aim of reducing pollution and also to create jobs.

5G-connected homes

With 75 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices expected to be in place by 2025, the world is on the cusp of experiencing a technology that will change the way live today.

Being able to download a full-length HD movie in seconds and share your wow-moments with friends — that’s just the beginning. Commercial 5G networks are starting to go live across the world.

With 5G commercial networks being switched on, the first use cases are enhanced mobile broadband, which will bring better experiences for smartphone users with 100 times faster data and fixed wireless access.

5G services have already begun in the US, South Korea and some European countries, including Switzerland, Finland and the UK. CSPs in Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Spain, Sweden, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have announced plans to accelerate 5G network building through 2020.

Voice as a new interface

Voice is slowly becoming the new human-compute interface, and India too is set are finally going to leverage voice to interact with the devices and digitally control their lives.

Alexa, Google Home, Siri and others are changing the way we interact with devices and the next decade will see digital assistants becoming all-pervasive.

According to Adam Berns, Director of Business Development, Alexa Voice Service (AVS) at Amazon, India is now ready for voice as a core experience.

“Today, voice is powering several devices — PCs, wearables, smartphones, car accessories and smart home devices — helping people streamline their lives. I firmly believe that voice is the next interface with computing, and Amazon with its Alexa offerings is here to change the world,” Berns told IANS recently.

Internet TV 24/7

An over-the-top (OTT) viewer in India is spending approximately 70 minutes a day on video-streaming platforms, with a consumption frequency of 12.5 times a week, according to a recent Eros Now-KPMG report.

In India, the Internet video traffic is projected to reach 13.5 Exabytes (EB) per month by 2022 — up from 1.5 EB a month in 2017 — with video contributing 77% of all Internet traffic by 2022.

“Unlike the common thought that urbanites are watching more content online, 65% video consumption is coming from rural parts of the country, thanks to cheap data plans, especially from Reliance Jio, and affordable smartphones. Those who cannot afford to buy a smart, connected TV are now streaming OTT content on phones,” TV Ramachandran, President, Broadband India Forum (BIF) says.

There are currently more than 32 online content and video-streaming platforms in the country and the market is expected to hit $5 billion by 2023, according to the global management-consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

5,2020/01/03,"India tops requests to TikTok, China not on list","India sent a total of 118 requests to the Chinese short-video making platform TikTok in the in the first half of 2019 to take certain actions against those accounts.

There was not a single request from China, TikTok’s home country where the app functions as a different name Douyin, which has stricter control.

While there were 107 legal requests, the Indian government asked information for 11 accounts, requesting to take down content deemed to be in violation of local laws, or to provide information related to accounts under certain defined circumstances, TikTok said in its first transparency report, mimicking U.S. tech companies who have the practice of revealing such information.

For 107 legal requests from India, TikTok which has nearly 200 million users in the country acted in 47% cases while for the government requests, it removed eight accounts.

The U.S. was second with 79 requests, related to 255 accounts, and received information on 86% of its requests. Third was Japan with 35 requests linked to 39 accounts.

TikTok has seen nearly 1.5 billion downloads globally and the U.S. market with 37.6 million downloads is at the third sport, after India and China.

“In balancing our responsibilities to law enforcement with our respect for the privacy of our users, we respond only to legally valid requests and only with the requisite amount of information needed,” said Eric Ebenstein, TikTok’s public policy chief.

6,2020/01/03,TRAI issues consultation paper on net neutrality,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Thursday issued a consultation paper on issues related to traffic management practices and the multi-stakeholder body for ‘net neutrality’.

The paper discusses the various challenges in measurement of internet traffic and compilation of reasonable traffic management practices (TMP), the regulator said in a statement.

It has invited comments on the issues raised in the consultation paper from the stakeholders by January 30, and counter comments, if any, by February 13.

The consultation paper said that currently there might be a number of TMPs, which are developed and deployed in the networks for different requirements. Some of these may be of a concern from the net neutrality perspective and required not to be applied in general, while some of the other TMPs might be necessary in specific situations.

However, such TMPs must be applied in proportionate and transient manner. To monitor and enforce net neutrality in an objective and transparent manner, it might be required to list out the reasonable TMPs and conditions when these may be applied.

“Keeping in view the continual changes in features and capabilities of networks and services, it might not be possible to make an exhaustive list containing complete technical details,” it said, adding that to keep pace, there may be a need to have a framework to prepare a list of reasonable TMPs.

The framework may also be responsible to develop technical documents that should capture enough details so that the interpretation of TMPs may be done in an objective manner, according to the consultation paper.

As per a recent TRAI report, India has total 665.31 million internet subscribers, out of which wired internet subscribers are 21.67 million, and wireless internet subscribers are 643.64 million. Total mobile internet wireless subscribers are 643.09 million.

“If we follow the trend of internet subscriber base in India, it shows that out of the total internet subscribers, 96.66% are using mobile device for access to internet service. Performing measurements for monitoring TMPs for such a large subscriber base, which reflect actual experience of consumers, would be a major challenge. The body conducting such measurement may face several challenges,” the report said.

7,2020/01/03,Here is why Google stopped Mi Home integration with Assistant,"Google has temporarily killed Nest Hub and Assistant integration for Mi Home smart home products, after a camera owner reported seeing unfamiliar still images apparently from other cameras.

According to a Reddit post, the user reportedly recently purchased a Xiaomi Mijia 1080p smart camera for his own home, but when he tried to stream video from his camera to his Nest Hub, the device started showing still images from a stranger’s house instead, The Verge reported on Thursday.

“We are aware of the issue and are in contact with Xiaomi to work on a fix,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, we are disabling Xiaomi integrations on our devices.”

In the images and video shared by the Reddit user Dio-V, one can see a still from someone’s room where a man is sleeping, another shows an image of a sleeping baby, one shows a kid playing with toys.

Recently, security camera start-up Wyze announced that it was hit by a data leak that exposed the personal information of more than a whopping 2.4 million of its customers.

8,2020/01/03,Think twice before giving apps access to info stored on phone,"Giving each and every app access to personal information stored on Android smartphones such as your contacts, call history, SMS and photos may put you in trouble as bad actors can easily use these access to spy on you, send spam messages and make calls anywhere at your expense or even sign you up for a premium “service”, researchers from cybersecity firm Kaspersky have warned.

But one can restrict access to such information as Android lets you configure app permissions.

Giving an app any of these permissions generally means that from now on, it can obtain information of this type and upload it to the cloud without asking your explicit consent for whatever it intends to do with your data.

Therefore, security researchers recommend one should think twice before granting permissions to apps, especially if they are not needed for the app to work.

For example, most games have no need to access your contacts or camera, messengers do not really need to know your location, and some trendy filter for the camera can probably survive without your call history, Kaspersky said.

While decision to give permission is yours, the fewer access you hand out, the more intact your data will be.

Here’s what you should know to protect your data...

SMS: An app with permission to send and receive SMS, MMS, and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) push messages, as well as view messages in the smartphone memory will be able to read all of your SMS correspondence, including messages with one-time codes for online banking and confirming transactions.

Using this permission, the app can also send spam messages in your name (and at your expense) to all your friends. Or sign you up for a premium “service.” You can see and control which apps have these rights by going to the settings of your phone.

Calendar: With permission to view, delete, modify, and add events in the calendar, prying eyes can find out what you have done and what you are doing today and in the future. Spyware loves this permission.

Camera: Permission to access the camera is necessary for the app to take photos and record video. But apps with this permission can take a photo or record a video at any moment and without warning.

Contacts: With permission to read, change, and add contacts in your address book, and access the list of accounts registered in the smartphone, an app can send your entire address book to its server. Even legitimate services have been found to abuse this permission, never mind scammers and spammers, for whom it is a windfall.

This permission also grants access to the list of app accounts on the device, including Google, Facebook and other services.

Phone: Giving access to your phone means permission to view and modify call history, obtain your phone number, cellular network data and the status of outgoing calls, add voicemail, access IP telephony services, view numbers being called with the ability to end the call or redirect it to another number and call any number.

This permission basically lets the app do anything it likes with voice communication. It can find out who you called and when or prevent you from making calls (to a particular number or in general) by constantly terminating calls.

It can eavesdrop on your conversations or, of course, make calls anywhere at your expense, including to pay-through-the-nose numbers, Kaspersky warned.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/azlt9x/article30467854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03NETPHONEAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/think-twice-before-giving-apps-access-to-info-stored-on-phone/article30467855.ece
9,2020/01/03,Gadgets that could vanish in this decade,"As we prepare to see more and more driverless cars, foldable smartphones and smart AR glasses around us in a couple of years, the next decade will also lead to the demise of some of your current favourite gadgets.

Some of these could be:

Gaming consoles: The arrival of Cloud-based game-streaming services such as Apple Arcade, Google Stadia and the upcoming Microsoft XCloud are all set to change the way people play games, thus threatening the very survival of the traditional gaming industry ruled by consoles like Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.

Cloud-based gaming is the new live-streaming trend after music and video. One big advantage of Cloud gaming over the traditional one is lower cost of set-up, which can be played on smartphones, tablets, PCs and even TV.

A key advantage is that gaming enthusiasts can play with multiple players across several platforms with ease. The players are also introduced to leading world gaming championships such as Fortnite World Cup, Intel Extreme Masters and many more.

Video camera: The previous decades witnessed the rise of video cameras to replace film cameras. Japanese tech giants like Panasonic or Sony were the major producers of video cameras, which featured only a few megapixels and very short battery life.

In recent years, we have already seen a sharp turn in the status of DSLRs. Mirrorless cameras and smartphones have become more popular for video recording among the consumers.

Wired headphones: The 1990s saw great revolution for music lovers in the form of Walkman along with headphones. The era of Walkman ended soon with the launch of multimedia phones that let its users store music on their smartphones.

In the beginning, wireless headphones were quite costly but now with Chinese accessory makers coming into play, the prices have gone down. The rise in demand as well as supply of wireless headphones have adversely impacted the wired headphones and in the coming years, they are likely to be part of history.

DVD players: DVD players were truly introduced to consumers in the mid-to-late 90s and quickly became a major source of entertainment. With mass adaptation of streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime along with built-in Blu-ray players in laptops and consoles like the PlayStation 3, DVD technology is undoubtedly on its way out.

On-demand services through cable companies were the first step towards eliminating tangible movie rentals.

Digital wrist watch: Digital watch, especially those by Japanese watch makers Seiko and Casio, was something that was admired by most kids in the 1990s.

Digital display watch, perhaps, gained its popularity after the release of 1973 James Bond movie Live and Let Die although the traditional Rolex also featured in it.

The advancement of smart wearables, specifically in the form of smartwatches and fitness bands, have already killed the business of original digital watches.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/xjmq5x/article30467744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03NETGADGETSVANISHING,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/gadgets-that-could-vanish-in-this-decade/article30467745.ece
10,2020/01/03,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa seeks electoral, constitutional reforms in Sri Lanka","In his first address to Parliament since becoming President, Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday sought constitutional and electoral reform, for “a strong executive and legislature” and sovereignty of the people.

While preserving the “positive characteristics” of the proportional representation system, electoral reforms were needed to ensure the “stability of the Parliament and to ensure the direct representation of the people”, he said.

The proportional representation electoral system, currently followed in Sri Lanka, allows smaller parties to be represented in the legislature with a minimum vote percentage. In a House that is numerically skewed towards the majority Sinhala-Buddhist community, politicians representing minorities have had reasonable say because of the PR-system.

However, Mr. Rajapaksa appeared to favour a shift. “Even though elections can be won through numbers, an unstable Parliament that cannot take clear decisions and remains constantly under the influence of extremism is not one that suits the country,” he said.

Further, he underscored enhanced national security and a neutral foreign policy as priorities for his government in his address that was silent on long-pending political demands of the Sri Lanka’s Tamils of the war-hit north and east. He, however, pledged to “always defend” the unitary status of the country, and “protect and nurture the Buddha Sasana whilst safeguarding the right of all citizens to practice a religion of their choice.”

Observing that a majority of Sri Lankans had rejected “political agendas founded on race”, President Rajapaksa said they had proved that “it is no longer possible for anyone to manipulate and control the politics of this country by playing the role of king maker,” in an apparent reference to minority parties representing Tamils and Muslims that have in the past proved tilted poll results.

The November 2019 presidential poll outcome pointed to a clear divide between Sri Lanka’s majority Buddhist Sinhalese – who substantially backed Mr. Rajapaksa -- and the minority Tamils and Muslims, who voted decisively for his main opponent Sajith Premadasa of the United National Party, who is now Leader of Opposition.

Mr. Rajapaksa’s party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Party), is aiming for a clear parliamentary majority in the general elections scheduled this summer, to allow its legislators to push laws and amendments that the newly-elected President envisions.

Following his big win in the November presidential election, the former defence secretary-turned Head of State has repeatedly called the 19th Amendment, passed in 2015 during his predecessor government’s term to clip the President’s executive powers and empower parliament, “a failure” and emphasised that it must be scrapped.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/89uxqn/article30358235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20SRILANKANPRESIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-seeks-constitutional-reform/article30473061.ece
11,2020/01/03,Commander Qasem Soleimani killing: Iran vows revenge,"A furious Iran threatened to avenge a U.S. strike that killed a top Iranian commander at Baghdad’s international airport on Friday, raising fears of a wider regional conflict between the arch-foes.

The Pentagon said U.S. President Donald Trump had ordered Qasem Soleimani’s “killing” after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised “severe revenge” for Soleimani’s death, the biggest escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the U.S. on Iraqi soil.

Angry Iranians took to the streets of Tehran chanting “Death to America” and holding up posters of Soleimani, who was widely admired in the Islamic Republic.

Mr. Trump tweeted a picture of an American flag with no comment, then followed up by declaring Soleimani should have been killed “many years ago”.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Soleimani had been planning an “imminent” attack “that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk”.

Americans told to leave

The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad urged all American citizens to leave Iraq “immediately” and U.S. nationals working at southern oil fields were being evacuated, Iraq’s Petrol Ministry said.

Who was General Qasem Soleimani and why was he so popular?

Early on Friday, a precision drone strike struck two cars belonging to Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi, a paramilitary force with close ties to Iran, as they drove away from Baghdad International Airport.

Soleimani also served as Iran’s pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

Muhandis was the Hashed’s deputy chief, but was widely recognised as the real shot-caller within the group. A replacement for him has not yet been named. Both were under U.S. sanctions.

Ceremonies to mourn them will be held on Saturday, when Iraq’s Parliament is also set to hold an emergency meeting.

A leading Hashed member, Hadi al-Ameri, urged lawmakers “to take a bold decision to oust foreign troops from Iraq, because their presence has become a threat for Iraqis”.

Additional troops

Some 5,200 U.S. troops are stationed across the country, and a U.S. defence official told AFP that some additional forces had arrived in recent hours to boost security at the American Embassy.

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said the strike was a “flagrant violation” of a security accord with the U.S., warning it would “spark a devastating war in Iraq”.

And Iraqi President Barham Saleh called for “restraint” — an appeal echoed by alarmed foreign governments.

Meanwhile, Mr. Khamenei has named Esmail Qaani, the deputy head of the Revolutionary Guards’ foreign operations arm, as the successor to Soleimani. But paramilitary figures in Iraq including U.S.-blacklisted Qais al-Khazali and militiaman-turned-politician Moqtada Sadr called on their fighters to “be ready”.

And in Lebanon, the leader of the Tehran-backed Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, warned of “punishment for these criminal assassins”, although the Shia movement denied any of its commanders were killed.

As fears of a regional conflagration grew, Yemen’s pro-Tehran Huthi rebels – who have launched a string of missile attacks on Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia – called for “swift reprisals”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/twwgeq/article30472043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQ-SECURITYBLAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-vows-revenge-after-us-kills-general/article30473058.ece
12,2020/01/03,"Syria regime condemns Iran commander Qasem Soleimani killing, opposition rejoices","The Syrian government on January 3 condemned the killing of top Iranian and Iraqi commanders in a U.S. strike which was hailed by the country’s Opposition.

The strike outside Baghdad airport killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and the deputy chief of Iraq's pro-Iran paramilitary organisation, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Syria is “certain that this cowardly U.S. aggression... will only strengthen determination to follow in the path of the resistance's martyred leaders,” a Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying by the state news agency SANA.

The official described the killings as “a serious escalation of the situation” in the region and accused the United States of resorting to “the methods of criminal gangs”.

The unnamed official said the strike was “part of the (U.S.) policy aiming to create tensions and fuel conflict in countries in the region”.

Soleimani had been a key backer of President Bashar al-Assad and helped him save his position after an uprising that began in 2011 threatened to topple his regime.

He was Iran's pointman in organising Iranian forces and their Shiite-dominated foreign proxies on the Syrian battlefield and a frequent visitor to Damascus.

Mr. Assad sent a letter of condolences to Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, in which he praised Soleimani for his continued support. The Syrian people “will not forget that he stuck by the side of the Syrian Arab army”, Mr. Assad said. “The memory of the martyr Soleimani will remain immortal in the conscience of the Syrian people,” he added.

Idlib celebrations

Thanks to the support of Iran and its proxies as well as to the decisive 2015 military intervention of Russia, Mr. Assad has clawed back most of the territory he lost in the early stages of the war.

In the few areas still that still escape the regime's control, some Syrians celebrated the death of a man they hold responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians.

During a weekly Friday protest in the northwestern city of Idlib, one demonstrator held a placard that read: “We rejoice in the death of the terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Thank you Trump.”

“This piece of good news will encourage us to keep advancing, God willing, the revolution will continue and the revolution will triumph,” said another protester, who gave his name as Mohamed Shkeib.

Others handed out sweets to celebrate Soleimani's death.

Leaders of Syrian Opposition groups for their part hailed the death of a man they blame for thousands for thousands of deaths in the nearly nine-year-old civil war.

“The murder of Qasem Soleimani, the number one perpetrator of Revolutionary Guards' crimes against the people of Syria and Iraq, is a blow that confirms that the world is able to stop Iran and protect Syrian civilians if it wants to,” Nasr Hariri, a senior political opposition leader, said.

Ahmed Ramadan, another senior opposition figure, also praised the U.S. strike. “The killer of Syria's children has been killed, the killer of Iraq's free people has been killed,” he said in a post on social media.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jlfhuu/article30472792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NF13J,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syria-regime-condemns-iran-commander-qasem-soleimani-killing-opposition-rejoices/article30472793.ece
13,2020/01/03,"One killed in Paris stabbing, assailant shot dead","French police shot and killed a knife-wielding man who fatally stabbed one person and injured two others in a park south of Paris on Friday, police and sources close to the inquiry said.

The man had attacked “several people” in the suburb of Villejuif before he was “neutralised”, the Paris police department said.

The attacker was shot dead by police after he fled to a neighbouring suburb. Police did not provide any potential motive for the attack.

The number two at the interior ministry, Laurent Nunez, travelled to the scene of the stabbings accompanied by Paris police chief Didier Lallement.

France remains on high alert after being hit by a string of attacks by jihadist extremists since 2015, with more than 250 killed in total.

The attack came just four days before France marks the fifth anniversary of the killing of 12 people at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, by two brothers vowing allegiance to Al-Qaeda.

The day after that attack, a man linked to the Islamic State (IS) group shot and killed a policewoman in a Paris suburb before taking hostages at a Jewish supermarket the following day, killing four more people.

Police eventually killed all three attackers but it was the beginning of the wave of strikes on French territory.

15,2020/01/03,Analysis | The importance of Qasem Soleimani,"Major General Qasem Soleimani , the commander of Iran’s Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. air strike in Baghdad on Friday, had an illustrious career as a spymaster and military strategist and a celebratory status in Iran. Always a defender of the Islamic revolution, Soleimani reported directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and, of late, was the main architect of Iran’s recent foreign interventions, mainly in Iraq and Syria. He was so close to Khamenei that the Supreme Leader, the commander of Iran’s armed forces, once called him “the living martyr of revolution”. For the Iranian revolutionaries, martyrdom is service. As the Supreme Leader once said about another fallen soldier, in the end, Soleimani “drank the sweet syrup of martyrdom”.

From war hero to commander

Soleimani joined the Iranian Army immediately after the revolution. He was on the frontlines during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. His commanders were so impressed by his bravery during the war that they promoted the young soldier, in his 20s, to head the 41st Tharallah Division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

The Iraqi forces, which had the backing of the Sunni kingdoms in the region and the West, made huge gains in the initial stage of the war, but later Iran retaliated through suicide missions targeting Iraqi troops. When the war ended through a ceasefire in 1988, the Mullahs in Tehran, who Saddam Hussein and his Gulf allies wanted to overthrow, were totally in control of Iran. Soleimani was rewarded for his war performance. In 1990, he was named the IRGC commander of Kerman Province.

Iran had laid the foundations of its “forward defence” doctrine during the war. Tehran was aware of its limitations as a conventional military power and also about the challenges it faced in a hostile region. To overcome this asymmetry, Iran started cultivating deep ties with the Shia population across the region and help build networks. The main job of the Quds Force, as the foreign operational wing of the IRGC, was to build a network of operatives, organisations, militias and parties under Iran’s influence. In the 1980s, Iran helped create Hezbollah in Lebanon, which during the decade carried out a host of terrorist operations targeting the U.S. and Israel. Iran had also built ties with Shia parties in Iraq. By the time Soleimani was appointed the head of the Quds Force in 1998, Iran had already established a network of resistance. His job was to take it to new levels. And he did just that.

Defender of revolution

A believer in Islam, Soleimani was a hardliner of the hardliners. He never hid where he stood in Iran’s complex power dynamics in which the hardliners, moderates and reformists compete for influence through elections and other means. In 1999, when students revolted against the regime demanding more freedom, Soleimani and other senior military figures wrote a letter to the then reformist President Mohammad Khatami, demanding action against protesters. “Our patience has run out,” they wrote, warning that if the government didn’t crush the protests, the military would. It was a blunt warning from the establishment, which is loyal to the Supreme Leader, to a more popular wing of the regime, the elected government. The police finally cracked down on the protesters.

In recent years, when Iran has rapidly expanded its presence in both Iraq and Syria and ties between Tehran and Washington were fast-deteriorating, Soleimani , as the commander of Iran’s foreign missions, was very much in focus. In 2018, he responded directly to a warning from President Donald Trump against the Iranian President not to threaten the U.S. Soleimani said, “It is beneath the dignity of our President to respond to you. I, as a soldier, respond to you.” Understandably, he was extremely popular among the Revolutionary Guards. When Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, called for global efforts to deter Soleimani in July 2018, the IRGC retorted, “Soleimani is not a single person. The great people of Iran support him.”

Enemy of IS

The main challenges Soleimani faced in the final years of his career and life, besides the threats from the U.S., were the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State (IS). In 2011-13, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad kept losing territories to the rebels. Mr. Assad’s Syria was the only national ally of Iran in the region and is also a critical link between itself and Hezbollah in Lebanon. If Mr. Assad falls, Tehran would be weakened. Soleimani ’s mission was to stop it happening. “The Syrian army is useless,” he once told an Iraqi politician, according to the New Yorker profile of the General. What he did was to build and train Shia militias and send them to Syria to fight the rebels along with the regime.

He also coordinated with Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, in strategising the war. In 2013, the regime troops, Shia militias and Hezbollah fighters captured Qusayr, a town on the Syria-Lebanon border, from the rebels in a joint operation, which was one of the early victories of the Assad regime in the civil war. Though the Russian intervention in 2015 actually turned around the conflict, the real ground support for the Assad regime came from the Iranians. And it’s Soleimani who oversaw that ground support. Syria was his war.

He did the same strategy in Iraq in the war against the IS. The Iran-trained militias, the same militia that was bombed by the U.S. last month that precipitated the current crisis, were in the forefront of the war against the IS. Soleimani ’s men fought in the battlefield along with the Kurdish Peshmerga militia and the Iraqi Army while the U.S. provided air support. This model was tested in Amirli, a predominately Shia town in Iraq on the Iranian border, which was captured by the IS. In 2014, the Iraqi Army, backed by Shia militias, broke the siege of Amirli, in what was called Iraq’s biggest victory against the IS at that time. This model was repeated in Tikrit, Fallujah, Ramadi and finally Mosul, which all were liberated from the IS.

The IS Caliphate is now destroyed. The Syrian regime has survived the civil war. But the man who played a pivotal role in both these achievements has been assassinated by the U.S. Iran may not take it lightly as Soleimani was too big a figure in Iran for the regime to push it away. The risks of a major conflict are at an all-time high now.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8pl0b0/article30467269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSOLEIMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/analysis-the-importance-of-qasem-soleimani/article30469236.ece

The Parliament was to meet on December 3, but Mr. Rajapaksa prorogued it for one month and fixed January 3 for the commencement of the next session.

He attended the Parliament for the first time as he had never been a Member of Parliament. The President chose to be attired in a European suit, a deviation from all five of his male predecessors who always wore the traditional national dress.

In his ceremonial address, the President recalled his family’s long association with the Assembly and explained that although he was not wearing the family trademark maroon coloured shawl with national dress which claimed to represent the peasants from the deep southern region of Giruwapattuwa, he still had their interests as a priority of his administration.

The President outlined his government’s vision for efficiency, eradication of corruption and crime with accelerated infrastructure development to revive the local economy.

He told the Assembly that electoral and constitutional reform would be needed to make Sri Lanka a progressive state. The executive presidency must be strengthened to leave no room for extremist politics, he said.

He said that he wants stronger relations with all countries as the foreign policy of his government. We will not fall on our knees before any foreign nation,” he said.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 70, a former military officer, was sworn in as Sri Lanka’s seventh President on November 18 after he defeated the ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa by more than 13 lakh votes, marking the return of the powerful Rajapaksa dynasty.

He named his elder brother and former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister after Ranil Wickremesinghe of the United National Party resigned from the post following the election debacle.

The 74-year-old leader will function as the Prime Minister of the caretaker Cabinet until the general election in 2020.

18,2020/01/03,UAE extends $200m aid to Pakistan for economic projects,"The United Arab Emirates has extended $200 million aid to Pakistan for the development of the small and medium-sized enterprises in the country, Finance Adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan has said.

The announcement came after Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan concluded his one-day visit to the country on Thursday.

The adviser, Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, on Thursday said “the money will be spent on small business promotion and jobs. This support is testimony to the expanding economic relations and friendship between our countries.”

The Crown Prince directed the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development to allocate $200 million in order to assist the Pakistani government’s efforts to create a stable and balanced national economy that will help achieve the country’s sustainable development, Dawn News reported on Friday.

During the visit, the prince met Prime Minister Khan and held talks on bilateral, regional and international issues.

The UAE is Pakistan’s largest trading partner in the Middle East and a major source of investments. The UAE is also among Pakistan’s prime development partners in education, health and energy sectors.

It hosts more than 1.6 million expatriate Pakistani community, which contributes remittances of around $4.5 billion annually to the GDP.

This is the Crown Prince’s second visit to Pakistan since Khan took office in August 2018. He had last visited Pakistan on January 6 last year, just weeks after his country offered USD 3 billion financial assistance to Pakistan to deal with its balance of payment crisis.

The Crown Prince’s visit was considered by experts as an attempt to woo Pakistan against the backdrop of recent developments when Saudi Arabia and UAE apparently used pressure to stop Pakistan from attending the Kuala Lumpur summit held last month.

The summit from December 19-21 was seen by Saudis as an attempt to create a new bloc in the Muslim world that could become an alternative to the dysfunctional Organisation of Islamic Cooperation led by the Gulf Kingdom.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4ttz1s/article30459983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001C037R,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uae-extends-200m-aid-to-pakistan-for-economic-projects/article30468252.ece
19,2020/01/03,"Algeria frees prominent war veteran, government critics","Algeria released several prominent anti-government protest figures from detention on Thursday, including well-known independence war veteran Lakhdar Bouregaa, one of his lawyers said.

Mr. Bouregaa was freed from an Algiers prison where he had been detained for six months, an media photographer said.

“His trial, which was due to start this (Thursday) morning, has been postponed and the judge has decided to release him,” lawyer Abdelghani Badi said.

Mr. Bouregaa, 86, was arrested at his home in Algiers last June for “insulting a state body” and “taking part in a scheme to demoralise the army with the aim of harming the nation's defence”.

His supporters attributed his detention to his criticism of army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah, who became Algeria's de facto strongman after the fall of longtime president Abdelaziz Bouteflika last April. Gaid Salah died of a heart attack in December.

Mr. Badi said that Bouregaa, who underwent emergency surgery for a hernia during his detention in November, would remain free during his trial, postponed until March 12.

Mr. Bouregaa was a commander of the National Liberation Army — which fought French colonial rule — and a founder in 1963 of the Front for Socialist Forces, one of Algeria's oldest opposition parties.

Before his arrest, Mr. Bouregaa took part in the demonstrations that have rocked Algeria since last February — initially against Mr. Bouteflika, and then the wider establishment, after the president was forced to resign.

Mr. Bouregaa's arrest provoked outrage in Algeria, notably from supporters of the “Hirak” protest movement, who branded him a “prisoner of conscience” and demanded his release.

Among other detainees freed on bail Thursday was retired general Hocine Benhadid, according to Kaci Tansaout, head of support group the National Committee for the Liberation of Prisoners.

The 73-year-old was also accused of “demoralising the army” after criticising Gaid Salah.

Abdelhamid Amine, who was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his anti-government cartoons under the pen name “Nime”, was released after serving one month, Mr. Tansaout said.

About 180 protesters, activists and journalists were arrested ahead of an unpopular presidential election on December 12, many for waving Berber flags at protests or making critical comments online.

Some were acquitted, often after months of pre-trial detention. Another 30 were convicted of “attacking the integrity of the territory” and were recently released after serving six month sentences.

About 140 others remain in prison, either convicted or awaiting judgement.

After a vote marred by low turnout, Abdelmadjid Tebboune was sworn in as Algeria's new president on December 19.

20,2020/01/03,Democrats call U.S. killing of Iran general ‘reckless’,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that President Donald Trump has “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox” with the targeted killing of Iran’s top general in an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport.

The former vice president joined other Democratic White House hopefuls in criticizing Mr. Trump’s order, saying it could leave the U.S. “on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.”

The Pentagon said the U.S. military killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in Baghdad Friday at the direction of Mr. Trump. The attack is expected to draw severe Iranian retaliation against Israel and American interests. The Defense Department said Soleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a statement saying, “Trump’s dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.”

Democrats acknowledged the threat posed by Soleimani, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling him “a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted- “War with Iran is the last thing we need and is not the will of the American people. We should be acting to deescalate tensions and protect our people in the region.”

The attack also drew criticism from Democrats who aren’t running for president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration conducted the airstrike without consultation of Congress or an authorization for use of military force against Iran. She said it “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.”

But Republicans on Capitol Hill stood behind Mr. Trump. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said- “I appreciate President Trump’s bold action against Iranian aggression. To the Iranian government- if you want more, you will get more.”

And Sen. James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said- “America does not and should not seek war, but it will respond in kind to those who threaten our citizens, soldiers and friends - as the President has long promised. De-escalation is preferable and possible - but only if our adversaries choose it.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/owjy9i/article29427161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Joe-Biden,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/democrats-call-us-killing-of-iran-general-reckless/article30467923.ece

24,2020/01/03,Who was General Qasem Soleimani and why was he so popular?,"Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed Friday in a U.S. strike, was one of the most popular figures in Iran and seen as a deadly adversary by America and its allies.

General Soleimani, who headed the external operations Quds Force for the Guards, had wielded his regional clout publicly since 2018 when it was revealed that he had direct involvement in top-level talks over the formation of Iraq's government.

It was no surprise at the time for a man who has been at the centre of power-broking in the region for two decades.

Soleimani has been in and out of Baghdad ever since, most recently last month as parties sought to form a new government.

Where once he kept to the shadows, Soleimani has in recent years become an unlikely celebrity in Iran — replete with a huge following on Instagram.

His profile rose suddenly when he was pushed forward as the public face of Iran's intervention in the Syrian conflict from 2013, appearing in battlefield photos, documentaries — and even being featured in a music video and animated film.

In a rare interview aired on Iranian state television in October, he said he was in Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war to oversee the conflict.

To his fans and enemies alike, Soleimani was the key architect of Iran's regional influence, leading the fight against jihadist forces and extending Iran's diplomatic heft in Iraq, Syria and beyond.

“To Middle Eastern Shiites, he is James Bond, Erwin Rommel and Lady Gaga rolled into one,” wrote former CIA analyst Kenneth Pollack in a profile for Time's 100 most influential people in 2017.

“To the West, he is... responsible for exporting Iran's Islamic revolution, supporting terrorists, subverting pro-Western governments and waging Iran's foreign wars,” Mr. Pollack added.

With Iran roiled by protests and economic problems at home, and the U.S. once again mounting pressure from the outside, some Iranians had even called for Soleimani to enter domestic politics.

While he has dismissed rumours he might one day run for president, the general has played a decisive role in the politics of Iran's neighbour, Iraq.

As well as talks on forming a government, he was pivotal in pressuring Iraq's Kurds to abandon their plans for independence after an ill-judged referendum last September.

Decision-maker

His influence has deep roots, since Soleimani was already leading the Quds Force when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001.

“My Iranian interlocutors on Afghanistan made clear that while they kept the foreign ministry informed, ultimately it was General Soleimani that would make the decisions,” former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker told the BBC in 2013.

His firm but quiet presence play perfectly to the Iranian penchant for dignified humility.

“He sits over there on the other side of room, by himself, in a very quiet way. Doesn't speak, doesn't comment, just sits and listens. And so of course everyone is thinking only about him,” a senior Iraqi official told the New Yorker for a long profile of Soleimani.

A survey published in 2018 by IranPoll and the University of Maryland — one of the few considered reliable by analysts — found Soleimani had a popularity rating of 83%, beating President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

Western leaders saw him as central to Iran's ties with militia groups including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.

Part of his appeal was the suggestion he might bridge Iran's bitter social divides on issues such as its strict “hijab” clothing rules.

“If we constantly use terms such as 'bad hijab' and 'good hijab', reformist or conservative... then who is left?” Soleimani said in a speech to mark World Mosque Day in 2017. “They are all people. Are all your children religious? Is everybody the same? No, but the father attracts all of them.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g3t9v6/article30467686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQAIRPORTATTACKTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/who-is-general-qasem-soleimani-and-why-was-he-so-popular/article30467687.ece
25,2020/01/03,Five fishermen presumed dead in sinking of Alaska crabbing vessel,"Five commercial fishermen lost at sea when their crabbing vessel capsized and sank on New Year's Eve in the Gulf of Alaska were presumed dead on Thursday after search-and-rescue operations were called off amid rough weather, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

The crew of 130-foot (40-metre) Scandies Rose, owned by a Seattle-based fishing company and home-ported in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, issued a distress call late Tuesday night. Its last known location was about 270 km southwest of Kodiak, the Coast Guard said.

Two men who escaped the capsized vessel in a life raft were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter crew and taken to a hospital in Kodiak, where they were reported to be in a stable condition, the Coast Guard said.

But after criss-crossing 3,600 square km of sea for 20 hours with helicopters, airplanes and a cutter vessel, the Coast Guard called off its search for five other crew members on Wednesday night.

“The decision to suspend an active search-and-rescue case is never easy, and it's only made after careful consideration of a myriad of factors,” said Rear Admiral Matthew Bell, commander of the Coast Guard's Alaska district. “Our deepest condolences to the friends and families impacted by this tragedy.”

The Coast Guard described weather conditions during the search as challenging, with gale-force winds, high seas and limited visibility.

A spokeswoman said the Coast Guard had joined the National Transportation Safety Board in opening an investigation into the shipwreck.

The dead were identified as crew master Gary Cobban Jr., David Lee Cobban, Arthur Ganacias, Brock Rainey and Seth Rousseau-Gano. The survivors were Dean Gribble Jr. and John Lawler.

The loss of the Scandies Rose marked the worst Alaska commercial fishing accident in nearly three years. In February of 2017, another crabbing vessel, the F/V Destination, sank in the Bering Sea, and all six aboard perished.

Crab fishing in the waters off Alaska ranks among the world's most hazardous occupations, posing a host of dangers to life and limb chronicled in the popular reality TV series “The Deadliest Catch” on the Discovery Channel.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wady5z/article30467543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRABFISHINGBOATSINKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/five-fishermen-presumed-dead-in-sinking-of-alaska-crabbing-vessel/article30467544.ece
26,2020/01/03,U.S. airlines face risk of extremist activity in Pakistan airspace: FAA,"The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday warned American airlines and their pilots that there is risk involved in operating flights in Pakistan airspace due to “extremist or militant activity”, according to an official document.

“Exercise caution during flight operations. There is a risk to U.S. civil aviation operating in the territory and airspace of Pakistan due to extremist/militant activity,” said the FAA, in a notice to airmen (NOTAM) dated December 30, 2019.

The NOTAM is applicable to all U.S.-based airlines and U.S.-based pilots.

The U.S. regulator said in its NOTAM that there continues to be a risk to U.S. civil aviation sector from attacks against airports and aircraft in Pakistan, particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of flights.

“The ongoing presence of extremist/militant elements operating in Pakistan poses a continued risk to U.S. civil aviation from small-arms fire, complex attacks against airports, indirect weapons fire, and anti-aircraft fire, any of which could occur with little or no warning,” it said.

The FAA said that while, to date, there have been no reports of man-portable air defense systems or Manpads being used against the civil aviation sector in Pakistan, some extremist or militant groups operating there are suspected of having access to these Manpads.

“As a result, there is potential risk for extremists/militants to target civil aviation in Pakistan with Manpads,” it said.

The regulator added that pilots or airlines must report safety or security incidents - which may happen in Pakistan - to the FAA.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fg262x/article29991387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRCRAFTKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-airlines-face-risk-of-extremist-activity-in-pakistan-airspace-faa/article30467454.ece
27,2020/01/03,Donald Trump ordered killing of Iran Guards commander: Pentagon,"US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in Baghdad “in a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad,” the Pentagon said.

“General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,” the Department of Defence said.

Following Soleimani’s death, Mr. Trump tweeted an image of the U.S. flag without any further explanation.

The strike, which occurred at Baghdad’s international airport on Friday in Iraq, also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the U.S. embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The U.S. had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Baghdad airport was hit in a volley of missiles just after midnight Friday, Iraq’s military had announced.

Security sources told AFP the bombardment hit a Hashed convoy and killed eight people, including “important figures.” Soleimani heads the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force and also serves as Iran’s pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

“At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,” the Pentagon said.

“This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” it added.

The Pentagon said that Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including on December 27, the day the U.S. contractor was killed.

29,2020/01/03,Indonesia plans cloud seeding to halt rain as floods death toll hits 30,"Indonesia will carry out cloud seeding on Friday in a bid to prevent further rainfall over the capital Jakarta, after deadly flash floods and landslides following some of the heaviest rains in more than 20 years.

The death toll in Jakarta and surrounding areas rose to 30 as of Thursday night, according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced.

The floods followed torrential rains on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year's day and inundated swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns.

With more deluges forecast, two small planes have been readied to break up potential rain clouds in the skies above the Sunda Strait, while a bigger plane will be on standby, Indonesia's technology agency BPPT said in a statement.

“All clouds moving towards the Greater Jakarta area, which are estimated to lead to precipitation there, will be shot with NaCl (sodium chloride) material,” the agency said.

“Hopefully they will break before they reach the Greater Jakarta area.”

Cloud seeding, or shooting salt flares into clouds in an attempt to trigger rainfall, is often used in Indonesia to put out forest fires during the dry season.

The Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency has warned that “extreme weather” may continue until Jan. 7, while heavy rainfall could last through to mid February.

Television footage on Friday showed flood waters still inundating some areas of Southeast Asia's largest city.

Authorities on Thursday used hundreds of pumps to suck water out of residential areas and public infrastructure, like railways.

President Joko Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the disaster, including the construction of a canal that has been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems.

Widodo last year announced he will move Indonesia's capital to East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, to reduce the burden on Jakarta, which is overpopulated and sinking.

The PMF blamed the United States for an attack at Baghdad International Airport Friday.

Pentagon confirms strike

Pentagon has confirmed the news. ""The U.S. military has killed Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, at direction of President Trump. This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” the Pentagon said in a statement.

A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official confirmed to the Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were among those killed in the attack.

Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah, which was involved in the attack on the US Embassy this week.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his companions, killing them all.

Body identified

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorised to give official statements.

The senior politician said Soleimani’s body was identified by the ring he wore.

Soleimani had been rumoured dead several times, including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.

More recently, rumours circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s Aleppo.

Earlier, Iraq’s Security Media Cell, which releases information regarding Iraqi security, said Katyusha rockets landed near the airport’s cargo hall, killing several people and setting two cars on fire.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8pl0b0/article30467269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSOLEIMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irans-gen-soleimani-killed-in-air-strike-at-baghdad-airport/article30467271.ece
32,2020/01/03,U.S. slaps sanctions on Cuba defense minister over support for Venezuela's Maduro,"The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday on Cuba's defense minister, accusing him of human rights violations and supporting socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

Washington blacklisted Leopoldo Cintra Frias, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (MINFAR), and his children, Deborah Cintra Gonzalez and Leopoldo Cintra Gonzalez, in its latest action targeting Havana for its support of Maduro.

Pompeo said MINFAR had been involved in the torture of Venezuelans and subjected them to “cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment for their anti-Maduro stances” alongside Maduro's military and intelligence officers.

The designation bars Cintra, a career military officer who joined Fidel Castro's rebel army in 1957, and his children from entering the United States.

The Cuban Embassy in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment.

“As Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, Cintra Frias bears responsibility for Cubas actions to prop up the former Maduro regime in Venezuela,” Pompeo said.

“Dismantling Venezuela's democracy by terrifying Venezuelans into submission is the goal of MINFAR and the Cuban regime,” Pompeo added.

The United States and more than 50 other countries have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president. Guaido invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency last year, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham.

Vietnam’s U.N. Ambassador Dang Dinh Quy, the council president for January, told a news conference on Thursday that U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo and U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock will report to the council Friday on the current situation in Idlib province.

Syrian troops have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets over the past two weeks in Idlib, the rebel stronghold in the northwest. Idlib is dominated by al-Qaida-linked militants and is also home to 3 million civilians.

The United Nations has warned of the growing risk of a humanitarian catastrophe in the region, which lies along the Turkish border.

The Security Council meeting is taking place following the council’s rejection on Dec. 20 of rival resolutions that would continue the delivery of humanitarian aid across borders to more than 1 million Syrians every month in mainly rebel-held areas.

The current mandate ends on Jan. 10 and ambassador Dang said he thinks all council members will try their best to resolve differences and allow aid deliveries to continue.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that as a result of hostilities, more than 235,000 people had been displaced between Dec. 12 and Dec. 25. Many of them have fled from the town of Maaret al-Numan, toward which the Syrian troops have been steadily advancing.

Ambassador Dang said Vietnam supports a peaceful settlement of the eight-year Syrian conflict along with a cease-fire,

The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said Thursday that at least 140,000 children have been displaced in the last three weeks because of heavy violence in and around Idlib.

Iraqi paramilitary groups said five of their members and two ”guests” were killed in the airstrike on their vehicles inside Baghdad International Airport, militia sources reported on early Friday.

The militia members were hosting “important guests” at Baghdad airport who were being driven in two militia vehicles that were struck by two rockets, said the militia sources.

Two militia sources said the two guests were also killed in the attack but declined to identify them.

Police and health sources said that at least five people were killed and nine wounded.

Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) said in a post on Facebook that its director of public relations was killed in what it described as “cowardly U.S. bombing.”

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday following U.S. air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah militia bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.

35,2020/01/03,Algeria appoints new government amid worst political crisis in decades,"Algeria appointed a new government on Thursday, as the country faces its biggest political crisis in decades and a raft of economic problems caused by falling energy revenues.

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected last month and appointed Abdelaziz Djerad as prime minister on Saturday. They have kept several important posts unchanged, seemingly signalling continuity in major state policies.

Abderrahmane Raouia was re-appointed finance minister, after previously serving in that post from 2017 until last March, when he was replaced. As is usual in Algeria, Tebboune will act as defence minister.

Mass protests that broke out in February succeeded in unseating veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April. An election to replace him was postponed twice as protesters said it would be illegitimate while the ruling elite stayed in place.

Tebboune was elected last month in a vote that the protest movement rejected, winning 58% on a turnout officially registered as 40%.

He has offered dialogue with the protesters but the leaderless movement has continued to stage demonstrations since his election.

Algeria, a major energy exporter, depends on its oil and gas sales for 60% of government revenue. However, sales have fallen since oil prices began to drop in 2014 and Algeria's foreign currency reserves have more than halved since then.

A state budget agreed by the interim government and parliament late last year included new laws aimed at increasing foreign investment but pledged 9% cuts in public spending.

The interim government appointed a new head of state energy producer Sonatrach, Kamel Edine Chikhi, and a new central bank governor, Benabderahmane Ayman, in November.

The parliament also approved a new energy law that would make international investment in oil and gas more attractive in order to arrest declining output, while still keeping a bar on majority foreign ownership of projects in the sector.

Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab and Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud continue in their posts.

36,2020/01/03,Catalan separatists to break Spain's political deadlock,"A Catalan separatist party said on Thursday it would abstain during the Spanish parliament's upcoming vote to confirm Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez as prime minister, potentially ending the prolonged national political deadlock.

Spain was without proper government for most of 2019 after two inconclusive elections and Sanchez's Socialist Party needs the pro-independence Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) to at least abstain to secure his confirmation in office.

The investiture vote is due between Jan. 4 and 7.

The ERC said it would refrain from voting after the Socialists committed to an open dialogue on secessionists' wishes for Catalonia, which would then be submitted to a citizens' vote in the wealthy northern region.

At a news conference, ERC official Pere Aragones also said his party told the leader of Catalonia's regional government it would push for a new independence referendum in conversations with central government.

Spain has struggled to maintain stable governments since 2015 when a slew of smaller parties sprung up in the wake of the financial crisis, leading to four elections in as many years.

To avoid forcing Spaniards to return to the polls, Sanchez has been scrambling to drum up support for a proposed coalition with left-wing party Unidas Podemos.

Sanchez and Podemos’s leader Pablo Iglesias said on Monday that their coalition, if confirmed, would push for tax hikes and a rollback of a labour reform by a previous conservative government.

The most recent election in November left the two parties with a combined 155 seats, short of a majority in Spain's 350-member lower house, and thrusting ERC and its 13 representatives into the role of kingmaker.

Sanchez's Socialist Party confirmed it had reached an agreement with the ERC for a dialogue over Catalonia, but did not mention their potential abstention at the investiture vote.

37,2020/01/03,Australian navy races to rescue thousands as new fire threat looms,"The Australian navy was racing on Friday to rescue thousands of people stranded on the east coast of the fire-ravaged country as a searing weather front was set to whip up more blazes across the states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW).

The premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, declared a state of disaster for the first time ever, giving authorities broad powers to compel people to leave their properties and take control of services.

Wildfires have already killed two in the state and 17 are missing with grave fears for their safety.

NSW also issued a state of emergency as tens of thousands of holidaymakers were urged to leave national parks and remote tourist areas.

The navy's HMAS Choules was set to evacuate “at first light” around 800 out of 4,000 people stranded on a beach in the isolated town of Mallaÿcoota in far-east Victoria, with women, children, the elderly and sick going first.

Yet with all roads blocked, sea transport is the only way out of the stricken town and each round trip could take a day or more. Forecasters are warning that temperatures will soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, bringing a return of wild winds.

“It is forecast we will see dry thunderstorms coming across the state and the potential of lightning strikes mid- to late afternoon,” Andrew Crisp, emergency management commissioner for Victoria, told ABC news.

He urged people in the area to leave their homes immediately and not count on luck to avoid disaster.

“This is your opportunity to get out. It is not just the fires we know. It is the new fires that might start today.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison had called for calm on Thursday, before visiting the fire-devastated NSW town of Cobargo where he was not entirely welcome.

Video showed Mr. Morrison confronted by a group of angry locals, one of whom shouted he should be “ashamed of himself” and said he had “left the country to burn”.

Speaking to ABC news, Mr. Morrison said he understood there were strong feelings. “They have lost everything and there are still some very dangerous days ahead,” he said.

Mr. Morrison's conservative government has long drawn criticism for not doing enough to address climate change as a cause of Australia's savage drought and fires.

38,2020/01/03,Children among 18 killed in Sudan military plane crash: army,"Four children were among 18 people killed on Thursday when a Sudanese military transport plane crashed after take off from West Darfur state, an army spokesman said, following recent unrest there.

The plane crashed five minutes after take off from an airport in the state capital El Geneina, after delivering aid to the area, which had been hit by recent deadly tribal fighting.

“An Antonov 12 military plane crashed Thursday night after take off from El Geneina killing its seven-member crew, three judges and eight civilians, including four children, who were onboard,” the spokesman Amer Mohammed Al-Hassan said.

He said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the crash.

Most of Sudan's military and civilian fleet consists of old Soviet-made aircraft, and the country has suffered a series of crashes in recent years, with the military frequently blaming technical problems and bad weather.

Earlier a military source said the plane had delivered aid to West Darfur which was rocked earlier this week by deadly tribal clashes.

At least 48 people have been killed and 241 wounded in that violence, according to Sudan's Red Crescent.

It said the armed clashes broke out on Sunday night in El Geneina, and continued until Monday between Arab and African groups, with several houses torched.

“This morning the situation is calm,” the Red Crescent said on Thursday.

It said the bodies of the 48 people killed were transferred to a morgue in El Geneina and that 19 of those wounded were in a critical condition and flown to Khartoum for treatment.

According to Sudanese media, the fighting erupted after a row between two people, but it was not immediately clear what sparked it.

A woman reached by phone on Tuesday said she had fled the Krinding camp for displaced Masalit people, a non-Arab ethnic group, near El Geneina after assailants torched tents there.

“Our tents were set on fire. We have no food and only the clothes on our back and there are bodies littering the ground,” she said.

Security deployed

The government also deployed troops to El Geneina to restore order.

Residents of the state capital on Thursday said security forces were patrolling main roads in the city, and confirmed that the fighting had subsided.

In January 2016, six people were killed in unrest in West Darfur following violence involving Masalit tribesmen and members of the Arab Beni Halba tribe.

Darfur — made up of five states — spiralled into conflict in 2003 when ethnic minority rebels took up arms against the Arab-dominated government of now ousted president Omar al-Bashir, whom they accused of marginalising the region.

The conflict left around 300,000 people dead and displaced 2.5 million others, the UN says.

Mr. Bashir, who is behind bars for corruption and awaiting trial on other charges domestically, is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in Darfur.

Sudan said on December 22 it had opened a probe into crimes committed in Darfur.

The latest fighting in Darfur sparked rallies in Khartoum, with protesters marching to the prime minister's office and the justice ministry carrying signs calling for an “end to massacres in the camps of the displaced”.

They also called on authorities to punish the culprits.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/children-among-18-killed-in-sudan-military-plane-crash-army/article30465284.ece
39,2020/01/03,U.S. defense secretary urges North Korea to negotiate on denuclearization,"U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Thursday said the United States still sees a political agreement on denuclearization as the best path forward on North Korea, but that American forces remained prepared to fight if necessary.

“We would urge restraint by Kim Jong Un,” Mr. Esper said in an interview on Fox News.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said this week that there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing and that a “new strategic weapon” would be introduced in the near future.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were no indications that North Korea was preparing for an imminent long-range missile test.

The official said the assessment after Kim's speech was that North Korea believes it does not have to rush to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, though shorter-range missile or engine tests could be possible at any time.

U.S. President Donald Trump — who in 2018 became the first American leader to meet with a North Korean leader — said after Kim's remarks that the North Korean leader had signed a denuclearization contract and Trump thought Kim was a “man of his word.”

Last month, Pyongyang warned Washington of a possible ”Christmas gift” after Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal.

Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said that the alert status of American forces was at a sufficient level to respond to anything that happens and military defensive capabilities were adequate to defend the United States.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g9glo7/article30465276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-IRAQ-UNREST-IRAN-ESPER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-defense-secretary-urges-north-korea-to-negotiate-on-denuclearization/article30465277.ece
40,2020/01/03,"Turkish parliament passes Libya deployment bill, but troops unlikely for now","Turkey's parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill that allows troops to be deployed in Libya, in a move that paves the way for further military cooperation between Ankara and Tripoli but is unlikely to put boots on the ground immediately.

President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).

The GNA last month requested Turkish support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces, which are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.

Fighting and air strikes continue around Tripoli, where the U.N. refugee agency said three mortars had fallen on Thursday close to an overcrowded transit centre housing around 1,000 migrants in the centre of the city.

Turkey's move comes after Ankara and the GNA signed two separate agreements in November: one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, infuriating Greece, Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.

Almost immediately after the vote, Egypt strongly condemned the parliament's decision, and called on the international community to urgently respond to the move.

The bill, opposed by all major opposition parties, passed with a 315-184 vote. Opposition parties said the move may exacerbate conflicts in Libya and endanger Turkish soldiers in the region and Turkey's national security.

But Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the bill was an important step for protecting Ankara's interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean, and for achieving peace and stability in Libya.

'DANGEROUS ESCALATION'

The GNA's interior minister Fathi Bashagha said Tripoli had requested Turkish support following a “dangerous escalation” in the conflict by Haftar's forces.

“As Libya's only legitimate and sovereign government, the GNA is the singular entity with the right to formalize military alliances necessary to safeguard our nation,” Bashagha said, adding that the GNA aimed to stop a “war criminal” from seizing power and establish stability, security and democracy in Libya.

Dmitry Novikov, a Russian lawmaker, said after the vote that a Turkish military presence in Libya would “only deteriorate the situation”, according to the Interfax news agency.

Later on Thursday, Erdogan discussed Libya with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call, the Turkish presidency said without providing more details. Erdogan is due to discuss Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report.

But analysts and some officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately deploy troops, sending military advisers and equipment first.

“The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.

'DETERRENT'

Last week, a senior Turkish official said Ankara could train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Turkey may also consider sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli.

On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a “deterrent” to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar's forces pulled back.

The maritime agreement between Ankara and Tripoli has ended Turkey's isolation in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is at odds with Greece over resources off Cyprus. Greece has said the accord violates international law, but Ankara rejects this, and says it only wants to protect its rights.

Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed a deal on Thursday to build a 1,900 km (1,180 mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe, but analysts say the accord between Turkey and Libya could present a barrier to the plans.

“Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,” said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f021a4/article30465258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TAYYIPERDOGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkish-parliament-passes-libya-deployment-bill-but-troops-unlikely-for-now/article30465259.ece
41,2020/01/03,Lebanon receives Interpol notice for ex-Nissan fugitive Carlos Ghosn,"Interpol issued a wanted notice Thursday for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who jumped bail in Japan and fled to Lebanon rather than face trial on financial misconduct charges in a dramatic escape that has confounded and embarrassed authorities.

Lebanese Justice Minister Albert Serhan told in an interview that Lebanon “will carry out its duties,” suggesting for the first time that the automotive titan may be brought in for questioning. But he said Mr. Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, and he appeared to cast doubt on the possibility Lebanon would hand Mr. Ghosn over to Japan.

The Interpol notice is the latest twist in Mr. Ghosn’s daring escape, which spanned three continents and involved private planes, multiple passports and international intrigue. Turkey made several arrests Thursday as part of an investigation into how he passed through the country.

Mr. Ghosn’s arrival in Lebanon jolted the nation, already in the midst of a crippling political impasse and its worst economic crisis in decades.

Lebanon must now decide how to deal with the Interpol-issued Red Notice, which is a non-binding request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive. A Red Notice is not an arrest warrant and does not require Lebanon to arrest Mr. Ghosn.

Shortly afterwards, Mr. Ghosn issued a statement - his second this week - seeking to distance his Lebanese wife and family from any role in his escape.

""The allegations in the media that my wife Carole and other members of my family played a role in my departure from Japan are false and misleading. I alone organized my departure. My family played no role,” he said.

Mr. Ghosn, who is Lebanese and also holds French and Brazilian passports, was set to go on trial in Japan in April. He arrived in Lebanon on Monday via Turkey and hasn’t been seen in public since. In a statement Tuesday, he said he fled to avoid “political persecution” by a “rigged Japanese justice system.”

Mr. Ghosn, who grew up in Beirut and frequently visited, is a national hero to many in this Mediterranean country with close ties to senior politicians and business stakes in a number of companies. People take special pride in the auto industry executive, who is credited with leading a spectacular turnaround at Nissan beginning in the late 1990s and rescuing the automaker from near-bankruptcy.

Even as he fell from grace internationally, politicians across the board mobilized in his defense after his arrest in Japan in November 2018, with some suggesting his detention may be part of a political or business-motivated conspiracy. Lebanon’s foreign minister repeatedly called for his release.

Mr. Serhan said prosecutors will summon Mr. Ghosn and listen to him, and “at a later stage if there are any measures to be taken, then the precautionary measures will be taken.”

""We are a country of law and respect the law and ... I can confirm that the Lebanese state will implement the law,” the justice minister said.

At the same time, Mr. Serhan said that Lebanon has not received an official extradition request from Japan, and he noted that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.

""Mr. Ghosn arrived to Lebanon as any ordinary citizen. ... Lebanese authorities have no security or judiciary charges against him. He entered the border like any other Lebanese using a legal passport,” he added.

There were mixed reactions in Lebanon to Mr. Ghosn’s return, with some cheering his freedom and others lamenting his arrival as yet another ‘’corrupt” Lebanese to contend with.

""I like this man. He has a brain and he developed Nissan and Renault from the ground up. He came back to his mother country which embraced him,” said Ghassan al-Baba, a 52-year-old taxi driver and former employee of General Motors in Kuwait.

""He is a part of the corrupt, but the corrupt from the outside. Here, he didn’t do anything wrong. On the contrary, he is going to bring money to Lebanon,” he said, reflecting a longstanding Lebanese hope that Ghosn would one day help rescue Lebanon’s failing economy.

Sadiq Taher, a 42-year-old contractor among anti-government protesters who have been demonstrating against corrupt Lebanese politicians for weeks, said Mr. Ghosn is crooked on a global level and Lebanon does not need more “financial whales.”

In Turkey, the state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish authorities detained seven people as part of an investigation into how Mr. Ghosn fled to Lebanon via Istanbul. The private DHA news agency reported that those detained are four pilots, a cargo company manager and two airport workers.

Meanwhile, prosecutors in Japan raided Mr. Ghosn’s Tokyo home.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV, without identifying sources, reported Thursday that Mr. Ghosn had two French passports.

Japanese news reports said that there were no official records in Japan of Mr. Ghosn’s departure but that a private jet had left from a regional airport to Turkey. The Hurriyet newspaper said the plane carrying Mr. Ghosn landed at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport at 5-30 a.m. on Dec. 29. Mr. Ghosn was not registered upon landing and was smuggled onto another plane that left for Lebanon, the paper reported.

Mr. Ghosn, who is charged in Japan with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust, has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up charges to prevent a possible fuller merger between Nissan Motor Co. and Renault.

In another twist, two Lebanese lawyers submitted a report to the Public Prosecutor’s Office against Mr. Ghosn on Thursday, saying he violated Lebanese law by visiting Israel. ‘The two countries are in a state of war. Mr. Ghosn visited Israel in 2008 and met officials including the prime minister and the president. At the time he announced the launch of electric cars in Israel.

In Beirut’s affluent residential neighborhood of Ashrafieh, several security guards stood outside Mr. Ghosn’s rose-colored mansion on Thursday along with about two dozen journalists. Since news of his arrival, journalists, including many from the Japanese media, have flocked outside the building, trying to capture any proof of his presence.

At one point, a Lebanese lawyer who said he worked for Nissan appeared, claiming the building belonged to the auto company, not to Mr. Ghosn.

One of Mr. Ghosn’s neighbors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they are “split as to whether they are with or against his return.”

""It sounds like his escape could be the new Netflix show,” his wife joked.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9ltq0b/article30465235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-JAPAN-FRANCE-GHOSN-NISSAN-RENAULT-AUTOMOBILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-receives-interpol-notice-for-ex-nissan-fugitive-carlos-ghosn/article30465236.ece
42,2020/01/03,Trump tells Erdogan foreign interference complicating Libya,"U.S. President Donald Trump told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call on Thursday that outsiders were complicating the situation in Libya, the White House said.

It was not clear which countries or entities Mr. Trump was referring to, and a White House statement offered no other details.

Ankara passed a Bill allowing troop deployment to Tripoli that paves the way for Turkey-Libya military cooperation.

Although the deployment is not imminent, Mr. Erdogan has said troops would support Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord, which is fending off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces that are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan “stressed the importance of diplomacy in resolving regional issues,” the Turkish presidency said in a statement about the call, adding that they also discussed Syria.

At least eight people were killed on Wednesday when the Syrian army launched missiles that struck a shelter for displaced families in Idlib province, witnesses and residents said.

43,2020/01/03,"Trump administration clamps down on e-cigarette flavors, except menthol","The Trump administration on Thursday announced a ban on some popular e-cigarette flavors, including fruit and mint, to curb rising teenage use of vaping products, allowing only menthol and tobacco flavours to remain on the market.

The flavour ban applies to e-cigarettes, which use disposable cartridges filled with liquid nicotine and are often sold in convenience stores.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said companies that do not stop the manufacture, distribution and sale of flavoured cartridge-based e-cigarettes, other than tobacco or menthol, within 30 days risk enforcement actions from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Thursday's announcement would have no impact on Juul, which has already pulled flavours except tobacco and menthol. It would force competitors still offering a wider variety of flavours, including Njoy and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, which makes Vuse e-cigarettes, to restrict their offerings.

“The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.

“HHS is taking a comprehensive, aggressive approach to enforcing the law passed by Congress, under which no e-cigarettes are currently on the market legally,” Mr. Azar added.

The HHS said manufacturers that want to market flavoured e-cigarettes or e-liquids will need to submit an application to the FDA that demonstrates the product meets applicable standards.

The move comes as U.S. health regulators investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping that has caused 55 deaths and more than 2,500 hospitalizations as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The deaths have raised fears surrounding vaping's safety, but the outbreak of such cases appears to be waning.

45,2020/01/03,Top Israeli court ‘unable to rule’ on PM’s eligibility to form govt.,"Israel’s Supreme Court on Thursday refused to rule on a request by lawyers seeking to prevent indicted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a government after looming elections.

The lawyers took their case to Israel’s highest court on Tuesday, arguing that Mr. Netanyahu’s indictment in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust should prevent him from being mandated by the president to form a government.

But the court on Thursday said it was unable to rule on the sensitive case, saying the lawyers’ request was “premature”.

Israel faces a third general election in less than a year on March 2, after national polls in April and September failed to yield a governing coalition.

Mr. Netanyahu’s right wing Likud party was deadlocked with centrist Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party in both the 2019 elections.

Reacting to the court’s decision, Ms. Gantz said on Twitter “Netanyahu will be judged by the public at the polls, and we will win”.

Israeli law stipulates that a sitting prime minister is only required to step down once convicted and after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted.

But it does not provide immunity from prosecution.

Mr. Netanyahu on Wednesday asked parliament for immunity.

The request is “in line with the law... (and) with the goal of continuing to serve you, for the future of Israel,” the premier said.

That request is expected to delay the start of court proceedings for months, as lawmakers are not due to vote on the matter until after the general election.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uaqxjk/article30464426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAEL-POLITICS-NETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/top-israeli-court-unable-to-rule-on-pms-eligibility-to-form-govt/article30464427.ece
46,2020/01/03,U.S. sees signs Iran or allies may be planning more attacks: Pentagon chief,"U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Thursday there were indications Iran or forces it backs may be planning additional attacks, warning that the “game has changed” and it was possible the United States might have to take preemptive action to protect American lives.

“There are some indications out there that they may be planning additional attacks, that is nothing new ... we've seen this for two or three months now,” Mr. Esper told reporters.

“If that happens then we will act and by the way, if we get word of attacks or some type indication, we will take preemptive action as well to protect American forces to protect American lives.”

Iranian-backed demonstrators who hurled rocks at the U.S. embassy in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war.

The unrest outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad followed U.S. air raids on Sunday against bases of the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group. Washington said the air strikes, which killed 25 people, were in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.

The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East.

“The game has changed and we are prepared to do what is necessary to defend our personnel and our interests and our partners in the region,” Mr. Esper said.

During the same press briefing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said there had been a sustained campaign by Kataib Hezbollah against U.S. personnel since at least October and the missile attack in northern Iraq was designed to kill.

“Thirty-one rockets aren't designed as a warning shot, that is designed to inflict damage and kill,” Mr. Milley said.

He said that it was highly unlikely anyone could overrun the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and if they did, they would run into a ”buzzsaw.”

The United States sent 750 troops to Kuwait earlier this week and U.S. officials have told Reuters that about 3,000 additional troops could be sent to the region in the coming days.

Mr. Milley said additional troops had been alerted but a decision had not yet been on deploying them. Since May, the United States has dispatched about 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.

In his 2016 campaign, Trump promised to extract the United States from “endless wars.”

IRAN-BACKED FORCES

In a statement, Mr. Esper said the demonstrations outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad were carried out by Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia, saying leaders were seen in the crowd and some members showed up wearing their uniforms.

He said the series of rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq were being directed by the “Iranian regime” and specifically Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leadership.

The Iraqi government has attempted to integrate paramilitary organizations into it's armed forces.

Mr. Esper said he had not seen the Iraqi government take sufficient action on stopping Iran-backed groups from carrying out attacks on U.S. forces and Baghdad needs to double down on efforts to bring the groups under their control.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f30oqq/article30464291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-IRAQ-UNREST-IRAN-ESPER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-sees-signs-iran-or-allies-may-be-planning-more-attacks-pentagon-chief/article30464292.ece
47,2020/01/03,"Happy New Year for Sanders, Trump in fundraising hauls","Bernie Sanders raised more than $34.5 million in the last quarter of 2019, the largest three-month haul for a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, while Republican President Donald Trump drew $46 million on the heels of his impeachment, their campaigns said on Thursday.

The new figures brought Mr. Sanders' total campaign fundraising last year to $96 million, making him the leading fundraiser so far among 14 Democrats vying to face Mr. Trump in November's presidential election. States begin choosing candidates next month with the Iowa Caucuses on Feb. 3.

Mr. Trump, a polarizing president popular with a large majority of Republicans but vilified by many Democrats, maintained his formidable fundraising edge over Democrats with a surge of donations following his impeachment last month by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.

“Democrats and the media have been in a sham impeachment frenzy and the president's campaign only got bigger and stronger with our best fundraising quarter this cycle,” his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said in a statement.

The Trump campaign's latest quarter eclipsed a third-quarter fundraising haul of nearly $41 million. It begins the 2020 re-election year with cash on hand of $102.7 million, his campaign said, an amount that will help his bid to compete in states beyond those that carried him to a surprise victory in 2016.

Some Democrats have not yet disclosed their fourth-quarter fundraising numbers, but those who did had strong showings. Pete Buttigieg raised $24.7 million in the fourth quarter, a hefty total expected to land him among the top fundraisers in the Democratic field. Businessman Andrew Yang raised $16.5 million, well over the nearly $10 million he took in previous quarter.

The other candidates leading the pack of Democrats, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, have not released their latest figures.

Ms. Warren's campaign told supporters last week it needed more donations to meet its $20 million goal for the quarter. Mr. Biden's fundraising lagged behind those of his main rivals in the last quarter.

Mr. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who wants to reduce the sway of corporate America and economic inequality, has built his campaign on small donations, largely through online fundraising from an ethnically diverse, mostly young coalition of supporters.

Campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Mr. Sanders' “grassroots movement” showed he was the best placed candidate to defeat Mr. Trump.

“He is proving each and every day that working class Americans are ready and willing to fully fund a campaign that stands up for them and takes on the biggest corporations and the wealthy,” Mr. Shakir said in a statement.

Mr. Sanders, 78, bounced back from a heart attack in early October to win growing support for his platform of expanding government-run healthcare, making college free, and investment in renewable energy paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy.

Two billionaires in the Democratic race, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, are relying on their own money to fund their campaigns but have not released latest funding figures.

Mr. Bloomberg has spent more than $76 million on television ads since Nov. 16, while Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have spent a combined $13.2 million all year, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project citing Kantar/CMAG political ad data.

The New York media mogul, who only entered the race in November, has outspent Mr. Steyer, who has put more than $72 million into TV ads this year.

Mr. Bloomberg has risen to fourth place in the Democratic race with the support of about 5% of Democratic-leaning voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Dec. 18-19, while Mr. Steyer has just garnered 2% support.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lt8rbf/article30464247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-PRESIDENTIAL-CANDIDATE-BERNIE-SANDERS-HOLDS-NEW-YEARS-EVE-CA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/happy-new-year-for-sanders-trump-in-fundraising-hauls/article30464248.ece
48,2020/01/03,"999 Bangladeshis were in India illegally, says Border Guards Bangladesh head","Nearly 1,000 Bangladesh nationals were detained in Bangladesh in 2019 for living in India “illegally”, and the Bangladesh government has initiated legal proceedings against them, Major-General Shafeenul Islam, Director-General of Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), said in Dhaka on Thursday.

This is the first time in recent decades that Bangladesh has made public the number of its citizens who had lived “illegally” in India.

The announcement came following the talks between the Directors-General of the Border Security Force (BSF) and Border Guards Bangladesh in New Delhi from December 25 to 30, 2019.

Nine hundred and ninety-nine Bangladesh nationals — 135 children, 258 women and 606 men — were detained, Major-General Islam said at a press conference. And 312 of them were arrested in November and 133 in December. Officials said they were arrested on the border, while going to India or returning home. Their identities were ascertained and legal proceedings initiated “as per law for illegally entering and staying” in another country. Those arrested were either kept in custody or freed on bail.

Dhaka’s assurance

A couple of weeks ago, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s foreign policy adviser Gowher Rizvi said in Kolkata that Bangladesh would take its citizens back if they were illegally staying in India. “But it has to be proved that the person is a Bangladesh citizen,” he had said.

Bangladesh also submitted a list of 96 Indians “illegally” staying in Bangladesh. Of them, 62 were handed over to the Border Security Force (BSF) and the rest were detained. Legal proceedings were opened against them. At least 35 Bangladesh nationals have been killed in border firing, Major-General Islam said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bp85mt/article30464178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shafeenul,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/999-bangladeshis-were-in-india-illegally-says-border-guards-bangladesh-head/article30464179.ece
49,2020/01/03,How ‘Inside Edge’ manages to hit the 'so-bad-it’s-good' sweet spot,"I have always had a soft spot for a good hate-watch. For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, it’s when you find a show so incompetent, so utterly devoid of substance that you can’t look away. For an earlier generation, this category of films and shows were often called so-bad-it’s-good (the Mithun Chakraborty film Gunda (1998) being the lodestar of the genre). The current wave of ‘cringepop’ stars like Dhinchak Pooja and Taher Shah can run because Gunda walked.

For the first time in many years, I believe, there’s finally another Indian show that has what it takes to be so-bad-it’s-good — Amazon Prime Video’s Inside Edge, the second season of which was released recently. Quite simply, Inside Edge (created by Karan Anshuman) is a show about the Indian Premier League (IPL), fictionalised here as the Power Play League (PPL).

Or to be honest, there are two shows (belonging to very different genres) wrapped up in one here. One mode is the snappily edited sports movie. Inside Edge is decent without being spectacular on this front. Scenes with cricketing action were technically better than I expected them to be.

It’s the other mode, however, that Inside Edge truly belongs to. This is its rendition of IPL’s infamous corruption scandal, with Bollywood stars, politicians and scheming team owners. Richa Chadha plays a slightly over-the-hill Bollywood star who’s also co-owner of the (fictional) Mumbai Mavericks. Vivek Oberoi gleefully hams it up as the sinister corporate super-villain of the pack.

Addictive melodrama

Gully Boy newbie Siddhant Chaturvedi plays a Dalit cricketer from Mirzapur, while Amit Sial plays his casteist senior teammate. Angad Bedi and Tanuj Virwani play sparring cricketers, while Sayoni Gupta plays a super-smart analyst (who also happens to be the younger sister of Virwani’s character).

The show aspires to Shonda Rhimes-ian levels of addictive melodrama and pure, breathless, incoherent thrills. The incoherent bit is important because with a typical contemporary Rhimes product, like How to Get Away with Murder, even devoted fans find it difficult to remember plot details a week after. In many ways, the Viola Davis-starrer is a show designed for the binge-watch, packed with just enough sex and intrigue to keep realist concerns at bay.

That is how it is with Inside Edge, too — nothing is muted or subtle or under the surface here. Villains declaim their nefarious schemes for the benefit of everybody in earshot. Heroes declare their imminent triumphs for the audience’s benefit. Oberoi has an asphyxiation fetish and likes to tie unsuspecting female guests to the edge of his penthouse roof. Chadha has formidable screen presence as always, but is hamstrung in the first season by some unintentionally hilarious screenwriting. The sound mixing is so bad in a scene featuring Chadha and Karan Oberoi that you can barely decipher what they’re saying.

And yet, somehow, Inside Edge hits that so-bad-it’s-good sweet spot. I’d be lying if I claimed I knew exactly how. Figuring out parallels between real-life figures and the characters they have inspired — definitely entertaining, but that’s not it. Could it be the way Oberoi enunciates each and every one of his dialogues the exact same way, like he’s mentally undressing everybody on set? Could it be the way Chadha goes to town on his silly head, demonstrating a most promising bat-swing? Or maybe it’s the over-the-top, anachronistic alpha maleness of Virwani’s character, which is so 1980s he could have been playing alongside Kapil Dev and Gavaskar.

Whatever the case, the truth is that I inhaled all of Inside Edge’s second season in one night. And very soon, I’ll need to read my own article to recall just what I saw.

50,2020/01/03,Lessons from life at Warhorse Learning Festival,"Sidhaanth Dharmadheeran feels quite strongly about the fact that our innate curiosity wanes when we complete our formal education. “We want people to fall back in love with learning,” says the co-founder and CEO of city-based educational enterprise, Warhorse. What started over a year ago as ‘secret experiences’ in the form of Stable Talks (where people could sign up for a session without knowing what was going to be discussed) led to a larger format event, the Warhorse Learning Festival.

“We had a lot of success with the mystery topics. Since they did not know who the speaker was going to be or what was being covered, they came with the sheer intent to learn something new. We have had people from ages 16 to 60+,” says Dharmadheeran, on the inspiration to curate such an event. With the festival, however, most of the speakers and panellists are revealed earlier. “We do have one mystery speaker, but I can tell you that the topic will be on advocacy and the kind of political atmosphere in the country now,” he says.

For the people

The second edition, which is set to take place this weekend, will have sessions on topics as varied as mental hygiene (by trainer and author Vidya Ragu) and branding (by Ratheesh Krishnan, Head of Experiments & New Ventures at SPI Cinemas). There will be sessions on world history, pop philosophy, game design and movement therapy, too, as well as a discussion on films with film critic Baradwaj Rangan and Kishor of the Moving Images YouTube channel.

Subjects like fashion and sustainability are also on the cards, in a discussion between city-based designer Sanah Sharma and sustainable fashion blogger Varsha Mohan (@moderas.in on Instagram). “Sanah has developed some construction methodologies that are focused on zero-waste and using resources frugally. There will also be a broader discussion about producing and consuming sustainably,” says Mohan, adding that people need to look at sustainably-made (hence more expensive) garments as an investment, and inculcate the mindset to buy less and wear more.

Comic Jagan Krishnan, who is conducting a “sort of workshop” on stand-up comedy, will discuss why people laugh. It is meant to be relevant to both the audience and his fellow comics, he says. He will also answer questions like why they tell the same jokes at live shows — unlike the marvellous Mrs Maisel, in real life, it takes close to a year to write an hour-long set. “Also, there is this misconception that we are always funny. This is 200% not true,” he says.

While all the topics might not be interesting to all, Dharmadheeran says, “The hope is that people will come in for what they are interested in, and stay to learn more.”

The Warhorse Learning Festival takes place on January 4 and 5, from 11 am to 8.30 pm, at The ARTery, Balaji Nagar, Royapettah.

51,2020/01/03,Government doing exact opposite of what’s needed to revive economy: Jayati Ghosh,"Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi, is one of the world’s leading development economists. A fierce critic of the near-universal obsession with ‘fiscal discipline’, Ghosh believes that India cannot revive its economy without increasing public spending. In an exclusive chat with the Magazine, she spoke about, among other things, the looming global recession, the situation at JNU, and what’s in store for the next generation of Indians. Edited excerpts:

Tell us something about your childhood.

I was born in Bangkok. My father, an economist who worked for the government, was posted there for a few months. My mother was expecting, but she went along with him. But they came back to Delhi, which is where I grew up, for the most part.

What about college?

I went to Miranda House, where I did sociology. I was interested in understanding social processes. But the more I did sociology, the more I realised that it’s just the surface, that it is the economy that’s really shaping social processes. So I decided to study economics. I had to learn mathematics over the summer holidays. The entrance exam at JNU at the time was such that you didn’t need an earlier degree in economics to enrol in an MA course there.

After the M.A.?

After my MA in economics from JNU, I did my Ph.D. from Cambridge. I stayed on in Cambridge as a research fellow for a couple of years, working on issues of external debt in developing countries. Then I realised that I couldn’t stay in England. It’s wonderful when you are a student — it’s international, there are lots of students from all over the world, and you are a community. It’s when you start working that you realise that this is not where you should be. So I came back, and worked briefly with the Planning Commission before I got this dream job at JNU.

You’ve been at JNU a long time. How would you describe what’s happening to it today?

JNU is one of the best universities not just in India or Asia but possibly the world. It has an amazing combination of good faculty, bright students, and diverse students. This is a very special characteristic because it isn’t just geographical diversity or gender diversity but also caste, class and ethnicity, and the OBC reservations have made it even more diverse. Such an institution, especially in the social sciences, gives you a much greater richness of conversation in the classroom and outside.

I’ve seen that many of the students, when they come in, are reticent. They don’t participate in discussions. Once they’ve been here two-three years, they become totally confident and articulate. A whole lot of awakening, not just political but also social, happens, and an institution that does this is very special. But this is precisely what is being sought to be destroyed now. The recent move to increase fees would force nearly half the students to leave. It would not only be a terrible blow to their prospects and those of other less well-off students in the future, but also damage the diversity that makes for much better scholarship.

International agencies have predicted a global recession in 2020. Will India be badly affected, or somewhat insulated?

The prognostication of a global recession is something I share. Unless something radical is done, and I don’t see that happening, we are on the verge of a significant crisis. We are already seeing all kinds of skittishness in global financial markets, and there is a downslide in investment everywhere. Well before the global slowdown, we had several internal problems: falling investment rates, falling employment, falling consumption — all bad indicators domestically. Now you add to that worsening exports and capital moving out, and not just foreign capital. We now have data showing that domestic residents are sending huge amounts of money abroad, thanks to the liberalised remittance scheme. In the latest quarter, it was 20% of inward remittances.

There’s been so much debate on whether the slowdown is cyclical or structural. What’s your take?

This is a foolish debate. ‘Cyclical’ would mean that growth will go up, and then down, and then up again. But it is not automatic. If it goes down, and nothing happens to make it go up again, it will stay down! Then will you call it cyclical or structural? These terms are being misused. What’s happening is that we are going through a downswing, and this downswing is reflecting a lack of demand in the system. Workers don’t have jobs. Farmers don’t have income. So they can’t buy. So eventually even the formal sector is hit.

What would you suggest to resolve the demand problem?

The government has to step in and create demand — this is basic economics! Increase your MGNREGA, spend more on infrastructure, put more income in the hands of farmers. They will buy more. They will spend the money. That will have a positive multiplier effect — it will generate more income, more production, more employment, more investment, and all that. But for some reason, the government is doing the opposite. Not only is it not spending more – it is spending less.

It has to be mindful of its fiscal deficit target, right?

This whole fiscal deficit business — first of all, it’s a big lie. It’s much larger than they claim it is. The government doesn’t pay the public sector enterprises. Take the Food Corporation of India (FCI), for instance. Every year, the FCI is supposed to get a subsidy to cover its losses. Suppose they don’t give it enough, and then they can’t cover their losses, how do they manage? They take on debt. So, every year, for the last 11 years — P. Chidambaram started it — the FCI was not being paid its dues. So it takes on debt, on which it has to pay interest. But this is off the central government budget. The CAG [Comptroller and Auditor General] has calculated that if you added allthis other spending that the government has done, then your fiscal deficit is close to 5%, not the 3.3% or whatever it is that they are claiming.

The claims may be untrue. But what’s wrong in maintaining fiscal discipline?

Why are we so terrified of a fiscal deficit? Because people think it will create inflation or a balance of payments crisis, or both, right? Now, clearly, it has not created inflation, because the fiscal deficit is much larger than they claim it is, and it hasn’t been inflationary. In any case, 3.3% is not some gold standard that you have to meet. The balance of payments deficit is happening for other reasons — because our exports are a disaster; not because our imports have shot up. So the reasons why you would be scared of a fiscal deficit don’t exist. In a downswing, when you have unemployment, when you have unutilised capacity, if you spend more, it is not inflationary. Rather, it increases economic activity. So I don’t know why they are unable to do this.

Is it to do with the bond markets?

The bond market is why they lie about the actual fiscal deficit too. But if you want to do that, you can still do that – you can keep on lying, and also create special purpose vehicles that will do public investments for you. You don’t have to do it yourself. You got a windfall from the RBI — spend the money! Increase public services — it would generate employment. But no, what do you do instead? You give tax breaks to big corporates.

Many people have said that the tax breaks will boost investor sentiment, and thus help attract FDI, helping India use the opportunities created by the US-China trade war.

Why does a company go into a country? It’s because they anticipate profits. Now, if you are otherwise not competitive — if you have terrible infrastructure, your ports are clogged, your electricity doesn’t work half the time and you therefore need expensive power backup, your workers are not trained in the way we want and are not fed properly or housed properly, as a result of which their productivity is not great — why would they come here? In other words, taxes are one of the factors. But a number of studies have shown that taxes are like no. 17 on the list of factors that firms consider when deciding where to invest.

So when companies say they invest in, say, Ireland, for tax purposes, that is just an office with ten people in it. It is not real investment. The opportunities created by the US-China trade war have already been grabbed by the likes of Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia. Some FDI from US companies has already moved there. It didn’t come to India — why? Because we are bad at all the other stuff. And how do you fix the other stuff? With public investment.

As an economist, how do you differentiate between ‘good’ GDP growth, due to greater production of goods and services such as food and hospitals, from ‘bad’ GDP growth, coming from, say, production of weapons, and construction of detention centres for non-citizens?

We don’t. That’s why it is so foolish to be obsessing about the GDP — whether its growing at 5.2% or 7.1% or whatever. It is meaningless in terms of the welfare of the people, even purely material welfare. You identified an example of bad GDP. Let us take the example of Delhi. We have a terrible, polluting, congested, unliveable system of privatised transport, with too many cars. Instead, if we had instituted a clean, green, ecologically efficient public transport system that was free, it would bring down GDP significantly, but would offer a much better quality of life for everybody. GDP is a bad indicator. Economists have known this for a while.

If that is so, then what’s the alternative?

I feel we should have an index that is relatively simple and is based on the material standards of the bottom half of the population. I’d say, let’s just look at the consumption standards of the bottom 50%. I want that to go up by 5% a year — that would be a decent goal.

The world over we are looking at interest rates close to zero, if not negative interest rates. Even the RBI has been steadily cutting rates. What does this mean for a common man?

It’s terrible news for the common man because it really means that if you’re planning to save for your post-retirement income, you are going to be a loser — big time. Negative interest rates are a way of attacking the working class over time, as opposed to today. The reason we are stuck with very low or negative interest rates is because governments the world over refuse to use fiscal policy.

How is that?

After the global financial crisis in 2008, the West went in for very low interest rates. They think if they have very low interest rates, somehow investments will come. Investors are looking at the difference between the rate of profit and the rate of interest that they have to pay, right? If the rate of expected profit is coming down, then the only way that you will invest is if you keep the rate of interest even lower. Anyway, that’s the argument behind low interest rates. But if at the same time you had also adopted a fiscal policy — by which I mean public spending — you would have created economic activity. You would have created demand, and you would have actually survived even with higher interest rates because expected profits would be higher. So it is the neo-liberal straitjacket — this mindset that you just cannot do fiscal policy — that is keeping interest rates low. There is this blind obsession that we can only do monetary policy — put lots of money in the system, keep interest rates low, and hope that things will recover. The logical culmination of this approach is negative interest rates, but that’s not a solution.

What happens to the idea of saving when there is a very low or negative interest rate, because then your savings wither away, right?

Yep. The very fact that this policy can become mainstream is a comment on how all economic analyses in our media are so heavily biased in favour of the upper class. Because who would really like negative interest rates? Finance-walas. They use the money to play around with all these other things that they make us invest in.

What other things?

Increasingly, people are being pushed away from bank deposits. They are being told, why don’t you put your money in a mutual fund? Put it in an investment programme that will generate money over time! It’s a combination of debt assets and equity assets and all kinds of fancy things that you won’t understand. You will get monthly statements that are so incomprehensible you won’t even know if you are losing money. And if you do make money, much of it will be taken away by brokers as commissions and fees.

Given the rise of automation in a big way, is job creation as a policy goal even feasible anymore? Since we don’t need so much labour, should we then think of an alternative policy approach?

Such as UBI?

Such as UBI.

Look, there was a time when we used runners to send information across. Now we just send an email or make a phone call. Throughout history, technology has displaced labour. It’s just that new activities are created. The problem today, the misfortune globally, is that the fourth industrial revolution is happening at the time of neo-liberalism, where this whole obsession with austerity means the government does not intervene to create jobs, and therefore we leave it to the market to create jobs. The market always goes for the most profitable, and the most profitable have always been the businesses with the least labour involved. This is not new — it is much better to hire a machine because they don’t talk back at you, they don’t ask for higher wages, they don’t combine and form a union. Technological progress doesn’t necessarily mean an aggregate jobs fall, because it all depends on whether there is enough spending to create demand for labour-intensive activities.

You want the state to keep coming up with new labour-intensive activities?

The economist Wiliam Baumol has pointed out that there is a whole bunch of service sector activities where there is no concept of labour productivity increase. For instance, you need exactly the same number of people to play a Beethoven symphony. You can’t say I am going to be more productive and do it with half the number of musicians. Similarly, there are several other service sector activities that are fundamentally relational. Care activcities need a human being. The human being can be assisted by machines, but you need the human being. So if you need less and less human beings to do the boring work, I would say that is wonderful, because, in an ideal society, you could have a much shorter working day, and everybody could have much more time for creative activities, care activities, relational activities and entertainment — all of these are hugely employment-intensive. If you go to a restaurant, it’s better to have more waiters than less. In a hospital, it’s better to have more nurses than less. It’s better to have more artists, performers, and musicians than less. It’s because we have progressively lost our imagination that we think we can only do the boring office work and now machines can do our boring office work. We have been so ground down by neo-liberal capitalism that we can’t even think beyond this.

Why is it that even in Europe, where unions have traditionally been powerful, they are unable to challenge austerity? Do they in fact see some merit in austerity?

I wouldn’t say they see any merit in austerity measures, I think we underestimate the lethal combination of finance and lobbying power, and their ability to control politics. We can see this in our own country. There are too many cases of turkeys voting for Christmas. People keep voting for things that are actually against their best interests. Also, the media keeps presenting things relentlessly in a certain way. This whole idea that public spending is bad but tax cuts are good — there is no rationale there, but the media onslaught is relentless, and the media is controlled by the corporations. We cannot underestimate their ability to influence public discussions and debate — either in the global North or in countries like India.

Is there a schism in India between manufacturing capital and finance capital? Are they at loggerheads over what they want from government policy?

About 15 years ago, I would have said yes. But today, all the smart ones in manufacturing have created a finance company as well. They have diversified into other things. The distinction today is between large capital and small/medium investment. Small and medium, first of all, cannot diversify. They are just trying to make a living out of making a particular thing, and they’ve really been messed around with. Large capital can play around, can diversify, can lobby, can influence policy, influence media, and pretty much get what it wants. But it’s the small and medium who are the main job-creators, and this is the big divide at the moment.

Describe the Modi government’s policy orientation in one line?

Extreme crony capitalism.

But you can be very friendly to certain crony capitalists, and also do a lot for small and medium enterprises. Isn’t the government doing that?

Not at all. There is a lot of PR, such as Mudra loans, for instance. They are a good idea, but when you look at the actual loan amounts, they are pathetic — most of them are in the under ₹50,000 category. What can you do with ₹50,000? As for medium enterprises, they were smacked by demonetisation, they were smacked by GST, and now they are being smacked by tax inspectors. They are facing an extremely adverse environment; and that too in a scenario of declining demand. So I would say this government is the opposite of small-investor-friendly.

What do you think life is going to be like for the next generation of Indians?

I worry about this a lot, because I have a daughter who is just beginning her life. I think we are headed for a demographic disaster.

But everyone keeps talking about a demographic dividend.

Demographic dividend refers to a scenario when you have lots of people of working age. But what do you call it when you have lots of people of working age and no jobs? That’s why it’s a disaster. Because you then get a massive increase in social and political instability. You may paper over it, or even make it work for you politically for a while, by diverting them into loving cows, loving Mother India, lynching people, and all that. You can do this for a while, but eventually you lose control of it. So we could be heading towards very serious anarchy. There could be a general breakdown of civic order. The more you try to unify a country like India through a very top-down kind of structure, the more the chances of a breakdown. This is my pessimistic vision.

And your optimistic one?

My teacher Joan Robinson used to say, anything you say about India, the opposite is also true. Every time I feel depressed about India, I also remember that we have amazing resilience. Amazing courage, not just individual but community courage. I have, or I used to have, this faith that Indian society, being so complex, doesn’t go for extremes easily. I don’t think that there is any such thing as one ‘Indian’ who is tolerant and secular and all that. But the extraordinary multiplicity among Indians is irrepressible. This absence of homogeneity is something that you cannot do away with easily, and that is a massive strength.

I see two pianos here. You play?

Yes, I used to. The older one [piano] has died. So I bought the other one recently.

How did you get interested in the piano?

I started playing the piano when we were in the U.S. My father was a great lover of Western classical music. He decided that we should learn an instrument. So my sister was put on the piano, and I was put on the violin. One day he discovered that one of the best violin teachers in Washington, D.C. — he used to train people for the Washington Symphony Orchestra and so on — lived nearby. He went to him and said “You have to teach my daughter.” The violin master replied that he only taught advanced students. And naturally, my loving father said, “Yes, yes, my daughter is very advanced.” So I went along, I was seven years old. I was a disaster. And the poor man, he had said he would take me on, so he had to. One day he got so fed up with how terribly I was playing that he grabbed the violin and hit me on the head with it. His building was across the road from our home. So I walked back, crying. I arrive home, my father opens the door, and sees me standing there, violin in hand, bawling. He asked what had happened. I said the teacher had hit me on the head with the violin. My father, unfazed, said, “Never mind, we’ll find you an instrument you can’t be attacked with.” That’s how I got to learn the piano.

53,2020/01/03,Ratan Tata moves SC against NCLAT verdict to reinstate Mistry,"Chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Private Limited, Ratan N. Tata, moved the Supreme Court on Friday against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) judgment restoring Cyrus Mistry as its chairman, saying the verdict had virtually pulled down the governance and corporate structure painstakingly built by the founders of the Indian multinational conglomerate.

Tata Sons has already moved the apex court against the NCLAT’s decision of December 18.

Mr. Tata said the NCLAT judgment banked on specious arguments to find him ‘guilty’ of acting in an ‘oppressive and prejudicial’ manner against the interests of shareholders. Mr. Tata said he had spent more than half of his life in building the name of Tata Sons and other Tata operating companies to one of the top global companies. He said the judgment claimed ‘over 550 emails’ were exchanged between Mr. Mistry and him to demonstrate the scale of interference from the latter’s side.

Mr. Tata said there were ‘no such 550 mails in the first place’. It was rather ‘remarkable and strange’ that an exchange of ideas, views, etc, between him and Mr. Mistry could be treated as conclusive evidence of unsolicited interference, Mr. Tata said.

“What is even more remarkable is that the whole case of oppression and prejudice is based entirely on words and statements contained in correspondence without there being an iota of evidence to buttress any actual loss/injury being caused to Tata Sons as a result of Mr. Cyrus Mistry being forced to act on such interference/interdiction against his wishes,” Mr. Tata contended.

He said the NCLAT, through its contrived and self-serving reading of the correspondence, concluded that he was ‘determined’ to remove Mr. Mistry. The tribunal accused him of engineering the coup to oust Mr. Mistry. The petition said the judgment, with no evidence to back it, castigated him and N.A. Soonawala (former trustee of Tata Trusts) and Nitin Nohria, a Trusts Nominated Director, for ‘unfair abuse of powers’.

Reluctance to disassociate

In fact, the appeal said, the “various fronts where Mr. Cyrus Mistry’s leadership was lacking was his reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the Chairman of Tata Sons and address any conflict in this regard, which was a condition precedent to his appointment as Chairman of Tata Sons”.

Mr. Tata said Mr. Mistry’s handling of the DoCoMo dispute was a “glaring example” of the lack of leadership skills. It was during Mr. Mistry’s tenure that Tata Sons reneged on its word with DoCoMo. He showed “complete obstinacy” to comply with legal obligations even in the face of an adverse verdict by arbitration.

“This is not what the Tata Sons brand stands for. Quite to the contrary, honouring its commitments is one of Tata Sons’ highest virtues it takes great pride in. The spat with DoCoMo, which was widely covered by the press, brought ill-repute and reputational losses to Tata Sons,” the appeal said. It said Mr. Mistry failed to capitalise when business opportunities came up.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lahjcl/article30472898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUTATA1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ratan-tata-moves-sc-against-nclat-verdict-to-reinstate-mistry/article30472899.ece
54,2020/01/03,Adani to buy 75% in Krishnapatnam Port,"Adani Ports and Logistics and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (APSEZ) will be acquiring 75% stake in Krishnapatnam Port Co. Ltd. (KPCL) in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh for a total consideration of ₹13,572 crore from the CVR Group, said the company in a filing.

The balance stake will be held by the CVR Group.

The acquisition is in line with APSEZ’s strategy of expanding its footprint in Andhra Pradesh. The transaction would accelerate APSEZ’s move towards handling 400 million tonnes (MT) of cargo by 2025, said APSEZ in its statement.

The purchase consideration will be funded via internal accruals and existing cash balance, APSEZ said.

KPCL is the second-largest private sector port in the east, after Mundra in the west, that handled 54 MT of cargo during FY19. Mundra Port, which also belongs to the Adani Group, has been handling over 100 MT of cargo for the past few years consecutively.

Adani Group began due diligence at KPCL during the first week of November 2019 and at the time, it was said that the entire exercise would last a month or two and that thereafter, the Adanis would take a final call. On Friday, APSEZ announced its intention to acquire the stake.

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and the transaction is expected to be completed in 120 days, the statement added.

Asserting that this acquisition would not only increase APSEZ’s market share to 27% from the current 22%, but also add remarkable value to pan-India footprint, Karan Adani, CEO and whole-time director, APSEZ, said “With the experience of successfully turning around acquisitions of Dhamra and Kattupalli ports, we are confident of harnessing the potential of KPCL and improving returns to stakeholders.”

Also, APSEZ would aim to enhance KPCL’s cargo handling volume to 100 MT in about seven years from the present capacity of 64 MT, the statement added. KPCL recorded a revenue of ₹2,394 crore in FY19 compared with ₹1,969 crore in FY18. KPCL, which is engaged in the business of handling containers, coal, break bulk and other bulk cargo, including liquid cargo, was till recently run by Hyderabad-based engineering major CVR Group.

CVR Group decided to hive off the company as it got into financial trouble when the Andhra Pradesh government cancelled the ₹3,200-crore Polavaram Hydel power project awarded to Navayuga Engineering, the flagship of the group.

Cancellation of the project and the economic slowdown had hit the operations of the group and that of KPCL. Since then, the promoters had been looking for a suitor to bail it out, said a former top official of KPCL who had quit recently.

On Friday, APSEZ shares declined 0.2% to ₹382.70 on the BSE.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gsu7m9/article30472661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUKRISHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/adani-to-buy-75-in-krishnapatnam-port/article30472662.ece

In the first three quarters of 2019, the company sold 19,193 units, 17,605 units and 17,705 respectively.

The last quarter saw a huge jump of 34,362 units, which was 67.92% more than that of corresponding year-ago period sales.

The market share in Q4 was 4.4%. Renault attributed the increase to the introduction of new products such as Triber, Kwid and Duster.

The seven-seater compact MPV Triber was launched in August 2019 and since then, Renault has sold 24,142 units.

Renault India CEO and MD Venkatram Mamillapalle had said they had started exporting Triber to South Africa by the last week of December 2019. The next lot will be shipped by February.

He also said that their mid-term plan of doubling production volume to 1.60 lakh units by 2022 to achieve profitablility was on track.

56,2020/01/03,Indigo boardroom battle takes turn for worse,"The boardroom battle between IndiGo’s two co-promoters is set to escalate in the days to come as Rakesh Gangwal has sought removal of clauses in the company’s Articles of Association that allow his rival Rahul Bhatia the right of first refusal if the former sells his stake in the company.

In a BSE filing on Friday, InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IGAL) — IndiGo’s parent company — notified that an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) is scheduled for January 29 after a request from Mr. Gangwal for passing a special resolution for deleting sections of the Articles of Association pertaining to “transfer of equity shares”, “acquisition of shares” and “other provisions on equity shares”.

RG Group, comprising Rakesh Gangwal, Shobha Gangwal and The Chinkerpoo Family Trust, collectively hold 37% shares in IGAL, while Mr. Bhatia’s company, InterGlobe Enterprises, owns a little over 38%.

“Rakesh Gangwal has sought deletion of clauses from the Articles of Association that provide the first right of refusal to the two co-promoters in case one of them seeks to transfer his share. This means, Mr. Gangwal may seek to sell his share in the company to either Rahul Bhatia’s competitor or anyone else,” said an expert on corporate law, on condition of anonymity.

At least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders will have to be in favour of the amendments sought by Mr. Gangwal in order for them to be passed.

“It is important to note that the EGM is not being called jointly, which means this is no sign of a truce. This may be a tactic to drive a hard bargain from Rahul Bhatia,” the person quoted above said.

Mr. Bhatia declined to offer a comment, while phone calls to Mr. Gangwal remained unanswered.

Qatar Airways’ Akbar al Bakr, a good friend of Mr. Bhatia, has on several occasions expressed his interest in acquiring a stake in IndiGo.

Work on all these companies is on and the process is facing delays due to “surprises” encountered once the wheels began moving, the official from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) said.

The Ministry had budgeted to garner ₹1.05 lakh crore from divestments during the fiscal. When asked if the strategic divestment in BPCL, which alone can fetch the government over ₹60,000 crore if it were to sell its entire 53% stake, will be completed this fiscal, the official said, ‘unlikely’.

On Container Corporation (Concor) and Air India as well, the official said the sale would not go through in the current fiscal ending March 31. The official said the government is preparing the financial statements and getting the data room ready for the sale.

Till now, the industry has shown ‘excitement’ over the companies which are being floated, the official said, adding that there are additional details which may be sought by potential bidders.

60,2020/01/03,"Don’t punish a child for marrying a female adult, says Supreme Court","The anti-child marriage law does not intend to punish a male aged between 18 and 21 years for marrying a “female adult,” the Supreme Court has held in a recent judgment.

A Bench led by Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar was interpreting Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, which says: “whoever, being a male adult above 18 years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees or with both.”

The court said neither does the provision punish a child for marrying a woman nor a woman for marrying a male child. The latter because “in a society like ours, decisions regarding marriage are usually taken by the family members of the bride and groom, and women generally have little say in the matter.”

The sole objective of the provision is to punish a man for marrying a minor girl. “The intention behind punishing only male adults contracting child marriages is to protect minor girls,” the court reasoned.

It said the 2006 Act also gives an option for prospective grooms who are between 18 and 21 years old to opt out of marriages.

The case at hand concerned a boy who married a 21-year-old woman when he was 17 years old.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court had set aside its own order providing protection to the couple, and initiated prosecution against the boy for contracting a child marriage, in which he himself was the child.

The Supreme Court set aside the HC order, saying the intent behind Section 9 was not to punish a child for contracting a child marriage.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m4mxmt/article30473213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dont-punish-a-child-for-marrying-a-female-adult-says-supreme-court/article30473214.ece
61,2020/01/03,"‘Poor, women will bear brunt of CAA, NRC’","Whenever Kochai Bai, a tribal, happens to catch the abbreviation ‘NRC’, it conjures up a sour memory: her grandfather’s eviction from the forests of Odisha by the British. Left without a birth or caste certificate, or even a proof of residence now, she is almost certain of a similar fate, lest the National Register of Citizens (NRC) should be implemented nationwide.

“But this time, I will lose citizenship, with no place to call home,” she said, wheezing. Unable to recall the year of her arrival in Bhopal, she remembers former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was alive then. Staying alone in Ganganagar now, Ms. Bai, 70, showing her trembling, calloused hands, said she had left selling vegetables on the streets long ago, and was on her own in her dotage.

‘So complicated’

Sitting along with another 100 women at a public park on Savitribai Phule’s birth anniversary on Friday, she was eager to know what the furore over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the NRC was about, and how it would affect her. “It is all so complicated. All I understand is that it will hit us, the poor, the most,” she said.

However, believes Savitri Bhatt, a puppeteer, the double jeopardy of being a woman and poor spelt greater vulnerability for them. “Men can easily procure documents as they have connections in the outside world. Yet, if women lead, they can fight for the entire family and put up a stronger front,” said Ms. Bhatt, 36, who makes ₹7,000 a month.

Stoking fear of exclusion among the poor and Muslims, the National Population Register (NPR), due with the 2021 Census exercise, is being seen as a sinister prelude to the nationwide NRC, whose previous model rendered thousands Stateless in Assam. In addition, protests have raged against the CAA across the country, leaving dozens dead, for purportedly violating the secular ethos of the Constitution by denying Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from securing amnesty in India.

‘Creates contradiction’

The NRC will require verification of residential legacy, which mostly women will have a difficulty in proving, said Shivani Taneja, social worker, spreading awareness at the park. “Married women are displaced from maternal families and change names. They will be left to run around seeking proofs in case the NRC is implemented. When you ask a family about its members, they mention the son and the daughter-in-law, but not a married daughter, which creates contradiction,” she explained.

“We need to remember Phule, the first literate Indian woman, in fact a Dalit, and Fatima Sheikh, who gave her house to Phule to start a school. If citizenship is snatched away from us, how will women fight for rights like this?” asked Anjali Noronha, a social worker. “This is not just about papers, but our existence.”

Inter-faith cordiality

Illustrating an instance of inter-faith cordiality, Nasreen, also a participant, remarked that communal riots in Bhopal following the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 did not even touch her locality as Hindus residing there assured the area’s two Muslims families of safety, and asked them not to flee. “Now, we fear our citizenship will be taken away. It’s not about religion, but I will stand up even if my neighbour, of a different faith, is displaced. The government should have told us earlier even birth certificates could define a citizen. There were only non-institutional deliveries back then,” she added.

Meanwhile, Nanda Uikey, belonging to a nomadic community in Chhattisgarh, called upon the Central government to deploy more soldiers at borders if it was anxious about infiltrators. “Instead of spending funds to uplift the poor, it is interested in carrying out the costly exercise of verifying citizenship, that too through an exclusionary model,” she said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lm9y3d/article30472877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHOPAL-CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/poor-women-will-bear-brunt-of-caa-nrc/article30472819.ece

Mr. Rao’s plea was not considered primarily on the grounds that it has to be approved and forwarded by Rajya Sabha Chairperson Venkaiah Naidu. Since Mr. Naidu is travelling, he hasn’t so far studied the petition. “It will be taken up by the committee once he approves it. And we will be raising this issue during the next session of Parliament,” one of the BJP members said.

The privileges committee, headed by Deputy Chairman Sabha Harivansh, has nine other members, four of whom are of the BJP. The Congress has two members: Anand Sharma and Ripun Bora. The others include Sasikala Pushpa of the AIADMK, P. Wilson of the DMK and Sasmit Patra of the BJD.

According to sources, the BJP members supported Mr. Rao’s petition, while the Opposition MPs pointed to the procedural errors. “There were many procedural omissions. The committee can consider any petition only after the Chairman’s nod and whenever the matter is taken up, the member who has moved the petition has to recuse himself from the meeting,” one member said.

Mr. Rao had written to Mr. Naidu on December 31, seeking to initiate breach of parliament privileges and contempt proceedings against Mr. Vijayan for a resolution passed by the Assembly terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, passed by both Houses of Parliament, “illegal and unconstitutional”.

64,2020/01/03,Govt. treads cautiously on framing rules for CAA rollout,"More than 20 days after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, was passed by Parliament, the government is treading cautiously on framing the rules that will govern the law.

A senior government official said that though the Act has the provision to grant citizenship to members of six communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India illegally, the applicants will have to prove that they entered the country before December 31, 2014.

Proof of entry

“They will have to show some proof that they entered India before the cut-off date; each application will be examined carefully before the citizenship is granted,” the official said.

In an open letter on Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh warned that the CAA could be misused for infiltration as “any person claiming to be of the six religions could simply apply in terms of the amended law, prove entry on/before the cut-off date and be eligible for citizenship”.

The official said the government has not asked the States for their suggestions yet but was minutely examining each aspect before the rules are finalised.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Wednesday that the State government had provided suggestions to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for framing of the rules under the CAA.

The Kerala Assembly passed a resolution earlier this week asking the Centre to withdraw the CAA. Seven other Opposition-ruled States — West Bengal, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Puducherry and Chhattisgarh — have refused to implement the CAA.

An official said all applications under the CAA will have to be made online and the final decision to grant citizenship rests with the MHA.

65,2020/01/03,CAA will leave many children stateless: plea,"The citizenship law which differentiates children on the basis of their date of birth will leave many stateless, a petition filed in the Supreme Court on Friday contended.

Besides challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, for discrimination in granting citizenship on the basis of religion, the petition filed by Association for Protection of Civil Rights, an NGO, challenged the validity of Section 3 (1) of the original Citizenship Act, 1955.

Section 3(1) creates three scenarios. It mandates that children born in India on or after January 26, 1950, but before July 1, 1987, are entitled to citizenship by birth. Secondly, it says children born in India on or after July 1, 1987, but before December 3, 2004, would be entitled to Indian citizenship by birth only if either of his parents is an Indian citizen. Thirdly, it provides that children born in India on or after December 3, 2004, would be entitled to Indian citizenship by birth only if both of parents are citizens or one of the parents is a citizen and the other is not an illegal migrant.

Hence, while there are conditions for children born between 1950 and 1987, children born in the second and third time-frame may end up stateless.

“Those children who were born in India on or after July 1, 1987, but before December 3, 2004, whose parents were illegal migrants would not be granted Indian citizenship but would not even be considered illegal migrants within Section 3(2) (b) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. Similarly, those children who were born in India on or after December 3, 2004, either of whose parents was an illegal migrant, would again not be granted Indian citizenship,” the petition contended.

“There is a huge revenue shortfall of about ₹5 lakh crore and compensatory GST allowance is not being paid to the States. The panel should be debating this subject and its implications on India's federal polity. Instead its attention is being deflected by studying the road map to a five trillion economy,” one of the members said.

In November, five non-BJP States — Punjab, Rajasthan, Kerala, West Bengal and Delhi — had in a common statement flagged the issue saying that GST comprised nearly 60% of the tax revenues of States and several States were already facing deficits up to 50% of the total GST.

They said the deficits will disrupt the State budgets and bring all activities of the States to a grinding halt. Since then, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has repeatedly said the Centre will honour its commitment.

The Ministry of External Affairs called upon the Government of Pakistan to ensure protection of the gurdwara, which was targeted by a mob during January 3 afternoon that reportedly threw stones and whipped up communal frenzy in the area near the place of worship. ""We call upon the Government of Pakistan to take immediate steps to ensure the safety, security, and welcome of the members of the Sikh community. Strong action must be taken against the miscreants who indulged in disecration of the holy Gurudwara and attacked members of the minority Sikh community,"" said the press statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs.

An agitated mob from a nearby area pelted the gurdwara with stones after a dispute broke out over the alleged abduction and conversion of a Sikh girl., who was kidnapped from her home in Nankana Sahib, which hosts a part of the Sikh community of Pakistan.

The issue drew attention of Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh who appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure safety of the gurdwara. ""I appeal to Prime Minister Imran Khan to immediately intervene to ensure that the devotees stranded in Gurudwara Nankana Sahib are rescued and the historic Gurudwara is saved from the angry mob surrounding it,"" said Chief Minister Singh in a social media message.

Earlier a series of videos shot by local Sikhs showed large number of people agitating over the fate of the lady and threatening the gurdwara.

“Amit Shahji, Modiji and you have been made Prime Minister and Home Minister to work for the public and not abuse Opposition leaders. Your allies are not accepting the divisive CAA, your own Chief Minister in Assam is not accepting the CAA,” Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a video message.

In a separate tweet, he also tagged a news report that Assam CMO had declined to comment on the reports that Mr. Sonowal was not ready to accept the CAA in his State.

Earlier, Mr Surjewala had challenegd Mr. Modi to dismiss his own chief minister for openly opposing the amended citizenship law.

In another tweet, the chief spokesperson of the Congress accused the government to resorting to a divisive issue to ‘fool’ citizens of the country as economic indicators were going plunging.

The move came after President Ram Nath Kovind, who is also the visitor of the university, accepted the resignation letter of Mr. Hangloo submitted earlier this week.

“A three-member panel has been formed to probe the allegations of academic, financial and administrative irregularities against Hangloo,” an official told PTI.

“The panel will headed by UGC chairman DP Singh. The other members of the panel are Gujarat University Vice Chancellor Rama Shankar Dubey and Shriprakash Mani Tripathi, Vice Chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak,” the official added.

The panel has been formed following a directive from the President to inquire into the allegations.

Mr. Hangloo has been under the scanner since 2016 for alleged financial and academic irregularities.

He was also summoned by the National Commission for Women last week over allegations of improper handling of sexual harassment complaints and lack of grievance redressal mechanism for female students.

“I resigned because baseless enquiries were initiated against me. On several occasions it was proved that there was no substance in the complaints. I resigned because I was totally fed up,” Mr. Hangloo had said in a statement.

Mr. Morrison was due to visit India for a 3-city tour to Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore on January 13-16, and was due to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and give the keynote address at the Ministry of External Affairs’ annual Raisina Dialogue conference.

On Friday Prime Minister Modi spoke to Mr. Morrison and conveyed condolences over the “prolonged bushfires” that have left atleast 18 people dead, thousands of animals burnt and homes destroyed.

“[PM Modi] offered India’s unstinted support to Australia and the Australian people, who are bravely facing this unprecedented natural calamity,” an MEA statement said. The situation has brought considerable criticism for the Australian PM, who had undertaken a Christmas vacation as the fires broke out.

India and Australia were expected to conclude a logistics defence agreement and discuss Indo-Pacific strategy during Mr. Morrison’s visit. According to an MEA statement, PM Modi reiterated India’s commitment to the strategic partnership with Australia during the conversation, and looked forward to the Australian PM’s state visit at a “mutually convenient time later in the year”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5qmnsa/article30472023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/australian-pm-calls-off-india-visit-due-to-bush-fires-back-home/article30472024.ece
71,2020/01/03,"We will not give an inch on CAA, says Amit Shah","In the midst of massive nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said the government would “not go back an inch” to revoke the legislation even if all the Opposition parties come together and spread “misinformation with all [their] might.”

The amended citizenship law would not take away Indian citizenship from anyone, said Mr. Shah, while addressing a rally as part of the BJP’s campaign on the issue. “The CAA is meant to grant citizenship to the people facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Congress and other parties are misleading the people to secure their vote banks,” he said.

Mr. Shah did not make any reference to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register during his half-an-hour-long address. He said it was “absolutely wrong” to say that the CAA would create divisions between religious communities. “On the contrary, it is an inclusive law. It treats our persecuted brethren with respect.”

Previously, Mr. Shah told the Lok Sabha on December 9: “We are very clear that NRC will happen in this country.” And, speaking at a public rally in Delhi on December 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed there had been no discussion, no talk since he came to power in 2014.

The rally was the first event with which an awareness campaign of the BJP was launched to address people’s concerns over CAA and explain the statute’s objectives. Held on the home turf of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, the rally was attended by a large number of BJP workers and common people.

Mr. Shah said the minority communities were living honourably in India, but the percentage of Hindus, Sikhs and others had declined sharply in neighbouring countries. “There are only 500 Sikhs left today in Afghanistan, which was a region once dominated by them. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus and other minorities comprise just 3% of population. If India doesn’t accept them, where else will they go?”

“The Congress, Mamata Didi, SP, BSP, Kejriwal and company, Communists... All of them are opposing the CAA. I challenge them to debate with me. Rahul Baba, I will translate this law in Italian for you. Read it once,” Mr. Shah said, while affirming that the Opposition’s charge that it would take away the minorities’ citizenship was wrong.

Mr. Shah said the BJP-led government at the Centre, under the leadership of Mr. Modi, had resolved the issues afflicting the nation for the last 70 years in just eight months. “Nobody could have thought that issues like Article 370, triple talaq, Ram temple’s construction and Pakistan-sponsored terrorism could be solved like this.”

Jodhpur was selected as the venue for Mr. Shah’s rally in view of the significant number of Pakistani migrants living there.

Mr. Shah, who announced a toll-free number for registering support for CAA, also attacked Mr. Gehlot over the deaths of infants in a hospital in Kota.

72,2020/01/03,India expresses concern over Soleimani’s killing,"India expressed concern over the situation arising from the killing early on Friday of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in an attack that also killed the chief of an Iraqi militia.

“We have noted that a senior Iranian leader has been killed by the U.S.,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement that did not directly criticise Washington, but cautioned against any escalation. The killing comes ahead of the MEA’s annual “Raisina Dialogue” in which Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is expected to participate on January 14.

“The increase in tension has alarmed the world. Peace, stability and security in this region are of utmost importance to India. It is vital that the situation does not escalate further. India has consistently advocated restraint and continues to do so,” the MEA statement added.

Speaking about the U.S. strike in Iraq, officials said the government would continue to walk a “tightrope” over growing tensions between Iran and the United States, given the importance of both relationships, as well as the importance of stability in West Asia.

More than eight million Indians live and work in the region, contributing a large part in remittances back home. India sources more than 2/3rds of its oil from West Asia, mainly Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and any retaliation from Iran will affect its supplies. Its energy bill, that has gone up due to its decision last year to cancel oil from Iran due to U.S. sanctions, will spike further with oil prices going up in the region.

On Friday, after the U.S. confirmed it had ordered the strike on General Soleimani, Brent Crude Futures rose 4.3% to $69.08 per barrel. The future of India’s Chabahar port project, which is key to the government’s connectivity plans for Afghanistan and Central Asia also hangs in the balance as tensions rise in the region.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xbdlyq/article30472450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Soleimani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/increase-in-tension-has-alarmed-the-world-india-on-iranian-generals-killing/article30471742.ece
73,2020/01/03,Chidambaram questioned for six hours on aircraft deal,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday recorded the statement of former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in connection with the procurement of 43 aircraft from Airbus during the UPA regime.

Mr. Chidambaram was questioned for about six hours, according to a senior agency official.

The ED probe is based on a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation in May 2017, following a Supreme Court directive to probe the allegations of irregularities in the agreements for the purchase of 111 aircraft worth about ₹70,000 crore for Air India and the erstwhile Indian Airlines. While 43 airplanes were procured from Airbus, the rest were from Boeing.

The agency has already recorded the statements of several officials of the national carrier and the suppliers.

The Comptroller and Auditor General, in its 2011 report, had found several loopholes in the agreements. The report said: “To enable effective price negotiations, it is normal (and was also necessary) to make an assessment through commercial intelligence gathered globally to assess a reasonable or threshold price (based on comparable prices paid by other buyers and other factors)”.

“However, no benchmarks for the cost of the aircraft were set by AIL [Air India Limited]/ MoCA [Ministry of Civil Aviation] before negotiations were initiated with the manufacturers at various levels,” it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2ui1n6/article30471665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SalmanKhurshidBookLaunch,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-questions-chidambaram-in-upa-era-aviation-scam-case/article30471666.ece
74,2020/01/03,We can execute operations without nuclear escalation: Army Chief,"Nuclear weapons are for deterrence and on a few occasions Indian armed forces have carried out operations across the Line Control (LoC) without the “nuclear portion coming into play,” Army chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said on Friday, referring to the 2016 surgical strikes and the Balakot air strikes last year.

Talking to a small group of print media journalists, he said the armed forces have been apolitical since independence.

“I disagree that there is any politicisation of the armed forces,” he said, adding there is some misperception on that. On the Army being called frequently to assist the civil administration he observed they are the Army “of the people and for the people.”

Chinese border

On the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, Gen. Naravane said we should be “firm” in our resolve and “assertive” in our claims but “don’t have to be aggressive.”

“We have to know what we want as far as the resolution of the border is concerned”, he stated.

“Historically nuclear weapons have been good deterrence. And that’s where their role ends. We have seen 2-3 occasions where we can carry out operations without the nuclear portion coming into play,” he said to a question on the conventional options available within Pakistan’s threat of nuclear escalation.

On the Balakot air strikes, Gen. Naravane said they have “achieved a lot.” “We destroyed that particular camp. Over the months it was rebuilt,” he stated.

On the message it had sent, he said, “It has signalled that terrorist camps and infrastructure like launch pads can all be taken down and they can’t operate with impunity. That was the message sent,” he said, adding as a result there will be some restraint and lot of caution which has come in before escalating (by Pakistan).

Keeping track

Gen. Naravane said terrorist camps continue to be there and their location keeps changing. Stating they don’t always have to be a big one, he said, they keep track of them. “We make an intelligence picture on the number of camps and number of terrorists. It is a guestimate, not an exact number,” he said, adding there are now about 250 terrorists at 20-25 launch pads waiting to cross over over into India.

To questions on the situation in Kashmir after dilution of special powers under Article 370, Gen. Naravane said it has brought peace. Stone pelting and violence have come down drastically, he said, adding, “Figures show there is improvement.”

Speaking of capability enhancement and infrastructure development on the border with China, the Army Chief said the focus has been there for several years and both the Western and Northern borders are equally important.

“The northern border is different and is a more inhospitable terrain. It’s natural that we focus more there. It is not that one is more important. We are just preparing for any eventuality. If you want peace you should be ready,” he stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ibvltp/article30471476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NARAVANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/we-can-execute-operations-without-nuclear-escalation-army-chief/article30471477.ece

This will encourage original equipment manufacturers to launch new electric vehicle models, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Friday.

The Department of Heavy Industry had invited the Expressions of Interest from large cities, smart cities, state/union territory capitals and cities from special category states for submission of proposal for availing incentives under FAME India Scheme Phase II for deployment of EV charging infrastructure within cities.

In response thereof, about 106 proposals from public/private entities for the deployment of about 7,000 EV charging stations were received. After evaluation of these proposals as per EoI, on the advice of Project Implementation and Sanctioning Committee (PISC) the Government sanctioned 2,636 charging stations to 62 cities submitted by 19 public entities for 24 states.

“By installing all these charging stations, it is expected that at least one charging station will be available in most of the selected cities in a grid of 4 km x 4 km. It will boost the confidence of users of electric vehicles in terms of range anxiety and also this will encourage the OEMs to launch the new electric vehicle models which they were hesitant because of lack of charging infrastructure,” the Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said.

Out of these 2,636 charging stations, 1,633 will be fast charging stations whereas the remaining 1,003 slow charging stations. About 14,000 chargers will be installed across the selected cities.

Under the second phase of the FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, 317 EV charging stations have been sanctioned in Maharashtra, 266 in Andhra Pradesh, 256 in Tamil Nadu, 228 in Gujarat, 205 in Rajasthan, 207 in Uttar Pradesh, 172 in Karnataka, 159 in Madhya Pradesh, 141 in West Bengal, 138 in Telangana, 131 in Kerala, 72 in Delhi, 70 in Chandigarh, 50 in Haryana, 40 in Meghalaya, 37 in Bihar, 29 in Sikkim, 25 each in Jammu, Srinagar, and Chhattisgarh, 20 in Assam, 18 in Odisha and 10 each in Uttarakhand, Puducherry and Himachal Pradesh.

77,2020/01/03,Yechury slams religious basis for CAA,"CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday slammed the Narendra Modi government for amending the citizenship law on the basis of religion to exclude Muslims from its ambit.

The government’s prejudice made it indifferent to harassment, discrimination and exploitation of Muslims in Islamic countries, Mr Yechury said at an rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Guwahati.

“Violence made many Sri Lankan Tamils flee and take refuge in Tamil Nadu and Odisha. Why are you not giving citizenship to them? You are also not ready to accept the Rohingya community who escaped persecution in Burma (Myanmar). Why is your citizenship for people who came from only these three countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan)?” Mr. Yechury asked the Modi government.

“They (BJP) said non-Muslims faced religious persecution and discrimination in the three Islamic countries and as such, they should be given citizenship. They are fanning communal passions by giving citizenship to only non-Muslim immigrants. Are Muslims not harassed in the Islamic countries? It is happening to the Ahmadiyya in Pakistan and the matter has reached the international court,” he said.

The CPI(M) leader alluded to Abdul Hamid, who was conferred the country's highest military honour Param Veer Chakra after the India-Pakistan was in 1965, to underline the sacrifice of Muslims for the country.

Mr. Yechury said the BJP's decisions were aimed at making India a “Hindu nation”. But people belonging to Dalit and Adivasi communities were also being exploited in a regime that could not tolerate criticism of its policies, he pointed out.

The CPI(M) leader also said CAA formed part of a dangerous package along with National Population Register and National Register of Citizens. “This is a ‘buy-one, get-three’ package offered by Modi saab to keep the people on tenterhooks,” Mr Yechuri said.

Signature campaign

The Congress in the State launched a mass signature campaign against CAA on Friday. The party also decided to join hands with all anti-CAA forces toward protecting Assam’s indigenous people.

The party has targeted 20 lakh signatures for a memorandum to be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind demanding the repeal of the amended citizenship law. Former Chief Minister Bhumidhar Barman has been assigned to supervise the campaign.

The Congress leaders also launched an “Astitwa Rakhyar Janajagarn Padyatra (Walk for awakening people to save existence)” across the State.

“We are open to alliance with every political party, non-political organisation against the unconstitutional CAA,"" State Congress president Ripun Bora said, advising the BJP to detect and deport illegal migrants instead of criticising the Congress for having protected them for years.

Protests against CM

The Nalbari district unit of All Assam Students' Union (AASU) ‘hanged’ at least 20 effigies of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for “creating a fascist government” and “cracking down on the very people that elected him”.

AASU leader Bhabajit Bezbaruah said the effigies were hung across Nalbari town and outskirts to protest the police atrocities on students who had shown black flags and shouted slogans at the Chief Minister’s convoy on January 1.

The AASU has also demanded action against two police officers who misbehaved with the local people.

NPP 'gag order'

The National People's Party (NPP), which heads the alliance government in Meghalaya, has asked its members not to make any comment or take part in any rally for or against the CAA.

In a statement on January 1, NPP national general secretary Thomas Sangma said the party had noticed certain members commenting on the political and social impact of CAA. “As our party has already made its stand clear on the CAA, it is hereby directed to all the members of the party to refrain from passing any comment in their official capacity, on CAA without prior written permission from the national president,” he said.

The statement reminded cadre that “no member shall have the right or authority to initiate legal proceedings in any court of law including the Supreme Court of India regarding the subject matter of CAA”.

“The Congress, which is one of the ruling parties in Maharashtra, will have to answer the Marathi people and all patriots in the country how long will it continue to insult the sacrifice of Veer Savarkar,” Ms. Irani said at the Delhi BJP office.

She also asked why does the Congress considers its “birthright to humiliate” Veer Savarkar.

Ms. Irani launched BJP’s ‘Meri Dilli Mera Sujhav’ campaign along with other leaders including the party’s Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari to gather feedback of the people of Delhi to draft the party’s manifesto for forthcoming Assembly polls.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Friday also targeted Congress over a Seva Dal booklet questioning Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s credentials as a patriot and his reputation for valour.

The Hindi booklet, distributed at a camp of Congress-affiliated Seva Dal in Madhya Pradesh, had also claimed that Savarkar and Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse were in a physical relationship.

“Veer Savarkar was a great man and will remain a great man. A section keeps talking against him. This shows the dirt in their mind,” Raut said, responding to the insinuations in the booklet, titled “Veer Savarkar, Kitne ‘Veer’?”

The book alleged that Savarkar received money from the British after he was released from Andaman’s Cellular Jail.

79,2020/01/03,BJP to launch pan India door-to-door campaign for CAA on January 5,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday announced that it will be launching a mega door-to-door campaign in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across the country on January 5, with all senior leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and party working president J. P. Nadda pitching in. The campaign is expected to reach out to 3 crore families in ten days.

Day 1

Mr. Shah will kick off the campaign in New Delhi while Mr. Nadda will visit a household in Ghaziabad. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be in Lucknow, Roads and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari in Nagpur and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Jaipur, on the first day of the campaign, BJP general secretary Anil Jain said while addressing a press conference at the party headquarters in New Delhi.

Mr. Jain said Indian Muslims had no reason to worry over any citizenship exercise, be it the NPR (National Population Register) or the NRC (National Register of Citizens), and asserted that India’s only religion is its Constitution. There have been widespread protests across the country opposing the CAA and the NRC.

Mr. Jain said a nationwide consultation will be held whenever a decision on rolling out the NRC, which is a part of the party’s manifesto, is taken, but noted that there is no such proposal now.

Asked about concerns among Muslims over a raft of citizenship measures, he said, “As the BJP’s national general secretary, I can say with full responsibility that no Indian Muslim can have any danger from whatever measures come into place, be it NPR or NRC.”

“The Constitution will take care of their concerns. India has only one religion, which is its Constitution,” Mr. Jain said.

‘Fears stoked’

He also accused Opposition parties of misleading minorities by stoking their fears and concerns “for political reasons”. The Congress and the BJP’s other rivals are inciting “rebellion and anarchy” in the country due to their politics of appeasement, he alleged.

Persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who are the intended beneficiaries of the Act, have been victims of atrocities in their countries, he said, adding that those opposing it have shown extreme insensitivity.

External Affairs Minister ducked a meeting with U.S. legislators,” said Mr. Menon while addressing a public hearing here on Friday organised by the Constitutional Conduct Group and Karwan-e-Mohabbat.

Dwelling on the international consequences of the two-pronged challenges of the CAA and the NRC, Mr. Menon expressed concern about the future of the idea of India.

“Global public opinion on India has shifted if you see the international press. It’s a self-inflicted goal,” he said.

He noted with concern that even India’s friends were speaking in a dismissive manner about the internal developments in the country.

“Bangladesh Foreign Minister said ‘let them fight among themselves’. If this is how our friends feel, what must our adversaries feel,” said Mr. Menon, noting that even the Kashmir issue that was dormant at the United Nations since 1971 had been revived.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cqxxnq/article30469115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN03SHIVSHANKARMENON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-will-face-international-isolation-because-of-nrc-caa-shiv-shankar-menon/article30469116.ece
81,2020/01/03,"No one called J&K ex-CMs ‘anti-national’, UT admin will decide on their release: Amit Shah","No one in the government has ever called the three detained former Chief Ministers of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir “anti-national”, Home Minister Amit Shah has said, adding that a decision on their release will be taken by the administration of the Union Territory.

Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had to be detained for “some time” after they made provocative statements, the home minister said on Thursday night while addressing an event organised by media outlet ABP News.

“Please see the statements made by them: like the entire country will be on fire if Article 370 was touched...In the backdrop of these statements, a professional decision was taken to keep them under detention for sometime,” Mr. Shah said at the news summit.

Many political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, including the three former Chief Ministers, were detained on August 5, the day the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions granting special status o J&K and bifurcation of the State into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

While Farooq Abdullah has been booked under the stringent Public Safety Act and confined to his Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar, which has been declared a sub-jail, his son Omar Abdullah has been detained at Hari Niwas. PDP chief Mufti was lodged at Chesmashahi hut initially but later shifted to a government accommodation.

To a question pointing out that Mr. Abdullahs’ National Conference and Ms. Mufti’s PDP were alliance partners of the BJP at some point of time and the leaders were now being labelled “anti-national”, Mr. Shah said that neither he nor anyone from the government had called them so.

“As far as the decision to release them is concerned, this decision will be taken by the local administration and not me,” he said, adding that the administration will release them whenever it deems suitable.

Mr. Shah said the situation in the Kashmir Valley was under control and day-to-day life was going on smoothly.

82,2020/01/03,"Morning Digest: Iranian General killed in air strike at Baghdad airport, Shaheen Bagh protesters to continue sit-in, and more","Gen Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, was killed in an air strike at Baghdad’s international airport Friday, Iraqi television and three Iraqi officials said.

The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, the officials said.

While certain individuals, claiming to be organisers of the demonstration, had put out statements that the agitation was to be called off, those at the site of protest dismissed these as rumours being spread to break the demonstration.

The announcement came following the talks between the Directors-General of the Border Security Force (BSF) and Border Guards Bangladesh in New Delhi from December 25 to 30, 2019.

The DMK had won in 727 of 1,632 seats the results of which were declared for the post of panchayat union ward members as of 11.30 p.m. The AIADMK was lagging by nearly 170 seats, as its candidates had won only in 556 seats.

Addressing thousands of students and seers of various Mutts, Mr. Modi said instead of carrying out agitations against Pakistan which was “oppressing” its minorities, the anti-CAA protesters were opposing the government for implementing the CAA and NRC.

Dr. Agrawal’s comments come in the wake of widespread outrage spurred by reports that the panel would determine if the poem was “anti-Hindu,” “anti-national” or had “hurt Hindu sentiments.”

Several architects have raised concerns over the government’s proposed change of land-use of plots to make way for a new Parliament House, flagging the potential reduction in land for general public use.

83,2020/01/03,Prime Minister launches 5 new DRDO labs,"Five new defence laboratories led by under-35 directors and young military scientists were formally launched on Thursday to drive the country’s war technologies of the future under the Defence Research & Development Organisation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a two-day visit to the State, dedicated to the nation the DYSLs or DRDO Young Scientists Laboratories that will operate from five cities across the country.

The labs operating in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad will each pursue a key technology necessary for developing the nation’s next generation of defence systems.

Addressing scientists at the DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment in the evening, Mr. Modi said the government would walk the extra mile with scientists to ensure India got the technologies and innovations needed for its security.

He praised the missiles programme developed by the DRDO as among the outstanding ones in the world and urged the scientists to give a decade’s roadmap where the DRDO would set the direction and pace of research in various scientific areas.

“The establishment of DYSLs will be a big leap forward for the DRDO from the goal of making India self-reliant to [making it] future ready in defence technologies,” a DRDO release said.

DRDO Chairman G.Satheesh Reddy told The Hindu that the labs are now formally operational. The new directors were chosen from within the organisation through a tough selection process across six months by a committee chaired by Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government K. Vijaya Raghavan.

There would be no fund constraints for the new labs and the new leaders get the same administrative and financial powers as the directors of existing defence labs.

He said the present labs did not have activities in the five chosen areas except for some work as in AI at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, Bengaluru. Asymmetric technologies, for instance, will change the way the next wars are fought.

The trigger for the labs apparently came in August 2014 when Mr. Modi suggested that DRDO give its youth pool research opportunities that are challenging as well as decision-making powers.

The defence R&D establishment already has 52 labs that are working in seven broad domains. Explaining the need for the new labs, the DRDO statement said a country needs to have a technology edge in its operational, tactical and strategic warfare. Traditional ways of assessing and forecasting technology are not enough as it needs “unimaginable immediacy.”

”No longer can we wait to evaluate technology till it is mature for implementation and then make the investment. Young and agile scientists with zeal and enthusiasm are the key to match the pace of technological innovation and the nation needs to recognise their ability to innovate,” the release said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e9xi6r/article30464734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02KRADRDO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-launches-5-new-drdo-labs/article30464735.ece
84,2020/01/03,Navy personnel ‘upset’ with ban on smartphones and FB,"A directive from the Navy banning the usage of Facebook and smartphones on naval premises has reportedly not gone down well with Navy personnel, with some terming it a ‘knee-jerk reaction’ that would cause resentment.

The decision to ban Navy personnel from using Facebook and smartphones comes in the wake of the arrest of seven Navy personnel from the Eastern and Western Naval Commands, and a Mumbai-based hawala operator, in a joint operation by the Andhra Pradesh Police, Naval Intelligence and Central intelligence agences.

The seven personnel reportedly fell for a honey-trap laid through Facebook by Pakistani agents to extract vital information.

Questions abound

Officers requesting anonymity questioned the rationale behind the decision. “Why ban only Facebook? There are several other social media websites and apps such as Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp. Moreover, in today’s tech-savvy world, nothing can be banned or blocked, as there is always a way out by opening fictitious accounts or operating the accounts through a third person,” they said.

“As per a general directive, no person from the Armed Forces or establishments under the Ministry of Home Affairs or some strategic ministries are supposed to upload their personal and professional details or pictures in uniform. We just mention that we are employed by the Ministry of Defence or Ministry of Home Affairs. But fake accounts can be opened,” an officer said.

‘No clarity’

According to them, there is no clarity on any directive or policy as a result of which there are several loopholes.

The directive reportedly issued by the Navy states that smartphones would not be allowed inside naval premises.

“Does it also mean that even in residential premises located inside naval premises, smartphones won’t be allowed?” questioned another officer.

In Eastern Naval Command (ENC), there are many naval residential quarters located inside naval establishments such as INS Satavahana, INS Kalinga and INS Eksila. “Are smartphones banned here also?” is the question on many minds.

As per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), smartphones or any communication devices, except for official radio sets, are prohibited inside vital assets or installations.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qlijxb/article30432102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THINSKADMATT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/navy-personnel-upset-with-ban-on-smartphones-and-fb/article30473608.ece

86,2020/01/03,Former MP bats for reforms in tobacco sector,"Former Member of Parliament Yelamanchili Sivaji on Friday said that the time is ripe for structural reforms in the tobacco auction system in the country.

Addressing tobacco farmers and traders at the Tobacco Board Formation Day celebrations at the Indian Tobacco Association Hall on Friday, Dr. Sivaji said that the lack of a competitive market, price stabilisation and monopoly of a single trading company is continuing to haunt tobacco farmers.

“Tobacco farmers need a marketing fund or a marketing corporation to deal with international markets. The Government of India needs to welcome foreign investment in tobacco and the time has come to review the auction system and bring in reforms,” Dr. Sivaji said at the meeting.

A medical doctor-turned-political activist and a farmer leader, Dr. Sivaji said that the Tobacco Board was set up in Guntur thanks to the collective efforts of growers and traders. An amendment to the Tobacco Board Act was introduced in Parliament in 1978, but was withdrawn after severe opposition from farmers and peasant leaders like Acharya N.G. Ranga.

The tobacco sector has withstood several challenges in the following years, more so the market crisis after Russia downsized imports from 25 million kg to 14 million kg. The uncertainty in markets has forced the farmers to sell tobacco at low prices, with many growers shifting to other crops.

In 2000-2001, the growers declared a crop holiday to protest against the low prices but it has done good in the long term, as it managed to draw the attention of the government to the plight of farmers. Prakasam farmers have switched over to Bengal Gram and cultivated over three lakh acres.

“I made an appeal to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2000 to set up a market stabilisation fund but the proposal is yet to materialise,” said Dr. Sivaji.

Later, the tobacco sector witnessed the biggest crisis in 2014-2015 which was due to an increase in production and lack of quality. Nine farmers committed suicide as the markets collapsed due to low prices. Later, the Central and State governments paid ₹22.40 crore as compensation to farmers, said Dr. Sivaji.

Tobacco Board chairman Y. Raghunatha Babu and Executive Director K. Sunitha spoke. Awards were given to growers and traders who followed the best agricultural practices in tobacco cultivation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vom7am/article29573899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PAANMASALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/former-mp-bats-for-reforms-in-tobacco-sector/article30473597.ece
87,2020/01/03,Pulsus CEO calls for setting up of agro-economic zones,"Pulsus Group CEO Srinubabu Gedela urged the State government on Friday to chalk out an action plan for the uniform development of all 13 districts in the State.

Dr. Gedela also suggested setting up of special agri-economic zones and special zones for promotion of fishing and industries based on the soil condition, availability of manpower and export opportunities in the respective regions.

Speaking to the media here, Dr. Gedela said that his group conducted a detailed survey in North Andhra, Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions to offer the government suggestions regarding the benefits of a need-based approach and sustainable development.

“Many farmers would return to agriculture if it is made lucrative. Aggressive promotion of horticulture, medicinal plants and commercial crops would benefit farmers in many ways and help them generate good income in no time. Training in vertical farming, soil-less farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics and organic farming under the supervision of agriculture scientists and experts would benefit the farmers immensely. These steps would boost agro-based industries in identified areas of the State,” said Dr. Gedela, who hails from Srikakulam district.

“The government can create special agriculture economic zones in Amaravati region spreading across the Krishna-Guntur delta area, Vizinaagaram, Srikakulam and other districts. Removal of middlemen, construction of godowns and marketing facilities will make agriculture more profitable,” he added.

“Farmers will never surrender their lands for construction activity and industries if their soil turns into gold. The farmers of Amaravati region would not have surrendered 33,000 acres of land if agriculture in the area was profitable. The government should make it an agriculture hub if it wants to develop Visakhapatnam as an executive capital,” he said.

The Pulsus CEO urged the government to promote economic zones all along the coastal belt for promotion of fishing activity. “Many fishermen communities from Srikakulam and Vizianagaram migrated to Gujarat where fishing activity has been brisk for decades. All of them will return to A.P. when opportunities are available,” he said.

He also suggested establishment of more industries in Rayalaseema region as many barren lands are unfit for agriculture. “Anantapur is the best place for development of electronic clusters. Many ancillary industries can be promoted in and around the proposed Kadapa steel plant,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5gwuij/article30476494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-VJ-PULSUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pulsus-ceo-calls-for-setting-up-of-agro-economic-zones/article30473560.ece

89,2020/01/03,No insider trading under TDP rule: Palle,"TDP leader Palle Raghunatha Reddy brushed aside the allegation that he had purchased land through insider trading.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Raghunatha Reddy said he was willing to give away the land he had legally purchased for the development of Amaravati.

“The allegation that I had purchased 7.5 acres of land is false,” he asserted.

I had purchased 2.52 acres of land in Amaravati in 2016 and not before September 4, 2014, when the Capital announcement was made, he argued.

“We did not illegally purchase the land. We contacted the farmers and did justice to them,” he said.

“My son was in the U.S. then. We decided to open a company with a view to contributing to the development of Amaravati,” he said.

Mr. Raghunatha Reddy also asserted that there was no insider trading under TDP rule.

“Mr. Naidu is a very committed person. He might not have told even his wife on the location of the Capital,” he added.

In fact, it was Chief Minister Y.S.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy lashed out at TDP leader Bonda Umamaheswara Rao for stating that his wife owned five acres of land at Neerukonda village.

Stating that there was no truth in it, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that details of his properties had been filed along with the affidavit he had submitted at the time of elections.

“I will quit politics if the charge is proved,” the MLA asserted.

Mr. Naidu had used force in acquiring land from the farmers of Yerrabalem and Kirshnayapalem, he alleged, and said that none of the promises made to the farmers was fulfilled during the TDP term.

Farmers had taught the TDP a lesson in Mangalagiri and Tadikonda, he said.

‘Naidu a worried man’

“Mr. Naidu is a worried man today as the prices of lands he had purchased through insider trading are crashing,” the MLA said.

Defending the government’s move to shift the Capital out of Amaravati, he said, “Krishna and Guntur districts are well off. People here have been going abroad and settling there. The same cannot be said about the north Andhra and Rayalaseema districts as people of these regions are migrating in search greener pastures.”

Referring to Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan’s statements, Mr. Ramakrishna said he had not opposed corruption in the Capital region in the last five years.

“There seems to be a secret deal between the TDP and the JSP presidents,” he alleged.

He asked Mr. Naidu to explain why he did not construct a house in the Capital region and why did he opt for temporary buildings after acquiring vast tracts of lands from the farmers.

Stating that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had not taken a final stand on the Capital issue, the MLA said that he would appeal to him to return the land to those farmers who wanted to cultivate them.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/t1uaws/article30476356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPG4-ALLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mangalagiri-mla-rubbishes-bondas-charge-on-landholding/article30473528.ece

In terms of administration, justice would be rendered to the three regions of the State (north and south coastal districts and Rayalaseema), he added.

The government was also correcting the wrong decisions taken during the TDP regime, Mr. Reddy observed, and promised to ensure cordial relations between all the regions.

‘No discrimination’

Addressing a public meeting after launching the pilot project bringing 1,000 types of diseases under the purview of YSR Aarogyasri scheme at Eluru in West Godavari district, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said he firmly believed that there should be no discrimination in administration, whether it was at the State or village level, or in utilising the resources in the districts.

The government was taking every decision with that in mind so that the State would achieve inclusive development, the Chief Minister said.

A concerted effort was being made to deliver clean and transparent governance as promised during the elections, he said.

The TDP government had neglected the State a lot, the consequences of which were being experienced by the people now, the Chief Minister observed.

Healthcare

On the health scheme, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said it was being extended to cover 1,000 types of diseases, in addition to those being currently dealt with at the network hospitals.

Any treatment costing more than ₹1,000 would now be subsidised under the scheme. Aarogyasri cards with QR codes were being given to the eligible beneficiaries (whose annual income was less than ₹5 lakh). By the end of February, 1.42 crore cards would be given, he said.

Besides, Aarogyasri had been extended to recognised hospitals in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad to enable the poor to undergo treatment for some rare diseases.

The Chief Minister said that 510 types of drugs were being dispensed at the government hospitals with effect from January 1, and they would be complying with the World Health Organisation standards from April 2020.

The government would bear the full expenditure incurred by cancer patients from February to help them overcome the financial distress, he added.

Kidney disease

Tenders were called for the construction of hospital-cum-research centres at Palasa and Markapur for treating people suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease with Unknown Etiology (CKD), and proposals were being worked out for setting medical colleges at Markapur, Piduguralla, Machilipatnam, Paderu, Eluru, Vizianagaram and Pulivendula, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qzu5qq/article30473507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPG4-JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/balanced-regional-development-is-our-goal-cm/article30473508.ece

104,2020/01/03,‘Contract killers targeted YSRCP leader’,"The city police arrested six persons, who were allegedly planning to eliminate a YSR Congress party leader from Fareedupeta village, Etcherla mandal, Srikakulam district, here at Pendurthy on Friday.

The accused were reportedly given contract (Supari) by a Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader from the same village, who was nursing a grudge against the YSRC leader, over political and land rivalries.

Three more persons including the TDP leader are yet to be arrested. The police have seized three swords, one knife, ₹ 70,000 cash and a few other things from their possession.

Political rivalry motive

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Commissioner of Police, R. K. Meena said MPTC of Fareedupeta village, Etcherla mandal, Kothakota Ammi Naidu and local YSRC leader M. Chiranjeevi, were having differences due to political rivalry for a long time. Being in the ruling party, Mr. Chiranjeevi reportedly used to behave high-handedly against Mr. Naidu and his followers. Irked by his behaviour, Ammi Naidu hatched a plan to eliminate Mr. Chiranjeevi, by giving contract to the rowdy sheeters.

Deputy Commissioner of Police, (Zone II) B. Uday Bhaskar said: “To avoid any suspicion in their village, Mr. Naidu decided to hire Visakhapatnam based rowdy-sheeters to lead and execute his plan properly.”

A ₹ 50-lakh contract

According to the police, Mr. Naidu approached one Killi Prakash from Visakhapatnam who also nursed a grudge against Mr. Chiranjeevi over a land dispute. The duo then contacted Pendurthy based rowdy-sheeter R. Kanna Babu, G. Rama Raju, A. Yesudas, P. Anil Kumar and Madan.

Further, Mr. Naidu and Prakash reportedly promised to pay ₹ 50 lakh for killing Mr. Chiranjeevi, of which ₹ 4 lakh has already been paid as advance. Mr. Naidu also reportedly sought the help of B. Paramesh and S. Tejeswara Rao, from Srikakulam district.

“To execute the plan properly, Killi Prakash, Ammi Naidu and Tejeswara Rao took the contract killers to Fareedupeta village, where they conducted recce on the house and party office of Mr. Chiranjeevi. Later, they went to the village five to six times to eliminate Mr. Chiranjeevi, but were not able to execute the plan,” said Mr. Meena.

Nabbed on tip-off

On Friday, Killi Prakash, Ganta Rama Raju, Yesudas, Paramesh and Anil Kumar met at Mr. Kanna Babu’s house at Chinamushivada, Pendurthy, to discuss their plan.

105,2020/01/03,Farmers pushed to distress sale of paddy in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts,"For many the New Year-2020 and the ensuing Sankranti festival is bringing cheer. But not to farmers of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram district. Reason?

With abundant rain in July and August, both districts witnessed bumper yield in the current season. However, farmers have not been able to sell their produce in many places in the absence of minimum support price (MSP). In fact, the government had decided to buy between at ₹1815 and ₹1835 per quintal based on the quality of the paddy. It had even established many procurement centres but those centers had reportedly failed to buy paddy from farmers, causing untold miseries.

Short-changed

According to sources, even 10 percent of the total produce was not bought so far by those centres run by Velugu members and others. To add to farmers’ woes, rice millers are also not interested to buy the produce. The result? In many places farmers are being forced to sell their hard grown crop at throw away prices to middlemen as they feared damage to the stock.

S.Sangam Naidu, a farmer from Palakonda village said the middlemen were offering only ₹ 1,350 per bag. “There were no takers for ‘1075’ variety paddy in the district,” rued another farmer S.Venkataramana of Ramakrishnapuram. So much so, S.Krishna Rao of Vangara mandal and V.Bhujanga Rao of Burada village of Regidi Amadalavalasa urged Srikakulam Collector J.Nivas to take stern action against millers and others who were cheating the farmers.

Collectors get tough and going

Mr. Nivas, who reviewed the issue directed Agriculture, Revenue, and Marketing officials to ensure speedy procurment of paddy and take action on millers and procurement staff if they failed to buy the paddy immediately. “Revenue Inspectors and Village Revenue Officers should monitor the procurement on a day-to-day basis. Senior officials have to coordinate the situation with daily tele- conference in their respective areas,” said Mr. Nivas.

The situation is equally bad in Vizianagaram district with the delay in paddy procurement. Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal asked district Civil Supplies officials to lift the paddy stock immediately since the farmers did not have storage facility. He said that the farmers would lose their crop with possible rains.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8rzcwl/article30476520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJSKPADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farmers-pushed-to-distress-sale-of-paddy-in-srikakulam-and-vizianagaram-districts/article30469905.ece

According to TTD statistics, the ‘hundi’ at the temple of Lord Venkateswara registered a record increase of 8.9% during 2019. Overall income (excluding gold, silver and other precious stones) alone stood at a staggering ₹1,161.74 crore against ₹1,066.48 crore in 2018, up by ₹95.25 crore.

Similarly, revenue earned by way of letting out of cottages and guest houses on a daily rental basis also stood at an all-time high of ₹83.71 crore in 2019, against ₹78.68 crore during the previous year, registering an increase of 6%.

107,2020/01/03,YSRCP shows video on ‘insider trading’,"Andhra Pradesh’s ruling YSR Congress Party (YRSCP) on Thursday shared a video that it claimed revealed the extent of corruption in the form of “insider trading” that had taken place in the Amaravati capital region during the 2014-19 period.

Detailing the allegations, senior YSRCP leader and Sattenapalli MLA Ambati Rambabu asserted that the ‘insider trading’ had taken place between June and December 2014, during which period the TDP leaders and their benamis had bought land to the extent of 4,069.65 acres in the region’s Thullur, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli mandals. Mr. Rambabu, who along with MLA T. Prakash Reddy released the video in a press conference at the YSRCP Central Office in Tadepalli, also made light of the TDP leaders’ protest in the Amaravati region, and wondered why TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s wife Bhuvaneswari had not protested when farmers in the State were dying of hunger and lack of adequate support prices.

Narrating the alleged sequence of events, the video purported to show how prior to the announcement made by then Chief Minister Naidu in the Assembly on September 4, 2014, TDP leaders had bought land at throwaway prices from unsuspecting farmers in the three mandals. In finalising the location of the Capital, the TDP government had also “dumped” the K.C. Sivaramakrishnan report, the YSRCP leader contended.

While 530 acres were registered in June 2014, 685.34 acres were registered in July, and another 353 acres in August. September saw 567.26 acres being registered, October another 564.91 acres, 836.81 acres in November and 531.90 acres were registered in December.

A month after forming the government, Heritage Foods had bought 14.22 acres in Kantheru village in Tadikonda mandal, followed by the then chief whip Payyavula Keshav, who bought 15.30 acres in Inavolu village, and Palle Raghunatha Reddy who purchased 7.56 acres in Thullur, the ruling party claimed in the video.

Mr. Rambabu alleged that irregularities took place in the finalisation of the master plan too. The CRDA finalised that the Capital would come up in 217 sq. km and later that was revised to 391.5 sq. km on the basis of a master plan made by a Singapore-based consultancy firm. In February 2016, the then government again released a notification confining the Capital area to 217 sq. km and this was done to benefit those who had bought lands just outside the core Capital region.

The zoning of areas by the CRDA was also done to benefit a few individuals, the ruling party claimed.

Mr. Rambabu said all the irregularities would be probed and charges would be filed against the accused.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/iarf3u/article30468013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02KRARAMBABU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-shows-video-on-insider-trading/article30468014.ece
108,2020/01/03,Farmers’ agitation baseless: Botcha,"Terming the agitation by the Amaravati farmers as baseless and a political move backed by the TDP to defame the YSRCP government, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana asked people of the Capital city region to be patient.

“The government will give them developed plots. A township will be given to the people as per the previous government’s promise,” Mr. Satyanarayana said while addressing the media here on Thursday.

“Insider trading had been witnessed in Hyderabad in the name of the Hitech City. The TDP repeated the same in Amaravati too,” he alleged.

Coming down heavily on the TDP, the Minister said that the State, under its rule, had gone 20 years backward.

The TDP had supported the bifurcation of the State, and that was why the economy crippled, he observed.

The visit of TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and his wife to to the Capital region on Wednesday was a political drama, he alleged.

‘Give back land’

“Instead of giving bangles to the agitating farmers, Mr. Naidu’s wife should have given back the land bought in her name in the Capital region,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

Referring to JSP president Pawan Kalyan, he said the actor-turned politician was toeing the line of Mr. Naidu and reading his script.

“Mr. Naidu has no moral right to speak against former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. It was YSR who was behind Mr. Naidu becoming a Minister when he was in the Congress party,” he said.

Three capitals

Supporting the idea of three capitals, Mr. Satyanarayana said, “Decentralisation means developing all the 13 districts. Development is possible only when projects are taken up in various sectors such as education and health. This will spur industrial growth. The previous government did not consider these aspects.”

A comprehensive decision on the three capitals would be taken after the high-power committee and the Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) submit their reports, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/iacgbm/article30467361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPG4-BOTCHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farmers-agitation-baseless-botcha/article30467362.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy to Chittoor on January 9, meant for the official launch of the YSR Congress Party government’s ambitious Amma Vodi programme.

Speaking to the media at the R&B guest house here, the ministers said that Jagan Mohan Reddy’s visionary scheme Amma Vodi was the first of its kind in the country and would go a long way in bolstering the image of education in the State, besides paving the way for equal opportunities for all sections of people to pursue higher education.

The launching of the programme as promised within six months of coming to power was nothing but historic. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy accords top priority to education, and thus took a bold step in a record time,” Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said.

The works pertaining to barricading, sprucing up the venue with all facilities for the visiting public and officials were thoroughly monitored, they said.

Earlier, the ministers visited the venues, including the helipad and the District Sports Authority stadium in the town.

Aid to the injured

Later, the ministers called on those who were injured in the road mishap near Tavanampalle at the Government Hospital here, and announced an aid of ₹50,000 each to the deceased persons for immediate expenses apart from all medical help.

After a series of public meetings, awareness rallies and motorcycle yatras, the Tirupati Urban Police got down to enforcing the rule on Thursday. The personnel met motorcyclists on the road and counselled them.

A special drive was conducted at Ramachandra Pushkarini, where two-wheelers were stopped and the importance of wearing a helmet was explained.

Superintendent of Police Gajarao Bhupal said it was time for stern action on the violators, as sufficient time had been given for the public to fall in line. The counselling session extended into a session for imposing fine on the violators.

With the e-challan system, the SMS on the e-fine of ₹100 (for first time offence) was sent directly to the registered mobile number of the two-wheeler owner. Those still not adhering to the rules would be in for trouble, as their vehicles would be seized and produced in the court in future, he warned.

Residents of this coastal town are ringing in the new year by organising the beach festival during the second week of this month. The two-day event is expected to showcase the pristine beauty of the shallow beach, the safest in the coastline of the State and also exhibit the local culture and tradition.

Deputy Speaker and local MLA Kona Raghupati, who is the brain behind the beach festival, said the idea behind the festival was to showcase the beauty of the beach to the people across the State. In yet another innovative move, Mr. Raghupati decided to spend 50% of the allotted fund for the festival to create permanent infrastructure on the beach front.

For the tourists, the beach has become the most favoured destination for the IT professionals from Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has constructed Haritha Beach Resorts, initially with 14 guest houses and later doubled its occupancy.

Mr. Raghupati along with Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar and other officials conducted the review meetings and said they expect a footfall of more than 50,000 for the beach festival. Separate toilets for men and women would be built on the beach, he said. Beach sports like volleyball, kabbadi would be held, and cultural carnival would showcase the rich cultural legacy of the coastal town.

The period during June-December 2014 saw lands being purchased on a large scale. In June, 2014, 530 acres was registered, 685.34 acres in July, 353 acres in August, 567.26 acres in September, 564.91 acres in October, 836.81 acres in November and 531.90 acres in December, Mr. Rambabu said.

A month after forming the government, Heritage Foods bought 14.22 acres in Kantheru village in Tadikonda mandal, followed by the then chief whip Payyavula Keshav, who bought 15.30 acres in Inavolu village, Palle Raghunatha Reddy who purchased 7.56 acres in Thullur.

Kommalapati Sridhar (former MLA) who bought 68.60 acres through Abhinandana Real Estate firm, Lanka Dinakar and former Minister Paritala Sunitha and her son, were also among those who bought lands at cheaper rates even before the announcement on the location of the Capital was made, the YSRCP leader alleged.

Most of TDP leaders from Guntur were also among those who purchased vast tracts of lands as part of insider trading, they alleged.

Vemuri Ravi Kumar, benami of former Minister Nara Lokesh, also bought 62.77 acres in the region, Mr. Rambabu alleged.

In another startling revelation, 800 white ration card holders from AP and 60 from Telangana also bought lands.

Master plan

Mr. Rambabu alleged that irregularities took place in the finalisation of master plan too. The CRDA finalised that the Capital would come up in 217 sq.km and later that was revised to 391.5 sq.km on the basis of a master plan made by Singapore consultant firm. In February 2016, the then government again released a notification confining the Capital area to 217 sq.km and this was done to benefit those who bought lands just outside the core Capital region, Mr. Rambabu alleged.

The zoning of areas by CRDA was also done to benefit a few individuals. Lingamaneni Ramesh, who heads the Lingamaneni Estates, Murali Mohan, and others were among those who benefited by the zoning. The then government realigned the zoning to ensure that their properties are outside the Inner Ring Road, he alleged.

Mr. Rambabu said that all these irregularities would be further probed by investigating agencies and charges would be filed against all the accused.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/82pcm3/article30464731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJAMBATIRAMBABU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-alleges-of-large-scale-insider-trading-in-capital-region/article30464732.ece
113,2020/01/03,RTC bus complex at Anantapur set for expansion,"The employees of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation here are jubilant over the formal merger of the corporation with the State government’s Public Transport Department and they look forward to expansion of services, infrastructure and routes to make public transport more effective.

The joy also stems from the news that the existing bus complex will be expanded very soon and more platforms added. The assurance of Backward Classes Minister M. Sankara Narayana on developing amenities in the complex lends credence to the proposal to construct nine more platforms to ease congestion at the existing 19 platforms.

The Regional Manager, now called Joint Commissioner, M. Jitender Reddy said the focus was on improving revenue from commercial sources mainly by improving the cargo services, for which the land available on the southern side of the complex would be used. Fourteen shops have been let out now on a long lease of 20 years, bringing in extra revenue.

The existing cargo services terminal would be joined with the platforms to provide space for nine more proposed. This would also help stop unauthorised entry of outside vehicles into the complex and create more parking space on the northern side beyond the administrative office building.

Losses

The RTC Anantapur Region sustained a loss of ₹61.08 crore with a revenue of ₹307.72 crore during the current fiscal (till November-end) . The region expects 30 to 50 new buses from among the 1,000 vehicles being acquired by the State government in the near future. It now has a fleet of 936 buses.

With a healthy occupancy rate of 81%, the RTC proposed to develop bus stations in peripheral areas by introducing services to criss-cross the city, the Joint Commissioner said. “Anantapur does not have a city service and these peripheral services will compensate for that,” he opined, adding nowhere the city services were profitable. The per kilometre operational cost was ₹43 and revenue was ₹36. Peripheral bus stations would reduce congestion in the city and lead to lower pollution. Such connectivity would also lead to development of smaller places, he said.

Transferred

Meanwhile, Joint Commissioner M. Jitendra Reddy has been transferred to Kadapa and the current APSRTC Guntur Regional Manager Sumanth R. Adoni has been posted here. Both are likely to assume office on January 6.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/w858a8/article30464748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJATBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rtc-bus-complex-at-anantapur-set-for-expansion/article30464723.ece
114,2020/01/03,Special Police Officers to curb smuggling in State,"The State government has accorded permission to the District Superintendents of Police for appointing 2,156 Special Police Officers (SPOs) on an outsourcing basis to prevent smuggling of sand and liquor at inter-State border checkposts.

According to G.O. Rt No. 4 issued by Principal Secretary (Home) K.R.M. Kishore Kumar on Thursday, the SPOs would be deployed at the checkposts and also in mobile teams to supplement the checkposts.

The checkposts and mobile teams would operate in two shifts per day, requiring 3,234 personnel. Of them, 1,078 will be provided by the Home Department and the remaining 2,156 are Special Police Officers who will be outsourced.

The capital cost will be incurred by the A.P. Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. (APMDC) and the recurring cost jointly by APMDC and Excise Department (A.P. Beverages Corporation Limited).

The Director General of Police has been mandated to take necessary action and the SPs were instructed to appoint SPOs from among the applicants on the basis of efficiency in an accountable and transparent manner.

116,2020/01/03,"CAA: Cong, Left creating unrest among Muslims, says Kanna","BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana accused the Congress and Left parties of creating unrest in the Muslim community by misinterpreting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Speaking to mediapersons at Kadapa after inspecting the arrangements for an awareness programme on January 4 being organised by the BJP on CAA, in which the party’s national working president J.P. Nadda is participating, Mr. Lakshminarayana said the CAA was aimed at giving Indian citizenship to people belonging to the minority communities who fled from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan due to religious persecution but the Opposition parties were apparently raising a hue and cry on it, thereby stoking fears among those sections to derive political mileage.

He recalled that the Congress leaders including Manmohan Singh had wanted the same law (CAA) to be made prior to 2004 when they were in the Opposition and Atal Behari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister.

They now changed their stand and were spreading falsehood on the CAA to appease the minorities, the State BJP chief stated, asserting that the impugned legislation was not at all draconian as is being apprehended.

Thanks to bountiful rains, migratory birds including flamingos have arrived in large numbers at the picturesque Pulicat lake.

Environment Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy will formally inaugurate the festival and release educational posters on the flora and fauna at the lake, the country’s largest brackish water ecosystem after Chilka Lake in neighbouring Odisha.

The district administration has lined up a series of cultural programmes and has appointed special officers to ensure amenities for visitors at Sullurpeta, Atakanithippa, Nelapattu and BV Palem. Centres for Environment Education are being opened to create awareness on the need for protecting the biodiversity, said Sullurpeta Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife) M. Hima Sailaja while overseeing the arrangements for the festival. “Snake shows will be held at Nelapattu and Atakanithippa for the benefit of the youth,” she said.

However, those looking forward to a boat ride at B.V.Palem as in the past will be disappointed as the risky ride on fishing vessels will not be permitted this time in the wake of the boat tragedy in East Godavari district.

The arrival of a variety of aquatic and terrestrial birds including Painted storks, Large and Little egrets, Grey pelicans, Grey herons and water birds like Northern pintails, Black-winged stilts, Northern shovellers, Common teal, seagulls, terns, sandpipers, and common coots began in September and peaked towards the end of December.

121,2020/01/03,Former Minister accuses YSRCP MLA of land grab,"Alleging that Pendurthi MLA Adeep Raj has grabbed 8.68 acres on the bund of a tank, former Minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy has sought the intervention of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Revenue Minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose.

“If the government fails to action against the Pendurthi MLA the TDP will move the court,” Mr. Murthy told the media here on Thursday.

The former TDP MLA alleged that he had brought the issue to the notice of the government in the past, but it was brushed aside as ‘mere allegations’.

“The land in question is located along the bund of Veerraju Cheruvu. I have gathered documentary evidence. The land is shown as Veerraju Cheruvu in the FMB and on the Google maps,” said Mr. Murthy.

Mr. Murthy recalled that YSRCP leader Jami Gangu Naidu had lodged a complaint against his party colleague Mr. Adeep Raj to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the TDP government, alleging land grabbing.

‘Fake documents’

“The land was registered in the name of the paternal uncle of Mr. Adeep Raj in 2008 with the help of fake documents. His application seeking a pattadar passbook was rejected in the past. Now, the officials under the new dispensation are working in favour of the ruling party MLA,” he alleged.

Referring to the Supreme Court judgment that water bodies should not be disturbed, Mr. Murthy said encroachment of the bund would deprive farmers from Gorapalli, Rampuram and Pinagadi villages of irrigation water.

At a pro-CAA rally here, he said, “You should mind your business. Otherwise, you will have to face serious consequences.” He alleged that they were being “misled and misused” by the Congress. “We are 80% of the population and you are just 17%. Don’t test our patience time and again,” he said, and added that if the majority lost their patience, consequences would be bad. He then gave graphic details of the possible violence.

Defends police action

He also defended police action against protesters and suggested that they should have been more aggressive. “If you continue to damage public property, we will not tolerate any more,” he said.

Thousands of right-wing activists, holding saffron banners and flags, participated in the rally that was organised by Desh Bhakt Nagrik Vedike in support of the CAA and the NRC.

123,2020/01/03,Kumaraswamy questions Prime Minister’s ‘Pakistan chanting’,"Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “obsession with Pakistan” in the context of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Friday sought to know if Mr. Modi, who keeps “chanting about Pakistan”, was the Prime Minister of India or of the neighbouring country.

“Did the immigrants or the refugees from Pakistan vote for you or did Indian nationals vote for you?” he asked in a series tweets on Friday.

These followed the Prime Minister’s reference to Pakistan during his speech in Tumakuru on Thursday where he vociferously defended the CAA. “Why are you obsessed with people residing there [Pakistan]? Having been elected by Indians and having become the Prime Minister based on Indian Constitution, what is your priority — development of States or providing citizenship to Pakistanis?”

Karnataka that gave 25 BJP MPs has suffered losses of ₹35,000 crore in floods, but it has got only a fraction of the amount as relief. On the other hand, MGNREGA dues have not been settled and the State has not got its share in taxes, he said. “Since you cannot talk of these things, you speak on Pakistan,” he said.

124,2020/01/03,Modi betrayed State in a big way: Siddaramaiah,"Continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the second day, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday accused him of “betraying the State in a big way” by not announcing any flood relief during his two-day visit, in spite of Karnataka having elected 25 BJP MPs.

While Mr. Siddaramaiah held a press conference, the Congress attacked the Prime Minister in a series of tweets.

“There were a lot expectations from the Centre, but Mr. Modi did not utter a word on providing flood relief to the State. During the 2019 elections, Mr. Modi had said that if the BJP comes to power at both the Centre and the State, the doors of good fortune will open for Karnataka. Forget opening the doors of good fortune, he did not even open the doors of his house to the leaders of his own party,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

He regretted that the Prime Minister had not responded to the State’s plea for flood relief despite Mr. Yediyurappa raising the issue, and said this showed Mr. Modi’s “neglect” towards Karnataka. “Mr. Modi has betrayed Karnataka in a big way,” he said. More than 100 taluks in 22 districts of the State were devastated by floods in 2019.

Hitting out at Mr. Modi for making a “political speech” at Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuru on Thursday, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked what was the necessity of speaking about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and also against the Congress and Pakistan in front of the schoolchildren.

The Congress leader also questioned Mr. Modi for not conferring the Bharat Ratna on Shivakumar Swami of Siddaganga Mutt, who passed away last year at the age of 111. He said he had written a letter seeking conferring the highest civilian award on the seer, but the Prime Minister did not reply at all, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7xeezt/article30473391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGSIDDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/modi-betrayed-state-in-a-big-way-siddaramaiah/article30473392.ece
125,2020/01/03,"PM has promised to ‘consider’ State’s request, says Yediyurappa","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded positively to the State’s demands for more funds for flood relief and assistance for development programmes and promised to “consider” them, said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday.

This clarification from the Chief Minister came after many, including Opposition leaders and farmers’ groups, took exception to Prime Minister Narendra Modi not responding to the issues raised by Mr. Yediyurappa — particularly on flood relief — at the farmers’ convention in Tumakuru on Thursday.

In a move that left many surprised, the Chief Minister raised the issue of “inadequate” flood relief assistance from the Centre and also sought a special package of ₹50,000 crore for irrigation projects in the State. Mr. Modi, who spoke at the event later, did not respond to any of these requests and spoke largely about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The Chief Minister sought to clarify on the issue and said, “In fact, the Prime Minister spoke to me personally and assured me of all help and suggested I come to New Delhi and meet the Ministers concerned to apprise them about the State’s problems and pending projects. He also directed me to prepare a detailed report on this matter.” This assurance came when they met at the Raj Bhavan on Thursday night, sources said.

Interestingly, Mr. Yediyurappa during his speech on Thursday said he would meet the Prime Minister with a delegation of senior Ministers and the Chief Secretary to make a case for the State’s demands. Mr. Modi, however, was not inclined to meet the entire delegation but met Mr. Yediyurappa and assured him of support to the State, sources close to him said.

Mr. Yediyurappa’s speech at the convention has ruffled feathers within the BJP, as the speech is being interpreted as his attempt to assert himself in the party by publicly expressing “unhappiness” about the Mr. Modi-led Union government’s alleged indifference to the demands of the State. They said it was “unthinkable” for a BJP Chief Minister.

‘Being misinterpreted’

A day later, the Chief Minister sought to downplay the import of his own speech and how it is being interpreted. He claimed that a section of the media had attached motive to his speech which was “plain and honest” in its content.

“Being in a federal set-up, there is nothing wrong in placing the facts before the Prime Minister and making submissions. As a Chief Minister, I placed our State’s problems and need of more funds for the development activities. As it was a farmers’ meet, I felt it worthy and timely to plead the Prime Minister for more funds to all the development activities in the State,” he said in a statement on Friday.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bfdnsw/article30473269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pm-has-promised-to-consider-states-request-says-yediyurappa/article30473270.ece
126,2020/01/03,No public exam for class 7,"Class 7 will not be a public examination; however, the government is determined to conduct a common examination from this academic year.

Speaking on the sidelines of a programme on Friday, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said the examination will bring a “smile on the faces of parents and students”. No student will be detained based on its results.

Sources in the department said in all probability, a common paper will be set for the students. Unlike the SSLC exam, however, teachers of the same school are likely to evaluate the answer scripts.“Modalities have yet to be finalised. Details of how the exam will be conducted will be announced shortly,” said officials.

Students and parents have been anxiously waiting for an announcement as there are less than three months for the year-end exam. In fact, State board schools had started preparing for the routine year-end exam as the government had not issued any official orders. The move to conduct a public examination was criticised by the Karnataka State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights. The commission had issued a notice to the department over the proposal and had stated that it was against the mandate of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and other constitutional provisions. The commission had batted for a regular exam to be conducted in the classroom by the subject teacher in a child-friendly environment. Following this notice and deliberation with the commission, the Department of Public Instruction tweaked their plans and mooted for a common exam for class 7 students.

On Tipu in textbooks

Mr. Suresh Kumar said the decision on whether contents pertaining to Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan will be dropped, retained or modified would be taken in consultation with the Chief Minister.

The committee formed by the government in a strongly-worded report stated that lessons pertaining to Tipu should not be modified and students should continue to study the lessons.

It was contended in the petition that Good Newwz gives an impression that all IVF centres are unworthy except the one “projected” in the movie. “For any couple using IVF centre is a serious business and we don’t think that choice will be done based on one movie,” the court said, while observing that though the petition is filed as a public interest litigation, it seeks to represent cause of IVF centres other than one said to have been projected in the movie.

128,2020/01/03,Sea of ASHAs descend on Bengaluru,"Nearly 20,000 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) from across the State landed in Bengaluru’s Central Business District on Friday wearing pink, demanding a fixed monthly honorarium of ₹12,000 and pending payment of Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) incentive.

They launched a massive protest at Freedom Park in the city. Under the banner of Karnataka State Samyukta ASHA Workers’ Association affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), the ASHAs marched from Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna Railway Station in Majestic to Freedom Park. They plan to indefinitely boycott all services from Saturday in their respective villages.

There are 41,268 ASHAs in the State.

Although the workers initially had planned to stage a day-and-night protest in the city for two days from Friday, they dispersed and returned to their respective villages on Friday as they did not get police permission for the second day.

The protesters claimed that the MCTS incentive has been pending for the last 15 months and each ASHA has to get ₹35,000 at the rate of ₹3,000 a month. Apart from a fixed monthly honorarium, their list of 11 demands included de-linking of ASHA incentives from Reproductive Child Health (RCH) portal or ASHA Soft, the Centre’s online payment system for ASHAs, social security and health insurance.

Health Minister B. Sriramulu assured the health activists that their demands would be looked into and requested them to withdraw the strike. A team of health officials led by Principal Secretary Jawaid Akhtar, Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey and Director Patil Om Prakash R. met the workers at Freedom Park and explained to them that eight of their 11 demands, which were as per statutory norms, had been considered. However, the protesters refused to budge.

D. Nagalakshmi, secretary of Karnataka State Samyukta ASHA Workers’ Association, said the government has been giving them “false promises” for years. “Our MCTS incentive has been pending for 15 months and we are demanding ₹3,000 per month. ASHA Soft, which facilitates the Health Department to capture beneficiary-wise details of services given by ASHAs to the community, and also ensure online payments to their bank accounts, is making life harder for us. The beneficiary-wise details that are uploaded by ANMs is invariably delayed or not done properly due to which most do not get paid on time,” she said. “We need a written assurance from the government that all our demands will be met. We will not withdraw till then.”

However, Mr. Pandey said the ASHAs cannot be given a fixed honorarium as the Centre had put in place a performance-based incentive payment mode across the country. “The allegation that incentive payment had not been done for 15 months is false. The remuneration under State government component of ₹4,000, the NHM component of ₹2,000, and performance-based incentives that range from ₹3,000 to ₹4,500 had been paid to ASHAs up to November 2019 and that for December was under process. They are demanding MCTS incentive of ₹3,000 per month, which is not possible as there is no record of services provided by them on the portal. However, we have paid them incentives at the rate of ₹300 per ASHA per month for seven months and the budget for the remaining six months has been disbursed to the districts for payment,” said a note issued by the Commissioner.

Regarding de-linking of ASHA services from RCH portal, the Commissioner said the portal had been introduced across the country to avoid duplication and ensure timely payment. “It cannot be de-linked as data of nine activities is being fetched from the portal for disbursing ASHA incentives,” he said.

Social security

Social security is provided to ASHAs through enrolment under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyothi Bhima Yojana (insurance coverage of ₹2 lakh on death), and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bhima Yojana (insurance coverage up to ₹2 lakh for disability). The annual premium of the schemes is reimbursed by the National Health Mission. That apart, ASHAs are covered under Ayushman Bharath-Arogya Karnataka for health protection.

ASHAs who have served for 10 years and want to retire are given one-time payment of ₹20,000 under NHM. A grievance cell has been constituted at the district and taluk level under the chairmanship of the CEO of zilla panchayat, and executive officer of taluk panchayat, to sort out issues pertaining to ASHAs. They have also been linked to 104 Arogya Sahayavani centre for grievance redressal.

Protesters bring children along

Some ASHAs brought their kids to the protest site, Freedom Park, as they had no means of leaving them behind. They also came prepared with food (rotis and chutney) to last through the day. Although the Karnataka State Samyukta ASHA Workers’ Association had made some arrangement for food and water, not everyone got it. The protesters depended on water stored in open barrels at the venue for their drinking water needs.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iuv45y/article30472949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGASHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sea-of-ashas-descend-on-bengaluru/article30472950.ece
129,2020/01/03,Special court cannot function with staff hired on ad-hoc basis: HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Friday observed that the special court for land-grabbing cases cannot, prima facie, function effectively and smoothly when some staff are appointed on ad-hoc basis from amongst retired government employees and some are working on outsource basis.

The court also found that the State government had not found time to frame rules for appointing staff for the special court as per Section 12 and 18 of the Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition Act, 2011, which came into force with effect from October 9, 2014, and even after the special court was constituted in August 2015.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemanth Chandangoudar made the observations while hearing a PIL petition filed by M.N. Venugopal and others in 2018.

The petitioners questioned the legality of appointing 18 retired government servants for the special court contrary to the government’s 2016 circular prohibiting appointment of retired government officers to various vacant posts on ad-hoc or contract basis. The petitioners also pointed out that 19 of the staff members were working on outsource basis.

As the government counsel said that rules had not been framed for laying down the method of recruitment of staff for the special court, the Bench said that due to failure of the State government to do so, prima facie there was no effective implementation of the Act while pointing out that the purpose of enacting the law itself was gets defeated when it was not implemented substantially.

The court adjourned hearing till January 24, while directing the government to spell out the outer-time limit within which rules should be framed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/special-court-cannot-function-with-staff-hired-on-ad-hoc-basis-hc/article30472937.ece

131,2020/01/03,Farmers’ leaders seek law on MSP,"Criticising successive governments at the Centre for their improper implementation of the price support scheme, the Akhil Bharat Raitha Sangharsh Samiti, a conglomerate of farmers’ organisations, has demanded the government come up with a law that would make scientific Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farm produce mandatory.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Maruti Manpade, leader of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, said that that the proposed law should be based on the recommendations of M.S. Swaminathan-led national commission on farmers.

“No government is consistent on offering MSP to farm produces. There is no legal obligation to the government on offering MSP and fixing prices to each crop. The MSP being offered is unscientific. Firstly, the prices fixed under the scheme are too less as compared to the cost of cultivation. The rent of the land and the wages of family members are not normally included while calculating the cost of cultivation. Secondly, only 10% of the crop grown by the farmers is procured under the scheme, forcing the farmers to sell the remaining crop in the open market at fallen prices. The Union government should enact a law correcting these anomalies so that the government would be legally duty-bound to offer scientific MSP,” he said.

Viewing the duty-free imports of pulses as one of the major reasons for the fall of prices of domestically grown pulses, Mr. Manpade demanded that the Union government impose at least 30% duty on the imports of pulses.

“The Union government has allowed big corporate houses to import pulses without any duty even when the country had a huge stock of domestically grown pulses. We have been demanding the government to impose 30% duty on the imports so that the imports are restricted and prices are stabilised,” he said.

He announced that the conglomerate of farmers’ organisations will stage a dharna in front of Lok Sabha member Umesh Jadhav’s residence on Sunday with a list of demands.

He also announced that all the farmers’ and labourers’ organisations in the district will actively participate in the nationwide strike next Wednesday.

134,2020/01/03,Judicial probe alone with bring out truth: DYFI team,"A judicial probe alone will bring out the truth behind the police excess and violent protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 19, Democratic Youth Federation of India national president Mohammed Riyaz said here on Friday.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Riyaz alleged that the death of 23-year-old Nauseen and 53-year-old Jaleel Kandak on December 19 was nothing but state-sponsored killing. The two, who were innocent, were “unnecessarily shot down by the police.”

Like in Uttar Pradesh, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists have joined the city police in assaulting peaceful protesters that aggregated the situation. “There are videos of RSS activists in plain clothes trashing people in select shops in the city market area on December 19. What happened in Uttar Pradesh is repeated here,” he said. The Centre and the Karnataka government were pushing their agenda of creating unrest in the society by prompting two communities to fight against each other, he alleged.

“The State government is wary about the judicial probe as it will bring out the true reasons behind police firing and violent reaction of protesters,” Mr. Riyaz said.

While demanding removal of Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha, Mr. Riyaz said family members of the deceased should get ₹25 lakh each as compensation. The State government should withdraw false cases booked by police on innocent people following the trouble on December 19, he added.

Mr. Riyaz was part of the DYFI Central Committee delegation that met family members of Nausheen and Jaleel on Friday. The delegation included DYFI Karnataka and Kerala State Presidents Muneer Katipalla and A.Satish, DYFI Kerala State Secretary A.A. Rahim, DYFI Central Committee members S.K Sajish and K.U.

135,2020/01/03,Karnataka: ASHA workers launch massive strike,"Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) from across the State have launched a massive indefinite day-and-night protest in Bengaluru from Friday. Their demands include a fixed monthly honorarium of ₹12,000 and delinking of the Reproductive Child Health (RCH) portal from ASHA Soft, the Centre’s online payment system for ASHAs.

The workers, who descended in the city from across the State, marched from City Railway Station to Freedom Park.

D. Nagalakshmi, secretary of Karnataka State Samyukta ASHA Workers’ Association, said workers who had a meeting with Health Minister B. Sriramulu and top health officials in the city on Monday were not happy with the government’s response to their demands.

“This was our fourth meeting with the Minister and all that we have been getting are false promises. We will stage a two-day day and night strike in Bengaluru and continue the strike indefinitely in our districts till our demands are met,” she said.

136,2020/01/03,Old KSRTC buses to be converted into toilets and mobile libraries,"The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is coming out with plans to to make better use of buses identified for scrapping, which include converting them into toilets for women, mobile library, and skill development centres such tailoring centres for women.

Non-air-conditioned buses of the KSRTC are usually sent as scrap after they complete 9 lakh km of operations, and AC buses are sent after they complete 13 lakh km.

Taking a cue from the Pune Municipal Corporation, the transport corporation is in the process of building a toilet for women in an old ‘Karnataka Sarige’ bus with amenities such as sanitary napkin dispenser, solar operated lights and a baby care centre.

Shivayogi L. Kalasad, MD, KSRTC told The Hindu that they took a decision to convert some of the old buses to provide some facilities at major bus stands. As of now, the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) has come forward to provide ₹12 lakh under its corporate social responsibility initiative to build a toilet for women passengers with other amenities in an old non-AC bus, he said.

He further said that a ‘Sree Toilet’ will be stationed at Majestic bus stand. “We borrowed the idea from the Pune Municipal Corporation, which has converted some old buses into toilets for women. Every day, lakhs of people come to Majestic bus stand to travel in KSRTC buses to various destinations. Providing facilities, such toilets and baby care centres, will help women passengers,” said Mr. Kalasad.

The KSRTC is also celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Majestic bus stand. Earlier, it was announced that the corporation will build a museum at Majestic to highlight how the KSRTC has grown over the years from the erstwhile Mysore Government Road Transport Department to the present-day KSRTC. The corporation is also planning to rope in Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath to display art works using scrap items at its depots.

No takers

Disposing scrap buses has turned out to be a big headache for the State-run road transport corporations.

More than 1,200 old buses, which have been identified for scrapping, continue to lie in workshops and depots of the corporation due to poor demand. For over three years, the corporations has been struggling to find a good bidder for old buses. It is said that demand for scrapped buses came down after demonetisation, and it came further down after introduction of GST.

When asked about unsold scrapped buses, Mr. Kalasad said, “There is stagnation in demand for scrap buses in all the four corporations. The market for scrap buses is very limited. We are taking various measures that include re-floating tenders and decentralising the process to find a better market. Six months ago, we had managed to clear 40% of buses, but now the demand has come down. ”

He said that the corporation usually earns ₹1.5 to ₹1.75 lakh per scrapped bus. Out of the buses that are available for sale, around 800 belong to KSRTC and BMTC. They include some air-conditioned buses.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vd4lqi/article30467917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGBUSSCRAP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/old-ksrtc-buses-to-be-converted-into-toilets-and-mobile-libraries/article30467918.ece
137,2020/01/03,Modi neglected State on several fronts: Congress,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his two-day visit to Karnataka on Thursday, the State Congress unit, in a series of tweets, accused him of “neglecting” the State on several fronts, including releasing inadequate amount in the State’s share of GST, MGNREGA funds, and failure to resolve the Mahadayi river water dispute.

“Where is Achhe din? Where is vikas? ... where is your first press conference?” the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) said in a tweet and questioned the Modi government’s performance in employment generation, brining black money stashed abroad, doubling farmers’ income, and women’s empowerment. Injustice was being meted out to the State in spite of 25 BJP MPs being elected, the Congress said.

In another tweet, it said, “Why you [Mr. Modi] did not visit the State when floods destroyed crops over ₹1 lakh crore” during the last monsoon. “Why the Centre did not declared national calamity when the State was devastated by floods? Why interim relief was not given?”

The Congress said the State government had submitted a report to the Centre estimating rain damage at ₹35,000 crore. But “why did you sit quiet by releasing just ₹1,200 corre”, it said.

The Congress had demanded that the Centre declare the flood situation in the State as a “national calamity”. Floods in more than 100 taluks of 22 districts led to destruction of crops and damage to infrastructure and houses.

Hitting out at the Centre’s policy on doubling farmers’ income, the Congress said 453 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka during the last eight months. “What steps it had taken for prevention of farmers’ suicide,” it tweeted.

On a different note, instead of staging a protest during Mr. Modi’s visit, KPCC Kisan Congress president Sachin Meega visited the families of farmers who have committed suicide and herd their grievances. The Congress criticised the Centre for not granting recognition to the Kannada flag, and opposed imposition of Hindi in banking recruitment examinations.

It said the foundation stone for a helicopter plant was laid at Biderehalla Kaval in Gubbi taluk of Tumakuru district three years ago, but no helicopter had been manufactured so far. A food park at Narasapura was opened about six years ago, but it has not generated jobs as promised, it said.

138,2020/01/03,Modi for creating brand value for State farm produce by setting up clusters,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday assured Karnataka farmers of creating brand value for some of their produce by creating a crop-wise cluster of cultivation areas besides creating infrastructure to facilitate their exports.

“Belagavi and Mysuru are known for pomegranate, Bengaluru and Chickballapur are known for rose onions, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, and Kodagu are known for coffee. These produce will be identified and a brand will be created,” Mr. Modi said after transferring the fourth instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to the bank accounts of farmers across India, at a convention here.

Value addition

He said geographical clusters had been identified to recognise the produce from their cultivation places, and value addition would be made and infrastructure provided to facilitate exports from these districts.

To support coffee growers, value addition to the commodity would be made through integrated coffee development programme. More emphasis would be laid on the production of nutri-cereals and on organic farming, he said.

Mr. Modi, who was wearing a green shawl to empathise with farmers, called upon all States to implement the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana in 2020 to help growers financially. Politics in the implementation of the pro-farmer programme would affect the farming the community, he said.

The role of farmers was important in making India a $5-trillion economy and the government would lay more emphasis on commercial crops and export of agricultural products, the Prime Minister said.

South India’s soil, temperature, and its water connectivity are favourable for agri-exports and the government would utilise them to make a New India, he said.

He said, “We should become self-reliant in the production of rubber and farmers should grow rubber on a large scale to meet the demand.”

Strengthening fisheries

Mr. Modi said the government was trying to strengthen the fisheries sector by encouraging fishery in villages by providing financial assistance, modernising fishing boats under the Blue Revolution scheme, and providing modern infrastructure to promote trade and business in the sector.

He presented Krishi Karman awards to progressive farmers of various States and fishing equipment, including transponders, to fishermen, at the programme.

140,2020/01/03,"In his speech, Yediyurappa asks Modi to release additional flood relief","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who has drawn flak for the Centre releasing “inadequate” flood relief to the State, on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for additional relief during his speech at a farmers’ convention in Tumakuru.

The Chief Minister even said, “I have brought this to the notice of the Prime Minister three or four times, but till now no additional relief has been sanctioned. I request him with folded hands to release it soon,” in Kannada. The Prime Minister, who spoke later at the event, however, did not respond to the Chief Minister’s request in his speech.

Mr. Yediyurappa said the State had witnessed losses to the tune of over ₹30,000 crore because of floods.

‘Stress on irrigation’

Addressing farmers at one of his main support bases of Tumakuru, the Lingayat strongman advised the Prime Minister that his dream of doubling farmers’ income by 2023 could become a reality only if he focused on “providing scientific price to farm produce, bringing water to farms through irrigation, and by interlinking rivers”.

Mr. Yediyurappa’s remarks made at a programme to release the fourth instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana, a farm subsidy cash transfer scheme of the Union government, have raised eyebrows.

Stressing on the key role of irrigation schemes in farmers’ welfare, he sought a special package of ₹50,000 crore for completion of long-pending projects in Karnataka.

The five-minute-long speech is being seen as an attempt by the Chief Minister to assert himself within the party by publicly putting even the Prime Minister on the mat. This comes in the wake of the BJP suffering defeats in multiple States and the party’s victory in the recent bypolls in the State under Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership, both of which have only strengthened the Chief Minister, sources in the party said. “We are curious as to how the party high command will now deal with this public assertion in front of the Prime Minister,” a senior party leader said.

The Chief Minister has been reportedly “deeply unhappy” over the delay in the flood relief by the Union government and also the “inadequate” amount released. The Opposition has attacked him over lack of adequate Central relief, which was interpreted as the BJP central leadership’s reported unhappiness with him. The Chief Minister had then said he was doing a “tightrope walk”.

141,2020/01/03,#GoBackModi trends top on Twitter during PM’s visit,"For the first time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was welcomed to the State with #GoBackModi Twitter campaign on Thursday. The campaign has become a common feature during most of his visits to Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The campaign in Karnataka, which did not witness such protests when a non-BJP party was in power, was seen by the governing party as a “conspiracy by liberals”.

Though “Hum Bharat Ke Log”, a coalition of progressive organisations, had given a call for the Twitter campaign in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, it took on a different dimension.

Issues such as inadequate flood relief to the State, centralising banking exams against the interests of Kannadigas, and GST dues to the State were also raised by the twitterati. There were over 66,000 tweets with the hashtag GoBackModi by 11.30 p.m.

A Twitter user, Prathap Kanagal, said, “Modi is in Karnataka today. Problem Karnataka is facing: unemployment, flood relief, GST dues, MNREGA dues, IBPS. Modi is talking about Pakistan, Kashmir and Article 370, Ram Mandir. Everything Modi spoke today is irrelevant to the problem State is facing. So Karnataka is saying #GoBackModi”.

Suburban rail project

The Prime Minister was also questioned over the delay in the Union Cabinet clearing the suburban rail project for Bengaluru. “Why should Bengaluru wait for decades for a simple thing that other cities have for 100 years?

142,2020/01/03,"Global hackathon, NoRK meet this year: CM","A global hackathon to analyse the challenges faced by the State, to elicit solutions for them and understand the opportunities ahead and a global meet of Non-Resident Keralite (NoRK) professionals for utilising their expertise in skill development of youth will be held in the State.

Announcing this at the valedictory session of the three-day second Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) at the R. Sankaranarayanan Thampi Hall in the Legislative Assembly building here on Friday, the Chief Minister said the government would invite experts for the hackathon to be held later this year. Mr. Vijayan said the government would seriously consider all the suggestions put forward by the delegates at the LKS and take proactive steps for the welfare of the expatriates.

The proposed Youth Leadership Academy for skill development would be set up with the help of expatriates, he told the delegates.

The government would take steps to prepare a comprehensive register of expatriates with the help of the Centre for Development Studies. Diaspora meetings would be held at various regions and delegates from the U.S. and Europe had already come forward to organise them. In order to facilitate trade with Japan, the government was ready to offer land to open an office for the Japan Trade External Organisation.

The government would take a call on insurance schemes for expatriates within three months. An expert committee would be formed to study the problems faced by Malayalis migrated to other States and it would be asked to submit a report by April.

Pointing out that the regional meetings held as part of the LKS had highlighted the legal problems faced by expatriates, Mr. Vijayan said the Law Department had been asked to look into it.

Legal cell

The government would seriously consider the LKS demand for a legal cell for handling property disputes and other cases. The government would entrust Secretary, NoRKA, to look into these suggestions, the Chief Minister said. He urged the delegates to uphold the democratic and secular values of the country.

143,2020/01/03,UDF will intensify protests: Behanan,"The United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership meeting held in the city on Friday decided to intensify the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

On the day of Mahatma Gandhi’s martyrdom, January 30, all district centres would witness human maps created by thousands of people, UDF convener Benny Behanan said here.

The UDF meeting accused Governor Arif Mohammed Khan of making mean and disgraceful statements ill-suited for someone holding a Constitutional position.

The Chief Minister’s silence in the face of the Governor’s unsavoury statements questioning the rights of the Legislative Assembly was surprising, it said, and asked the Chief Minister to meet the Governor to personally convey his protest.

Political decision

Mr. Behanan said that the decision to boycott the Kerala Loka Sabha was a political one.

“None should try to sabotage it,” he said.

The UDF leadership was in complete agreement on the decision to boycott the Loka Kerala Sabha, he said.

It was held for the Chief Minister to make announcements. Even the projects announced in the previous edition were not implemented.

144,2020/01/03,Anti-graft probe against DGP,"The government has asked the Crime Branch to investigate Director General of Police Jacob Thomas on the charge of having acquired ill-gotten wealth in the name of other persons.

In November 2019, the government had received a complaint from one Sathyan Naravoor in Kannur that Mr. Thomas, the senior-most ranking police officer in Kerala, had acquired properties in the name of his nominees.

He demanded that the police investigate Mr. Thomas under the provisions of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (PBPT Act, 1988).

Subsequently, the government transferred the case to the Crime Branch.

The agency recommended an inquiry by a competent officer.

Consequently, the government tasked the SP, CB, Thiruvananthapuram, to probe the complaint.

Punishable up to 7 years

It set December 31, 2020 as the deadline for submitting the inquiry report. The law carries a punishment of up to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and fine.

Mr. Thomas, who was handpicked by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to head the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau in 2016, fell out with the government after the agency booked Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan on the charge of nepotism.

Mr. Thomas had also earned the ire of the High Court for purportedly running a “Vigilance Raj” in Kerala by letting officers off the leash to register anti-corruption cases against government officials without justification. Later, the government passed over Mr. Thomas for the post of State Police Chief. His criticism that the government had responded poorly to the Ockhi Cyclone disaster in 2017 earned him a suspension.

Later, the government took Mr. Thomas to task for publishing a controversial service story without submitting the draft for vetting.

It also soon booked Mr. Thomas on charges of conspiracy, corruption, and bid-rigging in the procurement of costly dredging equipment when he was Director of Ports during the 2011-12 period.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7a12m8/article30473524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03KRAJACOBTHOMAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/anti-graft-probe-against-dgp/article30473518.ece
145,2020/01/03,CAA row may affect smooth start of budget session,"The growing discord between Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the government and the Opposition over his stance on a resolution passed by the Assembly demanding the Centre to rescind the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is likely to impede the smooth start of the Assembly’s budget session that is likely to commence on January 30.

Mr. Khan as well as the government and the Opposition have refused to budge from their stated positions and the slanging match over the Act is set to precipitate the crisis and rupture the ties further.

Customary address

Mr. Khan will have to deliver his customary address to the House on government invitation ahead of the presentation of the budget scheduled for February 7.

While Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has exercised restraint and chosen to steer clear of the row, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan has come out strongly in defence of the resolution and reiterated that the Assembly will take up issues such as the CAA, if needed, in future too.

The Opposition Congress had also raised a demand for moving a similar resolution in the Assembly against the CAA and more States are likely to follow suit too.

Only to Centre

Government sources told The Hindu that the resolution in question would not be forwarded to the Governor and would only be sent to the Centre from the Law Department as a routine procedure. But a thaw in relations was imperative for inviting the Governor to address the House.

The Governor enjoys protection under Article 361 of Constitution which says that he shall not be answerable to any court for exercising and performing his powers and duties. It also seals the scope for initiating any criminal proceedings against him while in office.

Hence, it has become obvious that Mr. Khan may not relent to the combined political duress of the government and the Opposition, be it on the CAA or any such issue.

The current political climate, especially when the protest against the Act is spreading fast across the country, neither the rival fronts nor the government have a leeway to retract from their positions. Though a rapprochement seems to be elusive at present, a solution may evolve before the government sets the date for the session, the sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caa-row-may-affect-smooth-start-of-budget-session/article30473509.ece
146,2020/01/03,"Which law did Assembly violate, asks Kodiyeri","Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has accused Governor Arif Mohammad Khan of passing remarks that do not augur well for the spirit of the Constitution.

Mr. Balakrishnan said in a statement here on Friday that Mr. Khan had been saying that a resolution on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, passed by the Assembly was unconstitutional without citing which law the House had violated.

Mr. Khan should also specify the law on which he had based his objections to the resolution, Mr. Balakrishnan said.

Earlier too, the Assembly had passed resolutions on a number of issues, but none of the Governors had conducted themselves in a similar manner.

Political game

He accused Mr. Khan of playing a cheap political game.

Sensible Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders should advise Mr. Khan that such moves would not work in the State, he said.

A Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Jagadish Singh Khehar, Madan B. Lokur, N.V. Ramana and others had categorically ruled in 2016 that the Governor did not have the powers to interfere in the functions of the Assembly.

147,2020/01/03,Serves no purpose: Governor,"A day after terming the resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as unconstitutional, Governor Arif Mohammad Khan said here on Friday that his intention was to make clear that the exercise did not serve any purpose.

Mr. Khan told the media that using the Assembly which was a Constitutional body to speak up things that were not in accordance with the Constitution was indeed an improper act.

“This exercise does not serve any purpose, but a waste of public money. The law dealing with citizenship is clearly within the Union List of the Constitution. It is a non-issue for Kerala. Citizenship law has to be uniform and that is the responsibility of the Central government. Opinions can be registered outside the Assembly. However, when the Assembly has been chosen for the same, you are wasting the resources, which should have been spent on public welfare,” he said.

Duties of Governor

He also requested the politicians who were critical of him to read the Constitution and get an idea on the duties of the Governor before airing their criticism. “I took oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law. I shall devote myself to the service and well being of the people of Kerala. As the representative of the President of India, if any law is criticised in my presence, I have a sacred duty to defend it,” he said.

He sought to warn the political leaders who reportedly made calls against his public appearances. “As per IPC section 124, trying to intimidate or overawe the President of India or the Governor of a State is a cognizable offence. I am making this point not to frighten anybody, but only to tell them that as responsible people in public life they should not speak in a language which goes against the Constitution and law of the land,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/serves-no-purpose-governor/article30473502.ece
148,2020/01/03,No longer outsiders in their own land,"The relevance of a platform for non-resident Keralites to come together and communicate their ideas and needs with the government was the key thrust of an open forum on ‘Loka Kerala Sabha — experiences and expectation’ organised at the Legislative Assembly Complex on Friday on the sidelines of the summit.

Writer Benyamin saw the emergence of such platforms as part of a larger change in how society now views people who have migrated out of their homelands for better prospects.

“In the past, such people were considered as outsiders in their native land, and as second class citizens in the countries they worked in. Now, it is believed that their own countries have a responsibility toward these people. From being seen as mere sources of money, they are considered as individuals and as citizens. Ninety-six countries have now given non-residents full voting rights, with facilities to vote in the places where they reside. So many of those who have left this land for better prospects have ideas to share. Though some might see the LKS as utopian, this is the best platform for these people to interact with the government,” said Mr. Benyamin.

Address of one’s own

Writer Manasi said she after being part of the LKS, she now felt she had an address of her own in Kerala. “I left Kerala more than 34 years ago. Though only people who live outside the country are seen as ‘pravasis,’ even those living outside the State, like me in Mumbai, also have to face the same rootlessness.

Also, there is a difference between the way the men and women experienced this, in those days. I was initially overcome with the fear of not knowing the language and of travelling alone. There was not even a woman to be seen in the literary meets of that time in Mumbai. Now, that has changed,” she said.

Filmmaker P.T. Kunju Muhammed said the non-resident Keralites, who migrated to the Middle East in the 1970s, were for long seen with contempt by society.

‘Persiakkar’

“We used to be known as ‘Persiakkar,’ those who migrated to Persia. Even those intellectuals whose Gulf sojourns and awards were funded by the NRKs, viewed them with contempt. But the NRKs did not let any of this affect them, and slowly worked their way to become the biggest economic force in Kerala,” he said.

Disaster management expert Muralee Thummarukudy called the LKS a unique experiment, which facilitates the communication between Malayalis anywhere in the world with the government here.

“If this becomes a success, it could become a model for the entire world. The evaluation needs to be done maybe after two decades, when the true impact of this initiative would be known. But, we need to look forward in our discussions here, by including subjects that matter in the 21st century,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/z6pr7l/article30473451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TVTVLOKAKERALASABHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-longer-outsiders-in-their-own-land/article30473452.ece

Dr. John said the event had been planned to provide a common platform for students, researchers, and faculty members from disciplines such as science, commerce, and social sciences from academic institutions within the country.

Internationally acclaimed experts in environmental science and management would deliver lectures on issues pertaining to the focal theme.

150,2020/01/03,Relief to ailing cashew sector,"Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) suspending the import of borma (semi-finished) kernels will definitely offer some relief to ailing cashew sector, said officials of Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI) at a press meet.

The import misusing Advance Authorisation Scheme has been one big challenge for the sector, mainly affecting small and mid-level processors.

The scheme allows duty-free imports if they are part of a product going to be exported. “Exploiting the ad hoc norms approved in July 2018 for the export of cashew kernels, borma kernels worth around ₹500 crore have landed in Indian ports so far. Four lakh kg of borma kernels were imported during last month alone,” said CEPCI vice chairman Abdul Salam.

Major threat

The inflow of semi-finished kernels from countries like Vietnam, Ivory Coast and Mozambique has been posing a major threat to the prospects of domestic market and the council feels the latest development will give a new lease of life to cashew sector.

In July 2019 DGFT had issued another notification hiking the import price for broken cashew to ₹680 per kg from ₹288 and that of whole cashew to ₹720 per kg from ₹400.

This new policy prohibiting the imports below these prices had helped the industry, but then traders resorted to the loopholes in Advance Authorisation Scheme to bring in consignments of shelled and unpeeled kernels.

This cashew is later re-processed and released to the market and it requires only minimal manpower for processing.

“CEPCI had appealed to the government several times regarding the issue and we welcome the new notification. Curbing the practice will definitely strengthen the industry and open more markets,” said R.K. Bhoodesh, former chairman.

Vexing problem

At the same time processors argue that none of the recent changes are capable of addressing the issue of misdeclared shipments reaching Indian ports.

During the past few months tonnes of broken kernels have landed in India under various Harmonised System Nomenclature (HSN) codes including those for animal fodder and agricultural rejects. Though it was brought to notice of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and many consignments were sized, the practice still continues.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/relief-to-ailing-cashew-sector/article30473416.ece
151,2020/01/03,Bamboo bolsters a tribal economy,"A cup of tea is served in a bamboo mug and one can drink it sitting on a bamboo chair. At the Kallickal tribal settlement, near Uppukunnu, in Udumbannur grama panchayat here, bamboo has become a part of life. Items ranging from furniture to kitchenware, in addition to baskets, mats, and boxes are artistically crafted here. In effect, plastic has been replaced by bamboo.

The ‘bamboo village’ came into being after a group comprising 19 women were trained by Kirtads (Kerala Institute for Research, Training and Development Studies of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) in making bamboo utensils and marketing them. The movement is relevant in the wake of the plastic ban in the State and the village is hoping to make a livelihood through these products. Around 140 bamboo items are made here.

Lengthy process

P.V. Sunil, secretary of the bamboo village project, said the villagers collected bamboo from the forest but were wary of over-exploitation. The cut bamboo is put in hot water and dried completely.

“It takes at least 28 days to make a bamboo cup; including the four-day period of keeping it idle and five days of of soaking it in hot water. The process is followed to make the products durable and pest-resistant,” he said. There are also miniature bamboo baskets and mats for the purpose of display, he added.

Simi, a bamboo artisan, said they made bamboo products after completing their other chores. “We have exhibited the products in various fairs and are getting orders. The products are made mostly depending on the orders,” she said.

Bamboo houses

The tribespeople were earlier adept in building bamboo houses. Over the years, the houses were replaced by those provided under various government projects.

A few tribespeople are still skilled in building strong bamboo houses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3fbn7a/article30473407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvidukki,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bamboo-bolsters-a-tribal-economy/article30473408.ece
152,2020/01/03,Stop harassing coastal people: Sabha,"The Dheevara Sabha has urged the State government to stop harassing people living in coastal areas in the name of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations.

In a press statement issued here on Friday, Dheevara Sabha general secretary V. Dinakaran alleged that officials with local self government institutions had been visiting houses and forcing the people to give “written declarations”.

“The government should not consider fishermen families who have been living in coastal areas for so long and encroachers in the same way,” Mr. Dinakaran, former MLA, said.

CRZ violation

He said that as per a list prepared, 50,000 houses along the coastline would have to be demolished in the State for violating Coastal Regulatory Zone norms.

“The government should submit the list to the Supreme Court after omitting the houses of coastal people. It should not initiate steps that will lead to the eviction of people from coastal areas. If needed, the government should enact a law to protect the interest of fishermen and people living in coastal areas,” he added.

The Dheevara Sabha also warned of protests if the government continue to target the coastal people in the State.

Unauthorised

Last month, the Alappuzha Coastal District Committee (CDC) had identified as many as 4,536 unauthorised constructions in Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) area in the district.

According to third interim report published on the website of Alappuzha district administration (http://alappuzha.nic.in), the highest number of 822 CRZ violations are in Punnapra South grama panchayat in Ambalappuzha taluk.

It is followed by 429 unauthorised constructions in Punnapra North, 427 in Mararikulam South and 412 in Mararikulam North grama panchayats.

Of the 36 local bodies including four municipalities and 32 grama panchayats to which CRZ rules are applicable, CRZ violations have been found in two municipalities and 26 grama panchayats.

Officials said that unauthorised constructions in the zone included fishermen dwelling and other buildings.

Violations

Earlier, following the Supreme Court verdict in the Maradu illegal flat case, the State government proposed to look into all constructions along the coast for CRZ violations in the State.

The CDC with district collector as chairman was constituted as per a Government order issued in October for carrying out the process.

Speaking to reporters at Kayamkulam, Mr. Vasu, also former president of SNDP Yogam Mavelikara Union, called the father-son duo a “Dracula” who sucked the blood of Ezhava community.

“Natesan and his family has siphoned off huge amounts from the Yogam. He has cheated an entire community. The SNDP Yogam is enmeshed in corruption. The source of the income of the Vellappally family should be examined,” Mr. Vasu said, adding that the family had bought a flat at Macau in China. He said Thushar had cheated the National Democratic Alliance, of which BDJS is a constituent. The BDJS is the political arm of the SNDP Yogam.

He said more revelations against the Vellappally family would be made at a joint press conference with former State Police Chief T.P. Senkumar in Thiruvananthapuram on January 16.

Explanation sought

The outburst comes a day after the BDJS State council decided to seek an explanation from Mr. Vasu for indulging in anti-party activities. Thushar had alleged that Mr. Vasu cheated the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and the BDJS. “He was involved in several financial frauds. He has been given 15 days to give an explanation. If found unsatisfactory, the party will take action against him,” Thushar said on Thursday.

Union dissolved

Last week, the SNDP Yogam dissolved its Mavelikara union. The Yogam general council took the decision after the Crime Branch launched a probe against Mr. Vasu, who was the union president, and secretary B. Suresh Babu, among others, based on a complaint that they had been involved in a financial fraud under the banner of a microfinance scheme.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bdjs-leader-flays-vellappally-thushar/article30473304.ece
159,2020/01/03,Concern over proposal to bifurcate Palakkad rail division,"Rail users in north Kerala have expressed concerns about a proposal of the Ministry of Railways to either bifurcate or disband the Palakkad division.

The proposal to bifurcate the Mangaluru section under the Palakkad division for the creation of a new division at Hubli in Karnataka was mooted less than a year ago.

Similarity

For many, the move has a striking similarity to the creation of the Salem division by carving 75% of the route from the Palakkad division in 2007.

“Such a proposal will sound the death knell for the Palakkad division. After the formation of Salem division, the track of the Palakkad division has been reduced to less than 600 km. This bifurcation was also against the principles of railways,” Shyam Sundar, member of the Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee, said. He said that the Mangaluru section was a major income earner for the Palakkad division. Bifurcation of this section would also reduce revenue generation. This happened in the case when the Salem division was formed. Besides, the Railways stipulate that a division should have 600 km of track, Mr. Sundar added.

There are other factors as well affecting the rail commuters in Malabar or even the State. If the Managluru section is cut off from the Palakkad division, then the Nagercoil section under the Thiruvananthapuram division will also go, for the creation of the Tirunelveli division, C.E. Chakkunni, working president, Confederation of All India Rail Users Associations, said.

He said that the Ministry of Railways had also come out with another move to have one railway division in the State.

That was to merge the existing Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram divisions and create a new division at Ernakulam.

“All these years, we have been demanding for a zone in the State and for establishing an integral coach factory at Palakkad. Now we will lose two divisions,” Mr. Chakkunni said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/concern-over-proposal-to-bifurcate-palakkad-rail-division/article30473293.ece
160,2020/01/03,DST orders probe into SCTIMST affairs,"The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here is yet again in the eye of a storm with its parent department, Department of Science and Technology (DST), ordering an inquiry into a long list of contentions raised by T.P. Senkumar, former State Police Chief and a member on the governing body of the institute, against the manner of its functioning. According to the information received, the DST has instituted a three-member committee, including former Director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Govardhan Mehta, NIMHANS Director and Vice Chancellor B.N. Gangadharan, and former State Vigilance Commissioner and DGP Jacob Thomas.

It will inquire into the contentions raised by Mr. Senkumar in his 1000-plus pages report sent to Union Minister for Health, Science and Technology, Harsh Vardhan.

The committee has been asked to submit its report within a month.

No formal intimation

SCTIMST authorities, while denying receiving any formal intimation from the DST, said it would welcome any inquiry into its functioning and that the institute would present all documents and records before the inquiry committee.

The issues brought up by Mr. Senkumar is just the latest in the long list of grouses raised against the SCTIMST in recent times.

The institute had come under a cloud following its recent decision to extend fully subsidised care to the destitute alone and limit subsidies to BPL at 30%, citing financial difficulties.

Its refusal to join the Ayushman Bharat-Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati, the State government’s health insurance scheme, even nine months into the scheme citing that the treatment package rates were “unviable”, had also raised a storm, with the matter even reaching Parliament.

This denial of high-end care at the SCTIMST to those who cannot access it elsewhere seems to have figured prominently in the report sent by Mr. Senkumar, who has also raised issues of anomalies in the selection of candidates, appointments, and promotions in the institute.

“I was inducted as a member of the institute’s governing body only nine months ago and I have attended only two GB meetings during this period. I am not a signatory to many decisions taken at these meetings and had refused to sign the minutes of the meeting as I had raised objections on several counts and had insisted that my dissent note be made separately. There are several issues in the manner in which the SCTIMST is being run and while it has some of the best brains in the country working with loyalty and dedication, none of them are happy there,” Mr. Senkumar told The Hindu.

He also pointed out that there was no proper system of complaints redressal at the institute.

The SCTIMST maintained that most of the allegations raised by Mr. Senkumar were against the collective decisions taken by the governing body or institute body and that these had been found to be baseless.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dst-orders-probe-into-sctimst-affairs/article30473286.ece
161,2020/01/03,Leopard rescued from well,"Forest Department personnel rescued a leopard which had fallen into an open well at Vattavayal, near Vythiri in the district, on Friday.

Officials suspected that the leopard fell into the well while chasing prey in front of the house a private individual.

When Gopi, the house owner, discovered the leopard around 6.30 a.m , he alerted the Forest Department, who soon arrived at the spot.

A Rapid Response Team from Sulthan Bathery was also brought in for the rescue operation.

Crowd control

As the word spread, hundreds of people arrived to see the leopard. Forest Department personnel had a tough time controlling the crowd as many people started taking photographs and videos.

Officials finally dispersed the crowd as they were worried that the noise would further agitate the leopard.

According to South Wayanad Forest divisional officer B. Ranjith, the male leopard aged about three years had fallen into the well which was about 35 ft deep and which had about 5 ft of water in it.

Tranquillised

The rapid response team and department personnel tranquillised the leopard and extricated it from the well around 10.30 a.m.

Forest veterinary surgeon Arun Zachariah administered the tranquilliser dart. Later, the leopard was transported in a cage to the wildlife rescue centre at Lakkidi for observation.

“The leopard is healthy and was not injured,” Mr. Ranjith said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7ywmm6/article30473260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvwyleopardrescueoperation1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/leopard-rescued-from-well/article30473261.ece
162,2020/01/03,VCs must get more space: Governor,"In an apparent reference to the recent controversies that rocked the State’s higher education sector, Governor Arif Mohammad Khan here on Friday called up on Vice Chancellors (VCs) of the universities to rise above the interests of the political class and adhere to the acts and statutes that govern them.

Speaking at an interactive session with the Vice Chancellor, pro vice chancellor, Syndicate and faculty members of the Mahatma Gandhi University on the university campus on Friday, Mr. Khan observed that the VCs should be given more space.

On controversies

“If anybody of the university tries to bring pressure on you to do something, which is in departure from the law, then make it clear to them that you are not going to oblige and refer the matter to me. I as the Chancellor will take the responsibility,” he said.

Regarding the recent controversies in MG University, the Governor said they brought shame to the institution.

Labs visited

“What kind of system are we operating? Will the episode, which was widely reported by the press, help us make the university a nationally acclaimed one or will it downgrade us? Your achievements can make you an internationally acclaimed university. Then how did these things happen here,” the Governor asked.

He was welcomed by MGU Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas, PVC C.T. Aravindakumar and registrar K. Sabukuttan.

The Governor visited laboratories under the International and Inter-university centre for Nano Science and Nano Technology and the farmland of the Inter University Centre for Organic Farming and Sustainable Agriculture.

Researcher detained

Earlier, the Gandhinagar police detained a woman research scholar at the varsity here following reports of her planning to approach the Governor to lodge a complaint against university Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas. The scholar, identified as Deepa P. Mohanan , was let off later. The police clarified that she had been taken into preventive custody as part of the security arrangements provided to the Governor.

Deepa, a Dalit research fellow at the Nanoscience department had raised a cast discrimination complaint against her guide to the Vice Chancellor. She tried to meet the Governor to file a complaint stating that the Vice Chancellor was protecting the accused, instead of acting upon her complaint.

Speaking to mediapersons later, Mr. Khan said he was unaware of the incident but would look into the matter if gets any written complaint.

Black flags

166,2020/01/03,Judge seeks introduction of plea bargaining,"A seminar on the significance of plea bargaining conducted at the district jail at Malampuzha near here on Thursday threw light on the advantages of this unique legal measure.

Leading the session for the 200 male and eight female inmates of the jail, V. Vijayakumar, District Judge (Family Court), Kasargod, lamented that almost every stakeholder in the country’s criminal judiciary system was virtually oblivious of the merits of plea bargaining.

Plea bargaining is an arrangement between the prosecutor and the defendant whereby the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a more lenient sentence or an agreement to drop other charges.

“Plea bargaining can improve our criminal justice system tremendously,” said Dr. Vijayakumar. He urged his colleagues and the legal fraternity to initiate measures to introduce plea bargaining.

District Collector D. Balamurali presided over the seminar organised by the Victims Information, Sensitisation, Welfare and Assistance Society (VISWAS), a voluntary non-governmental body working for the welfare of the victims of various crimes. VISWAS held the seminar as part of celebrating its seventh anniversary.

Mr. Balamurali said that introduction of plea bargaining would help the criminal courts in the country to reduce their pendency of cases.

167,2020/01/03,Nothing unconstitutional: Speaker,"There is ‘nothing unconstitutional’ about the Kerala Assembly’s special session passing a resolution recently, demanding that the Centre rescind the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan said on Friday.

“Nowhere in the Constitution is it mentioned that a State Assembly cannot move such a resolution,” the Speaker said responding to Governor Arif Mohammad Khan’s comment that the resolution passed was “unconstitutional and insignificant.”

‘Moral duty’

The Speaker said the Assembly had upheld the Constitutional values and was duty-bound to intervene when the Constitution was under threat. Like other democratic platforms, the Assembly had the right to respond when the Constitution was challenged.

He described it as the moral duty of the Assembly.

The Speaker said the Constitution was clear that there should not be any discrimination on the basis of religion.

The Act had blatantly violated Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution.

The Assembly had passed resolutions earlier also against laws passed by the Parliament, the Speaker said.

Precedent

In 1975, the Assembly had asked for the repeal of Maintenance of Internal Security (MISA). In 2006, it sought the repeal of the Income Tax amendment that affected the cooperative department.

Last year, the Speaker said, the Assembly had passed a resolution to remove Section 194 of the IT Act.

On BJP Rajya Sabha MP G.V.L. Narasimha Rao seeking permission of the Rajya Sabha Chairman to move the a breach of privilege motion against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for moving the resolution against a law passed by the Parliament, the Speaker said one House cannot move a breach of privilege motion against another elected House.

“But, if they are insisting on the motion, they should move the privilege motion against the Speaker, Leader of Opposition, and all the legislators who had spoken on the floor of the House during the special session. We are ready to face it,” he added.

On Governor’s sanction

To a query on whether the Governor was kept in the dark about the resolution, the Speaker said the special session was convened to ratify the amendment on SC/ST quota in the Lok Sabha and other assemblies.

The Business Advisory Committee of the Assembly finalises the proceedings and there is no need to seek the Governor’s sanction, Mr. Sreeramakrishnan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/o70fd0/article30473184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvwyflashlightprotestmarch21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nothing-unconstitutional-speaker/article30473185.ece
168,2020/01/03,Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan writes to 11 CMs on Citizenship Amendment Act,"Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to 11 Chief Ministers, urging them to emulate the model set by the Kerala Assembly in passing a resolution demanding that the Centre scrap the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019.

Mr. Vijayan’s move to elicit the cooperation of 11 States in the fight against the CAA comes in the wake of Bharatiya Janata Party leader G.V.L. Narasimha Rao filing a petition with the Rajya Sabha Chairman for initiating breach of privilege proceedings against him for passing the resolution.

Mr. Vijayan, in his letter, said the Act had triggered apprehensions among large sections of society and the need of the hour was unity among all Indians who wished to protect the country’s democratic and secular values. People from different sections, irrespective of their different opinions, should unite to preserve the basic tenets of the polity which form the cornerstone of democracy, he said.

‘NPR put on hold’

Kerala had decided to address the apprehensions about the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) would eventually lead to the NRC. The government had stayed all activities related to the NPR in the State, he said.

Drawing attention to the resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly on December 31 expressing concern over the impact of the CAA on the nation’s secular credentials and requesting the Centre to repeal it, Mr. Vijayan said States that felt that the Act should be repealed could consider similar steps. It would be an eye-opener to the proponents of CAA and NRC, he said.

169,2020/01/03,Kerala Culture Minister slams Centre for rejection of R-Day tableau,"The Kerala government on Friday slammed the decision of the Central government to reject the State’s design for a carnival float it had aspired to put on display at the prestigious Republic Day Parade in New Delhi on January 26.

Culture Minister A.K. Balan said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government had sidelined Kerala and excluded it from the parade merely for “petty political reasons”.

He said the model for the tableau, to have been mounted on a truck platform and exhibited at the cultural procession at Rajpath, represented Kerala’s cultural uniqueness exceptionally well.

The blueprint also highlighted Kerala’s distinctive architectural splendour, its famed snake boats, spice trading past and flora and fauna, including wild elephants and tigers.

The trailer portion of the float would have had artists staging ‘kalari’ movements, ‘Mohiniyattam’ dance and other art forms such as ‘Theyyam’, ‘Padayani’, ‘Koodiyattam’ and ‘Ottamthullal’.

Against spirit of federalism: Minister

However, the Centre seemed to see red at the very mention of Kerala. It summarily rejected the proposal. “Why this hate towards Kerala and Malayalees,” he asked. The Centre’s stance ran against the spirit of federalism, he said.

Jaya Prabha Menon, a member of the screening committee under the Union Ministry of Defence, told a news channel in New Delhi that Kerala’s design was repetitive.

The committee had asked the State to re-submit a renewed concept with new themes instead of “wearily recurrent motifs”. However, the government drafters kept sending the same design, she said.

‘No political dimension’

Ms. Menon said there was no political dimension to the decision to reject Kerala's proposal. “It was purely based on merit,” she told the news channel.

Kerala now joins the list of West Bengal and Maharashtra whose designs were similarly rejected by the Centre.

The West Bengal government’s proposal was rejected after an Expert Committee examined it in two rounds of meeting, according to a Defence Ministry statement.

The alliance partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government of Maharashtra on Thursday said the Centre’s rejection was prejudiced. The theme for the State’s tableau was to be on 175 years of Marathi theatre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/36namd/article30468325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TABLEAU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-culture-minister-slams-centre-for-rejection-of-r-day-tableau/article30468295.ece
170,2020/01/03,Health dept. to focus on keeping waterborne diseases at bay,"Everything went so well at that wedding event in Kozhikode district some time ago until many guests complained of uneasiness and had stomach upset. Health Department officials who reached the area in subsequent days could not first detect the cause as the host was very firm that there was no compromise on the quality of food or water.

“Only later we realised that unbeknown to the host, some of his relatives and local residents had collected water from an unhygienic water source and it was used for cooking,” said a senior official, pointing out that the instances of viral hepatitis is turning out to be a major public health challenge they face these days. The beverages being served as “welcome drink” at many events is also turning out to be a concern, she claimed.

This year, the department is planning to focus more on this issue as part of Arogya Jagratha, the State Government’s ongoing ambitious scheme to check infectious diseases.

Sources said that many people were found to opt for cheap commercial ice blocks to prepare welcome drink as clean and pure ice would cost more. The water source for the preparation of that ice might not be hygienic, and it could lead to serious health issues, they claimed. Though the Kozhikode district administration in 2019 had mandated licence for those serving food and drinks during religious festivals and feasts, it was not being followed at many places. The lack of public involvement in ensuring hygiene is often leading to problems too, say Health officials.

In the city Corporation area, wayside eateries serving cut fruits and marinated delicacies also pose a health hazard. According to sources, though the health wing of the Corporation had issued licence to over 100 such vendors after examining their hygiene standards, there are a total of 200 vendors operating within the city. Asha Devi, Additional District Medical Officer, told The Hindu that hand-washing and use of only boiled water for cooking would keep waterborne diseases at bay. “The State is expected to face water shortage in the summer months. The vessels to keep drinking water should be properly closed with lid,” she added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4cb19u/article30467487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03CTWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/health-dept-to-focus-on-keeping-waterborne-diseases-at-bay/article30467488.ece
171,2020/01/03,"CM misused Rahul Gandhi’s letter, says Ramesh Chennithala","Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said on Thursday that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had sent only a customary reply to the letter sent by the State Government and that he lauded the Loka Kerala Sabha because of his high morals.

“However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan misused the letter to create controversy and for political interest when the United Democratic Front (UDF) boycotted the Sabha,” he said.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Chennithala said that when the Chief Minister wrote a letter to Mr. Gandhi, who is a Member of Parliament from Wayanad, he had sent a reply to it on December 12. But the UDF decided to boycott LKS on December 20.

“Loka Kerala Sabha is happening at a time when the State is facing huge financial crisis,” he said and added that it was beyond understanding why the Government was spending ₹25 crore on it now.

He alleged that all development works in the State had been stalled due to lack of funds. Besides, the Government was yet to settle issues of Pravasis, raised in the first LKS. The UDF decision was taken by considering these factors, he added. Mr. Chennithala said the World Bank, under the first phase of Rebuild Kerala project, had given ₹1,780 crore as assistance with a condition that the funds must be handed over to flood victims within a week. However this amount was yet to reach victims, he alleged.

On the Assembly resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said the UDF’s stand on the issue was right. “I have personally filed a plea before the Supreme Court to re-examine the CAA and have also appealed to the State government to file petition before the apex court in this regard,” he said.

176,2020/01/03,Row over Syro-Malabar Mass raises its head again,"The question whether the celebrant should face the congregation (westward) or eastward during the holy Mass, a bone of contention in the Syro-Malabar Church for several decades, is back in focus again.

On the agenda of the Church synod meeting at St. Thomas Mount here, headquarters of the Church, from January 7 are possible changes to the liturgy and the direction the celebrant should take during Mass.

Monsignor Varghese Njaliath, senior priest and an expert on liturgy, on Thursday made an appeal to the synod not to ban the practice of priests celebrating Mass facing the congregation. He was speaking at a seminar on liturgy at the Renewal Centre here. There was a general opinion at the seminar that it was not to the east but to the Cross of Christ that the priest should look during Mass.

Fr. Njaliath said the spirit of the Second Vatican Council should be imbibed and no restriction should be imposed on offering Mass facing the congregation. Pastoral councillor secretary P. Gerard spoke on the agenda of the Synod. Around 1,200 representatives from different parishes of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese participated in the seminar.

‘Liturgical unity’

In the controversy, a golden mean was struck sometime back with the celebrant being allowed to face the congregation up to the homily and then being allowed to celebrate the consecration of the host and rest of the Mass facing away from the people. Even the compromise formula has been skipped in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese where the mass is celebrated with the celebrant facing the congregation throughout. There is a large section of the faithful in the archdiocese who fear a ban on Mass facing the congregation, to bring about liturgical unity.

Meanwhile, the Thrissur archdiocese said it had always taken a neutral position on the issue. “We are ready to abide by the decision of the synod,” archdiocese sources said.

Sources in the Thamarassery diocese said the agenda of the synod is finalised only in its first sitting.

Any propaganda about the items on the agenda of the synod is obviously a part of the defence mechanism of those who have vested interests.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/afdl4w/article30467648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvchurch,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/row-over-syro-malabar-mass-raises-its-head-again/article30464263.ece

178,2020/01/03,Manuscripts of Gundert legacy from Deutschland,"The second Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) in session in the capital on Thursday became the venue for the handing over of the digital archives of German missionary-cum-scholar Herman Gundert, the great lover of Malayalam language and literature who spent two decades in Kerala till April 1859.

Incidentally, the hard disc of the digital archives was handed over to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan by Heike Oberlin, Professor of Indology, University of Tubingen, Germany. Attired in traditional Kerala sari, Ms. Oberlin, a Koodiyattam exponent, communicated with the Chief Minister in Malayalam with ease.

For her, it was a successful mission as the attempt to hand over the hard disc to the Chief Minister at the University of Tubingen during his recent European visit did not succeed.

It was in Tubingen University that Gundert took doctorate before coming to Kerala in 1838. The university library had taken up the project to digitise and make available online the legacy of Herman Gundert to Malayalam and other languages. The corpus of nearly 80 manuscripts, 150 printed works, and some palm leaf manuscripts of the German scholar available with the university runs into some 42,000 pages.

Besides manuscripts, printed works, and palm leaf manuscripts, the Malayalam-English dictionary which he began compiling in Kerala and completed in Germany, notes prepared for grammar, and the books of his friends had been digitised.

Ms. Oberlin said 1,37,148 pages, including 142 manuscripts, had been digitised and 24,000 pages were available online and could be accessed free of charge from gundert-portal.de/

“It is a honour for me and the varsity to take forward the work started by Dr. Gundert. People in Kerala love him for his love for language and literature,” Ms. Oberlin, who first came to Kerala in 1993 as part of an academic programme as an Indology student, said. Later, she mastered Malayalam and got trained in Koodiyattam and Nangiarkoothu at the Kerala Kalamandalam in 1995.

Course in Malayalam

She said mastering Malayalam was difficult when compared with other languages. Tubingen University had commenced the maiden course in Malayalam. Besides students from Germany, there were students from other European countries for the course.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/viiobq/article30464197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvgundu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/manuscripts-of-gundert-legacy-from-deutschland/article30464194.ece

180,2020/01/03,"Initiatives have curbed trafficking of tribespeople, govt. informs High Court","The initiatives taken by the State government have brought under control trafficking of tribespeople in Wayanad to Karnataka for working in agricultural lands, according to a submission made by the State government before the High Court.

The submission was made on Thursday in response to a writ petition filed in 2010 seeking an investigation into the deaths/missing of tribal labourers taken to Karnataka for working in ginger and other agricultural fields.

The petitioner, Kerala Adivasi Forum, had also sought a directive to prevent exploitation of the tribespeople working in Karnataka fields.

The government submitted that the Wayanad district administration had taken steps to conduct periodical review meetings to check illegal human trafficking.

Informing police

It had been made mandatory to inform the police station and the District Labour Officer, Wayanad, before recruiting tribespeople for working in Karnataka. Besides, tribal extension officers and tribal promoters had been directed to report to the police any case of human trafficking.

Moreover, registration had been made compulsory for brokers recruiting tribal labourers with prior intimation to the police station. A special mobile squad led by a Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mananthavady, had been posted to deal with atrocities against tribespeople. The ‘one job, one family’ scheme of the Tribal Welfare Department was providing gainful employment to at least one adult member of tribal families.

Dismissing the petition, the High Court said more than nine years had lapsed since the filing of the writ petition and an investigation/inquiry into the alleged death/missing of tribal labourers at this stage was not possible. Besides, now no incidents of death, torture, and exploitation had not been reported.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/initiatives-have-curbed-trafficking-of-tribespeople-govt-informs-high-court/article30464169.ece
181,2020/01/03,‘Shimla Mirchi’ review: rife with embarrassing clichés,"Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Hema Malini’s on-the-road campaign in Mathura yielded some of the best memes of the year. Among them, my favourite, was Malini crouching under a haystack, held by an old frail lady. Shimla Mirchi is the cinematic version of that meme, where Malini is the film and the old lady is the script.

Ramesh Sippy’s latest film, made 25 years after his previous film, was lying in cold storage for over five years, and finally has found distribution. There’s an inevitable fear that the film and the direction would appear dated, and the results don’t disappoint. Although the film is shot in close frames and loud colours, which are meant for television viewing, and has arbitrary cuts passed off as editing, the film’s most anachronistic elements are its script, screenplay and acting. The old-fashioned telling could have worked as a throwback or homage to the traditional Bollywood comedy of errors or love-at-first-sight romance but Shimla Mirchi, with its over-the-top narrative clichés, would still be counted among the most avoidable films, even if it were to release in the 90s.

Shimla Mirchi Director: Ramesh Sippy

Cast: Hema Malini, Rajkummar Rao, Rakul Preet Singh and Shakti Kapoor

Story line: Naina sends her admirer’s love letters to her mother to reignite her love life after separation from her father

Although, the storyline, on paper, is progressive. Rukmini (Malini) refuses to sign on divorce papers, despite her husband living-in with a 27-year-old girl, and creepily stalks him (including climbing a tree to look into his bedroom. Their daughter, Naina (Rakul Preet Singh) desperately wants her mother to move on, so she passes on the love letters written by her anonymous admirer Avinash (Rajkummar Rao) to her mother. Rukmini instantly falls in love with these letters and wants to date Rao, who is half her age. This supposedly funny plot is so flat that the most amusing part of the film is meta product placements of Kent water purifiers, which Malini endorses in real life.

The veteran actor-cum-politician is plain embarrassing in the film. After playing the dejected wife in the first half, she has to transform into a seductive cougar in the second. Her idea of looking young is to wear ghungroos and wear sleeveless blouses with her sarees. The awkwardness is so palpable that it almost overshadows how extra Singh is in this film. Singh’s character is supposed to be a firebrand but her reactions are like she’s experiencing drug withdrawal symptoms. At one point, her reaction to a cheating contractor at her cafe is to break the chandelier. As for Rao, it’s heartening to see that he has come a long way today from Shimla Mirchi.

The film’s only saving grace is that as tormenting as the comedy is, it never enters the mawkish territory, which it hints at right from the start. It ends with a lovely cameo of an actor as a throwback to Sholay (1975). You can maybe fast forward to see that when it drops on OTT platforms, which seems to be the natural home for all defrosted and homeless Bollywood films, struggling to find distributors.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2lqam8/article30472354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shimla-Mirchi1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shimla-mirchi-review-rife-with-embarrassing-clichs/article30472355.ece

183,2020/01/03,Batting for a world where streaming content is made available on DVDs,"The recent announcement that Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma would become the first Netflix Original to become available on Bluray and DVD on the Criterion Collection in February 2020 brought much cheer to all aficionados of physical media, including me. We have, of course, in these pages, extolled the virtues of physical media previously, but the Criterion announcement is a cause of joy and another excuse to revisit the subject. A wag on social media remarked not so long ago that long after streaming services have turned to dust, physical media will remain. I couldn’t agree more.

This is not the first time that a Netflix title is being made available on physical media. House of Cards, Jessica Jones and a few films were released on DVD. As someone mentioned to me the other day — “What about those who don’t have a Netflix account and have no intention of getting one?” Without physical media, there is no other legal way to access streaming only series and films.

Now, bear with me and cast your mind back. Those long enough in the tooth will remember the once-fashionable ‘C’ word. Convergence. Remember, a fabled time when great expectations were on content, computing and various communications systems including print, cinema and television coalescing to form a unified whole? At the risk of angering Android-heads (I own one of each stream, since you ask), the convergence happened in 2007 with the introduction of the first iPhone. So much so that we now take it for granted, and cannot even clearly remember a time when the case was not so, and our homes were littered with all sorts of physical media.

Anecdotally, physical media is not dead. During Deepavali, I happened to be in Tamil Nadu’s second city, Coimbatore, and asked my cab driver if he had watched the holiday releases. When he replied in the affirmative, I asked him which cinema he’d watched them in. He looked at me pityingly and pointed to his phone (an Android, since you ask). On the same trip, I was despatched to the depths of Cross Cut Road to purchase hosiery (not for myself, since you ask), and joy of joys, the hole in the wall next to the shop I was sent to, stocked all kinds of DVDs and Blurays. Sadly, almost all were pirated.

Recently, another person on social media helpfully totted up the cost of all the streaming services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Apple TV+, etc, and arrived at a monthly bill of $90+ and wondered aloud how expensive ‘cord cutting’ had become.

So, where does all this leave us with physical media? Exactly where we were before. A bunch of foolhardy people, including me, will continue investing in it, and taking joy in it, at least until disc rot sets in. Meanwhile, let us await, and revel in the joys of the upcoming Criterion treatment being given to Roma. These include several documentaries about the film and its impact, and specially commissioned essays. And, dare we hope for Criterion discs of titles like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes in the near future?",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qi45ar/article30471366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30wkRomajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/batting-for-a-world-where-streaming-content-is-made-available-on-dvds/article30471367.ece
184,2020/01/03,R.D. Burman is the theme of a new cafe in — where else — Kolkata,"R.D. Burman or Pancham — the music director whose popularity continues to soar with every passing year ever since he died on January 4, 1994 — is now the theme of a newly-opened cafe in Kolkata, the city where he was born and in which he went to school.

The eatery — located in the upscale Hindusthan Park area which, in the recent years, has come to be dotted with hip cafeterias — is named Pancham Er Adday, loosely translating as ‘chitchat over Pancham’.

Continued inspiration

“To me, R.D. Burman is God,” says Amrita Annie, 38, who opened the restaurant in August last year after closing down a coffee shop she ran briefly in New Alipore. “Most of the songs you hear today are either inspired by him or remixes of his creations. So I thought, why not have a dedicated place where his songs are played for the younger generation?”

The café, sure enough, is packed with young people, and even though the songs playing in the background belong to the 1970s and 80s, they don’t sound out of place because Pancham’s music, no matter how old, sounds fresh off the recording studio — perhaps the reason why he has earned more popularity posthumously than in his lifetime.

The place is peppered with pictures and posters of the composer; goblets have names of his famous films etched on them; cushions are printed with posters of movies made famous by his music. What’s more, the food is cheap and the waiters efficient and charming.

Ms. Annie, who is 38, grew up listening to R.D. Burman but without realising who he was. “It was only much later I found out that most of my favourite songs happened to be composed by Pancham,” she says.

Popular bias

This is probably the first time that Pancham — or any popular artiste for that matter — has become the theme of a restaurant anywhere in the country. And what better place than Kolkata, which makes no secret of its bias in favour of the composer: shows are routinely held here in his memory and radio jockeys are decidedly partial towards his songs.

Pancham Er Adday, however, is not organising any special event on January 4, his death anniversary, when TV channels and social media is likely to be packed with tribute. “The reason being we do not like to believe that R.D. Burman is dead. He still alive, very much alive,” says Ms. Annie.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bjqdgp/article30470017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/d75d3786-522f-4fed-90f5-4533cd8c4248,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rd-burman-is-the-theme-of-a-new-cafe-in-where-else-kolkata/article30470019.ece
185,2020/01/03,Marvel Studios won’t be debuting trans character in MCU soon,"Despite recent reports, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige did not intend to confirm that a transgender character will appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) soon.

During a guest lecture at the New York Film Academy here, Feige was asked if the studio has any plans “on bringing more LGBT+ characters into the MCU, specifically trans characters”.

To which, Feige responded: “Yes — absolutely, yes. And very soon. In a movie that we’re shooting right now.”

Now, according to two sources close to the studio, Feige only intended to respond to the first part about LGBT+ characters, and he did not mean to imply that a trans character will be coming to the MCU very soon, reports variety.com.

At the time of his appearance in December, the only MCU movie in production was Eternals from director Chloe Zhao. In August, Feige confirmed that the film, which features Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, Kit Harington, Barry Keoghan and Brian Tyree Henry, will have the MCU’s first major gay character. He declined to specify who it would be.

Mani Ratnam has also revealed the names of the crew members in the project such as AR Rahman for music, Sreekar Prasad for editing, Ravi Varman for cinematography, Thotta Tharani for production design, Jeyamohan for dialogues, Eka Lakhani for costumes, Vikram Gaikwad for makeup, master Brinda for choreography and so on. However, lyricist Vairamuthu who was touted to be part of the film, has not been mentioned. There is a lot of speculation that he has been dropped from the project after being accused of sexual harassment in the #MeToo movement.

188,2020/01/03,Female directors reached record highs in 2019 Hollywood,"The number of women behind the camera on Hollywood movies jumped to record levels in 2019, with 12 directing top-grossing films including “Frozen II,” “Captain Marvel” and “Hustlers,” two studies showed on Thursday.

Women made up 10.6% of directors of the top movies last year, more than double the percentage in 2018 and the highest percentage of female directors in the past decade, a study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California found.

They comprised 20% of all directors, writers, producers, editors and cinematographers on the top 100 grossing films of 2019, up from 16% in 2018, according to a second report by the Center for the study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.

“This is the first time we have seen a shift in hiring practices for female directors in 13 years,” said Annenberg study author Stacy L. Smith.

Greta Gerwig's “Little Women” and Olivia Wilde's “Booksmart” also helped propel the record numbers.

The push for more diversity in directing and producing roles has been a major topic in Hollywood for more than a decade, and was given extra impetus by the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, fueled by the sexual harassment scandal that has roiled the entertainment industry.

Yet only one woman - Kathryn Bigelow for “The Hurt Locker” in 2010 - has ever won a best director Oscar, and only four women have been nominated for Hollywood's top awards since 2008, including the Oscars, Golden Globes, Directors Guild Awards, and Critics Choice Awards.

No women were included in the director nominees for the 2020 Golden Globe awards which take place on Sunday, and both Smith and Martha Lauzen in San Diego said more work needed to be done.

“Men continue to outnumber women 4 to 1 in key behind-the-scenes roles. It's odd to talk about reaching historic highs when women remains so far from parity,” Lauzen said in a statement.

“We won't know if 2019 was a single good year or the beginning of an upward trend until we see the numbers for 2020 and 2021,” Lauzen added.

2020 is already off to a good start with four of the year's most anticipated blockbusters - “Mulan,” Wonder Woman 1984,” ”Black Widow” and “Eternals” - directed by women.

Smith singled out Netflix Inc for praise, saying that 20% of the streaming platform's 2019 directors of U.S. fictional films were women.

“Legacy studios must recognize that the world and the talent pipeline looks vastly different from their hiring practices and act to reflect that reality,” she said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3c5u14/article30465969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ENDOFDECADEPOPCULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/female-directors-reached-record-highs-in-2019-hollywood/article30465970.ece

190,2020/01/03,5 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants held in T.N.,"Even as the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act rage across the country, Krishangiri police arrested the family of 3 Bangladeshi immigrants along with their two infants for gaining entry into the country illegally.

The AIADMK has secured a majority in two district panchayats.

Incidentally, the DMK could not open its account in Kanniyakumari district.

The DMK won 12 out of 23 seats in Krishnagiri district panchayat, 18 out of 24 in Tiruchirapalli, 4 out of 6 in Nilgiris and 11 out of 17 in Ramanathapuram. The AIADMK won 7 out of 10 seats in Theni district panchayat, which is the native district of Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and 4 out of 11 in Kanniyakumari. The DMK’s ally Congress won five seats and the AIADMK’s ally BJP won two in Kanniyakumari.

For the post of panchayat union ward members in 11 districts for which final results have been announced, the DMK has won a total of 793 seats, while the AIADMK has won 654.

The DMK’s gains came from Tiruchirapalli where it won 146 out of 241 seats, while the AIADMK could muster only 51. The DMK also crossed the 100-seats mark in Nagapattinam bagging 107 seats compared to the AIADMK’s 68 out of a total of 214 seats. The ruling party however won 109 seats in Cuddalore to the DMK’s 82.

Among the AIADMK’s allies, the DMDK put up a good show with 51 seats in the 11 districts, while the BJP bagged 26. The DMK’s allies Congress won 32, CPI got 47 and the CPI (M) won 10 seats.

192,2020/01/03,"Edappadi should pass a resolution against CAA and NRC, says former Ramanathapuram MP","“It is high time that the Chief Minister passed a resolution against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC (National Register of Citizens) just like other states such as Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha,” said former Ramanathapuram MP and State Secretary of AIADMK’s Minorities Welfare Wing, A. Anwhar Raajhaa. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, he said that the party’s performance in Ramanathapuram district in the rural local body elections was not great.

Mr. Anwhar Rajhaa’s comment came after his son and daughter, who were fielded for the posts of union councillors in Mandapam union, tasted defeat at the hands of the DMK candidates. Rajhaa’s daughter Raviathul Adhidhiya lost to DMK candidate Subbulakshmi Seevarathinam with a difference of 1,000 votes at ward No. 2, Panaikulam in Mandapam union and his son Nazar Ali lost to DMK candidate Thoufic Ali in a difference of 800 votes at ward No.16, Vedhalai in the same union.

“Not just them, but in general, many AIADMK candidates in the district lost badly and I believe that the reason for this is the resentment of the substantial Muslim population in the district due to the support extended by AIADMK to the passing of the CAA and NRC,” he said.

He added that the party leadership should take into account the apprehension and the resentment among the Muslims of the State regarding the Act. “I have briefed about this to both the CM and the Deputy CM. They should take a stand and give out a statement against the Act. Even parties such as PMK has come out with a statement against the Act, while continuing to remain in alliance with the BJP,” he said.

“Similarly, while a poll alliance with the BJP may continue, the AIADMK, as a party that stands of secular ideals, should voice against the discriminatory Act, so that minority community will repose faith in the party,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jh7gor/article30470558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03JANTH-ANWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edappadi-should-pass-a-resolution-against-caa-and-nrc-says-former-ramanathapuram-mp/article30470560.ece
193,2020/01/03,TN local body polls: Congress MP stages protest in Karur,"Congress MP S. Jothimani and DMK MLA Senthil Balaji, along with their party cadres, resorted to a road roko in K. Paramathi on the Karur-Coimbatore Road on Friday morning, alleging irregularities in the counting of votes and declaration of results in K. Paramathi Panchayat Union in Karur district. Earlier in the morning, they had staged a sit-in dharna at the counting centre of K. Paramathi Panchayat Union.

The protesters alleged that although the candidates of the DMK and the Congress had won from ward 1 and ward 16, respectively, in K. Paramathi Panchayat Union, officials have declared the AIADMK candidates as the winners.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Jothimani claimed that her party candidate Loganayaki had won in ward 16 but the AIADMK candidate was declared elected by a margin of two votes. Similarly, the DMK candidate had won in ward 1 but the AIADMK candidate was declared winner, she alleged.

“Counting of votes in the wards was over by 8 p.m. But the officials did not declare the results immediately. The declaration was made at around 3.30 p.m. after mobilising police forces,” she charged. Ms. Jothimani accused the ruling party of indulging in such irregularities to secure a majority in the 17-member K. Paramathi Panchayat Union, where a close contest was witnessed between the DMK and AIADMK-led alliances.

She also alleged irregularities in counting and declaration of results in a few other places in Thanthoni and Kulithalai unions in the district. ‘The court guidelines were not followed properly.

194,2020/01/03,"T.N. rural local body polls: 2,000 seats for DMK in panchayat unions; AIADMK comes second","The DMK on Friday extended its gains in the rural local body polls, winning and establishing clear leads in a majority of the district panchayat wards and panchayat unions in the 27 districts where polling was held in the first and second phases.

The DMK had won 2,000 seats in the panchayat unions while the AIADMK won 1,668 seats as of 11.45 p.m. on Friday. At the time of going to print, the State Election Commission had officially declared results for a total of 4,805 out of 5,090 panchayat union seats.

In the district panchayats, the DMK won 217 seats compared to the AIADMK’s 187.

Results for 452 out of 515 seats were announced and counting was still on in six districts. Results for the remaining six districts were announced for district panchayats and panchayat unions. Counting for the posts of village panchayat president and village panchayat wards were still underway, which are not fought on the basis of party affiliation.

Six districts — Tiruchiruapalli, Thanjavur, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai and Tiruvannamalai — formed the backbone of the DMK’s overall performance. The party bagged more than 100 seats in the panchayat unions in each of these districts. Tiruchirapalli stood out for the party as it trounced the AIADMK by 95 seats. However, in Kanniyakumari the party drew a blank in panchayat unions.

The AIADMK was able to muster 100 seats in only one district – Cuddalore, where it won 109 seats to the DMK’s 82.

While the DMK’s ally, the Congress bagged 126 seats in the panchayat unions, two of the AIADMK’s allies made a mark — the DMDK won 93 seats while the BJP won 84.

Incidentally, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) the ruling party’s ally, which bagged more seats than the other two AIADMK allies, was tagged with “others” by the State Election Commission on its website. Ironically, parties such as the Trinamool Congress, BSP, NCP and Desiya Makkal Katchi that have rather microscopic presence in the State were provided prominence in the results charts on the website. None of these parties won even a single seat.

PMK founder Dr. S. Ramadoss said in a statement that the party had won 16 out 36 district panchayat wards where it contested and bagged 224 out of 430 panchayat union wards.

AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran said his party’s candidates had won in 94 panchayat union seats.

The AIADMK managed a majority of district panchayat wards in Thoothukudi winning 12 out 17 seats while the DMK won five. The loss must worry the DMK since its leader Kanimozhi won the Lok Sabha polls from the constituency by a margin of 3.4 lakh votes. The DMK also lost the race for the panchayat union posts by a margin of two seats. The AIADMK won 63 to DMK’s 61.

However, the trends that were seen on the first day of counting held on Friday as well, with the margin of seats where the AIADMK won being low compared to big margins for the DMK in most of the districts. While the maximum seat difference in districts where the DMK won in panchayat unions stood between 34 and 95 (where DMK bagged more than 100 seats), the margins for the AIADMK ranged only between 26 and 34 seats. But the AIADMK’s seat margins against the DMK in district panchayats was better.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cy4tbx/article30458115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Countingjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-rural-local-body-polls-dmk-extends-gains-aiadmk-comes-second/article30467669.ece
195,2020/01/03,"DMK spreading false information, ruling party tells poll watchdog","The AIADMK has petitioned the State Election Commission, urging it to take action against DMK president M.K. Stalin for spreading “false information” about the counting process for the rural local body elections.

Late on Thursday evening, organising secretaries of the party C. Ponnaiyan and J.C.D. Prabhakar visited the office of the SEC and urged the Commissioner to see to it that the process passed off smoothly.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Prabhakar lauded the SEC for the way in which the counting process was being carried out, and accused the DMK of having indulged in “violence and irregularities” during the 2006 local body polls. He said it was “incredible” that Mr. Stalin was unaware of the several stages involved in the counting process for the rural local body polls. “Without realising this, he has alleged that the authorities have been delaying the announcement of results,” the senior AIADMK functionary added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-spreading-false-information-ruling-party-tells-poll-watchdog/article30465046.ece
196,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: DMK views results as a prelude to 2021 win,"The initial outcome and the trends of the rural local body elections have not only disproved the perception that the ruling party normally sweeps the local body polls, but have also boosted the DMK’s hopes of the wheel of fortune turning in its favour in the 2021 Assembly election.

As an immediate impact, its performance has helped the DMK dispel the notion that it was afraid of facing the local body polls. The election has also proved that the party has the advantage of vibrant grassroots-level organisation, though it had lost two consecutive Assembly polls in 2011 and 2016. “The people’s dissatisfaction and anger with the government have manifested themselves in the election. In fact, they were angry with the DMK for not having dislodged the government. Since they were not aware of the consequences of the anti-defection law, they were asking why the DMK, with 100 MLAs, had not ousted the government. Now, they have voted for us because they have come to the conclusion that the AIADMK will not continue in power,” contended DMK MLA and former Chennai Mayor Ma. Subramanian. Though the DMK swept the last Lok Sabha election, the outcome of the byelections to the 22 Assembly constituencies came as a disappointment to the party, since it was unable to muster the numbers to remove the AIADMK from power.While there is a view that the ruling party could have swept the local body polls were they held in 2016, a few months after the Assembly polls, the AIADMK government had delayed holding the polls after former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death, since it appeared unconfident of its support base.

Eventually, it was pressure from the judiciary that forced the government to announce the elections – that too in phases and by switching to the indirect mode of elections for key posts.

“Voters know that the DMK is going to capture power in 2021. The outcome is an indication of our victory,” Mr. Subramanian argued.

Court pleas

The DMK, by approaching the courts in connection with the delimitation of wards and reservation, created an impression that it was not prepared to enter the fray. But its constant petitions to the SEC and other officials seemed to have created a desired effect. “In fact, our efforts have restrained officials and prevented them from committing irregularities in favour of the ruling party,” contended former Minister Thangam Thennarasu. He said the outcome of the rural local body polls was a prelude to the DMK’s victory in the 2021 Assembly polls.

P. Sattanathan, a Congressman, said the results were more of a reflection of the people’s anger against the AIADMK establishment than of their support for the DMK in rural areas. On whether this will pave the way for the DMK’s victory in 2021, he said it all depended on how the alliance formation is pursued.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8mtnt9/article30465042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03DMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-rural-local-body-polls-dmk-views-results-as-a-prelude-to-2021-win/article30465043.ece
197,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: Results and trends take AIADMK by surprise,"The initial trends and results of the rural local bodies (RLBs) in 27 districts appear to have taken the ruling AIADMK by surprise.

After losing narrowly in the Vellore Parliamentary election and recording success in the byelections to the Nanguneri and Vikravandi Assembly constituencies, the party had hoped to get an overwhelming mandate in the polls to the RLBs.

Besides, the popular perception prior to polling was that the AIADMK was well-prepared to meet the elections, whereas the DMK was a reluctant entrant and had devoted its time and energy largely to filing case after case against the elections.

A senior functionary of the ruling party explained that the organisation was under the impression that the decision not to conduct the polls to all local bodies – rural and urban – would be beneficial to its prospects as the party’s vote base was greater in rural areas than in urban ones.

“But the indications have proved our calculations wrong,” the office-bearer admitted, referring to the defeat of the daughter of former Minister and Ramanathapuram Member of Parliament A. Anwhar Raajhaa in a panchayat union ward.

Anti-incumbency factor

A young office-bearer of the AIADMK said his party’s showing should be seen against the backdrop of eight years of anti-incumbency and the damage that several natural disasters like Cyclones Ockhi and Gaja had caused to many rural parts of the State in the last few years. In addition, despite the presence of the BJP in its front, the ruling party’s performance was “creditable”.

198,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: AIADMK denied sweep in western stronghold,"The AIADMK, which has always counted the western districts among its strongholds, was in for a surprise on Thursday, when the trends of the rural local body polls indicated that it was not sweeping the region.

The party’s alliance with the PMK and the BJP, both of which have reasonable influence in certain pockets of the region, has not helped it outshine its arch-rival DMK, if trends as of Thursday night are anything to go by. Considering that the western districts have influential politicians like Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, besides Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami himself, the AIADMK’s second-line functionaries said they had expected better results. Though the results in certain districts indicated that the AIADMK was ahead, the DMK managed to establish leads in a reasonable number of wards.

Elections were conducted in all rural local bodies in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Nilgiris, Erode, Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. In Namakkal district, Yuvaraj, son of AIADMK legislator Chandrasekaran, who contested the post of Nadukombai village panchayat president, lost the election by four votes. Demanding a recount, Yuvaraj and his supporters staged a protest at the counting centre for Sendamangalam panchayat union. By evening, in Salem, the Chief Minister’s native district, the AIADMK established its lead in many wards.

Though no untoward incident was reported in most of the counting centres, there was a problem at the centre for the Sulur panchayat union in Coimbatore.The counting began after the intervention of District Collector K. Rajamani, who said the seals on ballot boxes had not been tampered with, and the gunny bags did not matter at all.

As of 6 p.m., the Coimbatore district administration had declared results for 25 of the 155 panchayat union wards that went to the polls. And, of those, the AIADMK won 15 union wards, the DMK - 9 and Independent - 1.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z76u5l/article30465007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03SALEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-rural-local-body-polls-aiadmk-denied-sweep-in-western-stronghold/article30465008.ece
199,2020/01/03,Murasoli Trust accuses NCSC vice-chairman of bias,"The Madras High Court on Thursday sought the response of L. Murugan, vice-chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), to a writ petition filed by Murasoli Trust accusing him of having “failed to shed his ties” with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and allowing the constitutional body to be misused for settling political scores.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan ordered notice to him after being prima facie satisfied with the claim of the Trust, represented by its trustee R.S. Bharathi, that “all was not well” with regard to Mr. Murugan having taken cognisance of a complaint lodged by a BJP office-bearer alleging that the Trust had encroached upon panchami land in Chennai.

The judge also directed a Central government standing counsel to take notice on behalf of the NCSC and submit its reply by January 21 to the contention of the Trust that the commission does not have jurisdiction to decide upon the title of a property. Notice was also ordered to the complainant R. Srinivasan, secretary of the State unit of BJP, based in Madurai.

In the meantime, when Senior Counsel P. Wilson, appearing for the trust, brought it to the notice of the court that NCSC had summoned Managing Trustee M.K. Stalin, also president of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, for an inquiry, the judge said it would be sufficient if his representative attended the inquiry with a list of documents in their possession to prove the title.

The court was also told that the commission had issued a notice on December 13 asking Mr. Stalin to appear before Mr. Murugan in New Delhi on January 7. However, following a telephonic conversation, the inquiry appeared to have been advanced to Friday (January 3), though no written notice was issued in that regard, the petitioner’s affidavit read.

Questioning the authority of the Commission to inquire into the title of a property, the Trust stated that only a civil court and no other body could determine the ownership. Though the Trust was in possession of documents dating way back to 1937 to prove its title, it need not submit itself before an authority that lacks jurisdiction, the senior counsel argued.

‘Political motive’

Further, accusing the complainant of having approached the commission solely with a political motive since he was not a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste, the Trust said huge publicity given by BJP members to Mr. Murugan when he was conferred a doctorate by the University of Madras in November last clearly demonstrated the amount of bias.

According to the complainant, the Trust constructed the office of Murasoli, the official organ of DMK, on the panchami land meant for welfare of Scheduled Castes. However, Mr. Wilson claimed before the court that former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa herself had gone on record to state that there was no panchami land at all in entire Chennai city.

He urged the court to restrain the NCSC from proceeding with the hearing of the complaint and also sought an interim stay purely on the ground of jurisdiction of the commission to inquire into such issues. In his second limb of argument, the senior counsel levelled allegations of bias against the vice-chairman of the commission in particular.

After hearing him, the judge directed the counsel for NCSC to get instructions regarding the quorum required to conduct such inquiries.

He also wanted to know whether the chairperson or other members of the commission could replace the vice-chairman on the inquiry panel if any such necessity arose.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yltcm/article30464908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/murasoli-trust-accuses-ncsc-vice-chairman-of-bias/article30465001.ece
200,2020/01/03,Political parties seek release of Tamil orator ‘Nellai’ Kannan,"A section of political party leaders condemned the arrest of Tamil orator ‘Nellai’ Kannan for allegedly making a hate speech against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday last.

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri questioned as to why the police had two different rules when it came to arresting those allegedly making inflammatory comments.

“Why has Seeman (Naam Tamilar Katchi founder) not been arrested so far for claiming that they only killed [former Prime Minister] Rajiv Gandhi? Despite a complaint given to the police, no action has been taken against him. If someone speaks against Mr. Modi or Mr. Amit Shah, they are immediately arrested. But when comments are being made against Rajiv Gandhi, there is no action,” Mr. Alagiri said referring to Mr. Kannan’s arrest on Wednesday night.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president Thol. Thirumavalavan alleged that Mr. Kannan being targeted was due to his exposing the Sangh Parivar’s designs time and again. “What he said at the event was purely a joke. Everyone present there, including women, understood it as a joke only. There was no other ill intention behind it, and the Muslims who were part of the event also did not take it seriously,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the BJP was not targeting Mr. Kannan for that specific comment, but for his speech in which he exposed the Sangh Parivar, and the anti-people activities of the BJP government. “Besides, the fact that he being a Hindu exposed them in front of Muslims is what is irritating them,” he charged and said it was clear that the AIADMK had become slaves of the BJP by arresting the orator late at night and demanded the cases be withdrawn against him immediately.

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi president M.H. Jawahirullah questioned the speed at which Mr. Kannan was arrested and asked why others who made inflammatory speeches are still roaming free.

“Why didn’t the police arrest Nainar Nagendran (BJP leader) when he called for lyricist Vairamuthu’s head? Why is he still roaming free? What about BJP national general secretary H. Raja who recently said if students throw stones from inside university campuses, bombs will be thrown from outside? He has abused everyone from Periyar to High Court judges, yet he has not been arrested,” Mr. Jawahirullah pointed out.

He also questioned why actor Y. Gee. Mahendran who claimed boys went to protests just to look at girls, or Dairy Development Minister Rajenthra Bhaalaji who said Congress MP Manickam Tagore should be shot and actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s tongue should be cut, have not been arrested. He demanded the immediate release of Mr. Kannan.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/8nqz7k/article30466473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03-pondy-nellG976UA3475jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/political-parties-seek-release-of-tamil-orator/article30464999.ece
201,2020/01/03,"Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: In the north, AIADMK edges past DMK","The ruling AIADMK and the Opposition DMK were slugging it out in tight contests in the northern districts of Cuddalore, Tiruvannamalai and Tiruvallur.

While the AIADMK was way ahead in terms of panchayat union councillor posts in Cuddalore district, it was locked in a close battle with the DMK in Tiruvannamalai district. In Tiruvallur, it was the DMK that initially took the lead, but the AIADMK fought back to inch ahead of its principal rival by Thursday night.

The counting process witnessed commotion and chaos in various centres across the three districts.

Of a total of 287 panchayat union ward councillor posts in Cuddalore, the AIADMK had won 18 posts, while its arch-rival had won 10, followed by Independents, who won five posts. The DMDK, an ally of the AIADMK, had won one post.

A counting centre in Virudhachalam witnessed commotion when an AIADMK candidate was announced the winner though an Independent had bagged more votes. Also, counting was halted in Sathamangalam.

In Tiruvannamalai, the AIADMK and the DMK had won 13 and 11 seats respectively in panchayat union wards.

Likewise, chaos reigned at the entrance of Shanmuga Industries Government Higher Secondary School, where police denied entry to the official agents of candidates. Election officials cited late arrival as the reason. There were arguments and counter-arguments between the police and the agents. At one point, the local leaders and their supporters tried to scale the gate.

Reinforcements were brought in, and the situation was brought under control. As a result of this, the counting process started late. It took almost two hours for sorting out preliminary issues to commence the counting process at Tiruvannamalai, whereas in places like Cheyyar and Arni, counting was carried out swiftly and with ease.

In Tiruvallur district, the DMK was initially leading in the elections for the panchayat union ward members. But by 8 p.m., the AIADMK was leading in 23 places, and the DMK, in 20 places. At many centres, the election staff were unhappy as breakfast and lunch were not provided on time. Many of them refused to take part in the process.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z8cnrc/article30464997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03TIRUVALLUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-rural-local-body-polls-in-the-north-aiadmk-edges-past-dmk/article30464998.ece

He was reacting to a recent report published in The Hindu that the Centre is unlikely to fund Cauvery project. In a statement, Mr. Ramadoss said that the Cauvery river is highly polluted and Centre cannot escape from its role of cleaning the river.

Even Karnataka is equally responsible for the pollution of Cauvery, he said and as a result Centre cannot deny funds.

Mr. Ramadoss also pointed Centre’s announcement of ₹20,000 for the clean-up of Ganga river and also funds to the tune of ₹1515 crore to Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi Governments for rejuvenating Yamuna river.

The estimated cost of Cauvery project is ₹11,250 crore and Centre should provide grants as well as arrange loans from multilateral funding agencies for the project, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-should-fund-cauvery-project-pmk/article30464973.ece
203,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: DMK pulling ahead in central region,"The DMK was pulling ahead of the AIADMK in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts in a stiff battle for supremacy in the rural local bodies of the central region. The region holds sentimental significance for the Opposition party as its late leader and former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi hailed from Tiruvarur and represented the constituency in his final term in the Assembly.

While the results of the polls for district panchayat wards in the region were not expected to be declared till late on Thursday evening, those pertaining to panchayat union wards, as well as the trends in the district panchayat wards, indicated a stiff contest between the Dravidian majors in most places in the region.

As per the results available as of 8.30 p.m., the DMK had bagged 57 of the 241 wards in 14 panchayat unions in Tiruchi district. The AIADMK could manage to win only 18 seats, while its ally, the DMDK, had won four seats. The CPI, the BJP and the Congress had bagged one ward each in the district.

The DMK had also done well in Thanjavur district, the heart of the Cauvery delta, winning 43 of the 276 wards in 14 panchayat unions. The AIADMK had won 28 seats. The BJP and the Congress had won two seats each, while the CPI and the DMDK had secured one seat each.

Clear lead

The DMK had established a clear lead in Pudukottai district, winning 45 of the 225 wards in 13 panchayat unions. The Congress had won four seats, while the AIADMK could manage to win just 26 seats in the district, from where Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar hails.

The DMK was leading in seven district panchayat wards, while AIADMK candidates were ahead in four wards. Congress candidates were leading in two wards, while a DMDK candidate was leading in a ward.

The DMK, which was initially lagging behind its rival in Tiruvarur, subsequently surged ahead of the AIADMK, winning 26 seats, as against the ruling party’s 19. The AIADMK was putting up a good fight in Nagapattinam district. With 13 panchayat union wards in its kitty, the party was marginally ahead of the DMK, whose tally was 11 in the district.

The AIADMK was also ahead in Karur district with 15 seats, compared to the DMK’s 10. Of the 113 panchayat union wards in Ariyalur district, the AIADMK had won three seats, and the DMK, two.

Among the significant losers in Tiruchi district was Murugan, husband of M.

The Assembly session of Tamil Nadu is scheduled to begin on January 6 with the Governor’s address. Mr. Stalin’s letter was handed over to the Assembly Secretary on Thursday by DMK MLAs Ma. Subramanian, P.K. Sekar Babu, S. Sudarsanam, R.D. Sekar and Aravind Ramesh.

The resolution contended the CAA was not only against the Indian Constitution, but also sowed the seeds of division and hatred among people because it had excluded Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils.

“It has been opposed by majority of the people and paved way for widespread protests. The Centre is planning to implement the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens. (NRC).

“This will divide the people on the lines of religion and race and pose a challenge to India’s unity and integrity,” the resolution further said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tuy2ce/article30458991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02JANTH-Stalin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/caa-stalin-to-move-private-resolution/article30464922.ece
205,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: Madras High Court holds special late-night sitting,"Justice M. Sathyanarayanan of the Madras High Court on Thursday presided over a special two-hour sitting between 8.45 pm and 10.45 pm to hear a writ petition filed by R.S. Bharathi of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam alleging irregularities in the ongoing counting process of rural local body polls and directed the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (TNSEC) to file a detailed affidavit on Friday regarding the procedures followed by it.

The judge ordered that the affidavit should explain the counting process in detail, besides listing the number of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras being used to record the entire counting process, the number of requests received for recounting of votes, the number of local bodies for which recounting of votes was done, the number of local bodies where the requests for recounting was rejected and such other details.

Favouring AIADMK

The interim order was passed after senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the writ petitioner, met Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi after the completion of the court hours and obtained permission to move the case urgently, since there was an apprehension of large-scale irregularities in favour of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the counting process during the intervening night between Thursday and Friday.

He claimed that Returning Officers of several districts had not declared the results of local bodies across the State despite the completion of the counting process and feared that it could lead to irregularities in the marathon counting process that began on Thursday and expected to continue overnight due to use of ballot papers for various posts. He insisted declaration of the results of all local bodies where the counting had been completed.

Three-tier security

In reply, senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, appearing for the TNSEC, refuted all allegations and assured the court that the purity of the election process was being maintained. He said the entire counting process was being recorded using CCTV cameras and that a three-tier police security had been created around the counting centres. As many as 30,554 police personnel had been deployed for security purpose, he added.

Stating that the delay in counting was due to use of ballot papers of different colours for different posts, the senior counsel said that there were also requests in many places for recounting and they were being considered in accordance with law. Mr. Sundaresan also stated that results could not be declared hastily without following all statutory procedures. Therefore, it was wrong on the part of DMK to allege irregularities.

The court was further told that DMK president M.K. Stalin met the State Election Commissioner in person and complained about results of local bodies being delayed in Salem district. “Immediately, the Commissioner phoned up the District Collector concerned in the presence of the party president and instructed to speed up the process. Therefore, he knows everything.

206,2020/01/03,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: Mixed bag for Dravidian majors in south T.N.,"The southern districts will be a mixed bag for the DMK and the AIADMK, going by the available trends and results.

While the AIADMK alliance’s candidates emerged victorious in many wards for which results had been declared in Theni, Dindigul, Madurai and Thoothukudi, the DMK front had fared well in Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Kanniyakumari and Virudhunagar districts. However, the final results will be out only on Friday.

Regional leaders of both the Dravidian majors viewed the results as an indication that the people favoured their respective parties.

Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar told The Hindu that the government’s “achievements in various spheres and hard work of the cadre” had fetched the “desired results” for the party. “This shows that the AIADMK has delivered on its promises to the people,” he said.

DMK leader and former Madurai Mayor P. Kulandaivelu contended that had the AIADMK not “interfered” with the official machinery, the DMK would have won in more wards in the southern districts. “This is the beginning of the end for the AIADMK,” he said, and claimed that in the next election, the DMK will sweep the polls. B. Thirumalai, a writer from Madurai, was of the view that the northeast monsoon may have helped the establishment. Many tanks, which were desilted under the kudimaramathu scheme, were giving the farmers full confidence about their ability to raise crops, he felt.

The impact of money power was also palpable during the campaign, with some candidates contesting the post of panchayat president by spending over ₹30 lakh on distribution of freebies, biryani and liquor. However, a District Collector insisted that the elections and the counting process were conducted in a free and transparent manner.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/o3qybs/article30460228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02JANTH--COUNTING4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-rural-local-body-polls-mixed-bag-for-dravidian-majors-in-south-tn/article30464905.ece

More than four and a half years have passed since the work on the high-level bridge began parallel to the existing old bridge over the river in the temple-town to ensure hassle-free vehicular movement on the crucial link to the vast tribal hinterland stretching across neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

The new bridge was sanctioned with an estimated outlay of ₹98.45 crore a little over six years ago to ease traffic congestion on the existing five-decade-old bridge, part of the National Highway 30 (Old NH-221), the vital road link between Telangana-Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh.

The new bridge was to be completed by June 2018 as per the extended deadline.

Initially, there was considerable delay in execution of the civil works owing to frequent floods in the Godavari and some technical obstructions in laying piers on the rocky terrain in the river zone, sources in the National Highway (NH) wing of the Roads & Buildings Department said.

Work on the major components, including nearly 36 piers of the new bridge, has been completed and plans are afoot to lay a diversion road to facilitate construction of the remaining main piers by employing gas cutting method to level the uneven rocky stretch of the river zone, said an official of the R&B Department.

Penalties had been levied on the contractor concerned for the delay in execution of works and focus has been laid on ensuring speedy completion of the bridge by the year-end, the official, who did not wish to be identified, said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/485f2g/article30472236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04HYKHMBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/work-on-bridge-across-godavari-misses-extended-deadline/article30472237.ece

Elections would be held for Kothapalli, Choppadandi, Huzurabad and Jammikunta municipalities and Karimnagar Municipal Corporation in bifurcated Karimnagar district. Already, the ruling TRS, which is upbeat after its winning streak in the Assembly, Parliament and local bodies’ elections, is ahead of others in the electioneering process by organising preparatory meetings with the party rank and file in all municipalities.

Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar is taking care of the elections for the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK, Kothapalli municipality and Choppadandi municipality in coordination with local legislator Sunke Ravishankar.

Minister for Health Eatala Rajender is overseeing the election process of the party in Jammikunta and Huzurabad municipalities by organising meetings with the party cadre and aspirants.

The TRS is solely banking on developmental works taken up and welfare schemes such as Aasara pension, Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarrak. The party has decided to personally write letters to the beneficiaries of various welfare programmes informing them about the importance of voting for TRS in the municipal elections.

TRS aspirants are applying to coordinators appointed by Mr. Kamalakar for tickets.

On the other hand, BJP district unit leaders, who had tasted victory in Parliament elections by winning the Karimnagar seat, are leaving no stone unturned to snatch the coveted Mayor post of the MCK. The leaders are organising preparatory meetings for the municipal elections and cashing in on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Congress, which had never lost the municipal elections in Karimnagar, was defeated in the last elections for the first time. With continuous defeat, most party aspirants have shifted their loyalty to TRS and BJP. The resignations of DCC president K. Mruthyunjayam and Town Congress president Karra Rajashekhar have come as a rude shock to the Congress in the district.

However, TPCC working president and former MP Ponnam Prabhakar is coordinating the party affairs and gearing up with available leaders for the municipal elections. He has constituted a 16-member team for selection of candidates.

The mannequins wearing traffic police gear, including uniform, reflector jacket, cap, boots, mask and sunglasses, would be installed at strategic locations to regulate traffic and prevent accidents. Besides, the mannequin traffic police would also keep surveillance with a secret camera and take photos of traffic violators. Police are also planning to fix magnetic cameras on the mannequins that will use 3G and 4G technology for live surveillance.

The district police hit upon the mannequin idea after the successful functioning of a life-size cut-out of a saluting policeman at the RTC bus station complex in August 2018. A hidden camera was fixed on the cut-out, which sent live footage to the local Karimnagar One Town police station, and the police command control for necessary action.

Police are securing the mannequins costing ₹5,500 each from Bengaluru for installation across the district. They have already procured six mannequins.

Talking to The Hindu on Thursday, Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy said that they were planning to install mannequins of traffic police in various parts of Karimnagar to create fear among commuters about traffic policemen watching them. “In the wake of shortage of traffic policemen at unmanned junctions, the mannequins would be of immense help to the district police,” he said, adding they were procuring 16 mannequins in the first phase.

Mr. Reddy added that they would install the mannequins in busy traffic junctions and other places in the town, where rash and negligent driving and mobile phone use while driving were common. “We are planning to install the mannequins on National and State highways to reduce accidents,” he informed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nnsv41/article30464439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KRM-MANNEQUIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mannequins-for-traffic-surveillance/article30464436.ece
217,2020/01/03,Phase II of Palle Pragathi programme launched across the State,"Adilabad district Collector D. Divya on Thursday launched the second phase of Palle Pragathi in Mamidiguda village of Indervelli mandal. She went to the village along with a team of officials and interacted with the residents to ascertain their difficulties.

Mamidiguda in fact is divided into 2 habitations of 17 houses each, one of the habitation being located on a hillock. The Collector suggested the villagers from both the habitations to live in one village only.

The villagers asked for a new approach road and a bridge over the stream to reach the habitation in the hillock.

Ms. Divya said she would write to the government in case the budget for the bridge exceeds the limit within the purview.

‘Hold gram sabhas’

Karimnagar Collector K Shashanka called upon the educated villagers to participate in the campaign of “each one, teach one” to ensure cent per cent literacy in villages.

Launching the second phase of ‘Palle Pragathi” programme in Vannaram, Eedulaguttapalli and Lalithapur villages of Manakondur mandal on Thursday, he said that all the villagers who crossed the age of 18 years should be literate.

Instructing the village secretaries to identify the list of literates and illiterates in the villages, he urged the literates to help the illiterates learn.

He said that the elected representatives, officials and the villagers should conduct grama sabhas for taking up any developmental work in the villages. He informed the villagers to ensure the completion of dumping yard, crematorium and water percolation tanks in all villages before completion of the second phase of the programme. He instructed the villagers to prepare vermicompost by segregating the wet and dry garbage generated from houses.

The Collector expressed his ire over poor enrolment in the government schools. He was shocked to see three teachers and only 21 students in a primary school in Eedulaguttapalli village. He instructed the teachers the local bodies representatives to take all measures for ensuring more enrolment of students in government schools in the villages.

ZPTC member Shekhar Goud, MPP Sulochana, sarpanches Kavitha, Saritha and Kondaiah, DRDO Venkateshwar Rao, tahsildar Rajaiah and others were also present.

‘Penalise garbage throwers’

Medak/Sangareddy: The first day of the programme was a busy affair with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, Collectors - K. Dharma Reddy (Medak) and M. Hanumantha Rao (Sangareddy) making their presence felt in many villages.

Mr. Harish Rao was at Konayipally (PT) in Manoharabad mandal. He was unhappy over lack of cleanliness in the village. He questioned officials as to why the road side is not clean -- which could have been done in the first phase. The Minister later interacted with students of a primary school and distributed books to them.

Mr. Dharma Reddy visited Khajipally village in Medak mandal. He too was unhappy over a drain piling up with garbage, and instructed officials to impose penalties against those throwing garbage on road. He also enquired whether grama sabha was held in the village and how many have participated in it.

Mr. Hanumantha Rao made a surprise visit to Fasalwadi village and and interacted with villagers.

On the first day of the programme, Mr. Rao examined the growth of saplings in the village and watered a few of them. He urged villagers to hold a ‘Mega Shramadanam’ on January 5. On his way, the Collector came across garbage piled up at Shivampet. He has directed showcause notices be issued to the sarpanch and panchayat secretary immediately, and instructed them to keep the village clean by evening.

Surprise visit

Kamareddy: Education Secretary B. Janardhan Reddy made a surprise visit to the Upper Primary School at Lingampally in Sadasivanagar mandal.

He had a close look at the condition of the kitchen garden, library and classrooms.

Later interacting with students, he asked them to maintain 100% attendance, wake up early in the morning, and lead a disciplined life. He appreciated students who did not abstain classes even for a single day.

He asked the DEO to ascertain through teachers and students whether all households have individual sanitary lavatories. “Each one, teach one” will give good results in eradicating illiteracy, he said. On the occasion, he gave dictionaries to be distributed to students of Classes VI, VII and VIII.

Collector N. Satyanarayana, Assistant Collector Tejas Nandlal Pawar, District Educational Officer S. Raju, headmaster Sailu and sarpanch G.

Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar formally launched the Palle Pragati-II, a comprehensive action plan for integrated development of all villages, by planting saplings at Vepakuntla village in Raghunadhapalem mandal late on Thursday afternoon.

Assistant Collector (Training), Khammam, Adarsh Surabhi, Khammam Zilla Parishad CEO Priyanka and others were present.

Collector R V Karnan made a surprise visit to the Kamepalli gram panchayat and conducted on the spot assessment of the sanitation and other basic facilities in the village. He had inspected the status of various developmental works, including those initiated during the first phase of the Palle Pragati in September last year. Mr Karnan inquired about the progress of a slew of State government's initiatives for expanding the green cover and ensuring cleanliness in the gram panchayat.

In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, Project Officer V P Gautham made a whirlwind tour of several remote villages in Aswapuram mandal on Thursday.

219,2020/01/03,Upcoming Kochi-Muziris Biennale to celebrate the ability to flourish artistically in dire situations,"For a Biennale that has always been artist led, every edition of KMB allows for an unconventional exercise in curating. As an artist in conversation with other artists, for me curating the Kochi-Muziris Biennale is not just about the final production. Process, method, technique, undercurrents and original contexts are also part of the exhibition and discourse.

South Asia’s largest arts festival

As South Asia’s largest arts festival, and with the upcoming edition to run for four months this year, the scale of the Biennale is rich, diverse, and immersive. It can also be challenging. How can one retain regional contexts of artworks from across the globe? Perhaps one method would be to recognise how so many of these contexts intersect. An obvious example would be post-colonial nations continuing to grapple with generational trauma and how artists navigate the diffusion of borders, communities, languages, media, and so on when negotiating this. These approaches may be similar or divergent, but what is notable is that they remain imperatives that are still current, especially when thinking about the way so much of the global south continues to cater to the north, in terms of resources, but also in the neo-colonising of our nations as ideological battlegrounds.

In formulating the curatorial structure of a biennale such as this, it is important to consider the problem of how we construct region. As the first curator of KMB, not based in India but in Singapore, I am excited by the opportunity to spotlight the vivid practices and discourses in Southeast Asia, while simultaneously examining the term itself. The main reason, for me, will always be the dangers of the appeal to authority, or the claim to speak on behalf of a region from a position of knowledge that, as a curator, is sometimes expected. Terms like ‘South Asia’ or ‘Southeast Asia’ are difficult to reconcile. They appear to bring together states that diverge quite radically but, also given the complex geo-politics, histories, and cultures with porous ‘boundaries’ here, a term like ‘South Asia’ would present them as a supposedly unified geographical region. For me, these terms are especially troubling because it assumes that we must read this rich tapestry, this multiplicity, primarily as state (or nation) first. This is especially applicable when we see how the interaction between cultures or communities is invariably framed as transnational or statist, where national identity is regarded as the signifier of all parties in the conversation. At the same time, I recognise the importance of cultural production (in thinking, writing, and in making) in post-colonial states having to grapple with what constitutes statehood, nation-building, and regional allyship. It is about recognising other forms of power within communities and collectives. It is about recognising that the rhetoric that privileges certain groups over others is already being reframed or dismantled, and that a key aspect of this reframing involves the acknowledgement of intersecting contexts.

Kochi’s cultural and historical multiplicity

Yet the idea of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale being only regional is an assumption that I am unwilling to make. It seems to be rooted in the perception that sites ‘outside’ of the global north are, by simple virtue of location, necessarily regional. Where the KMB can be considered regional would be in its localness; in its connection to Kochi. It’s one of the first things we notice when we visit the Biennale – the way its residents have a personal involvement, with strong opinions about the art and artists of each edition. At the announcement of my appointment as the curator, I had spoken of the way biennales are often akin to floating cities that are unmoored from their locality or regionality. The Kochi-Muziris Biennale is unique in that it is rooted in the intertwined histories and cultural multiplicities of Kochi, while providing a crucial platform for larger discourse of the critical, political, and social impulses in artistic practices. To shift the lens through which we read the spectacle of exhibition, especially biennale spectacle, we must reposition dialogue and practice through acknowledging intersecting narratives, and retain, as much as possible, the original contexts of the works. I believe it is possible for the Biennale to retain regional realities and histories through cementing existing affinities and establishing new commons.

Perhaps this why I can imagine the Kochi Biennale as being more than a cultural staging area, but a crucible within which these intersecting discourses and practices can occur. As a possible knowledge commons, the conversations that would emerge from the exhibition, the seminars and other programming would be vital in demonstrating the diversity of strategies that artists employ. Though we may share the same concerns of land, migration, the climate crisis, rising neo-fascism, the future of technology, for instance, we diverge in our methods and approaches in thinking and in making. This is what I’ve been looking for during my curatorial research and travel over the last six months. This diversity of strategies, methods, and production can be emphasised and shared. This is not new, and is evident in, for instance, the significant work increasingly being done by artist collectives. A powerful example would be the multiple acts of remembering and reintegrating pre-colonial community-based thinking and practices in performance, for instance. Active decolonising initiatives, unearthing of overlooked histories and bodies of knowledge – all these are of keen interest to my plans for the biennale, as they have always been in my work as an artist.

Celebrate our optimism

One of the roles of cultural institutions, artists, writers, academics, etc. is to engage with the issues of their times and to be a mirror to society. In grappling with these issues it is easy to become disenchanted with, or apathetic about the state of our societies, our collective futures, and the planet. Yet I would argue that our fears for the future do not detract from our abilities to think and to make, but fuel our yearning to articulate through art the complexities of our realities. This affirming power of artistic work, no matter the medium, has been a keystone in my practice, and will continue to inform my curatorial work for KMB. The ability of our species to flourish artistically in fraught and dire situations, this refusal in the face of disillusionment to disavow our poetry, our languages, our art and music, our optimism and humour, is a stubbornness to be celebrated. The communities that come together to make this happen are to be celebrated. This is what I hope to foreground in the next edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale.

220,2020/01/03,Practice to perfect,"There are many young talents who find it hard to gain a platform for performance and even when they do, the audience is very small. Yet, today’s unknown artistes are tomorrow’s great vidwans and vidushis. So, giving them a platform and audience appreciation while they are still unheard of, gives them a boost. Also, sabhas can identify potential artistes at such events and offer them opportunities later.

The recent programme by Neelamabari at Saptaparni, Hyderabad proved that point with their annual classical-music festival. Titled Swara Pallavam--2019, it had a series of short-duration concerts of Carnatic music by students and budding performers of their school.

The programme began with very young children and progressed to senior students. Similarly, the renditions progressed from swarajathis and simple kirtanas to lesser-known compositions and manodharma sangeetham. Some of the students showed much promise and the seniors exuded confidence. For many, it was their first major onstage performance.

Neelambari has been founded by the couple Subbalakshmi Alamuri ( grand-niece of Nedunuri Krishnamurthy) and Gopalakrishna Alamuri (Nedunuri’s grand nephew-in-law). Gopalakrishna has given solo performances on several occasions and also sang in Nada Neerajanam, twice in troupes led by Seshulatha Viswanath; and once in a group of Hyderabad Sabha organisers led by Daruri Raghavchary of the Hyderabad Brothers.

What began as a three-student, two- teacher academy has now grown to 50 students with four teachers, three of whom are graded artistes of AIR. Well-known musicians — Oruganti Rajashekhar, Rayaprolu Sudhakar and Chilumula Ramakrishna — teach here.

Subbalakshmi and Gopalakrishna say, “Neelambari started its journey as a Sangeeta Sabha in 2011 with a view to providing a stage to those that are just getting ready to sing manodharma sangeetam but have no platform to hone their on-stage skills. We believe it is important to expedite the process of artistes ascending to higher platforms right when they’re ready. We believe there is an advantage with mridangam, violin and vocal all being taught under one roof. Students do not play and sing independent of each other, but rather, they learn to work together, intuitive of each other’s skills during their tutelage and later on the stage.”

The programme began with renditions by vocalists Manaswini, Sarvepalli Srivatsa, Shravani, V Kavya, and V Nandita , Varshini Vishwanathamin solo and with Velvadapu Shriya for duet , Rama Priya, K Trinadh and Vemuri Virinchi, T Ananya, Chaganti Jyothirmayi, Chaluvagali Sivani.

Renditions by instrumental included Y. Ayush (violin), M Rithvik (violin) and P Suhas (mridangam), G Trilok and Yanamandra Aakarsh (mridangam duet), Rehaan Jain (mridangam), N C Anuraag and K Sridhanush (mridangam duet)S Srivatsa and T Sriraaga (violin duet), , Alamuri Abhiram (mridangam) , Malladi Abhiram (mridangam), P. Sarath Naresh (violin), Chaganti Manikanta and Tirumala Anand (mridangam duet), Pandravada Suhas (mridangam), Vemuri Sarmada and K Sai Srikar (violin duet)K Sai Srikar presented (violin)

A more mature performance came in the form of a group veena performance by P Lakshmi Kiranmayee, G Surekha, M Geeta, D Hima Bindu, N Madhavi all supported by their teacher Rayaprolu Sudhakar. They rendered Sri Gananatham Bhajamyaham (Kanakaangi); Ninu vina naamadendu (Navarasa Kannada) and a Tillana (Desh). The finale had all students of Neelambari come together to perform Jayamu manade (Hamswadhwani), an Annamacharya kirthana tuned by the late Sathiraju Venumadhav.

Also present at the event were Suri Venkateswarlu of Vignana Samithi, Voruganti Ananda Mohan of Sangeeta Ksheera Sagaram and Maheedhara Seetarama Sarma of Sujanaranjani.

221,2020/01/03,Thiruppavai: Seasonal melodies,"Come Dhanur maasam, many temples, including the Srivari Temple in Tirumala, replace the morning rituals like the Suprabhatam with Thiruppavai renditions. An anthology of 30 short Tamil poems composed by the child saint/ goddess Andal or Kodhai in Srivilliputtur, Thiruppavai is composed by her while observing a 30-day vratam — one Paasuram (poem) each a day.

Bharatanatyam dancer and singer Smitha Madhav shares that even before she started learning dance and music, Thiruppavai was a fixture in the annual calendar at home. “No Margazhi (dhanur maasam) went by without all of us reciting Thiruppavai songs at the crack of dawn. The annual performance season at Chennai also happens during Margazhi, and so whenever we (my gurus and I) sat down to make a list of pieces to be performed at my vocal/ dance concerts, presenting a Paasuram from Thiruppavai seemed like the most appropriate thing to do.”

Noted Carnatic vocalist D K Pattamal’s senior disciple Bhavadhaarini Anantaraman, shares that Dhanur maasam is the only Hindu month, where there are no festivals so that one should think about the Lord on all 30 days. She says that in the 30 stanzas on Thiruppavai , the first five stanzas provide an introduction to the main theme, its principle and purpose. “In the next ten stanzas, Andal describes the importance of community participation. The next five stanzas describe her visit to the temple accompanied by her friends. The last nine stanzas are on the glories of the Lord,” Bhavadhaarini explains and adds, that she learnt many Thiruppavai paasurams from her mother Nalini and Pattammal as a kid. Today, she teaches her daughter Aadya Venkatesh, who during Margazhi this year has presented 10 paasurams at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Chennai. “I was given an opportunity to perform right from when I was seven years in my school, Valliammal Matriculation, my alma matar, everyday during Margazhi. “There is a practice to learn to recite Thiruppavai as a hymn which is called Saatthumarai and one version which is sung in tuneful ragas (as tuned by late Ariyakudi Ramanuja Ayyangar). I have learnt both the Sathumarai and singing in my childhood and I’m indebted to my mother who made this a practice,” Bhavadhaarini says.

“Growing up in a Vaishnavite household, my brother and I were taught various shlokas such as Vishnu Sahasranamam, Dashavatara Strotarm etc. However, Andal’s Thiruppavai was the most important of them all and my mother made sure that both of us learnt all 30 paasurams before we turned six or so,” recalls Smitha. In the same breath, she adds that the brother and sister duo participated in the Thiruppavai competitions held at Keyes High School in Secunderabad each year. “Our home is still filled with stainless steel dabbas that we won as prizes all those years ago,” she says with a smile.

Bhavadhaarini says that Thiruppavai can be chanted on all days, not just during Margazhi, although “Chanting Thiruppavai during Margazhi does have a distinct charm. It is indeed a blessing to be able to sing in temples early morning. I recite daily in the morning at my home during Margazhi and also teach my little daughter and other students,” she adds.

Many dance and music lovers would be aware that initially Smitha had brought all 30 stanzas to life for a Hyderabad-based TV and later for another electronic channel on a grander scale, where she spoke in English also, so that the younger members of the audience as well as the Indian diaspora could relate to the compositions. “The project was a huge effort since we shot the entire work (all 30 paasurams were sung, all 30 were danced to and all 30 were explained) in six days. These were telecast as 20-minute-long episodes over the 30 days of Margazhi, under the title ‘Hari Koluvu’, where eminent violinist Embar Kannan and dance guru Bhargavi Parameswaran lent me able support,” Smitha shares. Her rendition and presentation of all 30 paasurams are available on YouTube and various other social platforms. “It is my desire that as many people as possible hear these poems and fall in love with them just as I did,” she adds.

Bhavadhaarini who’s sung Thiruppavai for Arutperumjothi Audios had released the same this Margazhi through YouTube and the CD would be released shortly. Bhavadhaarini who skips one meal during Margazhi every day, reveals that she cooks quite a variety of Margazhi prasadams. “Most people prepare venn pongal on all 30 days, sarkarai pongal, daddojanam, puliyodharai, akkaara adisal on different days while unni appam and appam on the 30th day signifying the Aandal Kalyanam. I improvise at times with paayasam or carrot kheer or coconut burfi,” she says and quickly adds that another significance in Tamil homes is Margazhi kolams, where people draw very tough and intricate designs.

Smitha says that she also prepares various naivedyams on important days of Margazhi and observes the dos and don’t’s for the Maargazhi vratam to the best of her abilities.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/xugtcl/article30469126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf03bhavadaarinijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30469127.ece
222,2020/01/03,Manomanthana: Of seeking and salvation,"Billions of sounds, they rain down on the ear

Filtered; through the delicate cochlear

They meander until they reach the chambers

That assign some sense to them.

In this unrelenting cacophony, what chance do I have of finding you?

But here you are…

She had us at ‘delicate cochlear’! The frustrating lure of the external world that impinges on that of the inner, competing for attention, thwarting the soul’s attempts to turn inwards, forms the crux of ‘Manomanthana’.

An hour-long journey that traces the vicissitudes, ebb and flow, crests and troughs of the seeker straining to meet and consequently merge with Lord Rama, Srividya Angara’s original work tightly wrapped in Kuchipudi’s grace and vigour, had moments that touched hearts. It wasn’t a mere point-of-view of Thyagaraja’s predicament as a devotee of Rama nor was it a retelling of his compositions; Instead, Srividya chose to plunge into her own experience as an individual caught in a vortex of existential crises, questing for Rama, for the much promised sublimation that every spiritual aspirant desires. To questions. dilemmas and doubts expressed in soft elegant words written by Srividya herself, answers are unveiled by Thyagaraja’s songs, as if clearing a path.

Stringing together compositions of the saint-bard that have become oft-hummed household refrains like Dudukugala, Jagadanandakaraka and Nagumomu, the dancer wrought out the struggles and challenges of an individual trapped in a quotidian existence holding a dialogue with herself even as she fights her own demons.

And what are the demons? The demons are attachments, some familial and some foreign, that we willingly trap ourselves in. Srividya depicted this segment with a golden chain that she first revels in and then as she realises its stranglehold over her being, begins to resist it: Perhaps the aid of a prop makes it more relatable and dramatic to the lay audience. One instantly connected with the angst and frustration of the dancer at not being able to see Rama, as she repeatedly asks, ‘where are you?’ She stamps her foot in righteous indignation or slaps a palm against the other, demanding to be shown a glimpse of Him. And then taking liberties in her anger that could only be endured by God, she takes his symbolic bow and arrow and flings them aside in fury. This is a tiny detail but nevertheless makes an unexpected reappearance later in the form of a gentle rebuke by the Maryada Purushotam himself. We shall see how.

Overcome with despair and overwhelmed with the surrounding chaos, when the dancer lets go of all her temporal limitations, in a sense, dying, for want of a better word, she sees him at long last. She springs to an effulgent Jagadanandakaraka as she now knows that the manifest world is nothing but ‘maya’. There is suspension of disbelief as the audience is made to travel along with the dancer in this astral world as she ‘sees Him’; childishly delighted and filled with incredulous joy, she describes his presence in Sogasu choodu tarama, only to realise that he is not carrying his bow and arrow!

Realising her folly, she seeks his forgiveness. The dancer, the individual, the restless soul has, even if it is for a transitory moment, found and become one with the Universe. There is catharsis.

Konakol sections embedded in the narrative gave ample opportunity to the dancer to maximise the Kuchipudi technique, celebrating the breadth and range of aduvus in the style. The agratala sanchari of the heels, or the interlinking of toes, the leaps and jumps — all of these were utilised to the fullest.

Driven by Thyagaraja’s compostions

Based in Bangalore and an engineer by qualification, Srividya Angara is now a full time Kuchipudi dancer/choreographer and the founder of CitSabha, a Centre for Kuchipudi and Allied Arts.

Training in Kuchipudi and the initial years

While she started her training at the age of six In Visakhapatnam, being a child of the forces, Srividya moved several cities before she started training again under Yamini Ramana and then Y Vijayavalli Priya under whose guidance she completed her certificate. She moved to the US after her marriage where she continued to practice her art showcasing Kuchipudi at various festivals including the 27th Annual Choreographers’ Showcase of Maryland and the Norristown Dance Festival in Philadelphia where she presented a piece on Draupadi’s vastrapaharana called MEL set to Beethoven’s 5th symphony.

Upon returning to India in 2011, she co-founded SAMAAGATI collaboration between styles, with Odissi dancer Shubha Nagarajan. She currently practices Kuchipudi apart from training in Kalaripayatu under guru Ranjan Mullarat.

The inspiration behind Manomanthana

Growing up to the songs of Thyagaraja, Srividya had always felt a strong urge to work with the saint-composer’s compositions. She particularly remembers being moved by the heart-rending melody of Thodi in Yendukudayaradura that she would listen to everyday while she was an Applications Manager at GE. ‘Manomanthana’ is in many ways a coming together of all those memories and a strong attachment to the sentiment and emotion behind the songs themselves.

What makes Manomanthana special

Manomanthana has something for everyone. There is Thyagaraja whose compositions are known to everyone especially in the South, there is Kuchipudi a style that has a powerful nritta element, there is English prose and poetry and finally, the evocative emotional and spiritual content that impacts everyone at some level or the other.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hbo1ua/article30468804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf03srividya-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana-manomanthana-of-seeking-and-salvation/article30468805.ece
223,2020/01/03,Anpu Varkey describes her silent comic as a sepia-tinted memory,"Summer’s Children defies language. In some ways it is asking just for your attention. Anpu Varkey’s silent comic, which comprises only visuals and no text, comes at a time when we are constantly being bombarded with information. The comic makes you pause, go within, and reminisce your childhood memories. Each panel is detailed and brings alive the interiors of a rubber plantation in Kerala, where the book is set.

Anpu, who has painted stunning public art murals across the country, brings her creative skills to Summer’s Children. “It took me two years to draw for the book and a year to look around for publishers. The whole process took around three years,” says Anpu, who has self published the book. Her first silent comic was Jaba, published in 2014, but she says Summer’s Children is a larger book.

“I have done comics for other publications as well, such as Verite 01 and Verite 02, an anthology of comics published by Comix India.

Summer’s Children is a story of my childhood in Pala, Kottayam, where I spent the first three years of my childhood, and then subsequent summer vacations. I did not go back to the place to do a briefing. Also, the place does not exist any more, so the book is about memory and loss.”

The story is a visual narration from the perspective of two siblings, and their explorations over a day. “I wanted to depict this luxurious, heightened place that I was part of. This book is mainly for adults because you would reminisce your past in some ways. So it is a memoir of some sort,” says Anpu, who completed her Master of Fine Arts (BFA + MFA) at Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, and received a diploma in Fine Arts at Central St Martins Byam Shaw School of Art, London.

The power of the silent comic, says Anpu, is that the reader can interpret the story in their own way. “I find it hard to tell a story from a first or a third person perspective, and to think over how the story should be situated. The story is about reflecting on a different level.”

Initially, the drawings were made on A3 pages, but later made on A5 pages. “I wanted to make it a pillow book, one that you could keep under your pillow.”

Anpu is well-known for her public art such as of a 158-foot mural of Mahatma Gandhi in the Delhi Police Headquarters in ITO, Delhi, which she made in collaboration with German artist Hendrick Beikirch and of a giant harvest moon near Halasuru metro station in Bengaluru.

Anpu says public art happened serendipitously. “In 2012, a friend of mine gathered a couple of people at Khirki Extension, Delhi. My first wall was 20 by 40 feet. It was a realisation that this is something I can do. It was five to seven years of free work that I did. Part of becoming an artist is that we forget to have fun. I constantly push myself, learning something new.”

Public art is often considered as reclaiming the streets, but Anpu does not agree. “I am not interested only in my painting. Most of the times I have had lovely conversations with people. I don’t think I am above anything when I am on the streets, this is when I am totally humble. On the street, I am accountable to everyone, unlike in the studio where you are only accountable to yourself. For me public space is not an arrogant space, what is there to reclaim?”

Anpu, though, agrees that public art is not always an easy space to work in. “But it is not as if I know how to inhabit it...it is a learning process. I don’t revisit my work. I think of it as a learning process, it is never ending. And that has allowed me to try a new medium. All of this happened because I broke out of my studio practice, expanded my skills, and not think I am precious. Every time I tried something new, I always got the opportunity to expand it further.”

Unlike murals, Anpu says, comics take a longer to make. “Graffiti is faster, it takes me about three to five days. But the comic took me days to do because it is completely done by hand.”

Anpu’s next project is with Daksh, a Bengaluru-based civil society organisation focused on solving the problem of pendency of cases in the Indian legal system. To celebrate 70 years of the Constitution and our Republic, Daksh is organising several events between Constitution Day (November 26, 2019) and Republic Day (January 26, 2020). The campaign, called Republic@70 seeks to deepen our engagement with the Constitution and make it more relatable to ordinary Indians. “I am working on a mural with Daksh,” says Anpu.

“We have spoken, there’s no problem and the matter has been resolved. Speculations are being made as there's no tax on speculation,” Mr. Khattar told journalists in response to a question on the dissent note sent by Mr. Vij to the Chief Minister over transfer of 9 IPS officers without taking him into confidence.

Last week, the State government had transferred 9 IPS officers even when Mr. Vij had mentioned his dissent against the transfers. The Home Minister later stated that even though the Chief Minister has the power to overrule him, but in the wake of the dissent note, before taking a final decision he should had been kept in the loop.

Mr. Vij had not only expressed his displeasure over the transfers of IPS officers, but had also pointed fingers over the functioning of the State’s intelligence agency — the CID — and had sought an explanation from the senior officers for not responding to his queries.

Amid the ‘tug of war', which is being seen as an embarrassment in the political circles, sources said that Mr. Khattar recently met party's central leadership to discuss the matter among other issues.

Meeting with Nadda

He met the BJP’s working president J.P. Nadda in New Delhi. “I met Mr. Nadda to discuss Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and forthcoming elections in Delhi,” said Mr. Khattar, adding that “any other inference about the deliberations during the meeting were mere speculations.”

Police threatens scribe to reveal source,"In yet another case of high-handedness of the Uttar Pradesh police, a senior journalist was allegedly threatened to reveal his source of an objectionable video of Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna that had gone viral. When he refused, the Noida police tried to pick him up for questioning.

Piyush Rai, a senior correspondent of Times of India in Meerut, has lodged a complaint with IG Meerut Zone in which he said that on Thursday when he was about to leave the office of the Meerut SSP with a fellow reporter, he was stopped by members of the Noida police in plain clothes.

“First they asked for the source of the video and then threatened to pick me up. They stepped back only when the fellow reporter indicated to them that they were in a CCTV zone,” said Mr. Rai in the complaint.

He further said that on Thursday morning, Mr. Krishna called him up to know about the video and its source which he refused to share.

Alok Singh, IG Meerut Zone, told The Hindu that an explanation had been sought from Mr. Krishna and the Meerut SSP asked to investigate the sequence of events. “When Piyush told me about the videos, it was I who advised Mr. Krishna and him to talk to each other,” said Mr. Singh. When asked whether Mr. Krishna betrayed his trust, Mr. Singh said that was why his explanation had been sought. As for the veracity of the videos which have created an upheaval in the department, Mr. Singh said the cyber team was looking into it.

230,2020/01/03,SP promises pension for citizenship law protesters,"The Samajwadi Party on Friday promised pension for anti-CAA protesters if voted to power, drawing a sharp reaction from the ruling BJP which said it was in the “DNA of that party to honour rioters and anti-social elements”.

Leader of the Opposition in the UP Legislative Assembly, Ram Goving Chaudhary, said their party would also give compensation to the kin of those jailed or killed during anti-CAA protests in the State.

“If our party comes to power at the Centre and in U.P., they (protesters) will be given pension as they have struggled to save the Constitution and the democracy,” said Mr. Chaudhary responding to a question.

He said they protect all those who seek refuge from them.

“Jo humari sharan mein aa gaye woh humari sharan mein hain. Hum sabki raksha karney wale log hain,” the senior SP leader told mediapersons here.

Referring to remarks of State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should stay in Pakistan for a month to understand atrocities being on Hindus, the senior SP leader said the Narendra Modi-led Union government was out to divert people’s attention from real issues.

Later, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma lashed out at the Samjawadi Party, saying, “It is in the DNA of that party to honour the rioters and anti-socials.”

“They had also tried to withdraw cases against terrorists in the past and the court had to intervene. It is unfortunate that SP leaders are speaking about giving citizenship rights to the Bangladeshis and Rohangiyas,” Mr. Sharma alleged.

The statement came after the AMU administration extended the winter vacations.

The AMUSU appreciated the people for mounting a massive resistance to the CAA and condemned the Uttar Pradesh government for using excessive force against civilians.

‘CM Yogi should go’

“After killing 20 innocent protesters, jailing over 6,000 people, and damaging public property, (Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath has no right to continue in office,” said the statement.

M. Salman Imtiaz, AMUSU president (2018-19), has also petitioned the Allahabad High Court challenging the forceful entry of police into the university campus and unleashing of violence on innocent and unarmed students with tear-gas shells, stun grenades, chilli-based explosives, rubber bullets.

The court has reserved its order for January 7.

Mr. Imtiaz described the letter written by Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor to students as a gross misrepresentation of facts and an attempt to hide the administrative failures.

Administration flayed

“The AMU administration, which was aware of the ongoing peaceful protests but chose to be partners in crime with the U.P. police and permitted them to invade the campus despite their horrible record against minorities, played an ugly role on the night of December 15,” he said.

234,2020/01/03,Fadnavis demands ban on Savarkar booklet,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday demanded a ban on a controversial booklet on V.D. Savarkar released by the Congress Seva Dal in Madhya Pradesh, and asked the Shiv Sena how many insults it would endure at the hands of the Congress to remain in power in Maharashtra.

Mr. Fadnavis, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Assembly, lashed out at the claims made in the booklet distributed at a camp of the Seva Dal — the grassroots organisation of the Congress — which claimed that Savarkar had a physical relationship with Nathuram Godse, Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin.

“The Congress has continually insulted Veer Savarkar, who suffered untold atrocities in Andaman’s Cellular Jail in the fight for Independence and who inspired several revolutionaries. But [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi calls him a ‘traitor’… the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Sena should beware that the people of Maharashtra will never forgive them for insulting Savarkar in this crass fashion,” he said, addressing public meetings in Nandurbar district to campaign for the zilla parishad elections.

He later tweeted, “SwatantryaVeer Savarkar ji is undoubtedly one of the greatest freedom fighters & inspiration for all of us! Congress party has shown its distorted mentality by distributing a book which uses extremely cheap,insulting words for Veer Savarkar ji.Congress shows its mental bankruptcy (sic).”

He also demanded that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray immediately ban the booklet, while wondering how Sena founder Bal Thackeray would have reacted to it.

The booklet, Veer Savarkar Kitney ‘Veer’? (How ‘brave’ was Savarkar?), claims that Savarkar encouraged sexual assault on women from the minority community and that he celebrated the deaths of Muslims. It also says he received money from the British after his release from Cellular Jail.

The Seva Dal has said that claims of Savarkar’s alleged homosexual relationship with Godse were made in the bestseller Freedom at Midnight (1975) penned by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. The book details the events in the run-up to Independence and the immediate aftermath, including Gandhi’s assassination.

In his address, Mr. Fadnavis further attacked the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, saying that the Sena had “betrayed the people’s mandate” and trust by forming a government with the Congress and the NCP.

“This is the first time in the State’s history that a party [BJP] has fought with its ally [the Sena], but the latter is setting up a government with the opposition. This [MVA] is a government by deception,” he said, adding that in India’s history, no government formed by deception had lasted for more than six months.

He said while the BJP had won 70% of the seats it had contested in the Assembly elections, the other three parties had barely managed to win in 40-45% of the constituencies where they contested.

“Despite the BJP coming first in class by topping the merit list, it is out of it … but the other three students [the Sena, the NCP and Congress] who secured 40% came together and claimed that they are in the merit,” he said.

He said the Sena’s ‘tiger’ — the party mascot — had been reduced to a ‘cat’, and the party was politically impotent.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5v6a2l/article30473001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bmfadnavis,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fadnavis-demands-ban-on-savarkar-booklet/article30473002.ece
235,2020/01/03,Videos of police violence surface in Bihar,"Like in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, several videos of policemen indulging in vandalism and caning young boys, allegedly for participating in anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and anti-National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests, have emerged from Bihar’s Aurangabad district, too. Earlier, on December 31, the dead body of a young Muslim boy, who too had participated in anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, was found from the minority-dominated Phulwarisharief area of Patna.

In one video circulated on social media, policemen wearing helmets could be seen wielding batons on the windscreen of a van and a car parked in a desolate street while, in another video, policemen are seen getting hold of a young boy and caning him brutally.

In a third video, a group of Muslim women, young and old, are seen alleging that policemen had barged into their homes and abused them. “The policemen said tumko azadi chahiye na…dete hain tumko azadi (you want freedom…let us give you freedom),” a young girl student is heard saying in one of the videos.

Opposition visit

A local Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former minister Suresh Paswan is also seen in the video meeting with the frightened women. “Yes, I along with other party leaders had gone there to meet them on December 22…Justice must be done for these terrified women and people against whom police had resorted to brutalities,” Mr. Paswan told The Hindu over phone.

Local sources in Aurangabad told The Hindu that the incident took place after the RJD’s bandh call on December 21 in protest against the CAA and NRC. The police had resorted to baton charge allegedly after stone-pelting incidents in which at least seven people received serious injuries and were admitted to local hospitals.

“Later, the police ran amok in the Muslim-dominated areas of Shahganj and Quereshi mohalla of the town, and vandalised vehicles and barged into their homes,” a local journalist told The Hindu. More than 50 people were named in a First Information Report and several mobile phones were seized from them, he added.

‘Only lathi charge’

In one of the videos that went viral on social media, a youth identifying himself as Iltav Quereshi claimed he was the owner of the van vandalised by the policemen. However, a local police official, who was not willing to reveal his name, said, “We too have heard that such videos have gone viral on social media but nothing of that sort [police violence] happened…the police merely resorted to lathi charge after stones were pelted on them.”

Earlier, on December 31, 2019, the decomposed dead body of a young boy, Amir Hanjla, 18, was found in a bushy water pit in the communally sensitive area of Phulwarisharief in Patna. Hanjla had gone missing on December 21, when he had participated in an anti-CAA-NRC protest called by the RJD. The post-mortem revealed stab wounds and injuries inflicted by blunt instruments on his body. Hanjla — a Matriculate-pass and the fourth among seven siblings — was working in a local bag-stitching unit but since it had closed on that day due to bandh, he had gone to participate in the protest.

“He was killed for holding the tri-colour in his hands,” Sohail Ahmed, his sexagenarian father, told journalists. Later, he refused to hold any demonstration with his son’s body as it would have escalated communal tensions in the area.

12 named

Phulwarisharief Police Inspector Mohd. Shafiq-ur-Rehman said as many as 12 persons had been named in the case, and four of them had already been arrested. Some of those arrested, allegedly, are members of two fringe Hindutva groups. “The rest, too, will be arrested soon,” Mr. Rehman said.

Locals, however, accused a senior police official posted in the area for the delay in taking action against those involved in attacking pro-CAA-NRC protesters, and later, for labelling Amir Hanjla as a “mentally disturbed” person.

After violent protests on December 20, Firozabad police sent out notices to at least 200 people asking them to prove they would not be a threat to peace in the area and furnish surety of ₹10 lakh each.

Among those who were served notices were Fasahat Mir Khan and Sufi Ansar Hussain, both over 90 years and in poor health, and Banne Khan, a resident of Kotla area, who had died six years ago.

“CO (circle officer), city, has been asked to conduct a probe into how a notice was issued in the name of a dead person. The CO’s report is awaited and strict action will be taken against those found behind it,” said Superintendent of Police, Firozabad city, Prabal Pratap Singh.

Firozabad City Magistrate Kunwar Pankaj Singh said no action will be taken against any elderly person.

“These notices were interim measures initiated on the basis of reports from various police stations. No action will be taken against any elderly person,” he said.

The notices were issued under sections 107 (apprehension of breach of peace and tranquillity of an area) and 116 (inquiry as to truth of information) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Hussain said he failed to understand why he had been served the notice.

“I was in Firozabad on December 18 and had met senior officials during an Urs. I have spent all my life trying to ensure peace in the city. I don’t understand why this was done to me at the age of 90,” he said.

Fasahat Mir Khan’s son Mohammad Tahir said before the notice was sent, policemen had visited their house looking for his father. The family had told them that he was over 90 years old and not keeping well.

“They (policemen) had informed their seniors about this on phone but three days later, the notice was issued. My father has served the society all through his life and had also got an opportunity to meet former president (APJ) Abdul Kalam. It is surprising how such things are happening,” Tahir said.

Six people had died in the clashes in Firozabad. As many as 29 people were booked and 14 arrested in about 35 cases registered in connection with the violence.

242,2020/01/03,"Former police chief, Kuladhar Saikia, elected Assam literary body president","Some of Assam’s popular novelists and writers have been police officers, serving or retired. But it took more than a century for the State’s apex literary body to have a former man in uniform as its president.

On Thursday night, the Assam Sahitya Sabha elected former Director General of Police and writer Kuladhar Saikia as its president for the 2020-22 term. He bagged 269 of the total 619 votes polled, leaving far behind six other contenders, including former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta’s writer-wife Jayashree Goswami Mahanta.

The election was held during a meeting of the organisation in central Assam’s Hojai.

Among the other office-bearers elected was Mrinalini Devi, the mother of Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. She beat three contenders to become the vice-president of the literary body.

“I have been given the responsibility at a time when adapting to digital technology is crucial. My objective would also be to make the body more inclusive with the focus on developing and promoting the literature of various ethnic groups besides trying to take Assamese literature on a higher pedestal,” Mr. Saikia, who took over from Paramananda Rajbangshi, told The Hindu.

A Fulbright scholar and winner of Sahitya Akademi Award (2015) for his short stories, Mr. Saikia retired as Assam police’s chief in November 2019 after a three-month extension.

The Assam Sahitya Sabha was formed in 1917 with novelist, poet and dramatist Padmanath Gohain Baruah as its founder-president.

243,2020/01/03,Amarinder says Kerala House resolution represents will and wisdom of people,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh has come out in support of the resolution passed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly seeking amendment to the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), terming it the voice of the people, and urging the Centre to heed the same.

In an open letter to Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Chief Minister countered the former’s recent remarks in which he had “discounted the position being taken by some of the States against the CAA” and “called upon such politicians to seek appropriate legal advice before taking such a stand.”

Capt. Amarinder asserted that the said States had taken the necessary legal advice. The Kerala Assembly resolution represented the will and wisdom of the people, as spoken through their elected representatives. “Such MLAs represent the voice of the people at large,” he said. It was not only a matter of parliamentary privilege but also the constitutional duty of those representatives to make known such views.

‘Neither naive nor misguided’

As heads of responsible State governments “we are neither naive nor misguided”, he said. Laws could not be forcibly imposed on citizens, and like all powers, even the parliamentary power was coupled with the duty to exercise it responsibly.

By insisting that only Parliament, under Article 245, had the legislative power to pass laws as regards citizenship, and not the State governments, the Union Law Minister had entirely missed the point of the Kerala resolution. “It has not passed any citizenship law. It urges the Government of India [through Parliament where it now has a majority] to amend the CAA,” he said.

“Surely, you, both as Minister of Law as well as a lawyer, know that the resolution is rightly directed, as it is Parliament which must amend-repeal such law based on a proposal-Bill mooted by the Union government,” he said.

Capt. Amarinder dubbed the Union Minister’s continuous disclaimer that the CAA does not in any manner affect Indian Muslims as “a public-political stand which you are forced to take out of compulsion of office.”

He said, “Surely [and again as a lawyer yourself], you would be alive to the raging debate that the CAA fails the test of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees to all persons equality before law and equal protection of laws, irrespective of their religion.”

The Chief Minister cited the sensitive border location of Punjab and expressed another serious concern over the CAA. He noted that the Act’s language “does even require that any illegal migrant seeking its benefit need be of Indian origin in any manner.” All they have to be was from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, he pointed out. This could be a citizen or even a resident, or even a temporary person in transit through these countries.

“Since the CAA has no requirement of being of Indian origin or having to prove any such origins, this means that any person claiming to be of the six religions could simply apply in terms of the amended law, prove entry on or before the cut-off date and be eligible for citizenship. This could in fact be misused for infiltration into our country, particularly in the border States, converting this misguided legislation into a national security threat,” the letter said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yi5o4x/article30469099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN03AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-says-kerala-house-resolution-represents-will-and-wisdom-of-people/article30469100.ece
244,2020/01/03,"Are you the PM of India or Ambassador of Pakistan, Mamata asks Modi","Whenever an issue is raised by an Indian citizen, Prime Minister advises the person to go to Pakistan, to divert attention from the growing economic crisis in the country, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.

Ms. Banerjee was addressing a rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019, and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Siliguri in north Bengal on Friday.

‘Talk about India’

“If someone asks for a job and says [he] has no work, PM [Prime Minister] asks the person to go to Pakistan. If someone says we don't have an industry, he tells them to go to Pakistan. Pakistan can talk about itself, as much as it wants; [we] should talk about India. This is our motherland, all of us were born here,” Ms Banerjee said.

Her remarks are a response to Mr Modi’s comments on Thursday asking the Congress and its allies to raise their voice against Pakistan’s atrocities on its minorities for the past 70 years, rather than the CAA.

Ms. Banerjee also criticised the Prime Minister for “frequently comparing India with Pakistan” and wondered if Mr. Modi is “Ambassador of Hindustan or the neighbouring country.”

“India is a big country with a rich culture and heritage. Why does the PM regularly compare our nation with Pakistan? Are you the Prime Minister of India or the Ambassador of Pakistan,” the Trinamool chief said. Indicating that the Prime Minister’s responses were a strategy to divert attention from slow economic growth, Ms Banerjee said, “We don't want to be Pakistan. We love Hindustan.”

Deliberate confusion

The Chief Minister accused the BJP of “deliberately” creating confusion over the implementation of NRC, saying its leaders have been making contradictory statements on the issue.

“On one hand, Prime Minister says that there will be no NRC; on the other, the Union Home Minister and other BJP ministers claim the exercise will be conducted across the country.”

Talking about police action during the anti-CAA protests in Uttar Pradesh, which claimed several lives, Ms. Banerjee, in an apparent reference to her counterpart Yogi Adityanath, said, “those who cannot rule are governing major States.”

Dubbing her fight against the CAA as the “second war of Independence”, she said the BJP knows “how to divide the nation on the basis of religion.”

“But my religion is to defend the freedom of people. We have to save the country from bigotry,” she added.

246,2020/01/03,Two anti-CAA activists attacked in Assam,"Unidentified miscreants attacked two leaders of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) movement about 220 km apart on Thursday night.

Police said they were probing the attacks and that there was no evidence yet to establish these were related to the anti-CAA stir.

In the first of these incidents, a gunman fired at the car of Binoy Barua at Ganakpukhuri near Dergaon in eastern Assam’s Golaghat district. Mr. Barua had gone to the house of Pranjal Rajkonwar, an acquaintance, and the car was parked outside his house when the shots were fired.

“The gunman fled after the shots alerted the neighbours. I have no idea who he was but the attack could be related to the anti-CAA protest I have been organising in the area,” Mr. Barua said.

Golaghat’s Superintendent of Police Pushpraj Singh said seven empty cartridges were recovered from the site of the incident.

“The man who was attacked is politically active. We are investigating, so it is difficult to say at this point of time whether the incident is due to political or personal enmity or if there is some other reason,” he told The Hindu.

The local police said the incident happened around 9 p.m., almost 12 hours after Mr. Barua had organised an anti-CAA rally in Ganakpukhuri.

Almost simultaneously, some miscreants pelted stones at the car of Entajul Islam, a former leader of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), when he was travelling from Udalguri town to Paneri in north-central Assam.

The AASU has been spearheading the anti-CAA movement in Assam, which began violently and claimed the lives of six people in December 2019.

The district police said the attack could have been carried out by two unidentified men who rode a two-wheeler.

“We suspect a force aided by former extremists desperate to start a communal conflict was behind the attack,” local AASU leader Jayanta Bhattacharya said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dnugli/article30445756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-ADVISER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-anti-caa-activists-attacked-in-assam/article30468628.ece
247,2020/01/03,Surgical strike failed to demoralise Pak terrorists: Shiv Sena,"The Shiv Sena on Friday targeted the Centre by questioning the “efficacy” of the 2016 surgical strike and said the perception that it would demoralise Pakistani terrorists remained an “illusion” as Indian soldiers continue to get killed in terror attacks in Kashmir.

Accusing the Modi government of boasting about how Pakistan was straightened out after the surgical strike, the Sena sought to know whether it has really happened.

It also observed that troubled borders were not good for the country’s well-being.

The Sena’s remarks come in the wake of the death of an Army soldier from Maharashtra, Naik Sandip Raghunath Sawant, who was killed during a counter-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.

“The New Year did not begin on a positive note in Kashmir. Our jawan from Satara, Sandip Sawant, attained martyrdom in Kashmir along with two other soldiers. In the last one month, seven to eight jawans from Maharashtra were killed in the line of duty. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra is not responsible for this,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’

The party also questioned whether the situation in Kashmir has improved after the surgical strike and abrogation of Article 370 provisions. However, maintained that scrapping Article 370 was a good move.

India had conducted the surgical strike on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC) as a response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir earlier that month.

The Shiv Sena also questioned the government’s claim that the situation in Kashmir was under control after the nullification of Article 370. Also, alleged that there was no clarity as to what was happening in Kashmir after the scrapping of Article 370 and only the media reports of soldiers sacrificing their lives have been coming out from that state

248,2020/01/03,Six Rajasthan BSP MLAs join Congress,"A day after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati attacked the Congress over the infant deaths in a government hospital in Congress-ruled Rajasthan, six BSP lawmakers from the State formally joined the Congress after meeting party president Sonia Gandhi on Friday.

Stepping up her attack on Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Ms. Mayawati had demanded his resignation for making insensitive remarks.

Charging Mr. Gehlot with making political statements that were irresponsible and unsympathetic, Ms. Mayawati tweeted, “This is highly shameful.”

The BSP chief added that “Mr. Gehlot be dismissed and replaced by a new dispensation otherwise more women will lose their children.”

On Thursday, Ms. Mayawati also attacked Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for being silent on the infant deaths at a government-run hospital in Rajasthan’s Kota and not visiting the mothers who lost their babies.

Though the Congress didn’t get into a war of words, it seems to have reacted by making all the six BSP MLAs join the party.

“The six MLAs met the Congress president and formally took the Congress membership. They also told the Congress president that they would support the party unconditionally,” All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge for Rajasthan Avinash Pande said.

249,2020/01/03,Sonbhadra clash: 5 cops asked to deposit one-month salary as fine,"Almost six months after 11 tribals were killed in a clash over a land dispute, the Uttar Pradesh police has held five policemen responsible for laxity and asked them to deposit their 30 days’ salary as fine.

The clash took place in Sapahi village on July 17 last year.

Twenty-one people were also injured in the violence that erupted after the village headman, Yagya Dutt, and his supporters opened fire on a rival group while trying to take possession of 90 bighas of land in Ghorawal area.

Five policemen have been served notice to deposit their 30 days’ salary as fine, Sonbhadra Superintendent of Police (SP) Ashish Srivastava said on Thursday.

When village head Yagya Dutt tried to forcibly grab a disputed piece of land in 2017, police inspector Shiv Kumar Mishra and his predecessor Mool Chand Chauhan did not pay heed to complaints by Gond tribals, he said.

They handled the matter with a prejudiced approach, he added.

Srivastava said three constables, Kanhaiya Lal, Sudhakar Yadav and Pramod Kumar Singh, did not act as per the rule of law and followed directions of their senior officers.

These policemen have been found ignoring the complaint of locals expressing apprehension of some untoward incident just before the incident took place on July 17, the SP added.

Days after the clash, the Uttar Pradesh government suspended five officials, including the sub-divisional magistrate, all posted in Ghorawal.

But the saffron party retained these posts in Sangli ZP, where local Sena members decided to back its candidates.

252,2020/01/03,It’s our responsibility to take in persecuted minorities: Vijay Rupani,"Justifying the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday said it was India’s responsibility to take in persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries.

Addressing a gathering at Kothamba in Mahisagar district, Mr. Rupani criticised the Congress for opposing the controversial law that grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“The Congress always resorts to vote-bank politics. Why is the party opposing CAA? This is a conspiracy by the Congress and other opposition parties to incite people to commit violence,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Rupani was in Kothamba to unveil a statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and to inaugurate some developmental works.

After Partition, Mahatma Gandhi had said Hindus of Pakistan and Afghanistan should be allowed to return to India, the CM claimed, adding that this was also agreed upon in the Liaquat-Nehru Pact, but the agreement was not implemented.

“Due to anarchy, majority of 450 temples were demolished and only 20 remained in those countries,” he said, referring to alleged temple demolitions in the three countries.

“In Afghanistan, Lord Buddha’s statue was demolished using tanks. Buddhists were forced to flee. Where would they all go? Who would take them in? It is India’s responsibility to give them citizenship,” Mr. Rupani said.

The MLA, daughter of former Union minister and Congress veteran Sushilkumar Shinde, represents Solapur City Central Assembly constituency.

The party workers held a sit-in protest outside the Congress Bhavan in Solapur. As many as 100 Congress workers, including those from Solapur city unit’s youth wing and the National Student Union of India (NSUI) also tendered their resignations in the last couple of days as a mark of protest, a party functionary said.

The Youth Congress workers sought the inclusion of Ms. Shinde into the State Cabinet.

“We demand that Pranititai be inducted into the Cabinet as soon as possible. To press for our demand, we staged a sit-in protest today,” Congress corporator and party’s State youth wing secretary Vinod Bhosale said.

Despite the MLA’s capability, she has been denied a ministerial berth, he said.

“We are not protesting against the Congress, but against some senior leaders in the party, because of whom Pranititai could not become a minister,” Mr. Bhosale said.

Mr. Bhosale said the senior party leadership should explain why she was not inducted into the Cabinet.

Solapur (city) Youth Congress head Ambadas Kargule said the protest held on Thursday was “peaceful”, and warned that effigies of senior leadership would be burnt in future if Ms. Shinde is not given a place in the council of Ministers.

On Tuesday, Solapur district Youth Congress head Nitin Nagne wrote a letter in blood to party president Sonia Gandhi, claiming that Ms. Shinde and her father had worked hard for the party and always remained loyal to the leadership.

254,2020/01/03,Leader from coastal Odisha likely to be BJP State president,"Hectic lobbying is going on ahead of the appointment of the next president of the BJP’s Odisha unit.

The criterion for selection is said to be a new face from the State’s coastal region since the last four State unit presidents of the BJP hailed from the western region.

According to sources, the BJP is looking for a leader from the coastal belt since it is lagging behind the Congress in many areas in the region. The party had succeeded in strengthening its base in the State’s western region over the years.

Although the party’s aggressive behaviour in the State has decreased in the aftermath of the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections held last year, the new president has to work hard to keep the party workers engaged and active to fight the urban body polls this year and panchayat polls in 2022.

The BJP continues to hold press conferences at its State headquarters in Bhubaneswar on a regular basis to maintain its presence, but its voice has mellowed down after the ruling Biju Janata Dal supported the BJP candidate in the Rajya Sabha bypoll in the State a few months ago. The BJD has also supported several crucial Bills in both Houses of Parliament, including the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which has since become a law.

Sources in the party said that the party’s State unit vice-president Samir Mohanty is among the many leaders who are being considered for the president’s post.

The warning came after Aadhaar seeding of all beneficiaries under the NSAP and the MBPY could not be completed by October last year.

Aadhaar seeding is about 91% in case of NSAP and about 73% for MBPY in Odisha. Under the NSAP, elderly, widows and persons with disabilities get pension.

The MBPY beneficiaries, who include elderly, widows, persons with disabilities and HIV/AIDS-affected patients, get ₹500 to ₹700 per month. But they must not be part of any Central schemes.

257,2020/01/03,Allahabad HC reserves order on police action at AMU,"The Allahabad High Court on Thursday reserved order on a PIL against police action during an anti-CAA protest at Aligarh Muslim University on December 15.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Vivek Varma will pronounce its judgment on January 7.

In the petition filed by Mohd. Aman Khan of Allahabad, it was stated that students were protesting peacefully against the legislation since December 13.

On December 15, students gathered at Maulana Azad Library and marched up to the university gate, where police tried to provoke them, the petitioner said.

“After some time, the police started firing tear-gas shells at students and also hit them with lathis,” the petitioner alleged, adding that around 100 students were injured in the police action. The petitioner sought the formation of a panel by the court to inquire into the police action.

He also sought the release of the students detained by the police and compensation for those injured in the violence.

Appearing for the State government, Additional Advocate General Manish Goyal argued that the university gate was damaged by the students and police entered the campus on the request of the AMU administration to control the students who indulged in violence. He said no excessive force was used by police.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allahabad-hc-reserves-order-on-police-action-at-amu/article30465136.ece
258,2020/01/03,Dalits prevented from cremating body at public crematorium in Rajasthan's Tonk,"Dalits at Gata village in Rajasthan's Tonk district were prevented from cremating the body of an old woman at the public crematorium, as the people belonging to the dominant Jat community destroyed the funeral pyre and allegedly threatened the family of the deceased. The small Dalit community has cited it as an instance of the continuing caste-based discrimination in the village.

Police intervention

When the police intervened after Dalits staged a protest, Phula Devi’s body was cremated on the ground instead of the platform with tin shed where the funeral rites are usually performed. Police registered a first information report on December 23, four days after the incident, following a rally taken out by Dalits at Tonk district headquarters.

The FIR has named Tonk District Congress Committee president Laxman Chaudhary as the main accused and included several of his relatives, including four women, among the 14 other accused.

The case was registered at Peeplu police station under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly) and 297 (trespassing of funeral ground) of Indian Penal Code and various sections of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

A fact-finding team of Jaipur-based Centre for Dalit Rights (CDR), which visited Gata earlier this week, has expressed concern over the atmosphere of fear prevailing in the village and alleged that the police were under pressure not to take action in the case. “Despite the FIR specifically naming 15 accused persons, none of them has been arrested so far,” CDR Director Satish Kumar said.

Mr. Kumar said the police had not invoked Sections 4 and 7 of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, which dealt exclusively with the offences arising out of untouchability. He said though Dalits were facing discrimination as a routine affair, including not being allowed to ride a mare in wedding processions, they were earlier cremating the bodies at the common funeral ground.

‘Law will take its course’

Niwai MLA Prashant Bairwa, in whose constituency the Gata village is situated, told The Hindu on Thursday that some dominant castes were intimidating Dalits to retain their “influence in the social hierarchy”. “The law will take its course in connection with Mr. Chaudhary, who has been named in the FIR,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8u7n17/article30465127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02-DALIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dalits-prevented-from-cremating-body/article30465128.ece
259,2020/01/03,Victims’ kin yet to get autopsy reports,"It’s been more than 12 days since at least six persons were shot dead in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad during protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but the families have not yet been given post-mortem reports despite running from pillar to post, they said.

On December 20, Navi Jaan, 22, Rashid, 26, Mohammed Shafeeq, 40, Mohammed Haroon, 30, Mukeem, 20, and Arman alias Kallu, 24, were shot dead. The deceased were labourers working in different factories in Firozabad and were returning home from work when the incident happened, their families said.

While Navi Jaan, Rashid and Arman’s post-mortems were conducted in a government hospital in Firozabad, Mukeem, Haroon and Shafeeq’s post-mortems were conducted in Delhi hospitals where they were referred to from an Agra hospital.

Arman’s paternal uncle Mohammed Taufeeq told The Hindu on Thursday that he has visited the government hospital thrice asking for the post-mortem report but has been turned away. “I visited two days ago as well but the official at the mortuary told me that I should ask the police for it. Then I went to the Rasulpur police station but the official sitting there shunned me away and told me that the officer concerned is not present,” he said, adding that they need the report for their record and to proceed further.

Mr. Taufeeq and Arman’s father Mohammed Yameen have not been visited by any police officer since the protest to investigate his killing, they said. A First Information Report under section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered.

Rashid, who was shot, dead was differently abled; his right hand didn’t function. His father Noor Mohammed, 59, has gone twice to the government for his post-mortem report but to no avail. “Unhone bola hum nahi denge… kisi ko nahin mili hai… hum wapas chale aaye (They said that they won’t give… none of the victim’s families have been given… I returned),” he said. Mr. Mohammed said he is illiterate and his other sons are not interested in the proceedings due to which he has not been able to visit the police station.

Navi Jaan’s father Mohammed Ayyub had a similar experience as Mr. Taufeeq. He said he had visited the mortuary on Tuesday and was asked by the official that they should got to the police station.

‘No police visit’

“When we went to the police station on Wednesday, they asked us to come after two days,” he said, adding that no police officer has visited them for probe.

Mukeem, Haroon and Shafeeq whose post-mortems were conducted in Delhi were allegedly told by the hospitals that they’ll receive the report after 10 days.

260,2020/01/03,"Akali leader shot dead, party blames Congress","A Shiromani Akali Dal leader, said to be a close aide of former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, was shot dead by unidentified assailants in Amritsar's Umarpura village.

Gurdeep Singh’s killing on Wednesday is a second such instance of fatal attacks on SAD leaders in the State since November, when Dalbir Singh Dhilwan was killed in Gurdaspur.

Terming the murder “politically-motivated”, carried out at the behest of the ruling Congress, SAD has demanded an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case.

Police said 50-year-old Gurdeep was killed on January 1 by motorcycle-borne assailants when he was coming out of a local gurdwara after offering prayers. The police said the assailants managed to flee after pumping five bullets into Gurdeep’s body, who died on the spot.

Wife a sarpanch

Gurdeep’s wife is the village head (sarpanch) of Umarpura village.

Station House Officer Tarsem Singh told reporters that five persons have been booked in connection with the murder and police teams were conducted raids in search of the assailants, who fled the spot after the incident.

Hitting out at the ruling Congress, Mr. Majhitia said the killing of Gurdeep was a “political murder”.

“The political assassination of Baba Gurdeep Singh was a direct result of threats being issued to him of dangerous consequences if he did not stop speaking against the ‘minister-gangster’ nexus. A message had been sent to me that my close political associates will be targeted if I do not stop speaking for justice for former Akali Sarpanch Dalbir Dhilwan, who was also murdered in the same way like Baba Gurdeep Singh,” said Mr. Majithia.

261,2020/01/03,Maharashtra will follow Chhattisgarh model to tackle red terror,"The Maharashtra government will soon enact a law to tackle Naxalism on the lines of the controversial Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act (CSPSA).

State Home Minister Eknath Shinde said discussions with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray are in the final stages, and the Maharashtra Public Security Act will soon be introduced to deal with the menace of Naxalism. “The Chief Minister has already given a clearance to introduce the Act, which will be on the lines of the law in Chhattisgarh,” Mr. Shinde said.

The CSPSA 2005, also called the Chhattisgarh Vishesh Jan Suraksha Adhiniyam, has been in the news after civil society groups pointed out its “regular misuse” against activists protesting government “high-handedness”.

The People’s Union for Democratic Rights has said provisions of the Act authorise the police to detain anybody for committing acts with a “tendency to pose an obstacle to the administration of law”. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative has said the definition of “unlawful activities” imperils free exercise of fundamental freedoms laid out under Article 19 of the Constitution, and appears to restrict the right to hold public meetings.

Mr. Shinde said the decision to bring in such a legislation was taken following a meeting of senior officials from Naxal-affected areas, including those in Gadchiroli. The Minister said that during his tour of the Naxal areas in Maharashtra, he found development work was being hindered by protests. He thus ordered that a body like the Border Roads Organisation be set up to carry out road works under trying circumstances.

The CSPSA also imposes certain restrictions on media reporting in conflict areas. The Act bars the media from carrying reports of any kind of “unlawful activities” in the State. Following the enactment of the law, the International Federation of Journalists had appealed to the President not to give his assent to such an “undemocratic legislation”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9bcpwh/article30464836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMGADCHIROLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-will-follow-chhattisgarh-model-to-tackle-red-terror/article30464838.ece
262,2020/01/03,Centre rejects Maharashtra tableau in Republic Day parade,"The Union government’s decision to reject Maharashtra’s tableau for the Republic Day parade, along with that of some other States including West Bengal, has set off a political controversy.

The alliance partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday said the Centre’s rejection was prejudiced. The theme for the State’s tableau was to be the 175 years of Marathi theatre.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule tweeted, “The Centre has rejected permissions to the tableaux of Maharashtra and West Bengal from parading on Republic Day. It is a festival of the country and the Centre is expected to give representation to all the states. But the government is behaving in a prejudiced manner, giving step-motherly treatment to the states being ruled by the opposition parties.”

She condemned the Centre’s decision saying both Maharashtra and West Bengal have played a major role in India’s freedom struggle and the said action is an insult to people of these States.

Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut too slammed the Centre and asked whether there was any political conspiracy behind it. “Maharashtra’s tableau has always remained the centre of attraction and has even won first prize on various occasions. Would BJP have remained silent had it happened in the Congress regime?” asked Mr. Raut.

Replying to the criticism, the official Twitter handle of State unit of BJP said those criticising the Centre are purposely hiding the facts. “The selection tableaux is on rotation basis. Every year 32 states file applications from which 16 states are chosen. With addition of eight tableaux from departments of central government, a total of 24 tableaux are permitted every year,” it said.

It claimed that Maharashtra’s tableau has been rejected earlier in 1972, 1987, 1989, 1996, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2013 and 2016. “Except for two years, rest were Congress ruled years.

264,2020/01/03,"Varsities Nationals should have qualification standards, says Valson","It’s not a case of ‘the more the merrier’ at the 80th National inter-university athletics championships which are currently on at Moodbidri, near Mangaluru. In fact, the huge number has made it a long wait for athletes in almost every event.

The men’s 100m was a classic case. With the event attracting more than 300 sprinters, there were 40 heats and in the women’s section, 25 heats were run.

“In some of the women’s 100m heats, some of the runners were 30m behind the winner,” said Thankachan Mathew, a prominent coach from Pala’s Alphonsa College and part of the MG University team, from Moodbidri on Friday evening. “They should do something to bring down the numbers.”

The scene was almost similar in the women’s long jump qualifying round with the topper doing 6.09m and many at the back of the pack not even able to do 3m. And in women’s discus throw, the qualifying round topper produced a 47.81m effort while many at the lower end could not bring out a 15m throw.

The only solution, feels Athletics Federation of India secretary C.K. Valson, is to have qualification standards for the varsities Nationals.

A mess

“They should have qualification standards and select athletes. Otherwise, it will become a mess and you will only have time to run hours of competition and not have any results coming out of it,” said Valson, the Competitions Director for Asian athletics.

“Even technical officials will not be able to do a proper job. And with such big numbers in jumps and throws, an athlete will have to wait a long time after every round in the qualification series.”

But there is a worry that universities and coaches may find a way around the qualification standards.

“Universities may just bring athletes claiming that they had achieved the qualifying mark, so even introducing entry standards may not change the scene much,” said Thankachan Mathew. “At the MG University (in Kottayam), we have fixed the sixth place of the previous varsities Nationals as the entry standard.”

Timing not ideal

Even the championships’ timing is not ideal.

“The timing is very bad. It’s virtually off-season for almost the whole world. It’s the building-up period now. You don’t participate in the month of December or early January anywhere,” said the AFI secretary.

“And these athletes will have to be back to their form in the months of March-April again. They will not have sufficient time. Ideally, the varsities Nationals should be in September, just before the Open Nationals.”

The AFI had an observer and a technical delegation at the varsities Nationals a few years ago but that is not the case now.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/4qaj6h/article30472525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th04naresh,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/varsities-nationals-should-have-qualification-standards-says-valson/article30472283.ece
265,2020/01/03,Moonwalking their way into people’s hearts,"R Kartik is living a dream. The dancer has millions of fans that includes celebrities like Riteish Deshmukh and Remo D’Souza.

Kartik is the founder of MJ5, an all-boys dance group, that locks and pops and enthralls. It was a love for Michael Jackson and a desire to pay tribute to him that was instrumental in the formation of the group in 2013. Himanshu Gola, Rohit Singh, Vishnu Kumar and Dennis Anthony and Kartik himself came together and before they knew it had won the internet with their iconic locking and popping style when they auditioned for a reality show India’s Dancing Superstar. “It was just 10 days earlier that we had formed the group. All we wanted to do was dance but the auditions went so well that we became the favourite of the audience and eventually won the show. Then on, life has not been the same,” says Kartik.

The group recently won hearts in the city with its performance on the last day of Visakha Utsav. “We have been to Visakhapatnam a couple of times before for corporate events and also for a show hosted by the Navy. The hills and the coastline make a beautiful combination,” says Rohit.

For the love of drama

The group has seamlessly blended Bollywood thumkas into locking and popping. The emotion-less faces that occasionally break into a smile add fun to their performance. Each act is peppered with Bollywood drama be it recreating the classic ‘ Ja Simran ja...jee le apni zindagi’ from Dilwale Dulhanaiya le Jayenge or the starting dialogues of ‘Oh Oh Jane Jaana’ from Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya. “Kartik brings humour to the act. In reality, he is a fun-loving person and that reflects in his choreography. The funny bits also make our acts interesting. We were once performing in front of Rajnikanth and Amitabh Bachchan and we saw them laugh out. That is all the validation we need,” says Vishnu.

MJ5 shot to fame after winning the reality show India’s Dancing Superstars

Himanshu believes that the reality show shaped their careers and helped them become more professional. “While it was a tough journey with lots of rehearsal and the pressure of improving your own acts, it was also a good learning experience. Through the show, we cemented our strengths and got to work on our weaknesses as a group ,” he says.

It was a stroke of luck that brought the boys together all of whom studied at the University of Delhi’s Vocational College. “We were regulars at college fests and were aware of each other’s dancing capabilities. We were all set to audition individually but luckily the auditions got postponed for a month and in that time Kartik came up with the idea of forming a group,” says Rohit. The boys were also a part of Kartik’s dance academy Big Dance School. After winning the show, the boys moved their base from Delhi to Mumbai.

Standing out

Imitation is the best form of flattery and there have been several other artistes who have gone beyond just copying their moves and even copied their group name! “We have to constantly keep updating ourselves so that we are always better than the ones copying us. That is the only way to lead,” says Kartik.

Dance inspirations Michael Jackson

Prabhu Deva

Allu Arjun

The group had the internet abuzz when they released a version of the song ‘Dheeme Dheeme’ along with actor Karthik Aryan. They have nearly five lakh followers on Instagram, and are frequently invited to perform at corporate events, college fests and award functions. Recalling his most memorable moment in these six years, Kartik says, “During India’s Dancing Superstar, actor Riteish Deshmukh once said that Michael Jackson would have been proud to see the things we do with his dance style and that meant a lot to us.”

266,2020/01/03,Blend of bhava and technique,"It’s not often that you notice a young Bharatanatyam danseuse find the right balance between the grammar of a rich dance form and surrender to the bhava of a number with such candour. And it’s also not often that a dancer breaks free from the style of a guru like Priyadarshini Govind and carves a niche on the stage. Chennai-based Shweta Prachande in her inaugural performance for Lasyakalpa’s annual dance festival Mukuram held at Ravindra Bharathi, Hyderabad, charmed and surprised many with her margam.

A brief virutham in the name of Lord Muruga was where it all started, describing him as the vanquisher of Surapadman and a dutiful son who does his magnanimous father Shiva proud. The alarippu composed by dancer-choreographer Aadith Seshadri borrowed richly from Thiruppugazh, made for a pleasing invocatory number. Terrific postures, brisk neck movements elaborating the salient features of Lord Muruga in a piece set to Misrachapu talam was just the confident start that Shweta needed to warrant a rasika’s interest.

The danseuse was in her element with the Swati Tirunal-composed Sumasayaka varnam in Kapi ragam. Voicing the plea of a sakhi to relieve her friend (the nayika) from the pangs of separation in the absence of the Lord Padmanabha, she lived up to the challenges posed by the contrasting jatis with her striking nritta portions. The piece was interestingly paced, making the audience root for the sakhi and empathise with her plight.

The Kshetrayya padam Choodare Adi Nadiche Hoyalu (in Sahana ragam) was the sweet spot of the presentation, where a coy nayika expresses her readiness to become one with Lord Krishna, only to become a talking point among those many around her. The sanchari bhavas of the opening lines clearly defined the extent to which Shweta was into her part - the well-defined movements, striking eyes dwelling upon the shringara rasa with an element of mischief and subtlety.

A javali on similar lines, Sarasamuladedenduku, a work of Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Kapi ragam, saw Shweta present a nayika’s excuses to thwart the man of her dreams from publicly displaying his affection for her. The dancer’s swift responses to the pacy charanams were an apt showcase of her adaptability to alternate between various speeds and holding her own with her agility.

A tillana by T Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar uniquely composed in the Hindustani raga Purvi took centre stage soon. The exquisite execution of the intricate steps with her vigorous footwork to the brisk jati passages (with the dominant swaras) yet again showed Shweta’s command over her nritta.

Abhangs, which have become a regular feature of margams in the recent years as a concluding item, found a place in Shweta’s lineup too. Through the Marathi piece Vrindavani Venu, she utilised the expansive stage space to express the devotee’s heartfelt admiration for Krishna. Bhakti conveyed through beautifully expressed motifs of nature including the mountains, (the dancing) peacocks, animals in Shweta’s piece reminded of the poet Bhanudasa’s rich visual imagery. Through the evening, the dancer was at peace with herself, enjoying her performance and letting bhava supersede her sound technique.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/o7oak1/article30469035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf27swetha2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/blend-of-bhava-and-technique/article30469033.ece

It will be followed by the Bharatanatyam performance of Renjith and Vijna at 6 p.m. and Odissi performance by Arushi and Madhavi Mudgal at 7.45 p.m.

Besides the performances that will be held in five segments — 10 a.m., 11.30 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m. and 7.45 p.m., there will also be panel discussions from January 4 to 6 (8 a.m. to 10 a.m.) featuring eminent artistes, who will take up various issues relating to the field of dance.

Varied topics

Among the topics that will be taken up by the panellists are ‘Spirituality and Classical Dance’, ‘Insights and adaptations from folk dance and theatre’ and ‘The evolving classical dance pedagogy.’ The aim behind introducing the pnael discussion was to go beyond the technique and repertoire to look into the finer elements that impact a dancer’s journey and thought process.

Apart from solo performances, ensemble works such as V.P. Dhananjayan’s ‘Thyagaraja Vaibhavam’, Singapore-based Apsaras Arts Dance Company’s ‘Alapadma - The Lotus unfolds’, ‘Vaali Moksha’, a Yakshagana presentation by Keremane Shivananda Hedge Group and Vaibhav Arekar and group.

270,2020/01/03,AIADMK win in two wards triggers row in Dharmapuri,"Two wards of Dharmapuri union, where DMK candidates were shown to have won by over 100 votes informally before dispersing for the night, only to return to find the losing AIADMK candidates declared winners, has kicked up a storm here with the DMK alleging partisanship by the returning officer.

The DMK has demanded recount in two wards in Dharmapuri panchayat union, where it has been alleged that the DMK’s win was reversed by officials and the AIADMK candidates were declared winners.

Speaking to The Hindu, Dharmapuri MP Dr. D.N.C. Senthil Kumar said, the DMK won by a margin of 111 votes in Ward 18 (New Colony) and by 106 votes in Ward 8 (Old Dharmapuri) at 3 a.m. and the figures were announced, but the declaration was not made. “Three hours later, at 6 a.m., the AIADMK candidates, who had conceded defeat were declared winners by the returning officer,” alleges Dr. Kumar.

According to the MP, in one of the two contested wards, the AIADMK candidate himself had offered to relinquish the declaration in writing, because he knew he did not win. “But that counts for nothing, because it would lead to a re-poll. What we demand is a recount.”

The pattern of the defeated AIADMK candidates wishing the winning candidates after the announcement of the final votes counted; accepting defeat and a few hours later, the same AIADMK candidates being declared winners was repeated in Harur panchayat union as well. An Independent candidate, who won by 246 votes at 2.30 a.m., was wished by the AIADMK candidate and the candidates returned home. However, at 6.30 a.m., the AIADMK candidate was declared winner.

There appeared to be oral orders from the government to the officials to declare the AIADMK candidates as winners, wherever the margin of victory was a little over 100 votes, alleged the Dharmapuri MP.

“When the result is deliberately declared in haste in such a manner hoodwinking the real winner, the only option is moving the court, where the verdict is often given after the term ends. The other option is demand for a recount, which is left to the discretion of the RO.”

The DMK MP has listed out wards in Morappur, two wards in Palacodde, and four in Karimangalam along with the wards in Dharmapuri union. “My party headquarters has moved the court for an urgent hearing. For a recount, we insist that the original papers that were used in the first time of count is produced,” he said. It was also alleged that postal votes were not opened in many wards, where the margins were less favouring the AIADMK.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/aiadmk-win-in-two-wards-triggers-row-in-dharmapuri/article30473615.ece

However, the DMK managed to win in more wards in Panchayat Union Councillor elections. The party's candidates emerged victorious in 75 out of 170 wards. The AIADMK managed to win in only 57 out of 170 wards.

The party won 10 of the 17 district panchayat wards leaving only half of it to the DMK. The Bharatiya Janata Party won a seat. The result of one more seat is awaited as of 9 a.m. Friday.

Also Read Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: AIADMK suffers a setback

The 10 seats give the party of elect one of its district panchayat councillors as the district panchayat chairperson.

In the elections to the 155 panchayat union wards, the AIADMK has thus far won 76 and its arch rival 49. With the addition of the seats won by their respective allies, the AIADMK tally goes up to 83 and that of the DMK to 54.

This victory gives the AIADMK the numbers necessary to control Thondamuthur (six out of nine), Kinathukadavu (nine out of 17), Periyanaickenpalayam (eight out of 12), Pollachi North (11 out of 17), Karamadai (15 out of 21) and S.S. Kulam (three out of five) panchayat unions.

The DMK gets to control only the Pollachi South Panchayat Union, where it trounced the AIADMK, bagging eight of the 13 seats.

In Sulthanpet Panchayat Union, though the AIADMK won six of 13 seats, the DMK with help from the Congress’ two has managed to match the AIADMK numbers. This leaves crucial the role of the lone Independent panchayat ward councillor.

The story is even more interesting in Madukkarai Panchayat Union as the AIADMK and DMK have won three seats each in the six-ward local body, making the attainment of the chairperson post difficult.

In Anamalai Panchayat Union, the role of an Independent union ward councillor could be of importance to win the chairperson post as the AIADMK has only a slender margin over the DMK. While the former has six ward councillors, including the support of a BJP member, the latter has five, including the support of a Congress member.

The result of one more that is unavailable as of Friday morning could tilt the scales either way.

In Annur Panchayat Union, the support from two BJP and one DMDK member gives AIADMK the necessary numbers to claim the chairperson post, leaving the DMK with six councillors in the 15-ward local body.

The same appears to be true of Sulur Panchayat too, as the AIADMK has won seven of the 14 wards.

The 26-year-old, who last donned India colours in an away Test match against the West Indies from August 30 to September 2, has made a return to the national side for the three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka starting here on Sunday.

Pace bowler Nortje, playing his fourth Test, finished with 2-54 off 17 overs as the home side restricted the tourists on a Newlands wicket that was expected to be full of runs.

A late cameo from Ollie Pope, one of three changes to the touring side's line-up after they lost the first Test by 107 runs, lifted England's gloom slightly as he defied the second new ball to finish unbeaten on 56.

The rest of England's top batsmen contrived to get themselves out when they looked set for a lengthy spells at the crease with Stokes dismissed for 47 and Root 35.

Joe Denly contributed 38 and Dom Sibley 34 but it is the home side who will be more satisfied after England won the toss.

They lost Zak Crawley (4) in the third over as he edged Vernon Philander to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.

The 21-year-old was making his second Test appearance after being brought in to replace the injured Rory Burns, who hurt his ankle playing soccer on Thursday in the latest setback for England on a calamity-filled tour.

Sibley was also snagged behind off Rabada just before lunch followed, in the afternoon session, by Root, caught off his gloves as he ducked into a vicious bouncer.

Denly was bowled by a full delivery from spinner Keshav Maharaj and Stokes, who hit a career-high 258 at the picturesque Cape Town ground four years ago, was beginning to look dangerous when he chipped to Dean Elgar at extra cover.

The sloppy shot left Stokes covering his face in disbelief before trudging off.

Jos Buttler (29) threatened a counter-attack before Dwaine Pretorius halted his progress and then bowled Sam Curran and Dom Bess was out first ball off the first delivery with the second new ball from Philander as De Kock took a fifth catch.

“We stuck to our disciplines, so it was a pretty good day. We can run with that,” Pretorius said.

A yorker from Rabada accounted for Stuart Broad but Pope attacked the new ball to add an unbeaten 28 runs for the last wicket with James Anderson, who will resume on three not out.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2m4bpi/article30473053.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BROADKBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-tour-of-south-africa-south-africa-vs-england-second-test-in-cape-town-day-1/article30471914.ece
287,2020/01/03,First day’s play washed out,"The first day’s Elite Group A Ranji Trophy action between host Bengal and Gujarat was washed out as persistent rains kept the Eden Gardens turf under covers forcing the umpires to call off play without a ball being bowled, on Friday.

For Bengal this is the second time in succession that inclement weather has forced the curtailment of its home match. Bengal saw its last home match against Andhra (between December 25 and 28) interrupted by rains and bad light spoiling the possibility of a result.

288,2020/01/03,"Shubman Gill intimidates umpire, Delhi players almost walk off the field","Shubman Gill is just about digging his teeth into first-class cricket. Having got the taste of ODI cricket after some match-winning knocks in Indian Premier League, the 20-year-old is promising more.

But on Friday, Gill appeared to have bitten more than he could chew. He became the centre of some unwanted attention after a heated altercation with an umpire on the first day of the Punjab-Delhi Ranji Trophy match Mohali.

On being given ‘out’, two ODI-old Gill questioned umpire Mohammad Rafi’s decision. When the intimidated umpire, in consultation with his colleague Pashchim Pathak, overturned the decision, Delhi’s skipper Dhruv Shorey almost led the team out of the field in protest.

On a day when Punjab reached 266 for eight at stumps, the 12-minute stoppage triggered by the incident involving Gill remained the talking point.

It all happened in the 10th over when Punjab was 34 for one and Gill on 10. Adjudged caught-behind off medium pacer Subodh Bhati, a surprised and instantly-animated Gill confronted the umpire, with his conduct being far from gentlemanly.

When Rafi changed his decision, the drama continued with Delhi players alleging abusive language by Gill, questioned the umpire and almost left the field. The match-referee P. Ranganathan intervened and eventually better prevailed with the match resuming. Gill, however, did not last long and was eventually out for 23.

It remains to be seen whether Ranganathan cracks the whip.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/50ketf/article30471280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHUBMANGILL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/punjab-ranji-match-against-delhi-halted-for-10-minutes-as-shubman-argues-with-umpire/article30471281.ece
289,2020/01/03,Waugh calls for scrapping of leg byes,"Former Australian batsman Mark Waugh has called for the scrapping of leg byes from all forms of cricket, saying the batting side shouldn’t be awarded runs for missing the ball.

“You know what, I’ve got a rule change in all cricket: No leg-byes, especially in T20s,” Waugh said while commentating for Fox Cricket during a Big Bash League encounter between Melbourne Stars and Sydney Thunder on Thursday.

“That should not be two runs. Why do you get runs? You missed the ball,” Waugh added.

To which, fellow commentator and former England skipper Michael Vaughan responded, “It’s just a part of the game.”

“And I’m changing it. I know it is. It doesn’t mean it’s right though,” the Australian retorted.

“So you reckon every time it hits the pad? Why should you get a run? I know it’s a part of the game. But can we change it for the better? All cricket,” Waugh added.

The 54-year-old World Cup winner said the drafter of the rule “was a pretty ordinary batsman.”

“The idea of batting is to hit the ball. Whoever made this rule up was a pretty ordinary batsman I’d say back in the heyday, back in the early 1900s,” Waugh said.

It was at that point that Vaughan said Waugh’s suggestion was a revelation.

“If you go across the last few years there’s been so many changes in the game: T20 arrived, 100 balls is going to start in the UK, talk of five day Tests going to four, but I think the most revealing is Mark Waugh’s.”

Vaughan then suggested that Waugh should become a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), custodians of the game’s law.

“You should be on the MCC cricket committee. You have to be on there. With that kind of thought process. He’s got to be on. You’ll get a couple of trips to London every year. You’ll sit in that nice room at the MCC at Lords.”

However, when asked if byes should also be done away with, Waugh replied in the negative.

“No, no byes is different. I’ll keep byes in. Then you don’t have to worry about whether the batsman has evaded the ball, played a shot at it? Leg byes nothing,” Waugh said.

“Because as a batsman you have a bat. The idea is to hit the ball with the bat. If you don’t hit it, sorry, you don’t get a run,” Waugh replied.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fv6yse/article30471227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARKWAUGH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/waugh-calls-for-scrapping-of-leg-byes/article30471228.ece
290,2020/01/03,"T20 World Cup is very much on my ‘agenda’, says Dale Steyn","Injury-ravaged South African pace legend Dale Steyn says this year’s Twenty20 World Cup is very much on his “agenda” and he will begin another effort at an international comeback with the series against England next month.

Steyn, who retired from Test cricket last year, has been battling to keep his career alive in the other two formats despite being hampered by a recurring shoulder injury. The 36-year-old is currently playing in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Stars.

“I know I’ll be part of (the T20 series against England), that was the last conversation I’ve had. I get a nice two-week break, then straight into it again. I’ll be around for the ODIs — to be honest, I don’t know how much I’ll play (the ODIs) I’ll be there for that and then definitely the T20s,” he told ‘cricket.com.au’

“That (T20 World Cup) is very much on my agenda. I’m starting to enjoy my cricket a lot more now, I think four overs is a lot easier on the body than the Test matches are,” he added.

Steyn picked the career-threatening shoulder injury in 2016 and appeared in just eight Tests, nine ODIs and two T20 Internationals since. He could not play in the 2019 World Cup despite being named in the squad due to the same injury.

The upcoming T20 World Cup is scheduled to begin in October in Australia.

Steyn has 696 international wickets from 262 matches across format.

“KG (Kagiso Rabada) is very young — to lead the attack at 24, and the next bowlers to come in are all younger than him, I think he needs somebody that’s there that is experienced, to look around and he knows he’s not only one there,” Steyn said.

“So I’m putting my hand up for that and then I’ll wait and see how selections goes. After the MSL (Mzansi Super League) that we played, there were a lot of players that come out — some fantastic bowlers.

“But the old guys still seem to do the trick — AB (de Villiers) was there, Imran Tahir was taking wickets, I was up in the wickets. Maybe we will get the nod, maybe we don’t - but I’m putting my hand up,” he added.

The limited-overs leg of England’s tour of South Africa will comprise three ODIs and an equal number of T20 Internationals to be held from February 4 to 16.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/q46oma/article30471188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DALESTEYN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t20-world-cup-is-very-much-on-my-agenda-says-dale-steyn/article30471189.ece
291,2020/01/03,AUS vs NZ: Labuschagne century puts Australia in commanding position,"Marnus Labuschagne scored his fourth century in five matches this summer as Australia continued its dominance of New Zealand by reaching 283-3 after the first day of the third cricket test.

Labuschagne shared a 156-run partnership with Steve Smith, who made 63, to give first day honours to Australia after captain Tim Paine won the toss and batted Friday on a dry Sydney Cricket Ground pitch. At stumps, Labuschagne was 130 not out with Matt Wade on 22.

It was a long day in the field for a depleted New Zealand, which was forced to make five lineup changes, including the absence of captain Kane Williamson because of a virus. Neil Wagner and Colin de Grandhomme again most-troubled the Australian batsmen, with Wagner’s short-pitched aggressive line complemented by de Grandhomme’s accurate swing bowling.

Smith took 39 balls to get off the mark as his series nemesis Wagner — who hit the star batsman on the body with his first ball — employed his short-pitched tactic to good effect to limit the Smith’s scoring options and greatly slowed Australia’s run-rate in the hour after lunch.

Labuschagne, however, was untroubled and kept the score ticking over, raising his 50 off 97 balls.

The 25-year-old batsman continued to score serenely and reached his fourth century in seven innings this summer with a clip to fine leg for a boundary off de Grandhomme in the 72nd over.

Labuschage celebrated his first hundred at the SCG — coming 12 months after his shock selection at No. 3 against India at the same venue — by raising both arms to the crowd before embracing batting partner Smith, who had reached his half-century two overs prior. His stylish century came off 163 balls with eight boundaries and one six.

“This time last year I was sitting here and there were a lot of questions,” Labuschagne said, referring to criticism of his inclusion in the top order against India here last year. “I believed that I had the ability. For me it was a lot of mental stuff and just making sure I stayed focus for long periods of times.

“It’s been an amazing time.”

The 156-run third-wicket partnership was eventually broken by de Grandhomme (2-63), who teased Smith into driving a ball outside off-stump and found the edge which carried to Ross Taylor at slip.

Smith’s second half century of the series also saw him surpass world No. 1-ranked batsman Virat Kohli’s current career tally of 7,202 runs in 84 tests, with the Australian taking 11 tests fewer to reach the same mark at an average of 62.84.

Opener Joe Burns (18) was the only wicket to fall in the first session when he edged to Taylor in the slips off de Grandhomme.

Wagner (1-48) then struck with the third ball after lunch by tempting David Warner into a pull stroke and had him caught by de Grandhomme at leg gully. Warner made 45 runs, his third score in the 40s this series.

After losing Trent Boult to a hand injury sustained in last week’s second test, a virus swept through New Zealand’s squad leading to five changes here in Sydney.

Glenn Phillips, who only flew in from Auckland on Thursday as injury cover for Williamson, made his test debut. Tom Latham was named captain, and Mitchell Santner, Henry Nicholls and Tim Southee were also out.

Seamer Matt Henry, spinners Todd Astle and Will Somerville and batsman Jeet Raval were the other inclusions for the tourists.

Australia was unchanged from the lineup that clinched the series 2-0 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground last weekend.

Players from both teams wore black armbands in memory of those killed in current wildfires in southern New South Wales and Victoria states. Conditions were expected to worsen on Saturday and smoke from the fires could affect play on the second day of the test.

Before the match began, a minute of applause was held to thank the thousands of emergency personnel, many of them volunteers, who are fighting the fires.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5ficxy/article30469612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LABUSCHAGNE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-tour-of-australia-australia-vs-new-zealand-third-test-in-sydney-day-1/article30469613.ece
292,2020/01/03,"Will now get a chance to interact about my bowling with Bumrah, says Navdeep Saini","Navdeep Saini didn’t get a chance to share the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah in his six international games and no wonder he is excited at an opportunity to pick the brains of India’s pace spearhead during the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.

Saini, has so far played an ODI and five T20 Internationals but Bumrah has either been rested or was out due to his stress fracture on lower back during these games.

“I can now share my weaknesses and shortcomings with him. I can learn more by watching him bowl. It will be a good opportunity for me. I am really looking forward to it,” Saini told PTI in an exclusive interview.

The 27-year-old had a memorable last year when he made impressive debut in white ball cricket as he hopes put in those hard yards to cement his place in a highly competitive bowling attack ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in October.

“Our bowling attack is the strongest at the moment and that gives me that extra motivation. And that I have to work even harder to secure a regular spot,” he said when asked where does he see himself in the World Cup-bound Australia squad.

Known for his fiery pace, the man from Karnal in Haryana impressed with figures of 3/17 on his international debut in the West Indies tour last year.

In four months’ time, he made ODI debut against the same opponents in Cuttack, when the 27-year-old was drafted in place of an injured injured Deepak Chahar.

“I had prepared well for my debut match and thankfully that yorker came off well. Let’s hope to do well again. I am just keeping my preparation going,” the wiry pacer said about his dream spell of 3-0-10-2 in Cuttack when he cleaned up Roston Chase with a deadly yorker and also accounted for the in-form Shimron Hetmyer.

With Mohammed Shami rested and the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar injured, Saini is a part of the squad for the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka, followed by the three ODIs against Australia.

Saini is aware that it’s very tough to secure a place with so much of competition in the ranks.

“From here on, every match and series is important for me. If I do well, I can also grow well as a cricketer and the team will also win. I don’t think too far ahead. Always I take one match at a time and think of giving my best every time.

“All my hard work paid off and I had a successful 2019. It’s about putting in that extra mile again so as to secure my place.”

For Saini, the challenge will be to become mentally stronger when the batsmen go on offensive.

“It’s about becoming mentally strong. Everything boils down to the fact that how strong you are mentally. You can put in that hard work of you are strong mentally.”

Known for his fiery pace with ability to bowl consistently as 140kph, Saini said his success mantra is sheer hard work and nothing else.

“It’s nothing but sheer hard work. That’s the only secret. There is no other formula. It’s as simple as that,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jgqdbr/article30469519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAVDEEPSAINI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/will-now-get-a-chance-to-interact-about-my-bowling-with-bumrah-says-navdeep-saini/article30469520.ece
293,2020/01/03,Mumbai vs Karnataka: a battle of the heavyweights,"It is one of the most — if the not the most — high-profile affairs in the domestic cricket calendar.

However, more than living up to the ‘big match’ tag, both Mumbai and Karnataka will be hoping to revive their Ranji Trophy campaigns at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s Bandra-Kurla Complex facility.

Karnataka’s eight Ranji titles are the second-best to Mumbai’s whopping 41, but in the recent past, Karnataka has snatched the tag of the “team to beat” from Mumbai with consistent performances across formats. Still, the visiting outfit is recovering from a poor show versus Himachal Pradesh in Mysore last week.

To add to its woes, star opener Mayank Agarwal has been asked to skip the game by the BCCI medical team. It will result in Abhishek Reddy opening the innings either with R. Samarth or Rohan Kadam. Captain Karun Nair had a reason to smile, with pacer Ronit More having recovered from a niggle that forced him to the sidelines against Himachal.

The Mumbai camp, on the other hand, is still recovering from a shock loss to Railways at the Wankhede stadium last week.

Having started the season with a commendable win in Baroda after a forgettable last season, Mumbai’s season was derailed with a 10-wicket loss.

Opener Jay Bista has been the victim of an otherwise settled yet inconsistent batting line-up, losing his place in the side.

With Shardul Thakur set to join National duty along with Shreyas Iyer and Shivam Dube, Mumbai will pin its hopes on Ajinkya Rahane to make his last appearance of the season count for the home team with a big knock.

While vice-captain Aditya Tare is likely to open the innings with Prithvi Shaw, it will be interesting to see if Mumbai gets offie Shashank Attarde or left-arm spinner Vinayak Bhoir to make up for Thakur’s absence.

Considering the flat deck, captain Suryakumar Yadav hinted at including a spinner but an early start — 9am — to ensure full day’s play may tempt the home team to bolster its pace department.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/huxaom/article30467172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03KARUN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mumbai-vs-karnataka-a-battle-of-the-heavyweights/article30467173.ece

The air pollution has been in the ‘severe’ category for five out of the past six days, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

On Thursday, the average level of PM2.5 — deadly respirable particles, which is a chief pollutant — was 282.3 ug/m3, more than four times the safe limit of 60ug/m3, as per Indian standards, in Delhi and NCR at 7 p.m., the CPCB said. The level is, however, more than 11 times the safe limit of 25 ug/m3, as set by the World Health Organization.

“Very calm conditions are persisting during stable night time with a sign of clustered emission hot spots, probably due to slow and congested traffic, leading to the accumulation of pollutants near the ground under very cool temperature,” SAFAR said. “We have been getting ground reports of a lot of traffic congestion. This accumulates and causes pollution,” a SAFAR official explained.

The city’s air quality index (AQI) on Thursday was 417, slightly down from Wednesday’s 437, according to the 4 p.m. bulletin of the CPCB that is the average of the past 24 hours.

“The AQI is forecast to improve to the higher end of ‘very poor’ category by January 3 and likely to remain in the same category on January 4,” SAFAR said.

297,2020/01/03,Two arrested for Seelampur violence get bail,"A Delhi court has granted bail to two persons arrested for their involvement in Seelampur protests noting that there was nothing on record to show that they were a part of any violent mob.

The police had charged the two persons under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 307 (attempt to murder), and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.

Judge Gurdeep Singh, while granting bail to both applicants, said, “Firstly, as regards to offence under Section 307 IPC, as per IO [Investigating Officer] injuries sustained by the police are simple in nature”.

Self-made video

The judge noted that the accused Sajid Ali was seen in the video footage made by himself, marching along with other participants and not seen pelting stone or setting public toilet on fire.

“Further there is no eyewitness to the effect that he [Ali] is part of the violent mob who pelted stones, set public toilet on fire and broke the window of the car,”.

In the case of accused Daniyal, the court said he is also not seen in the video pelting stone or setting public toilet on fire. Also, there is no eyewitness.

“Therefore in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in view the period of custody and his role, I am of the opinion that he is also entitled to bail,” the court said.

As a condition of bail, the court said the duo should make themselves available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and to report to the IO or Station House Officer (SHO) concerned on every 15 days for a period of six months regarding their activities.

His family in Meetnagar of Loni is still to come to terms with the loss.

Amit Kumar Balyan (28) died when he, along with other firefighters, got trapped in the rubble following a blast at the operation site.

“It’s a big loss for the family, but I am proud of my son. He sacrificed his life while saving others,” said Babu Ram, Amit’s father.

“He had completed basic fire training at Fire Safety Management Academy. He was posted at Kirti Nagar fire station as a fire operator,” said Atul Garg, DFS Director.

Amit is survived by his wife, father, mother, a younger brother and two younger sisters. His wife Shivani is a constable with the U.P. police.

“The couple had got married in February 2019. He left the house on Tuesday for work and was supposed to return on Thursday night. We did not inform his wife about the incident till she returned from work,” said a relative.

299,2020/01/03,Wi-Fi service now available in Metro Airport Express Line trains,"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday launched a free Wi-Fi service inside metro trains plying on the Airport Express Line that is touted as the first such facility in the country.

The service has been launched by DMRC Managing Director Mangu Singh. Addressing the media, Mr. Singh said, “Internet connectivity is extremely crucial in today’s age. Many of the DMRC stations already have Wi-Fi services, but it is for the first time that such services will be available inside the trains as well.”

Mr. Singh added that by December 2020, Wi-Fi services inside trains will be extended to the Blue, Yellow, Red, Green and Violet lines of the Delhi Metro network.

“Based on the performance, we will see how it can be extended to the Pink, Magenta and Grey Lines,” he said.

Logging in

Commuters will be able to access the Wi-Fi services by logging onto the “METROWIFI_FREE” network and feed in the one-time password received on the mobile. Officials said that once logged onto the network, commuters will get automatically connected to the services on subsequent journeys made on the corridor.

Officials added that with the launch, India also became the first country in the South Asian region to be providing free Wi-Fi connectivity to commuters travelling in underground trains.

DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said, “For giving a seamless Wi-Fi experience on the Airport Express Line, the consortium has laid a dedicated 24-km fibre network, 7 km of power cable with 44 base stations [pole as well as frame type] and other active components along the entire length of the line to ensure that trains never lose the Wi-Fi connectivity.”

Speaking about the project, Mr. Dayal said, “Only three hours of work per day was undertaken for the project beyond the operational hours of the Airport Express Line, with all safety precautions in place.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wi-fi-service-now-available-in-metro-airport-express-line-trains/article30465072.ece
300,2020/01/03,Firefighter killed during rescue operation at battery warehouse,"A firefighter was killed during a rescue operation at a battery warehouse in west Delhi’s Peeragarhi industrial area where a fire broke out on Thursday morning, the police said. The structure collapsed following an explosion and 17 people sustained injuries in the incident, they said.

The victim, Amit Baliyan, was inside the building carrying out a rescue operation when a part of the building collapsed following a loud sound resembling a cylinder explosion. Amit, along with 13 other firefighters, got trapped in the rubble. All except Amit were safely rescued by other firefighters. Amit remained untraceable for around four hours, said a Delhi Fire Service (DFS) officer.

“Amit was later located and oxygen was supplied to him. He was immediately rescued and rushed to Balaji Hospital in Paschim Vihar where he succumbed to injuries. A total of 40 fire engines and hydraulic fire-fighting vehicles were pressed into service,” said DFS Director Atul Garg.

The police said they received a call around 4.15 a.m. at Paschim Vihar (West) police station regarding fire at a battery warehouse. A police team reached the outlet-cum-godown of batteries and inverters at Peeragarhi’s Udyog Nagar. It was found that the fire started in the basement of the building that was used for storing batteries.

“We immediately informed the DFS, DDMA, NDRF and CATS for the rescue operation. A total of 17 people, including three workers of the warehouse and 14 firefighters sustained injuries and were shifted to a hospital,” said a senior police officer.

Around 7 a.m., when the firefighters were inside the building carrying out the operation, the ceiling of the building collapsed following an explosion. “We are trying to remove all combustible materials from the building and other materials used in the manufacturing of battery,” said a firefighter.

The firefighters faced difficulties inside building due to the toxic smoke from the burned batteries. “One can see thick black smoke emerging out of the building for the last ten hours. It is highly toxic and we used oxygen cylinders during the operation. Batteries were blasting and acid was spilling all over. It was not a usual fire call,” said another firefighter.

Till the filing of this report, the cooling operation was under way.

Rajinder Singh Sagar, ADCP (Outer) said that an FIR has been registered under IPC Sections 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304 A (causing death by negligence) at Paschim Vihar (West) police station.

₹1 crore compensation

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced an ex gratia of ₹1 crore to Amit’s family.

“Amit Baliyan laid down his life while serving the people of Delhi. Nothing can bring back a loved one lost, but Delhi government will give ₹1 crore as financial assistance to his family. It is the least we can do as a society...” Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet.

“Deeply anguished over news of death of fire operator Amit Balyan Amit along with his team members fought bravely to save lives of many people. I salute his bravery. My sincere condolences to his family members. All possible assistance to be extended to the injured and bereaved family [sic],” L-G Anil Baijal said in a tweet.

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari alleged that the Delhi government was not taking required steps to prevent such incidents. “This incident of fire is not a natural one and hence our duty should be to find out the reasons and take measures. The death of a fireman is an irreparable loss to his family. However, many lives have been saved due to the bravery of the firemen,” Mr. Tiwari said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3sxwzc/article30465060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03FIRE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/firefighter-killed-during-rescue-operation-at-battery-warehouse/article30465062.ece
301,2020/01/03,Harsh Vardhan tried to cancel PTM: Sisodia,"Calling the BJP an ‘anti-education party’, the Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday blamed it for allegedly opposing a parent-teacher meeting (PTM), which is proposed to be held in government schools on January 4.

“Today I read in media reports that Union Minister Harsh Vardhanji has written to the Lieutenant-Governor, requesting him to cancel the PTM. How did you get the courage to do this? You should be ashamed. It is unfortunate that we have such leaders and Ministers who can stoop to such levels,” said AAP leader Manish Sisodia.

He added that the BJP should work on developing the educational infrastructure all over India and in the Municipal Corporation-run schools of Delhi which are under them, instead of stopping the development.

“The reality of BJP is it is the enemy of education, therefore, they are trying to stop the PTM. Today it is clear that the BJP wants no dialogue on the issue of women’s safety, preparation of students before an examination, the issue of attendance or feedback on students. BJP is an anti-education party. The BJP should realise that such an anti-education mindset is also harming the families and the children of their volunteers because the children of many BJP volunteers also study in government schools,” he added.

Mr. Sisodia said the mega PTM initiative has been one of the key aspects of the revolutionary change in government schools.

“In the last 5 years, we have worked very hard to develop the school education system in Delhi. Now, the Delhi model of education is being discussed all over,” added Mr. Sisodia.

Responding to this, Mr. Vardhan said: “Don’t need a certificate from Sisodia.” He clarified that the teachers’ associations of the government schools had met him at his residence on Wednesday and gave him a copy of a representation which they had submitted to the L-G expressing concern over the PTM when schools in most northern States have been closed due to the cold weather.

They are seeking postponement of the meeting in view of the health hazards that the children are likely to suffer due to severe cold weather, Mr. Vardhan added.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too took to Twitter to express his dismay over the issue. “Why do these people want to cancel PTM? In PTM, parents get an opportunity to discuss their children’s progress with teachers. Many parents wait for PTM eagerly. PTM will be on time. I will also go to one of the schools tomorrow to get parents’ feedback,” he tweeted in Hindi.

302,2020/01/03,DDA – authority meeting,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Thursday approved a proposal to undertake in situ rehabilitation of projects with respect to 17 projects by executing the work on a public-private partnership mode through open tenders based on detailed project reports (DPR) prepared by consultants.

In the meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who is also the chairman of the DDA, approved an amendment to the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 pertaining to the operation of wellness centres in residential areas.

“Under the amendment new wellness centres shall be allowed on ground floor and basement from the date of notification in residential and mixed use streets. The Authority has also approved the amendment where fitness centres including gyms, yoga and meditation centres, will be permitted in these areas,” the urban body said.

Another modification to the MPD-2021 under which EWS (economically weaker section) dwellings developed to be sold directly to eligible beneficiaries was also approved by the DDA, officials said.

“Earlier the process of allotment of EWS flats to beneficiaries involved levying stamp duties at two levels – one when the developer entity sells to the DDA and other when DDA allots it to the beneficiaries. This resulted in a dual stamp duty on the beneficiaries,” officials explained.

A proposal to modify development control norms and activities permissible under the religious category at a sub city level also received the urban body’s nod.

“These include training centres for yoga, spiritual activities, museums, art gallery, exhibition centres, restaurant and bank extension counters,” the land-owning agency said.

303,2020/01/03,Polling officials to stay overnight at city booths,"In a first for the Capital, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has decided to deploy polling officials at booths the night before the Delhi Assembly election.

Confirming the development on Thursday, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi Ranbir Singh said the reason behind the move is to ensure a hassle-free polling process.

“This is to make sure that officials are more at ease on the day of polling. Usually, they have to reach the booths early morning and some of them take trains from far-off places. Necessary provisions will also be made for them,” he said, adding that this system is practiced in other States but it is a first for the Capital. Several meetings have been held between the police and the ECI officials regarding arrangements for the upcoming elections.

A senior officer said one policeman will be present in each polling team from the time they enter the centres at night. “This move will make the polling party more comfortable. They can check if any machine is out of order in case it falls while carrying and if the infrastructure is in place,” said an official.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Election Cell) Sharat Sinha said the preparations for the election are under way. “The policemen are prepared to make an assessment. Meetings and briefings are being conducted with officials at all levels. Inter-State border meetings will also take place. Necessary preventive measures are being taken,” he said.

Over 60,000 security personnel, including Home Guards and paramilitary forces, were deployed across the city a day before the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019. The police had kept vigil to ensure malpractices like liquor peddling and movement of anti-social elements to influence voters did not happen especially from border areas.

“A building can only be transformed into a school by its teachers and students. With a well-furnished building, we also need quality education to be imparted here and then only the purpose will be served. It is a brand new building today, 5-10 years down the line, the colours of the walls will turn dull and the only way to maintain the shine is by delivering brilliant students,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia added that the government schools are being shut down in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, and privatised in Uttar Pradesh as the government is unable to run the institutes.

“Delhi is the only State where new government schools are being set up and old ones being revamped. The parents are taking their children out of the private schools to enrol them in government schools,” he claimed.

He said earlier, students of government schools only had access to “kaam-chalau” education.

The have been on a sit-in protest for more than two weeks at the Noida-Kalindi Kunj Highway demanding withdrawal of the amended citizenship law.

While certain individuals, claiming to be organisers of the demonstration, had put out statements that the agitation was to be called off, those at the site of protest dismissed these as rumours being spread to break the demonstration.

“All our sisters here have promised to stay put until some action is taken,” said social activist Shaheen Kauser, who has been hosting the demonstrations from a stage here since the first day of protests.

Others such as Shahnawaz (65) said that until a representative from the government come forward and speak to the protesters or clear assurances are given in Parliament or in writing, the demonstration would not be called off.

Nazia, a research scholar and a resident of the area, scoffed at the news that the demonstrations were to stop. “This will go on,” she said.

Rubbishes claims

Meraj Khan, part of the Shaheen Bagh Coordination Committee, said that two people who had put out statements claiming that the protest had been called off had been part of the demonstrations only for the last few days and were falsely portraying themselves as “chief organisers.” The individuals also attempted to communalise the demonstration through incendiary speeches and tried to scare protesters by claiming that “BJP goons” or the police would soon take action, he added.

However, conversations with the police representatives had revealed that no such order had been issued, Mr. Khan said.

309,2020/01/03,Pitfalls in life,"There was a poor man, who ardently craved wealth. He did severe penance, and when God appeared before him he said he wanted a lot of wealth. God gave him a stick and said, “Every time you strike this stick on the ground, you will get one thousand gold coins. But the moment you lose your temper, the stick will disappear and so will all your wealth.” The poor man took the stick and went away happily. On the way, a sanyasi asked him why he carried a stick with him. The poor man tapped the stick on the ground, and as God had promised, a thousand gold coins showed up. The sanyasi then asked the poor man many questions, which the latter answered patiently at first. But with more and more questions being asked the poor man lost his patience and spoke angrily to the sanyasi. Immediately, the stick as well as the coins disappeared, as God had warned.

The story shows the impermanence of wealth and how we can lose everything we possess in a matter of minutes, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. If we run after wealth and other material possession, there will be darkness and worry in our lives. But when we seek God, we get jnana. Thiruvalluvar says that in order to get rid of desires, we must seek the One who has no desires. Vallalar says that we spend our lives in the pursuit of various things. This ruins our health and finally our lives end. Joy is like a mirage. Be like a mother to me, prays Vallalar to Muruga. Saint Appar saw Lord Siva as every one of his relatives. Manickavachagar saw Lord Siva as his parents. Vallalar in his Tiruarupta says to Lord Siva: “When a father punishes a child, the mother comes to its support. If a mother is harsh with the child, then the father comes to its support.

310,2020/01/03,Protests over CAA continue in Hyderabad,"Protests broke out at different mosques in the city, including Mecca Masjid, soon after Friday prayers.

The incident took place after 1.15 pm when around 200 people who left the mosque began to raise anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) slogans. They then proceeded towards Moghalpura and intensified the protest. Police detained six protesters.

Another protest against CAA and the National Register of Citizens was witnessed at the Nanabagh Masjid in Basheerbagh where congregants carried placards.

But the Shahi Masjid near Public Gardens witnessed an interesting sight. Soon after the Friday sermon, which touched upon issues of NRC, CAA and National Population Register, and the prayers, around 1,000 flags were handed to congregants. Caps ‘rejecting’ NRC and CAA too were given.

Khateeb of Shahi Masjid Maulana Ahsan al Hamoomi said, “Around 1,000 flags were given. In the Friday khutba (sermon), I said this is a case of tiranga versus bhagwa. We have to show we are people of the tricolour. Also, NRC and CAA, are not just anti-Muslim, they are anti-Dalit and anti-Adivasi. Technically, a lot of Dalits do not consider themselves different from Hindus. The two legislations will affect them badly.”

All India Muslim Personal Law Board office-bearer Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani on Friday reiterated the anti-CAA, NRC protests were not communal in nature, but against forces trying to ‘destroy the Constitution’. “Everybody, irrespective of religion, is protesting. This is because they understand this is not a matter of religion, but of constitutional values, such as equality and justice. It is the bad intention of the government that they have done this, when they could have said those who have been persecuted can come to India. Further, granting citizenship has been the discretion of government. So why exclude people?” he said.

Meanwhile, people from different walks of life took to social media to say that they would be at the planned ‘Million March’ against CAA and NRC on Saturday. Several began making banners, posters and stickers. Others began to take up logistical work and launched a Google Form to designate pick-up points.

312,2020/01/03,India is a secular country and will remain secular: Ram Madhav,"National Secretary of the BJP, Ram Madhav, on Friday, swore by the Constitution of India which offers ‘equal rights to all citizens irrespective of faith, caste, creed or colour’.

“India is a secular country, has been one, and will continue to be one for times immeorial. So, citizens of the country have nothing to fear about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),” he averred.

‘CAA is a humanitarian Act’

Further, “CAA is a humanitarian Act brought about to resolve a long pending issue of providing justice to refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Therefore, to oppose it is most ridiculous,” he said. Mr. Madhav appealed to Muslims not to be “mislead by false propaganda by knowledge proof and intelligent proof Opposition Parties”. He said it was “unfortunate” about talking of Muslims being discriminated when “people of all religions including different strands of Islam” stay here.

The BJP leader was delivering a talk on the CAA at a meeting organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of RSS, at Osmania University’s Tagore auditorium here.

India has never refused refugees and even now Muslims from the neighborhood can become citizens here through marriage, showing proof of residence for 12 years, and so on, Mr. Madhav clarified. “The CAA was meant for past refugees alone with a cut off date of December 2014. After that even Hindus will not be allowed to get citizenship through CAA,” he maintained.

A past legacy

The BJP leader was at pains to state that the CAA was a legacy of the past including the pacts signed by Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru with Pakistan’s Liaqat Ali Khan as well as Indira Gandhi with Bangladesh’s Sheikh Mujibhur Rehman.

He pointed out that for some reason the then governments did not amend the CAA and did not sign the UN Convention of Refugees Treaty leaving refugees stranded. “The Modi government took the bold resolve to fulfil a decades old demand,” he reasoned.

Opposing without knowing why

Most of those opposing do not know why they are doing so but they were bringing down the prestige of the government and country, Mr. Madhav rued. “It could also be because they are unable to take on Prime Minister Modi politically,” he opined.

313,2020/01/03,Badshahi Ashoorkhana restoration stalled again,"Squatters again managed to stop work on the restoration and beautification of Badshahi Ashoorkhana near the High Court. Nearly 10 years after the HC ordered their eviction from the Shia religious place, a group of people, led by a political leader, forced the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials to stop work on its outer part.

“The GHMC workers began digging at the site on Monday after moving the concertina wire, when a large group of people intervened at 4 p.m. and asked them to stop work. They demanded that the soil dug up for laying foundation be filled back,” said Abbas Moosavi, the traditional caretaker of the Ashoorkhana. Near the archway, the soil has been flattened.

Letter to DCP

The current effort to restore the site began with the department of Archaeology and Museums director writing to GHMC to take up the work on December 23, 2019. On December 27, the GHMC zonal commissioner wrote to the DCP to provide police protection for the work.

“Before the work was taken up by GHMC, we even met Charminar MLA Mumtaz Khan who agreed that the work is important. But later, others turned up at the site and created a ruckus,” Mr. Moosavi said.

The Ashoorkhana, built in the early half of the 17th century along with the Charminar, is one of the few surviving Qutb Shah-era monuments with magnificent tile work. This place of pilgrimage was turned into a horse stable after the conquest by Aurangzeb.

On the left side of the entrance arch was a chabootra (a raised platform) and to the right was the guardroom. While the encroachers were pushed out by HC orders in 2009, the space of guard room and chabootra was being eyed for real estate.

314,2020/01/03,AI technology to bloom in Telangana,"The Telangana government intends to make extensive use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in e-governance, healthcare, agriculture and education, in the coming years to deliver efficient services to people. It is also aware of concerns about privacy and is willing to adhere to the commonly agreed upon national ethical guidelines on this aspect, said Minister for Information Technology, Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao on Thursday.

The Minister said this during the launch of several AI initiatives, in the city.

More jobs

“Use of AI and other technologies of Blockchain and cyber security, among others, can address complex governance issues with the potential to transform the lives of people and generate scores of jobs. We want to take AI to the next level with the objective of making the city one of the top 25 global centres. The goal is to attract $ 3-4 billion investment and 2 lakh jobs to begin with,” Mr. Rao said.

Declaring “2020 as the Year of AI”, the IT and Electronics department entered into Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with eight organisations, including premier educational institutes and global firms, for scaling up AI in data processing, machine learning, capacity building and training.

While admitting that people are ‘paranoid’ about new technologies and concerns over ‘privacy’, the Minister refuted that the government was acting as a ‘big brother’. “These technologies pose challenges but we are already using it,” he said.

Stating that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was keen on utilising latest technologies for public welfare, he spoke about the photo recognition technology with the help of smartphones for pensioners to get their ‘life’ certificate from the comfort of their homes and another, where a farmer can take a photo of pest devouring crops to send it to experts for advice, as two examples where citizens have been directly benefited.

“If ‘Intelligent Technology’ is harnessed properly, it can tackle healthcare and other issues. People will be sceptical as they were when the IT boom happened but we can bring about amazing changes. We have no option but to leapfrog technologies and cannot afford to lag behind,” he said.

In response to an earlier plea made by Cyient founder B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, Mr. Rama Rao stated that AI would be introduced in engineering curriculum and faculty training programmes too would be initiated.

Among the MoUs are: Intel in partnership with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) & IIIT-Hyderabad for setting up an Applied AI centre in healthcare and mobility, with IIT-Kharagpur, with Nividia, Adobe, IIT-Hyderabad, Wadhwani AI, Hexagon, and Innovation Norway. Heads or representatives of these institutes spoke about their respective works on AI.

315,2020/01/03,Contributions pour in for woman struggling to save son,"Generous contributions poured in for a 35-year-old woman struggling to save her son’s life from Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), a rare blood disorder where the bone marrow ceases to produce red blood cells.

Responding to a news report with the headline “A mother’s plea to save her son’s life” published in The Hindu on Thursday, people donated ₹97,000 so far.

B. Lokesh (17) was diagnosed with PRCA a month after his birth. His mother B. Surekha, a tailor, and late father B. Ravi saved all their money for his treatment.

The teenager needs ₹4,000 per month for medicines. He also needs two rounds of blood transfusion a month and for that, need to spend another ₹1,000 to travel from their government sanctioned home at Abdullapurmet to a blood bank in central Hyderabad.

After Ravi died of a heart attack in February 2017, the financial responsibility of taking care of Lokesh was on Surekha. She earns only about ₹3,000 a month by stitching clothes and gets ₹2,000 as pension from the government. A ‘meagre’ ₹5,000 was not enough to meet the daily expenses and so, for his treatment, she used to rely on hand loans.

The ordeal was published in these columns, along with her bank account number and phone number.

People from various walks of life called her and assured her financial help. A total of ₹97,000 was transferred to her account till Thursday, including ₹50,000 and ₹10,000 from two individuals. Besides, some students promised her to pool in more money.

“I never expected so many people will come forward to help me. I was worried that my son might not survive as we did not have enough money to buy medicines. I am thankful to everybody for the generous donation,” Ms. Surekha said.

319,2020/01/03,CBI searches houses of SBI officials over ‘ loan fraud’,"The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday conducted searches at the residence of top officials of State Bank of India and Renlife Labs Private Limited in connection with a ₹16-crore loan fraud case registered on December 31.

According to the FIR copy accessed by The Hindu, the firm, which is into purchase and sale of human blood-derived products, such as Immunoglobulin, used the name of one Vijay Raghavendra Mysore of Bengaluru and added him as their third director.

Further, the accused forged documents stating that Mr. Vijay's father is dead and used the family property as collateral security to the bank for obtaining loan.

SBI Regional Manager P Ravi Kumar told the investigating agency that initially, the Saifabad branch had rejected the loan and subsequently financial consultant Janaki Rama Sarma moved to Mahabubgunj branch, where an asset-backed loan of ₹16 crore was sanctioned after the bank accepted the produced documents of three acre 30 gunta vacant land in Bengaluru South.

Assistant General Manager (Cyber Crimes) of SBI Dhanrjana Rao in the last week of November 2017 had entrusted the proposal for processing the loan to Pawan Kumar, RMME, Mahabubgunj branch.

320,2020/01/03,Miyawaki forest dies in UoH nursery bags,"At a time when politicians and celebrities are throwing green challenges at one another towards increasing green cover in the State, GHMC’s laxity and inaction has resulted in thousands of seedlings drying up even before plantation at the University of Hyderabad.

The Miyawaki forest patches proposed by GHMC in the university died a miserable death in the nursery bags, and all one can see there now are dried saplings, and empty pits.

Miywaki is the latest trend catching up in urban greenery, towards developing thick forests within shorter span of time.

The technique was developed and perfected by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, and it is said to help the plant growth 10 times faster and 30 times denser than the usual. GHMC has proposed to deploy the technique in its West Zone, to grow forests at various locations of Patancheru and Gachibowli. It was planned to initially plant 13 acres at BHEL, two acres in Gachibowli stadium and three acres in University of Hyderabad.

Launch couldn’t happen

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) K.T.Rama Rao was initially scheduled to launch the project at University of Hyderabad, and plant material in thousands of nursery bags was kept ready at the site, along with pits to accommodate them.

Bore-well was dug and a pump-set too was fixed at the location, for regular water supply to the plants.

The launch, however, could not happen as the Minister was held up elsewhere, and the plantation did not take place either on the scheduled day or later on.

As per the eyewitness accounts and available photo and video evidence, at least 10,000 seedlings proposed to be planted in 20 beds, dried up in the nursery bags, for want of water, even while the pits dug for the same are intact.

Official reaction

When approached for her version, Zonal Commissioner D. Hari Chandana said the saplings could not be provided water as power connection was yet to be obtained to the pump set.

The arrangement for water to be brought from the stadium too has failed. She claimed that the desiccated seedlings were only the remainder, after major part of the plantation was done.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gcop3c/article30464269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy03Plants,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/miyawaki-forest-dies-in-uoh-nursery-bags/article30464270.ece
321,2020/01/03,Why Western songs today are getting shorter,"Western songs are now much reduced in girth, with their average ""BMI"" hovering somewhere around three minutes.

Take the top five on the Billboard year-end Hot 100 Singles of 2019, and they resemble models ""chiselled"" to carry off size-zero outfits.

Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" clocks in 1:53 minutes; Post Malone's ""Sunflower"", 2:38; Halsey's ""Without Me"", 3:21; Billie Eilish's ""Bad Guy"", 3:14; and Post Malone's ""Wow"", 2:29 minutes.

Running a fine-tooth comb through the rest of the Hot 100 will trap many more two-minute-plus and barely-three-minute songs. However, I am sticking to just this five-song sample, for the sake of brevity.

The point is songs have become leaner, and this is hardly the result of a crash diet. ""Shorter songs"" isn't a recent phenomenon; over the last couple of decades, they have been shedding seconds as steadily as frogs shed their uneasy skins.

For contrast, study King-of-Pop Michael Jackson's songs from the eighties and nineties, with their average length pegged somewhere around a portly five minutes.

Back to the '50s?

By shedding their flab, today's songs may actually come across as a spitting image of those back in the 1950s. In fact, those oldies were further pared down, with two-minute-plus songs dominating most lists.

Here is a sample from 60 years ago. The top five on the Billboard Year-end Hot 100 Singles of 1959 look like they were in a tearing hurry to catch the last train out of town: Johnny Horton's jingoistic ""The Battle of New Orleans"" is done and dusted in 2:33 minutes; ""Mack The Knife"" (Bobby Darin) is the longest, at 3:25; ""Personality"" (Lloyd Price), 2:35; ""Venus"" (Frankie Avalon), just 2:20; and ""Lonely Boy"" (Paul Anka) 2:31 minutes.

Between then and now, there are two very different reasons at work for shaving off those inconvenient seconds. The 1950s was an analog world, and music was stored in gramaphone records with their highly-limited holding capacities. To pack one with enough, each song that went into it had to be pencil-thin.

Today, songs have to squeezed into a mindspace almost always constricted, being already filled with a multiplicity of entertainment choices, available at a languid swipe of the index finger.

""Musicians tend to crystallise their songs, keeping streaming platforms in mind. When you play one song, Spotify will suggest 100 other songs. So, the temptation to explore readily available options is extremely high for a listener today,"" says Omkar Potdar, singer-songwriter, Flying Shoe.

On streaming platforms such as Spotify, royalty-payments for musicians don't factor in the length of the songs. At its basic level, the payment is calculated on the number of times a song is streamed. Of course, the calculation is also partly dictated by the terms laid down by the record label.

Crisper intros

""If a song is catchy and short to boot, a listener may stream it more number of times,"" says Omkar.

He explains: ""The effort is aimed at making crisper intros. Instrumental solos are the sad casualty in this attempt to quickly capture the listener's attention and keep it. They have become sparse. When they are present, they are usually very short,"" says Omkar.

Illustrating the same point, Edison Prithiviraj, director of Unwind Center, presents a vignette of a past. It is an example that has to do with what is today revered as a rock classic not just for all-time, but eternity, suffered on account of instrumental solos that stretched the clock.

""Many radio stations would refuse to play 'Bohemian Rhapsody' because it was considered too long to sustain people's attention. If this can happen in the 1980s, when there were far fewer entertainment-related distractions, you can imagine how it is now. Pink Floyd's intros and instrumental solos are mesmerising, but in this fast-paced world when people consume music on the go, all it may take to capture a listener's attention is a catchy tune, that most importantly, should kick in early on,"" says Edison.

Faced with this predicament, musicians differentiate between the song they would present on streaming platforms and the same song they would perform for a live audience, points out Omkar.

""Invariably, musicians add instrumental riffs to the same song, while performing before a live audience. This trend is not restricted to the world of western music. Sometime ago, on YouTube, I stumbled upon a video of a live performance of the song 'Suno' by Punjabi rapper, Prabh Deep. In its middle, it offered a captivating saxaphone solo.

""Later, during a drive, I played this song on Spotify, and the saxaphone solo was not there. Obviously, Prabh Deep was including it only in live performances of the song. On a streaming platform, the target group is an unknown listener who is probably just trying out many songs in the palm of his hand. In contrast, a live audience has taken the time out for a particular performance, and so it makes sense to go the distance,"" says Omkar.

This situation is akin what prevails today in cricket. T20 may pack huge stadia, but Test cricket can't be evicted from its altar.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/1yc260/article30471965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALONEK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/why-western-songs-today-are-getting-shorter/article30471966.ece
322,2020/01/03,Meet the poets of dissent who critique the establishment and call for change,"It was on a train ride to Delhi on December 14, the day after Jamia Millia Islamia students marched to Parliament to protest the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), that Aamir Aziz wrote ‘Main Inkaar Karta Hoon (I refuse to accept)’. The Jamia alumnus, former Jamia Nagar resident and poet-lyricist-balladeer, who wrote songs of dissent such as ‘Achche Din Blues’ and ‘The Ballad of Pehlu Khan’, speaks of his new poem as a continuing expression of the experience of getting steadily marginalised and oppressed by the government. ‘Mere hi watan mein, mujhe haq ke bajaye bheekh diya jaaye, mujhe manzoor nahin (In my own country, I am given alms instead of my rights, I refuse to accept)’, he writes in the poem that he has been reciting at several protests against the CAA and NRC. And it has been resonating strongly with people. His second poem, ‘Jamia ki Ladkiyan (The girls of Jamia)’, is an eyewitness account and a tribute to the women who bravely stood up to the police to protect fellow students. “I have never seen Muslim women fight the way they have been doing,” says Aziz.

The genesis of Varun Grover’s ‘Kaagaz Nahin Dikhayenge (I will not show papers)’, the new anthem of the ongoing protests, came from a feeling of utter helplessness, he says. “Poetry is a small voice saying I am not dead yet. I wrote it just to cope with my own feeling of despair,” says the lyricist, writer, and standup comedian. The poem doffs a hat to poet Rahat Indori and the popular bhaat (rice) slogans in the Bengal protests, and also uses the cultural metaphor for life in a police state, ‘Your papers please’. He sets it to the catchy meter of the 1992 mandir wahi banayenge slogan. The subversion couldn’t have been starker, louder or clearer.

Poetry, songs and music have always been tools to counter the establishment. The on-going protests have evoked the songs of dissent in Rahat Indori’s ‘Sabhi ka khoon hai shamil yahan ki mitti mein; Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai (Everybody’s blood mingles in the soil; Hindustan does not belong solely to one)’; Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s ‘Hum Dekhenge (We shall see)’; and Dushyant Kumar’s call for lighting the revolutionary fire ‘Mere seene mein nahin to tere seene mein sahi; ho kahin bhi aag lekin aag jalni chahiye (If not in my heart, at least in yours; but the revolutionary fire should burn)’.

My manifesto

But there is suddenly a surge of new poets, largely young, on protest sites and several playlists; and their poetry threads are doing the rounds on social media and advocacy platforms.

Most of these poems and songs talk directly. Rahul Rajkhowa’s fiery rap exhorts the government to cut the ‘pragati crap’ (development bunkum); Sumit Sapra’s poem asks ‘Kya Sirf Kaagzaat Poochoge? (Will you only ask for papers?)’; Iqra Khilji writes ‘Dharti To Yeh Gulzar Hai; Pairon Tale Angaar Hai (Our land might be seemingly in bloom but there are burning embers under our feet)’.

Actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub recites Abhinav Nagar’s ‘Mere Desh Mein Bada Bawaal Hai’ in a video.

Abhinav Nagar’s ‘Mere Desh Mein Bada Bawaal Hai (My country is in the midst of a chaos)’, recited in a video by actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, asks: ‘Secular desh mein kya mere secular hone ka tumhein malaal hai (Do you have regrets about me being secular in a secular nation)?’

Bollywood lyricist and writer Puneet Sharma’s ‘Aap Sarkar Nahin Hain (You are not the government)’ is a takedown of police brutality and the state collusion in violence: ‘Aap ke paas lathi ho sakti hai, eentein ho sakti hain ghar mein, aankhon mein ho sakta hai gussa/ Lekin aap hinsa ka sahara na lein, aap sarkar nahin hain (You may have sticks, bricks stacked at home, rage reflecting in your eyes/ But don’t take to violence because you are not the government)’. Poetry is a release from anger, hatred, bitterness, says Sharma. “Poetry is my manifesto. When I get too overwhelmed with emotion, poems fire up like missiles.”

Lyricist-writer Hussain Haidry.

But a poem can acquire different shades over time. Lyricist-writer Hussain Haidry’s ‘Hindustani Musalmaan’, though written years ago, found new urgency when he recited it recently at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan. It was initially written as a reflection on his own identity as a Muslim. Later he used it to tell the world that Islam and the community cannot just be regarded as a monolith. “It became all about asserting the diversity, the many permutations within… the several dots that need to be connected,” says Haidry. Today it has acquired a whole new meaning; it is about a Muslim refusing to be othered, about reclaiming and seizing his rightful Indian identity.

Sharma believes that nothing ages in the country, not even poetry. Some poems he wrote during the Congress regime hold true even now, as much as they did then. His hello tune happens to be his favourite protest song, Gulzar’s ‘Haal Chaal Theek Thaak Hai’ from Mere Apne, still chillingly relevant in 2019 as it was in 1971. Piyush Mishra’s ‘Sheher’ from Gulaal, a powerful indictment of communalism, still speaks the truth a decade after the film’s release.

Reverberations

It is a comment on the power of words that they can appear threatening to the establishment, even long after the poet has passed on. After the students of IIT-Kanpur recited Faiz’s ‘Hum Dekhenge’ during a march in solidarity with Jamia students, the institute set up a panel to investigate if the poem is ‘anti-Hindu’.

What is it about dissent and poetry that makes them go hand in hand? Haidry thinks that the brevity and musicality of poetry helps with understanding issues. “There is a collective reverberation when people sing it together,” he says — a mix of emotional investment, passion and poignancy, depth and elevation.

“Singing reduces fear,” smiles Grover. “Music and songs are non-confrontational. They engage even with opponents and disarm them in a way an angry speech can’t.”

For Aziz, a poem may be borne out of a movement but it can also inspire movements and help the cause. “The only pre-condition is that it should communicate the reality of the times. It should not be about nostalgia and false hope. It should be contemporary,” says Aziz.

Poetry has always been a part of protest, not just against the government but even on professional and familial turfs. “It’s about a voice reaching out to apathetic powers that are not listening,” says Sharma. Apart from Sahir and Shailendra, whose protest songs have been well entrenched in popular imagination, Sharma considers a qawwali like ‘Ye Ishq Ishq Hai, Ishq Ishq (This is love)’, a clarion call against all institutions. “Love in Hindi cinema was a mode of protest [against all social hierarchies] till it became cool,” he says.

Meanwhile, as we go to press, hip hop artist Rahul Negi a.k.a Madara, has come up with ‘Tukde Tukde Gang?’ a satirical look at contemporary politics, especially the deliberate corrosion of educational institutions by the government. Clearly, resistance, and its many songs, are here to stay — and grow.

323,2020/01/03,Michèle Gurdal: In command with her form,"Belgium-born pianist Michèle Gurdal comes across as a demure, socially awkward person when you meet her at first, but you realise that’s only a veil to guard her against her apparent discomfort in communicating in English. Yet, the child prodigy who has blossomed into a composed musician with several global honours up her alley puts up a firm front in conversing with us about her eventful journey. She’s in Hyderabad to perform for Resonance 2020, a western classical music event series that’s a brainchild of the city musician Timothy Marthand.

Right from the time Michèle had barely learnt to speak (when she was three), she had begun demanding her parents to buy her a piano, a wish that was fulfilled only at six, partially. Her birthday gift was a toy piano that left the young girl completely unhappy until her persistence paid off in a few months. The parents gifted her a grand piano soon and were surprised to have their daughter make it to a television show in a few years, where she had performed Haydn’s concerto in D major as part of the Belgian Chamber Orchestra.

“I remember waking up to classical music at home. My mornings always began with conversations with mom about my impending piano. I assured my parents that I could play it very well, and they were pleasantly surprised by my drastic musical progress later. The very sound of the piano fascinated me as a child and continues to do so. It’s pleasant, it’s rich and can produce distinct music patterns. You can play a full orchestra with the instrument alone,” Michèle quips.

The supposedly shy musician is everything but apprehensive on the stage though. Her synchrony with the instrument is enviable, Michèle’s eyes are lit up with a fiery intensity when she plays the piano. That’s a place where she feels completely secure and in command of herself. It took a lot of travelling and learning the ropes under several musical experts for her to be in command of her form today.

Michèle, a product of Royal Conservatory of Brussels, owes her versatility to her academic stints across different cities (and countries) in Europe. “It’s interesting to get a lot of inspiration from different teachers. The beautiful side to my musical education is that most teachers had respected my personality and helped me find my own identity and grab something that would enhance my form on a deeper level,” she shares.

While Karl-Heinz Kammerling had helped her understand the specific styles of classical composers, Anatol Ugorski had introduced her to the nuances of Russian music, playing complex songs, whereas her musical grace comes from her learnings from Homero Francesch. Besides her performances across the globe including in countries like Germany, France, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, England, Canada and the U.S.A, Michèle knew that her career was on the right trajectory after she was awarded a fellowship at the prestigious International Piano Academy Lake Como (Italy).

Having been asked to perform for Chopin’s concerto in Hyderabad truly cheered her up for many reasons than one. “Chopin is one of my most favourite composers and I was really happy when Timothy had asked me to play his works. His works are unique because of the innate romance in them. It almost feels like the instrument is singing and you could hum along with it. I feel like a singer when I play his works. It's very expressive and can capture the fascination of a listener almost instantaneously,” she beams with joy.

Michèle incidentally shares the same name as the popular Belgian tennis player, however dismissing all claims that she was named after her. “I was told that they are distant relatives, but I have never met them (their family) to date.” Beyond music, it’s her love for yoga, sports, meeting friends that complete her life. Currently residing in Berlin, she calls the city a melting pot of influences. “There's nature, theatre, music, good food. What more could you ask for? Germany has a great taste for music, it has produced several globally renowned musicians, that's enough fodder for a classical musician like me.”

As far as her first Indian trip is concerned, she is loving the food in the country with the spices at their intense best. “I wouldn’t mind eating Indian food all my life. I hope to try the dosa soon. I have three-four days to explore Hyderabad after the concert. Though I wouldn't be able to travel much, I hope to go to the local market in the city and buy a few spices to take back home. I hope to return to Germany with pleasant memories,” Michèle gets back to her rehearsals.

324,2020/01/03,Taking tarangam forward,"Sage Narayana Theertha’s life and works stand out on several counts. Imbued with multiple shades of spiritual and devotional import couched in superlative poetic expression, his compositions in praise of Lord Krishna popular as Tarangams form a distinct genre in literature and are integral to Kuchipudi repertoire. ‘Taranga Gaanam’ is derived from Sri Krishna Leela Tarangini, a kaaya natakam written by saint-vaggeyakara Sri Siva Narayana Theertha.

If Taranga gaanam has been preserved, propogated and popularised, it largely due to efforts of a some families in and around Ongole. The Ongole-based Ghorakavi family in prominent among them. They are direct disciples of the sage Narayana Theertha. Ghorakavi Vera Raghava Rao was a vocal expert in Taranga Gaanam in bhajana sampradaya and so is his Ghorakavi Sri Krishna Sampath Kumar who performed at a concert in AMCOSA Hall in Visakhapatnam recently.

Sampath Kumar’s Taranga gaanam has always been soulful. Hailing from a family steeped in this genre of Taranga gaanam down generations, he enjoys an edge in its exposition. With this blessed background, this septuagenarian exponent sings tarangams with an almost a devotional trance, keeping the audience in self-forgetful mood. His recent taranga ganam concert was no exception..

Well-versed in Sanskrit and music in bhajana spamradaya, Sampath has fairly good grasp of all these aspects of Tarangams and renders it in his inimitable way. He opened it with Jaya Jaya Swamin in raga Nata. Interspersed with distinct jatis, his rendition was typical in its musical and lyrical appeal and the inherent devotional fervour of the compositions found lilting expression. The emotive way he provided the background of the composition at handwas enhanced by the scholarly commentary by Vakkalanka Venkata Krishna Rao. Saranambhava Karunamaya in Arabhi, Krishnam Kalaya sakhi in Mukhari, Alokaye Sri Bala Krishnam in Hasmanadam, Vedadri Sikhara in Kambhoji and others held the audience in thrall.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/lqvy0h/article30469574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYF03TARANGAM1VISAKHARASAJNAVEDIKA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/friday-review-telangana/article30469576.ece
325,2020/01/03,When opera is a way of life,"In a chic attire dressed right for the Hyderabadi winter is Canadian operatic singer Lauren Pearl Eberwein, shuffling time for an interview in between a quick lunch and her rehearsals ahead of her performance in the city. She rings in a twist to a western classical concert with her soulful singing, as it’s the first time that SOTA has added a vocal dimension to it’s annual music series Resonance.

A few days into her first Indian trip, Lauren shares, “India seems home to me already. It feels like I’ve been here before. I may have a past life here (giggles). The vibes are working just right before my concert.” She describes her singing career as a product of love, passion, faith, courage and perseverance. Growing up on the West coast in Canada and singing to the oceans, music was a way for her to become one with nature. “I was lucky enough to have teachers to encourage me and streamline my talents. I know to play the violin and piano too, though I’m not a professional at it,” Lauren adds.

Lauren finds that she expresses herself authentically through her songs and even labels herself as a chameleon the stage. “I am an actress as much as I am a singer. My job is to tell stories. I do everything to embody the character I’m portraying - from the physicality to the way I move to the way I sing. I want to be as honest and truthful as possible on the stage and that’s the way I connect with the audience,” she shares.

Her mother was the one who encouraged her to pursue her musical interests. That Lauren lost her at the young age of 11, reminded her of the purpose in life. “I had to sing, at least for her,” was what she thought for herself. Lauren considers it a blessing to be taking up music as a career, regardless of the audience she attracts. Her three-year stint with the Canadian Opera Company has helped her become what she’s today. “The opportunity to perform professionally with world-class players while still being trained, was a beautiful experience. Learning the difference between carrying your voice in a small room with a minimal audience to an opera hall that has a 2000-numbered audience and how the sound travels based on acoustics, there was so much to absorb,” Lauren reminisces a memorable stint.

Lauren also finds that technology has changed the music industry immensely and she prefers to the brighter side of the picture. “Yes, the recording industry has changed, everyone has access to history and a standard of music that one has to adhere to,” she mentions. Lauren’s tryst with technology has seen her experiment with amplification, use microphone and a looping station to vary the range of her voice too. “I am juggling the opera with modern sound so that I can connect with more people,” she says.

Travel is an unavoidable dimension of a musician’s career, but given her penchant to explore and travel, Lauren seems to have picked the right profession. To make sure she isn’t fatigued by travel, she always stays hydrated, wears a humidifier mask during her flights, sleeps well, carrying a box comprising a scent of oils that particularly comfort her senses.

She confesses that the founder of SOTA Resonance in Hyderabad, Timothy Marthand and she are kindred spirits; they resonated at many levels. “I felt a friend, there was an ease with which we communicated,” Lauren says. Her biggest motivation for any performance is to remind people why they live, and how any form of art is a balm for the soul.

Ahead of her concert, she sounds confident about her abilities and wants to absorb the soundscape of the region before she leaves. “I take this responsibility of being among the rare operatic voices that Hyderabad gets to hear. I may not have a lot of experience with Indian music but for certain knowledge about Pandit Ravi Shankar. I hope to make the most of the concert season here. Opera is about experiencing emotion at its most concentrated level in every sense of the word.”

326,2020/01/03,BMS opposes BPCL sale,"The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the trade union wing affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata Party, has now joined the bandwagon of protests against the Union government’s move to privatise BPCL.

V. Radhakrishnan, the national working committee member of BMS and a member of ESI Board, has publicly opposed the privatisation of the profit-making Maharatna company. Delivering the inaugural address at a protest programme against the privatisation policies of the Union government organised by the district committee of the BMS at the High Court Junction on Friday, he said that the privatisation of BPCL would not be allowed.

Public sector undertakings were the backbone of the country’s economy. The Centre was eyeing to mobilise ₹1.06 lakh crore through its privatisation measures. Twenty-two public section undertakings, including Air India, the affordable mode of air transport for common public, and Container Corporation have been put up for sale. Mr. Radhakrishnan said that this would entail far-reaching consequences for the country. While the BMS was not against the private sector, it opposed the privatisation of public sector undertakings, he said.

He alleged that the State government was following the same policies of the Union government. There were concerted efforts to privatise the KSRTC. Contract labour and casualisation have dealt a blow to the dream of permanent job.

Mr. Radhakrishnan called for strong protest measures against the anti-labour policies of the Central and the State governments.

327,2020/01/03,Steps for city flood mitigation,"District Collector S. Suhas has ordered completion of all works, including that of the renovation of drainage, to resolve flooding at Edappally Toll by January 31.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) officials have been asked to conduct a joint site inspection within a fortnight. The Kalamasserry Municipality has been entrusted with the supervision of works.

The decisions came at a meeting to take stock of the flood mitigation measures held here on Friday.

328,2020/01/03,Walkways to woo back visitors,"Having realised that families, youngsters and others are shunning the city’s ill-maintained walkways and are instead thronging glitzy shopping malls and eateries, agencies in charge of their upkeep have decided to make amends, albeit belatedly.

The Cochin Port Trust is giving finishing touches to a two-km-long walkway along the waterfront, from Mattancherry BOT Bridge Junction to the junction where Kannanghat Bridge takes off from Alexander Parambithara Road. “The ₹13-crore walkway, wholly funded by the Union Tourism Ministry, will be commissioned in March. It will be integrated with the walkway which was built earlier on the waterfront,” said M. Beena, Chairperson of Cochin Port Trust.

It will be a new eco-friendly concept, having plenty of space to walk and unwind. A floating restaurant and eateries serving ethnic and exotic cuisines too have been planned. Discussions are on with hospitality stakeholders and others for operating the eateries and maintaining the premises. Another option is to entrust the upkeep to a dedicated contractor, as is being done in public spaces like Durbar Hall Ground, she said.

Aimed at making optimal use of the proximity with the backwaters, the port trust has envisaged water sports in the 2-km promenade. Open-air events too can be staged on the walkway. There will also be space for recreational events and parking. The aim is to usher in responsible hospitality and site management, port sources said.

Marine Drive renovation

In the meantime, Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) has readied a ₹7-crore project to renovate the Marine Drive waterfront, from the first Goshree Bridge to Hotel Taj Gateway. This was done after the agency received much flak for shabby upkeep of the stretch.

“Uneven tiles at many places on the walkway will be levelled or replaced. Similarly, lights, seats and signboards will be installed wherever required. Tree saplings will be planted, while landscaping will be done afresh,” said V. Salim, GCDA Chairman.

The tender for the work has been awarded and the work will begin within two weeks. The rest of the walkway, including the Royal Musical Walkway, will be renovated in the second phase.

A walk through the GCDA’s newly-built walkway beside the High Court showed that the stretch is ill-kept, what with overgrowth of weeds and invasive shrubs which have devoured flowering plants. Only a dozen dating pairs, a few youngsters and three women deputed to clean the corridor were present there, as families have begun shunning the locale.

The operator of tourist boat in the area, Joseph, spoke of how Marine Drive has become a haven for drug addicts, due to inadequate lighting and overgrowth of weeds. “The GCDA must post security guards and more workers for the upkeep of the stretch, while the police must step up patrolling. CCTVs too must be installed at vantage points. Many people trip and fall, since many tiles on the walkway are undulating,” he said.

Visitors also complained of lack of pay and use toilets in the entire stretch of the old and new walkways.

The sole walkway in the city which has been maintained rather well is Queen’s Walkway on the Goshree Bridge-Chatiath Road. It was built using the then MLA Hibi Eden’s development fund.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qet4tg/article30472608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KIWALKWAY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/walkways-to-woo-back-visitors/article30472622.ece
329,2020/01/03,KMRL promises action,"Several footpaths that were widened and renovated into walkways less than two years ago by Kochi Metro Rail Limited, using funds of Cochin Smart Mission Limited, are in bad condition for want of upkeep.

A case in point is the recently-paved walkway from Ernakulam Boat Jetty to Maharaja’s Ground Metro Station, through Hospital Road. Concrete paver blocks are missing at many places, posing danger to pedestrians. Subsequently, pedestrians, including visually challenged people for whom tactile tiles were laid, prefer to walk through congested roads. Even worse, flowering and other plants on the walkway have begun to wilt or are missing.

“Encroachment by vendors is yet another headache. The Corporation and police must prevent this,” said a CSML official.

KMRL Managing Director Alkesh Kumar Sharma, who is also CEO of CSML, said that such issues will be looked into and amends made during the working season which has begun post the rains. “We will ensure that all walkways are maintained well, by entering into contract with people who will have to ensure their upkeep for at least three years. On their part, members of the public must not damage or litter these public spaces. Adequate number of waste bins will be installed,” he added.

The 800-m-long walkway built by KMRL on the southern end of Panampilly Nagar too is unkempt and due to that footfall has come down. A project worth₹7 lakh has been readied to undo the damage and to have an image makeover, said a KMRL source.

334,2020/01/03,"After festivities, Fort Kochi sports clean look","Over 4,000 volunteers representing various organisations landed in Fort Kochi on Thursday morning and cleared the area of plastic waste. And within hours, the heritage town wore a clean look.

After New Year festivities and the Cochin Carnival on Wednesday, Kochi’s premier tourist destination got a fresh look, with organisations like the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA) steering the clean-up campaign in line with the Government’s ban on single-use plastic.

Officials of the Navy, Coast Guard, Suchitwa Mission, and the Kochi Corporation as well as National Service Scheme volunteers and members of residents associations and NGOs had come together for a massive campaign named Green Cochin Mission, with Fort Kochi being their first project.

Work on the campaign had started much in advance of the actual drive on Thursday, said District Judge and KELSA Secretary K.T. Nizar Ahmed. Around 97% of plastic waste is reusable, said Mr. Ahmed. The company entrusted with recycling will segregate different grades of plastics and recycle them accordingly. And, the movement for plastic-free Kochi will be sustained, he added.

The drive received the support of people from all walks of life owing to the massive awareness campaign organised from the second week of December, according to Shaleena V.G. Nair, Sub Judge and Secretary, District Legal Services Authority (DLSA).

Since December 26, the volunteers had been on the job, she added. At least 15 water booths were provided in the Fort Kochi area to keep plastic water bottles away.

NSS volunteers and corporation representatives actively participated in the drive on Thursday, said Josey P.J., treasurer, Cochin Carnival - 2020. Around 50 loads of plastic were collected from the area. They will be recycled by a Kozhikode-based company named Green Worm.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/nmblao/article30467274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-KI-CLEANINGpng,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/after-festivities-fort-kochi-sports-clean-look/article30467276.ece

336,2020/01/03,Civil Line Road turns a nightmare for motorists,"Commuters from the city to the collectorate, Inforpark, and other places in Kakkanad and beyond are in a fix, thanks to the pothole-ridden arterial Civil Line Road, while the alternative stretch through Vennala and Palachuvadu has not been restored after being dug up to lay power cables.

Both stretches are maintained by the PWD (Roads Wing). The two roads cater for a few lakh motorists who reside or work in Kakkanad and towns located further eastward.

The department has not even done patchwork over the gaping potholes dotting the busy Civil Line Road, despite the expiry of the December 31 deadline set by the State Government. The road was not resurfaced although P.T. Thomas, MLA, had allocated ₹2.25 crore from his constituency fund.

“Back in October 2018, the PWD had assured that it would resurface the road using bituminous macadam bituminous concrete (BMBC) after Ebin Paul, a young two-wheeler rider died in an accident caused by a pothole. The department has not bothered to do even patchwork, leave alone resurfacing the stretch,” said Asees Moolayil, president of the Kakkanad unit of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti.

Little happened although two engineers were suspended for their alleged inaction in the case in 2018. The recent suspension of four engineers of the PWD (Roads Wing) after another two-wheeler rider was run over by a tanker lorry in a pothole-related accident near the Palarivattom metro station a fortnight ago, has not been a deterrent either.

Encroachments

“The PWD continues to be apathetic despite fatal and non-fatal accidents caused by potholes and agitations by traders and others seeking speedy repair of the road. Business has been dull for the past couple of years. The proliferation of potholes and erection of steel medians at Vazhakkala and other places have further affected our income. Pedestrians too are finding the going tough. Even worse, the PWD has failed to remove vendors and other encroachers from Civil Line Road, a stretch used almost daily by the District Collector and officials of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) who are at the helm of the District Road Safety Council,” Mr. Moolayil said.

Collector’s response

Responding to the issue, District Collector S. Suhas said he would enquire with PWD officials about the reason for the inordinate delay in repairing the road.

“I have been regularly interacting with the officials concerned to ensure that repair and resurfacing are completed as per schedule. Civic agencies too must play their part in prevailing over the PWD and be the lead agency in road repair work,” he said.

Funds allotted

A senior PWD engineer said funds totalling ₹4.50 crore had been allotted to repair 3.75 km of Civil Line Road.

“It is awaiting technical sanction. The contractor will be finalised in a month, and resurfacing work can begin soon after. Encroachers will be evicted before the work begins,” he said.

The official said that the resurfacing work on the Vennala-Palachuvadu-Seaport-Airport Road, which was extensively dug up by the KSEB last year for laying power cables, would begin within a week.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6ezj77/article30465181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-KI-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/civil-line-road-turns-a-nightmare-for-motorists/article30465182.ece
337,2020/01/03,Twenty20 set to choose presidential candidate,"Twenty20, the corporate-backed charity outfit governing Kizhakkambalam panchayat, is set to select its next presidential candidate this Sunday following the resignation of the incumbent president.

K.V. Jacob had stepped down on Wednesday levelling serious allegations about the autocratic ways of Sabu M. Jacob, chief coordinator of Twenty20, who is now away in the United States. The no-confidence motion moved against Mr. Jacob by the 14 members of Twenty20 was set to be taken up for discussion on Friday.

Mr. Sabu Jacob is expected to be back on Saturday, and a meeting has been scheduled to select the presidential candidate the next day.

“The meeting will be attended by all members of the 12-member board, all 14 of our panchayat members, and 133 ward committee members from all the 19 wards. The discussions are likely to throw up a candidate,” said Mr. Sabu Jacob.

It will be followed by a public meeting and rally, which is likely to be a show of strength by Twenty20, on January 12. The rally was originally planned for Friday coinciding with the no-confidence motion but has since been postponed as Mr. Jacob chose to put in his papers without facing the motion.

“There are attempts to write off Twenty20 as a failed experiment and write its obituary. The rally will show the popular support we enjoy,” said Mr. Sabu Jacob.

Mr. Jacob said though political parties had approached him, he would continue to function as an independent member, going ahead with his fight against the alleged injustice and autocratic ways of Mr. Sabu Jacob.

K.C. Jayan, panchayat secretary, said the Election Commission had already been alerted about the president’s post falling vacant. He added that the election to select the next president was likely to be held in a couple of weeks.

Food security market

Meanwhile, the food security market in the panchayat, known for supplying essential commodities to local residents at prices much lower than the market rate, will resume operations on January 6. The outgoing president and opponents of Twenty20 had all along alleged that the market was closed down in June by Mr. Sabu Jacob after people voted against his directions in the last Lok Sabha elections.

However, Mr. Sabu Jacob said it had to be closed down for maintenance as it was set up in haste without basic facilities in the first place owing to legal issues. “There wasn’t even a proper foundation for the building and permanent power connection. All those shortcoming have now been addressed,” he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/twenty20-set-to-choose-presidential-candidate/article30465152.ece
338,2020/01/03,Tankers continue to draw water from wells,"Water tankers supplying drinking water in Ernakulam continued to draw water from wells despite a directive from the district administration that water should be drawn only from the hydrants and supply points of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).

This came to light after KWA officials reported that only two tankers (that were earlier drawing water from private wells) had collected water from the major supply points of the authority at Aluva and Maradu on Thursday.

The filling stations at Aluva and Maradu have the capacity to provide up to 2.5 million litres of water daily. Around 250 water tankers supply water in Ernakulam as per records available with the Regional Transport Office at Kakkanad. According to the Ernakulam District Drinking Water Transporters Welfare Association, nearly 400 private tankers supply water across the district.

Water tanker operators informed users in the morning that they would ensure regular supply, saying that the district administration had extended the deadline for collecting water from KWA sources till January 10. An apartment owner at Thripunithura said residents had received the usual supply of five loads drawn from a private well near Ambalamugal on Thursday. “The tanker operator told us that the district administration had given an extension of 15 days for collecting water from private wells,” he said.

However, Deputy Collector S. Shajahan clarified that the administration had not extended the deadline. “We had only agreed to extend the time for registering water tankers with the Regional Transport Office till January 10 following a request from tanker operators at a meeting on Wednesday,” he said.

Asked whether action would be taken against operators who collected water from private wells, Mr. Shajahan said it could not be done in haste as such a move might hamper the distribution process. Tanker operators had suggested that they be allowed to draw water from the facilities at Travancore Cochin Chemicals at Eloor and Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd at Ambalamugal. “We will issue letters to the companies requesting their cooperation,” he said.

On complaints from operators that the filling points of the KWA at Aluva and Maradu lacked parking space, officials said up to 20 tankers could be parked at a time at Aluva (four filling points). It may take 10 to 15 minutes to fill up a tanker having a capacity of 10,000 litres. The supply point at Maradu also has adequate parking space, they added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/vcymyo/article30465146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KI-water-tankcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tankers-continue-to-draw-water-from-wells/article30465148.ece
339,2020/01/03,High Court upholds decision to set up gas crematorium,"A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has upheld permission granted by the District Collector for setting up a gas crematorium proposed by Poothrikka panchayat.

The Bench passed the verdict while dismissing an appeal filed by Vadayampady Pourasamiti and John Joseph, a ward member, against a single judge’s order allowing construction of the crematorium. According to the petitioner, there was no need for a crematorium in Poothrikka panchayat as there was a crematorium at the nearby Brahmapuram.

The panchayat had submitted that the proposal had been included in its 2018-19 annual project. A rough estimate of the construction came to ₹87 lakh. Since the panchayat did not have sufficient funds, it sought the assistance of Kochi Refineries Ltd (KRL), which later approved the request for ₹50 lakh. The Bench observed that the crematorium project was proposed at the instance of the panchayat. Opposition from a member could not challenge the collective decision of the panchayat, it said.

The court further pointed out that a private party could not insist that the panchayat should not set up its own crematorium. When a conscious decision is taken by the panchayat to set up a crematorium in its own land, for which it had obtained funds from the appropriate authorities, it was not open for the court to sit in judgment over the decision on the premise that there was a crematorium nearby, it held.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/high-court-upholds-decision-to-set-up-gas-crematorium/article30465111.ece
340,2020/01/03,Lampshades add colour to Sargaalaya fete,"The annual Sargaalaya International Arts and Crafts Festival is the ultimate destination for all kinds of crafts in south India. Besides the usual clothing and jewellery stalls, and those of State and national award winners, stalls selling a variety of lampshades cannot be missed at the ninth edition of the festival, that is under way at the Sargaalaya Arts and Crafts Village at Iringal here.

At night, the festival comes alive with many coloured lights seeping in through the beautiful textures of lampshades. Charma chitra lampshades from Andhra Pradesh and glass lamps from Rajasthan are hot favourites at the festival.

Mahesh and Ashwini from Ananthpur in Andhra Pradesh have been regulars at Sargaalaya for at least four editions of the festival. Charma chitra is literally paintings on skin or, rather, leather in this case. Kalamkari-style paintings on white leather is the speciality of the stall. The paintings sometimes take the shape of wall hangings, but the lampshades are more popular, says Mahesh. The lampshades are priced between ₹500 and ₹2,500.

Ramlal and Kishan from Rajasthan too have been regulars at Sargaalaya. Their stall is adorned with spherical lampshades made of glass, on which coloured glass pieces are stuck together.

Kathir and Velu from Puducherry is here for the first time with their thread and crocheted lampshades, which are lightweight and cost-effective. While the thread lampshades are made using just thread and glue, the washable crochet shades are made completely from thread. The price range is between ₹250 and ₹800.

Bidula from Elathur adds to the local flavour in the genre and her terracotta lampshades have been part of the festival for six seasons. With a price range between ₹50 to ₹950, her products are popular too. There are also bamboo lampshades that adorn at least five stalls from the Northeast that sell various bamboo products.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/4049sy/article30473587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KILAMPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/lampshades-add-colour-to-sargaalaya-fete/article30473588.ece
341,2020/01/03,Much-awaited cyberdome opens in Kozhikode today,"Giving a boost to the stringent enforcement of cyberlaws, the City police will open its much awaited cyberdome facility for the north Kerala region at the Cyberpark in Kozhikode on Saturday. Through video conferencing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will commission the new project, which will enlist the support of nearly 100 information technology experts.

A 500-sq. ft office space at the Sahya building of the IT park has been allotted for the project. It will have three full-time police officers, including the charge officer, for effective functioning and coordination with other investigation teams. All essential computer systems and IT tools to support the team of technical experts, ethical hackers and cyber professionals have been arranged at the spot.

Face recognition system to identify criminals is one of the significant features of the new cyberdome, which will extend its service to all north Kerala districts. It will work on the basis of an already prepared database with details of wanted persons. Drone cameras will be used to collect visuals from all suspected areas for real-time analysis and action.

“On New Year’s eve, we conducted the first successful trial of the face recognition system in the city using the available database of some of our policemen on duty. The result was accurate and it can be operated the same way in the days to come with a separate database,” said C. Sivaprasad, the nodal officer in-charge of the cyberdome project. He said the facilities and the basic infrastructure for the project were arranged at a cost of about ₹80 lakh.

Cyber police station

To support the cyberdome, north Kerala’s first cyber police station too will start functioning in Kozhikode on Saturday. The new station, which was set up at a cost of ₹30 lakh, will deal with serious cyber crimes reported from Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod districts. It will have the strength of 19 personnel, including a Station House Officer, an additional sub inspector, four senior civil police officers, and 11 civil police officers.

Mr. Sivaprasad, who is also the station house officer of the cyber station, said all the team members were trained by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, a premier research and development organisation under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

Hi-tech control room

The control room of the city police too has gone hi-tech, with superior surveillance camera network and GPS tracking systems. The movement of control room vehicles in the city limits can be monitored real-time using new systems.

342,2020/01/03,Sale of poor quality helmets under MVD scanner,"Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) squads on Friday conducted flash inspections in the city to crack down on the sale of poor quality helmets by wayside traders. The squads mostly covered National Highway stretches near Thondayad junction and Kozhikode Medical College following a tip-off that cheap quality helmets sold by wayside traders were in huge demand to hoodwink enforcement squads in the wake of tightened regulations.

The low quality of the headgear was exposed in the presence of the traders through a simple crash test by motor vehicle inspectors. During checks, it was found that the materials used in the helmet were substandard, with little capacity to absorb the impact of a collision. The inspectors could easily tear off the chin-bar of some of the tested headgear and break the top portion without much effort.

“We have not seized any helmets or destroyed the stock as the law does not permit us to do so. Our purpose was to discourage such unhealthy trade in the first phase and warn traders. Possible action will be taken in case of any further attempt to sell such items,” said Regional Transport Officer Subhash Babu who ordered the inspection. He said similar flash inspections would be conducted in other shops in the city to check safety standards.

Mr. Babu said poor quality helmets were sold mostly by wayside traders who exploit buyers’ ignorance about safety standards. “The products were put on sale for just ₹250. The traders were also willing to reduce the rate if the buyers were good with their bargaining skills,” he said.

The MVD has also decided to embark on a series of awareness campaigns with focus on safe use of helmets and ways to select quality products with the required safety certification. It will be launched as part of the road safety awareness week campaign slated to commence in the district on January 11.

Legal action

Legal action against those engaged in the trade of low quality headgear is yet to gain momentum within the city limits with the police not undertaking many checking drives. An MVD officer said enforcement units were not legally authorised to book illegal traders or seize low quality products from their custody. However, it could be done by the police enforcement squads under the applicable sections of the Kerala Police Act or the Indian Penal Code, he said.

During recent inspections by MVD squads, it was found that wayside traders collected their low quality stock from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Duplicate ISI certification stickers were also found affixed on some low quality helmets. Though stickers are never considered a symbol of standard certification, it helps illegal traders in the sector cash in on the ignorance of buyers.

343,2020/01/03,Anti-CAA rally in Kozhikode today,"United Democratic Front (UDF) and Left Democratic Front (LDF) supporters will join a rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act here on Friday organised under the aegis of a civic forum in the city.

Representatives of all political parties, except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), cultural and religious organisations, residents’ associations and students will take part in the rally from the Kozhikode beach to Muthalakulam Maidan at 5 p.m.

It is learnt that the Congress and its ally, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) have been instrumental in organising the rally against the backdrop of concerns about the proposed National Register of Citizens.

The organisers said that the Popular Front of India and Social Democratic Party of India had been kept out of the rally.

The participation of such organisations in a secular platform, many fear, would defeat the purpose of the programme aimed at conserving the secular and democratic credentials of the country.

At the same time, feeder and political outfits of the Jamaat-e-Islami have been roped in for the event.

Functionaries of the Welfare Party of India are also members of the organising committee. “The organisers have included that party as Left parties share power with it in some local bodies though they are not included in the LDF,” T. Siddique, District Congress Committee president, said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/anti-caa-rally-in-kozhikode-today/article30467494.ece

345,2020/01/03,"Women to go on fast in support of Allan, Thaha","A week after various socio-political and cultural activists staged a protest event here criticising the Left Democratic Front government for the arrest of CPI(M) workers Allan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal under the Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act (UAPA), a group of women are planning to undertake a fast on Friday in support of the youths.

The event is being held under the aegis of the “Allan, Thaha Solidarity Committee”. The organisers said that the “group of mothers” would fast from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. near the Central Library on Friday. They said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, purportedly conceived ahead of converting India into a “Hindu Rashtra”, had led to widespread protests across the country. This was preceded by the repealing of Article 370 of the Constitution that ensured special rights for Jammu and Kashmir and amendments to the UAPA and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act.

The LDF government in Kerala, which had opposed these measures, had framed the two youths under the UAPA and handed over the case to the NIA, they alleged. Allan and Thwaha should not be “made scapegoats in the fight between political parties with various ideological interests”, they said.

FB post goes viral

Earlier, a Facebook post by Allan’s mother Sabitha Sekhar, slamming “dictators with egos” went viral on the social media. Written as a letter to mark New Year wishes to her son, Ms. Sekhar said that the lives of all dictators in history had ended miserably. “We need to wait patiently. Our time too will come,” she said. Ms. Sekhar tells her son that the establishment can only imprison his body, but not his thoughts. “The books that you read will sharpen your thoughts and you can live your life with more clarity,” Ms. Sekhar says.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/women-to-go-on-fast-in-support-of-allan-thaha/article30465215.ece

347,2020/01/03,Aswath sings in praise of Goddess Meenakshi,"The 68th anniversary celebrations of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam started off at the Lakshmi Sundaram Hall here on Thursday with a Carnatic music concert by R. Aswath Narayanan, who sang to the accompaniment of M.A. Krishnasamy on the violin, Palladam Ravi on the mrudangam, and Vazhapallli Krishnakumar on the ghatam.

Aswath, after invoking the blessings of Lord Ganesa, started his concert with a Lalgudi Jayaraman’s ‘Innam en manam ariydavar pola’ in Raga Charukesi. It was followed by ‘Shobhillu saptasvara’ by Thyagaraja in Raga Jaganmohini, in which he praises the divine forms of the seven musical notes, which glow in the navel, heart, neck, tongue and nose of the human body.

In quick succession, he sang the viruttam from Kandhar Alangaram by Arunagirinathar, ‘Vizhikkuthunai,’ before the song by Papanasam Shivan in Raga Varaali, ‘Kaa vaa vaa Kanda vaa vaa’ on Palanimalai Murugan.

Shyama Shastri’s ‘Marivere gati’ in Anandabhairavi was his next selection in which the composer pleads with the presiding deity of Madurai, Goddess Meenakshi, to protect him as there is nobody else to do it.

Niroshta, a rare raga, which, in Carnatic music classification, is called audava (meaning ‘of 5’), does not contain madhyamam and panchamam (literal meaning - without the lips), for the song ‘Raja raja radhite’ by Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar, was well received by the rasikas.

The main raga of the evening for Aswath was Purvi Kalyani/Gamakakriya, for the song ‘Meenakshi me mudam dehi’ by Muthuswami Dikshitar. The intricate Purvikalyani alapana that followed was again unhurried. He handled this delicate Vakra Shadava-Sampurna raga with precision. On the violin, Krishnasamy offered an equally charming and benign exposition. The thani by Palladam Ravi and Vazhapalli Krishnamumar was unique and was applauded by the audience.

The final songs, which included ‘Enna solli azhaithal’ by Ambujam Krishna in Kanada and Chandrashekhara in Raga Sindhubhairavi by Anai Vaidyanatha Iyer provided an apt conclusion to the first day’s concert.

348,2020/01/03,Two candidates declared Panchayat president-elect in Sivaganga district,"A brief commotion was reported early on Friday morning at the counting centre for Sakkottai Panchayat Union in Sivaganga district, as two candidates who had contested for the post of Sankarapuram village panchayat president were awarded certificates

Two women candidates, Devi Mankudi and Priyadarshini Iyyappan, contested for the post reserved for woman (general), under autorickshaw and lock-and-key symbols respectively.

Late on Thursday evening, Devi was declared the winner by scoring 67 votes more than the other candidate and was awarded the certificate of village panchayat president elect. However, as the opposite party demanded a recount, the counting was done again around 2 a.m. on Friday and subsequently Priyadarshini was declared the winner leading by 63 votes. She was also awarded a certificate.

“The recount was done because of the intervention of a ruling party functionary. We suspect there is some discrepancy and bungling in the recount,” said Devi. She noted that Priyadarshini’s husband was a functionary in the AIADMK.

A source in the counting centre said that the recount was carried out in the presence of the observer and district collector since the initial count did not tally with the number of votes.

Sivaganga district collector, J. Jayakanthan denied any political interference or pressure. “Certificate was awarded to Devi even before the counting was completed and by the end of the counting, over 1500 votes could not be tallied with the count. Hence, a recount was suggested and it was carried out in a fair manner in the presence of the observer. Around 5 a.m. after the final round of counting, candidate Priyadarshini was declared winner,” he said.

However, Ms. Devi said that she will be filing a case in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, seeking justice, based on the certificate given to her.

Plea to annex with Karaikudi Municipality

Sankarapuram panchayat is one of the largest village panchayats in Sivaganga district, with a population of 40,000 and 15 wards. There has been a long time plea by the people of the panchayat to be annexed with the Karaikudi Municipality.

“The village has grown as a suburban area for Karaikudi town but none of the parties have paid heed to the people’s demand.

In the aftermath of the incident, 29-year-old Neetu Chopra, an entrepreneur from Rajasthan, has embarked on an ambitious mission.

Covering over 4,000 km in 18 days, Ms. Chopra is riding her two-wheeler from Ramban in Jammu and Kashmir to Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu to encourage women to come out of their comfort zones and start using more public spaces.

After covering 16 cities, Ms. Chopra reached Madurai on Thursday. “In this male-dominated society, women are often told not to venture out after dark. Through my nation-wide campaign, I want to motivate women to use public spaces even at odd hours and make authorities to ensure that they are safe for women,” she said.

With the theme ‘Ride for Revolution,’ Ms. Chopra, during her travels, tells stories and teaches self-defence techniques to women. “Only when women are fearless, they will be empowered. In the future, I want to start my academy to train young girls in self-defence,” she said.

Recalling an incident during her college days, she said that a male friend tried to harass her, but she fought alone and escaped from the perpetrator. “Hence, self-defence is important and women should never give up and face the situation bravely,” she said.

Her son A. Mohanasundaram said, “Our family of farmers is popular in our village for so many years and everybody knows her. “Still, despite her old age, she visited each house and canvassed for votes. It is easy to identify my mother among the lot as she is the village paati,” he said.

Ms. Veerammal told The Hindu that she contested in the local body election with the whole aim of taking charge. “I was happy to be one of the contestants and I’ll work for the betterment of Arittapatti. The village has given me so much over the past several years. It is time to give back to the village in the form of basic necessities such as drinking water, roads, proper bathrooms and drainage facilities,” she said.

Mr. Mohanasundaram said she campaigned extensively and was very confident of a victory. “We did not even paste posters in the village. Since we had a huge following of youngsters who rallied around my mother, they happily campaigned for the ‘brinjal’ symbol allocated to us and helped us win,” he said.

After winning, she visited all households and thanked the voters. “She is tired now.

351,2020/01/03,"Ahead of Paryaya festival, Udupi roads get a facelift","With the Paryaya festival fast approaching, the major roads in the city are getting asphalted, while the patch work has been taken up on the other roads in the city.

The Paryaya festival will be held on January 18, while the ‘Pura Pravesha’ or the customary entry of the next Paryaya seer to Udupi city will be on January 8.

The Udupi city municipal council has got ₹4 crore for asphalting and repair of the roads and is expecting to get another ₹3 crore for the purpose.

The patchwork for minor roads in the city has been taken up at a cost of ₹1.75 crore.

It is usual for the bituminisation of roads to be done once in two years in the city close to the Paryaya festival. Not only is the Paryaya festival an important festival in the district, it also attracts devotees and tourists from other places across the State and parts of the country.

Besides the roads, even the road dividers are getting a fresh coat of paint in the city. Both the Paryaya festival and the ‘Pura Pravesha’ event are accompanied by big processions. Hence, the authorities are concentrating on improving the condition of the road on which both these processions move.

Anand Kallolikar, Commissioner of Udupi city municipal council, told The Hindu that the remaining ₹3 crore from the State government is expected in a week. “The asphalting of main roads will be completed within a week, while those on the outskirts would be completed before the Paryaya festival,” he said.

“Besides the roads, we will start the cleaning of the city from January 6. Facilities for toilets and drinking water arrangements will be done at different places in the city as was being done in earlier for the Paryaya festival,” Mr. Kallolikar said.

Inaugurating the 80th All-India Inter-University Athletics Championship at Swaraj Maidan in Moodbidri, Mr. Rijiju said no sportsperson who has represented the country should be in distress. Mr. Rijiju said the Ministry of Sports was trying to ensure that all such sportspersons are looked after through their lifetime. The Ministry is providing medical and other assistance to help them live with dignity. “Under no circumstance should their head bow down. They deserve the utmost respect,” the Minister said.

Stressing the need to change people’s outlook towards sports, Mr. Rijiju said developing a sporting culture was important. Everybody, including elected representatives, should get involved in one sport or another, he said. “The new India should be a fit India and there will be no place for unfit persons. The Sports Ministry has started issuing ‘Fit School’ certificates to schools that promote sports,” he said.

He also said that India was looking beyond the Tokyo Olympics, which is eight months away. Certain policies are being put in place to ensure that India emerges a sporting superpower by identifying and nurturing true sporting talent for the Paris and Los Angeles Olympics, he said.

As many as 7,500 athletes from 350 universities from across the country are participating in the competition, jointly hosted by the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), Alva’s Education Foundation, and the Association of Indian Universities. The championship will end on January 6.

Ramanath Rai here on Thursday.

Speaking at a protest organised by the Congress and other organisations under the aegis of Dakshina Kannada Zilla Jatyateeta Paksha Sanghatanegala Janti Vedike here, Mr. Rai said that Mahatma Gandhi took the lead in the non-violent freedom struggle.

In the fight against CAA and NRC, the people will take the lead and fight to retain the secular nature of India.

While the State government blamed the Opposition for the violent protest on December 19 that led to police firing in the city, Mr. Rai said the government should take the blame for aggravating the situation by imposing prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Mangaluru and other parts of the State that angered the protesters.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai should take the blame for the damage caused because of police firing in the city on December 19.

Muneer Katipalla, State president, Democratic Youth Federation of India, said a judicial inquiry alone will bring out the truth behind the violent protest and police action. Mr. Katipalla said it was necessary for the State government to pay compensation to the family members of the two deceased and those injured in the police firing. The real perpetrators of the violent protest should be arrested and not the innocent ones, he said.

The State government announced a compensation of ₹10 lakh each for the kin of the victims only to rescind on its decision. The samiti wanted the government to pay the compensation to the kin.

A judicial probe should be ordered into the incident, he said.

Amrit Shenoy, vice-president of the State unit of Karnataka Rashtra Samiti, said that the police firing at the protesters in Mangaluru was unnecessary.

If the committee comes up with some alternative venue for the protest, the Commissionerate would consider the same to give permission, said a release from the City Police here. As the committee decided to postpone the protest following denial of permission, the City Police thanked it and sought cooperation from all the concerned to maintain law and order. The City Police listed out three important reasons not to grant permission for the protest at Nehru Maidan after getting feedback from its law and order and traffic wings.

Police said the roads surrounding the Nehru Maidan, especially Clock Tower To AB Shetty Circle, are witnessing massive civil works of the Smart City Project with only one-way available for traffic.

As the other lane was deeply dug, the public would be at danger if heavy gathering was mobilised.

Further, the area has many hospitals in the vicinity. Choking of traffic in the locality was likely to prevent movement of essential services vehicles and ambulances, the police said.

The venue is in close proximity to the Chief Office of Fire and Emergency Services on Old Kent Road, the police said. Any disruption in vehicular movement and choking of roads would disrupt movement of Fire and Emergency Services vehicles to other parts of the city, they said.

Police said the facts were conveyed to the president of the committee with a request to suggest alternative places to hold the protest before granting the permission.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/central-parts-cant-be-allowed-to-be-choked-police/article30464289.ece

The discussion paper titled “Private Participation: Passenger Trains” has identified 100 routes, including Mumbai Central-New Delhi, New Delhi- Patna, Allahabad-Pune and Dadar-Vadodara.

Other prominent routes include Howrah-Chennai, Howrah Patna, Indore-Okhla, Lucknow-Jammu Tawi, Chennai-Okhla, Anand Vihar-Bhagalpur, Secunderabad-Guwahati and Howrah-Anand Vihar.

The paper, prepared for discussions with stakeholders, has split the 100 routes into 10-12 clusters. As per the paper, the private operator will have the right to collect market-linked fares and will be provided flexibility of class composition and halts.

The privatisation of train operation, the paper said, will help in introducing modern technology and rolling stocks with reduced maintenance. Besides, it would provide world-class service experience to passengers and also help in reducing the supply demand deficit.

The operators could be domestic or international entities, the paper said. Each bidder would eligible for award of maximum three clusters, it added.

359,2020/01/03,Ratan Tata moves SC against NCLAT verdict to restore Mistry,"Chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Private Limited Ratan N. Tata moved the Supreme Court on Friday against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) judgment restoring Cyrus Mistry as its chairman, saying the verdict has virtually pulled down the governance and corporate structure painstakingly built by the founders of the Indian multinational conglomerate.

Tata Sons has already moved the apex court against NCLAT decision of December 18.

Mr. Tata said the NCLAT judgment banked on specious arguments to find him “guilty” of acting in an “oppressive and prejudicial” manner against the interests of shareholders. Mr. Tata said he had spent more than half of his life in building the name of Tata Sons and other Tata operating companies to one of the top global companies.

He said the judgment claimed “over 550 emails” were exchanged between Mr. Mistry and him to demonstrate the scale of interference from the latter's side. Mr. Tata said there were “no such 550 mails in the first place”.

It was rather “remarkable and strange” that an exchange of ideas, views, etc, between him and Mr. Mistry could be treated as conclusive evidence of unsolicited interference, Mr. Tata said.

“What is even more remarkable is that the whole case of oppression and prejudice is based entirely on words and statements contained in correspondence without there being an iota of evidence to buttress any actual loss/injury being caused to Tata Sons as a result of Mr. Cyrus Mistry being forced to act on such interference/interdiction against his wishes,” Mr. Tata contended.

He said the NCLAT, through its contrived and self-serving reading of the correspondence, concluded that he was “determined” to remove Mr. Mistry. The tribunal accused him of engineering the coup to oust Mr. Mistry. The petition said the judgment, with no evidence to back it, castigated him and N.A. Soonwala (former trustee of Tata Trusts) and Mr. Nitin Nohria, a Trusts Nominated Director, for “unfair abuse of powers”.

In fact, the appeal said, the “various fronts where Mr. Cyrus Mistry’s leadership was lacking was his reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the Chairman of Tata Sons and address any conflict in this regard, which was a condition precedent to his appointment as Chairman of Tata Sons”.

DoCoMo dispute

Mr. Tata said Mr. Mistry's handling of the DoCoMo dispute was a “glaring example” of the lack of leadership skills. It was during Mr. Mistry's tenure that Tata Sons reneged on its word with DoCoMo. He showed “complete obstinacy” to comply with legal obligations even in the face of an adverse verdict by arbitration.

“This is not what the Tata Sons brand stands for. Quite to the contrary, honouring its commitments is one of Tata Sons’ highest virtues it takes great pride in. The spat with DoCoMo, which was widely covered by the press, brought ill-repute and reputational losses to Tata Sons,” the appeal said. It said Mr. Mistry failed to capitalise when business opportunities came up.

“Slowly and systematically, he had also concentrated power and authority in his own hands as Chairman in all major Tata Operating Companies,” the appeal alleged. It said the NCLAT verdict would lead to chaos in the functioning of Tata Sons, undermine shareholder sovereignty and lead to a breakdown of its governance structure.

Besides severely affecting the rights of the Tata Trusts, its nominated directors, Mr. Tata's rights as a shareholder and rewriting the articles of Tata Sons against its interests, the judgment undermined the rights of all other shareholders and virtually extinguishes the doctrine of shareholder sovereignty and corporate majority, it said.

The judgment had granted vast and unsought-for reliefs to the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group (Mr. Mistry is a scion of the group), which were not even sought, that were not only contrary to company law and the Articles Of Association of Tata Sons but would paralyse the management and functioning of Tata Sons, the appeal said. The appeal said the SP Group was not in partnership with Tata Sons. The former was only a financial investor in Tata Sons. The NCLAT wrongly believed that Tata Sons was a “two-group” company.

Mr. Tata has been associated with the Tata Group for well over 55 years. He stepped down as the Chairman of Tata Sons after handing over the reins to Mr. Mistry in December 2012. Mr. Tata holds an aggregate of about 65.89% of the equity shareholding of Tata Sons.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pduqjf/article29693636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBURATAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ratan-tata-moves-sc-against-nclat-order-reinstating-mistry-as-tata-sons-chairman/article30469302.ece

367,2020/01/03,When defection is a mere detour for an MLA,"They defected, re-contested, and became members again, all in six months. Some are even likely to become Ministers soon.

The Karnataka byelection results have widely put to display the ineffectiveness of the Anti-Defection Law. Of the 17 defecting Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs, 11 were re-elected on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket. Not only did this set of events lay down a well-structured framework to sidestep the law, it even set a dangerous precedent for neutralising the consequences of the law altogether.

The phenomenon of defections is not new to Indian politics. It has been plaguing the political landscape for over five decades. The most prominent case was that of Haryana’s Gaya Lal, originally an independent MLA who, in 1967, juggled between the Congress and Janata Party for two weeks, during which he switched his loyalty thrice. The recurrence of this evil phenomenon led to the 1985 Anti-Defection Law, which defined three grounds of disqualification of MLAs — giving up party membership; going against party whip; and abstaining from voting.

Resignation not a condition

Resignation as MLA was not one of the conditions. Exploiting this loophole, the 17 rebel MLAs in Karnataka resigned, their act aimed at ending the majority of the ruling coalition and, at the same time, avoiding disqualification. However, the Speaker refused to accept the resignations and declared them disqualified. This was possible as the legislation empowers the presiding officer of the House (i.e. the Speaker) to decide on complaints of defection under no time constraint.

The law originally protected the Speaker’s decision from judicial review. However, this safeguard was struck down in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu and Others (1992). While the SC upheld the Speaker’s discretionary power, it underscored that the Speaker functioned as a tribunal under the anti-defection law, thereby making her/his decisions subject to judicial review. This judgment enabled judiciary to become the watchdog of the anti-defection law, instead of the Speaker, who increasingly had become a political character contrary to the expected neutral constitutional role. The same could be witnessed in Shrimanth Balasaheb Patel & Ors vs Speaker Karnataka Legislative Assembly & Ors (2019), where the three-judge SC bench upheld the then Karnataka Speaker’s decision of disqualification of the 17 rebel MLAs. However, it struck down his ban on the MLAs from contesting elections till 2023, negating the only possible permanent solution to the problem. The Supreme Court played the role of a neutral umpire in this political slugfest. But, the spectacle of MLAs hoarded in a bus, and being sent to a resort, openly exposed not just the absence of ideological ties between a leader and his party, but also her/his weak moral character. It was also upsetting to see public acceptance of such malpractices as part of politics, with some even calling it Chanakya niti!

Exit, and swift return

The Anti-Defection Law provided a safeguard for defections made on genuine ideological differences. It accepted “split” within a party if at least one-third of the members of the legislative party defect, and allowed the formation of a new party or “merger” with other political party if not less than two-thirds of the party’s members commit to it. The 91st Constitutional Amendment introduced in 2003 deleted the provision allowing split.

The 91st Amendment also barred the appointment of defectors as Ministers until their disqualification period is over or they are re-elected, whichever is earlier. But, obviously, such laws have not put to rest the trend of defections.

The main issue, as witnessed in Karnataka, is that the defectors treat disqualification as a mere detour, before they return to the House or government by re-contesting. This can only be stopped by extending the disqualification period from re-contesting and appointment to Chairmanships/Ministries to at least six years. The minimum period limit of six years is needed to ensure that the defectors are not allowed to enter the election fray for least one election cycle, which is five years.

Of course, MLAs can still be bought from the ruling dispensation to bring it to a minority by being paid hefty sums, simply to stay at home for six years.

Almost every political outfit has been party to such devious games, with hardly any political will to find a solution.

368,2020/01/03,Minimising the housing divide,"Notwithstanding growing disparities of material status in India, there is a framework to mitigate the country’s socioeconomic problems and create a common development platform for rural and urban areas. This is called the Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas (PURA). The realisation of PURA’s transformative potential depends on public policies that recognise that its design goes beyond the mere creation of economic infrastructure and employment opportunities in rural areas. It also aims to develop social infrastructure.

Market interventions

To further this paradigm, access to good housing, including housing amenities, should become a priority. Unfortunately, housing in rural areas is one sector that has consistently suffered from the lack of meaningful market interventions, including supply of developed land and financing for housing. This is not to say that India never pursued effective poverty alleviation measures, but that the interventions it carried out have hardly worked in minimising urban-rural divides. Due to incompatibilities in supply and demand, millions of Indians dwell in unsecured housing. This was largely driven by shortages in the supply of housing and a lack of redevelopment of collapsible or dilapidated units.

Officially, the incidence of this form of housing-related poverty is in the order of 25.85 million (82% in rural areas and 18% in urban). Menial occupation workers and low-income earners have been facing these forms of poverty the most. Thus, development interventions must focus on rural and urban areas with due consideration for new construction and redevelopment of existing, life-threatening units.

Dilapidated units have contributed towards a high level of housing amenities deprivation, especially because they cannot safely be connected with electricity or solar energy, latrines, and drinking water, owing to associated structural risks. This scenario has resulted in multiple deprivations of 45% of rural families without electricity, biogas and LPG; over 69% without household latrines; and over 82% of families without treated water for drinking at household levels. Thus, the composite deprivation is in the order of over 58%. However, the regional picture depicts two contrasting scenarios of lower and higher levels, respectively, in 19 and nine independent States. The lower range of deprivations is at 20.68-52.65% and higher range at 60.19-74.81%. These results only speak to the priority in the political agenda, the exhibition of political will, and the economics of resource allocation in the administration of anti-poverty policies. In such a scenario there have been higher rates of internal migration both due to dissatisfaction with housing arrangements and the prospect of better housing elsewhere.

The way forward

If India is to have a real chance to minimise the housing development divide, it requires an integrated housing development strategy for the rural context, to be implemented in “mission mode”. Such a mission should have, first, a definite time frame. Second, it requires political will as expressed in party election manifestos. There must also be accountability in terms of implementing such a mission agenda on a continuous basis, with social audits at multiple levels of governance. Third, a realistic resource allocation is required given the cost of redevelopment and new housing units besides other development costs of drinking water supply, household latrines, energy, and drainage connectivity. Fourth, penetration of the market, including the cooperative sector for the supply of critical inputs such as land and finances, is the need of the hour. Public-private-partnership projects should be encouraged on public or government-owned lands, with fiscal and other incentives. Land owners should be encouraged to develop incentive-based affordable housing projects. Last, the people facing housing poverty must be made partners. Micro finance and self-help groups could be roped in to this end.

369,2020/01/03,Piggybacking on open source and open data,"Elections and electoral results occupy a key slot among the events that animate our regular coverage. From ground reportage to data-based analyses, The Hindu strives to bring to its readers all the features of what is probably the most vibrant aspect of India’s electoral democracy.

Today, thanks to the Election Commission’s website, finding out the rural-urban difference in voter choice and the regional break-up of the mandate and obtaining minute-by-minute coverage of the electoral results is possible due to advanced data visualisation tools. Most TV channels depend on third-party agencies to provide them regular updates from polling booths for their live coverage of election results, but newspaper websites rely extensively on EC data. This method is slower than the updates given by agencies, but it is more thorough and accurate.

The print edition is the best place to provide context and analyses of electoral results. For example, geographical analyses of the recent Jharkhand results using Census data showed that it was not just traditional weakness in rural areas or lack of adequate tribal support that put paid to the ruling BJP’s hope of retaining power, but an urban backlash too.

The creation of both live and static electoral maps is not an altogether difficult exercise for a software coder, but it is a steep learning curve for a political journalist, whose job is to interpret the data and present conclusions. When I first wanted to present electoral data in a readable constituency map format nearly eight years ago, there were many technical hurdles. Downloading live electoral data from the EC website required knowledge of web scraping tools. Visualising this information in the form of both static and live electoral maps required a familiarity with web GIS tools. There was also the additional and seemingly insurmountable problem of having no shapefiles (map contours) for newly delimited constituencies. The EC had provided shapefiles for seats before the delimitation exercise in 2009, but there was no non-proprietary shapefile available for the post-2009 constituency boundaries.

However, thanks to an open source data community, DataMeet, this problem was sorted out. Somewhere around 2013, a hackathon involving geocoders and GIS specialists managed to recreate Assembly and parliamentary shapefiles that were released with a creative commons licence for public use. Once shapefiles were available, the job of visualising data became much easier thanks to the availability of free tools such as Google Fusion Tables. I also managed to write a web scraper for the ECI website using my rudimentary programming skills, besides taking recourse to the availability of similar code in repositories such as GitHub. It was a web programmer from Iceland who helped me refine the code.

Today, The Hindu provides live data in maps on the website besides deep and structured analyses of electoral results on print after every election. Comparisons with past data are also readily done using EC data that are also in easily reusable forms in repositories such as the Ashoka University’s Trivedi Centre for Political Data. The presence and the work of the open source data and coding communities who provided the stepping stones for us is the key reason why the process is now seamless and relatively easy.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/data/irkntq/article30464357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Open-data,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/piggybacking-on-open-source-and-open-data/article30462959.ece
370,2020/01/03,Should the FM tweak direct taxes to spur the economy?,"With the Union Budget due in February, the focus is on tax measures that the Finance Minister may take to address the slowdown, especially in consumption. In a discussion moderated by Suresh Seshadri, D.K. Srivastava (Chief Policy Advisor, Ernst & Young, India) and Surajit Mazumdar (Professor of Economics, Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University) look at the possibility of changes in the income tax framework in the wake of recommendations submitted in August by a committee to review the direct tax regime. Edited excerpts:

What is the likelihood of changes to the direct taxes regime, including in income tax? And what would the rationale be?

D.K. Srivastava: We have to evaluate options available to the government, in terms of the overall situation of government finances as well as in terms of the challenges to economic growth. So far, no fiscal stimulus [measures] that have been announced from time to time have delivered any result. The monetary stimulus, which has been going on since the beginning of 2019, has also not delivered any result. So, the momentum of slowdown appears to be continuing. And the impact of that is on government revenues, particularly Central government tax revenues, which will also impact the State governments.

So, in some sense, we now have a conflict. The conflict is that if we tend to reduce the income tax rates and bring them, at least the highest rate, in alignment with the lower CIT (corporate income tax) rate, then there would be a revenue loss. At the same time, there would be some additional disposable income in the hands of middle-income groups, who may increase their consumption, which would be a benefit. So, lower capacity for the government to make direct increases in expenditure, but it has an indirect capacity, which it can put in the hands of the personal income tax assessees. So, we have to now evaluate this balance.

My assessment is that the impact on government revenues, particularly the Central government’s gross tax revenues, is going to be very huge because of the under-performance of indirect taxes and because of the revenue impact of CIT. As such, the options available for the government may be very limited and in that sense, whatever income tax reforms may have to be undertaken will have to be modulated to recognise the constraints that are operating on the Indian economy.

The task force on the direct tax code is reported to have recommended an increase in the number of income tax slabs including some rationalisation in the rates and an increase in the peak rate for the highest earners. Does this move the income tax regime to a more progressive one?

Surajit Mazumdar: I think there’s always a case for changing our slab structure to make it a little bit more progressive than it actually happens to be at the moment because there’s a very large range of incomes which happen to be taxed at the same rate. However, if the idea is to reduce the revenues that the state is going to get from income taxes because of concessions, then I think that hardly solves the problem that we are facing in the economy today, for several reasons: First, if you reduce the income tax, and correspondingly cover for the revenue loss by reducing spending by the government, then it really has no effect ultimately on the total expenditure in the economy because you’re replacing one expenditure with another — a certain expenditure with a more uncertain expenditure. Second, how many people pay income tax in this country? Roughly about 6 crore people file income tax returns. Within that 6 crore almost 5 crore pay practically no tax. So it’s a very small proportion of your population which is going to be affected by any reduction in income tax. And the problem for the economy today is that its demand base is too narrow. So if you try and expand demand only in that narrow base, that’s not necessarily a resolution of the problem of the slowdown that you’re facing.

Overall personal income taxes account for less than 2.5% of the GDP. So even if you make a small reduction in that, it’s really not going to have any significant impact on the slowdown. In the longer term, however, I think we are in an economy in which we have a tax structure that is too heavily weighted in favour of indirect taxes as well as a low tax-to-GDP ratio. So, in the longer run, we should be moving towards a larger proportion of direct taxes. And, therefore, a reduction in direct taxes is not the way to go either in the short term or in the long term.

There have been attempts in the past as well to usher in reforms on the direct taxes front. Now, given the current fiscal constraints, again there is a problem. But then there would also be a school of opinion which would say: ‘The fiscal pressure can’t get worse than this. So probably bite the bullet now’.

D.K. Srivastava: A good framework would be to put in perspective what is the long-term reform that we want in the case of direct taxes. Now, as far as CIT is concerned, already the major step has been taken. And there has been a significant reduction in the CIT rates in order to attract foreign investors, foreign companies to set up their operations in India. So far, there has been a very lukewarm response. But nevertheless, I think we have to give this entire initiative some time. Now, having already considered that for CIT rates the norm is going to be 25%, with a conditionality for new manufacturing companies at 15%, we may not be able to keep, in the long run, our personal income tax rates, particularly the highest slab rate, much out of alignment with the CIT rate.

So, in some sense what the Ministry of Finance needs to do is at least indicate to us what is the desired long-term framework that the government is looking at, even if the present constraints may not allow us to go all the way towards that framework. In my view, the CIT rate predetermines, in some sense, the options that are available for the personal income tax (PIT) rates.

We should not actually increase our exemption limit because of the whole issue of how many people are our tax assessees. If we keep increasing the exemption limit, then obviously our tax base would become narrower. So while keeping the exemption limit where it is, maybe allow a small inflation adjustment. But other than that, I think the options are going to be very limited as far as PIT is concerned.

There are also suggestions that you need to try and move towards a more flat rate on income taxes.

Surajit Mazumdar: If you look at taxes as a whole, the base is a lot wider than it is for personal income tax directly. Because a substantial part of our taxes, two-thirds of our tax revenues — Central and State governments’ — come from indirect taxes, which are paid by sections of the population which may not be covered under personal income tax. So, if you have this kind of a structure where you have a flat rate of personal income tax and a substantial dependence on indirect taxes, then that is something that makes the tax structure pretty regressive. And that’s not a desirable result from an equity perspective or even from a growth perspective. If you look at the trajectory of the Indian economy, even in periods of relatively better growth, the reason you’re not able to sustain that high growth is that the kind of distribution of income resulting from that growth is too skewed in favour of a relatively small section of the population. And if that is the outcome, you have a dependence on a very narrow demand base, which is what is leading to the problem that you’re facing today. So, if you are going to address that problem, then your tax structure has to become more progressive rather than regressive. So, I would not be in favour of a flat income tax structure. I would think that there is much greater scope to improve compliance, not necessarily by a reduction in rates or having a flat rate, but by having a proper tax administration and improving the efficiency of the tax administration.

With respect to direct taxes, is the Budget going to be more one of making policy statements and less of actual measures that would make a difference to people’s pockets?

D.K. Srivastava: Yes, I think in the case of direct taxes, the Budget will only spell out incremental changes in the PIT structure; CIT there may not be much because already most of the action has taken place. And I think the constraint on stimulating demand is very, very severe. And the policy options available for the Central government are also, therefore, very limited. I see one method, which is also both short term and long term, that may deliver the Indian economy closer to its potential growth, and that is to start looking at the structure of government expenditure. Now, if you look at the entire saving-investment decline, which actually began from 2007-08, you will find that there are two major sectors where this has happened. One is the household sector and the other is the public sector or government sector proper. Overall savings rate erosion has been about six to seven percentage points. Half of that is due to the household sector fall in saving, and the other half is in the public sector, particularly government savings. And within the government, it is erosion in the Central government saving or increase in Central government dissaving.

Now, one way in which we can both increase demand and increase investment is for the government to really reduce its revenue deficit, reduce its dissaving, but spend on creating assets, particularly infrastructure assets.

In order to reinvigorate social sector spending, whether it’s in skills training, education or healthcare, what do you think can be done using the framework of taxation to move the needle?

Surajit Mazumdar: My view is rather contrary to the dominant view that governs policymaking. I think we need to move in the direction of greater government expenditure on all these sectors and therefore, greater revenue mobilisation also, which is also consistent with the objective of reducing the inequalities that exist in our society. So, to redress that inequality as well as to allow the government to spend more on sectors that need expenditures, one has to at least use fiscal policy. We are not having any radical programme of asset redistribution in the economy. At least, fiscal policy has to be used in a redistributive sense: in the sense of taxing those who are taking a large part of the cake and spending it on activities which bring benefits to others, but more importantly, create assets and circumstances in which sustainable long-term growth and development can happen.

371,2020/01/03,A weak test: On Swachh ranking of cities,"The NDA government’s Swachh Survekshan, the ranking system for clean cities, was rolled out four years ago as the answer to a problem that municipal law failed to solve. Sanitation and public health are responsibilities of State governments, and it is no secret that they have spectacularly failed at managing growing volumes of municipal and hazardous waste. The problem has only been compounded by the absence of plans that take a holistic view of housing, sanitation, water supply, waste management and transport. Ahead of the launch of Swachh Survekshan 2020, the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is once again trying to stir up competition among cities, by pre-ranking them for their performance during 2019 and assigning points to be added this year. As an idea, unleashing the competitive spirit among States may seem appealing, but in reality, the problems confronting urban India require large-scale infrastructure creation, full adherence to legal requirements on waste management, and transparent technical audits. Many cities remain clueless on handling their waste, one shocking example being the rising mountain of garbage at the Ghazipur landfill in Delhi. Ironically, Bhopal, which figures among the top five cleanest cities under the just-released list, continues to live with the effects of the gas disaster of 1984. Ranks and prizes clearly cannot solve the national waste management crisis.

Looking ahead to the next edition of the Survekshan, the Urban Affairs Ministry has identified ambitious targets: “100% processing and safe disposal of waste, complete faecal sludge and septage management, and wastewater treatment and reuse.” These are major tasks. The Ministry has also sanctioned funds under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) to help States set up facilities necessary to manage waste. States should ask for extended funding under such schemes to create the infrastructure for a future-focused clean-up and, simultaneously, institute measures to reduce waste. The emphasis worldwide is on creating a circular economy centred at the principle of material recovery from all kinds of waste, reuse, recycling and reduced pressure on natural resources. A sound ranking of cities and towns would naturally give the highest weightage to this dimension of sustainable management, replacing symbolism with an environmentally sound approach. Such rigour in policy formulation can make the Centre’s goal of eliminating single-use plastic by 2022 seem more realistic, and industry would find a compelling reason to switch to alternatives. Retooling Swachh Survekshan 2020 to go beyond perception management and adopt sustainability is essential to make it a genuine contest.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-weak-test-the-hindu-editorial-on-swachh-ranking-of-cities/article30463629.ece
372,2020/01/03,Berth pangs: On Maharashtra portfolio allocation,"With its expansion on Monday, the Maharashtra Council of Ministers is now 43 strong: the three key partners of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress got 15, 16 and 12 berths in the Ministry, respectively. Ajit Pawar, the nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar who vaulted to the BJP camp to briefly become the Deputy CM, now holds the same post in the government, almost as if his act of defiance of the party leadership did not happen at all. The sharing of portfolios remains a bone of contention among partners and within each party. Chief Minister Udhav Thackeray could not meet the deadline he had himself set for announcing the portfolios, which was a day after the expansion. He will be able to arrive at an agreement with leaders of allies and party colleagues, but that will not necessarily end bad blood and resentment in the camp. The MVA is an unlikely alliance as the Sena does not share a common ideological platform with the other two parties. Sena, the oldest ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), turned against the latter not on any question of ideology but on disagreements over power-sharing. The three parties are now bound by a shared rivalry with the BJP, and they also have a limited shared agenda. The endurance of that agenda and their bonding will be constantly tested and the bickering over portfolio allocation is one such occasion. Home, Revenue and Finance portfolios lend Ministers considerable sway and there are always multiple claimants for them.

The MVA consolidated several social and economic interest groups that perceived a threat from the BJP, and has good reasons to stay together till it gets closer to the next election. The opportunism in this alliance apart, the peaceful mobilisation of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act in recent weeks without any hostility from the police was indicative of the significance of the MVA as a bulwark against the BJP. Hunger for power could be a potent adhesive, but also the source of disarray for the alliance. The birth pangs of the Thackeray government, which took oath on November 28 and took until December 12 for the first round of portfolio allocation, then until December 31 for the expansion of the council, must act as an alert for all leaders. The populous cohort of dynasts in the council, which includes the CM and his son, also points to an inherent contradiction of most non-BJP parties. The Congress has eight, the NCP seven and the Sena has three members including the CM, in the council, who have acquired power as inheritance at least in part. The BJP too had its share of dynasts when it was in power. However, in the absence of a strong ideological orientation, dynastic politics becomes more jarring in non-BJP parties even as it remains essential for their sustenance.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/berth-pangs-the-hindu-editorial-on-maharashtra-portfolio-allocation/article30463620.ece
373,2020/01/03,Chitra Santhe: A brush with art and heritage,"The first Sunday of the New Year, January 5, will see over four lakh people visit the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath’s ‘Chitra Santhe’ (the art fair) where nearly 1,500 artists from across the country will display their work.

This time around, the 17th edition of the art fair will be dedicated to farmers, said CKP President B.L. Shankar. “The Chitrakala Parishath has been preserving and publishing dying art forms, both traditional and folk, for the last half a century. To make art more accessible to the public, we have been holding Chitra Santhe without a break since 2003,” said Mr. Shankar.

Art is not restricted to galleries and embodies the cultural and historical heritage of the State. Over the years, the Santhe has helped facilitate dialogue, discourse, debate and artistic interaction, and has become an open school for artistic exchanges between the States in India. With this in mind, the Tourism Department along with Chitrakala Parishath organised the Karnataka Heritage Camp from December 30, 2019 where 30 artists from across the country toured Karnataka.

They will be producing three art pieces each depicting 90 tourist attractions of the State. The artwork will be displayed at the Public Art Display under the theme ‘Heritage Karnataka – Love, Beauty and Art’ on January 5. “The Department of Tourism provided funds of ₹15 lakh for this initiative,” said Minister for Kannada and Culture C. T. Ravi at a press conference on Friday. He added that around 125 other art works related to the heritage of Karnataka would also be on display during the santhe.

For the first time, the Chitrakala Parishath has instituted a national award this year, named after its founder secretary Prof. M.S. Nanjunda Rao. “It will be awarded to senior artist R.B. Bhaskaran and will carry a cash prize of ₹1 lakh,” said Mr. Shankar.

The presentation ceremony will take place on January 4 where the ‘Chitrakala Sanman’ awards will be presented to H.N. Suresh (H.K. Kejriwal award); S. Krishnappa (M. Aryamurthy Award); Ganesh Somayaji (D. Devaraj Urs Award); and Vijaya Hagaragundagi (Y. Subramanyaraju Award).

At the santhe on January 5, visitors will be able to see Mysore and Tanjore traditional paintings, Rajasthani, Madhubani-style art, and modern and contemporary works in various media like water colour, oil, acrylic, pencil, ink drawings, and fibreglass.

All through the day, there will be performances at the Parishath and on Kumara Krupa Road. Special counters will be provided to senior artists and differently-abled artists within the premises of Chitrakala Parishath.

There would be 1,500 stalls from Windsor Manor hotel up to Shivananda Circle and part of Crescent Road.

“The last Chitra Santhe generated a sale of around ₹3 crore. We expect the figure to go up by 10% this year,” said Mr. Shankar, adding that the expenditure for the Chitra Santhe amounted to approximately ₹30 lakh.

Bengaluru as art hub?

The city will host India Art Fair, which will be organised by the Chitrakala Parishath on April 24 and 25. “Until now, it was confined to Delhi and Mumbai,” said CKP President B.L. Shankar. “There were two appeals from the public to extend the Chitra Santhe for two days and also change the venue. Unfortunately, we had to turn them down due to budget constraints,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5h48fy/article30473216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGCHITRASANTHE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/chitra-santhe-a-brush-with-art-and-heritage/article30473217.ece
374,2020/01/03,BBMP trying to get UDD to change stance on Mittaganahalli tender,"Waste management continues to be a problem for the civic body, which is struggling to find alternatives after the Urban Development Department rejected a tender for setting up a scientific landfill at Mittaganahalli.

The tender was rejected on the grounds that the bidder did not have prior experience in either setting up or maintaining a scientific landfill. According to civic officials, however, these issues were discussed during pre-bid meetings and the BBMP had decided to relax the conditions.

“Before the tender was cancelled, the UDD did not call for a meeting of the empowered committee as well. We have urged the department to place the tender before the committee for a detailed discussion. We have also sent the proceedings of the pre-bid meetings,” an official said.

While attempts are being made to get the department to revoke its decision, the move has come as a setback to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which continues to rely on landfills for the disposal of mixed waste.

It currently operates a temporary landfill at Mittaganahalli, which is fast filling up. Since the closure of Bellahalli quarry pit around three months ago, the civic body, as a stop-gap arrangement, has been dumping mixed waste in the smaller landfill at Mittaganahalli.

“The temporary landfill will reach full capacity either by the end of this month or early next month. The tender for the scientific landfill was floated to provide an alternative,” an official said and added that with time of the essence, the civic body was not in a position to float another tender.

Senior officials said, as per the tender condition, only inert waste could be dumped at the Mittaganahalli quarry, which is spread over six acres. This, after extracting all the recoverables from the mixed waste. This was done to ensure that the landfill lasted at least five years, by which time, the civic body had planned to increase the capacity of the processing plants, apart from having many more decentralised processing units within the city.

“Already, the number of vehicles being sent to the quarry pit has been reduced. On an average, around 300 vehicles carrying approximately 2,000 tonnes are sent to the landfill every day. Since the closure of Bellahalli quarry pit, the number of vehicles has been reduced by at least 50,” an official said.

The BBMP has also increased the processing capacity of the plants. From processing around 800 tonnes a day, the units now receive approximately 1,200 tonnes a day.

Currently, Lingadheeranahalli and Subbarayanapalya units are not receiving any waste. The case pertaining to Lingadheeranahalli will come up before the National Green Tribunal on January 17. Waste is not being sent to Subbarayanapalya for the past two months following a case of vandalism.

Senior officials said the zonal joint commissioner had been directed to meet the local communities soon to convince them to allow the civic body to reopen the plant. “Once both the units are allowed to operate, the quantum of waste processed will increase,” officials added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/o5u48o/article30473114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBELLAHALLILANDFILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-trying-to-get-udd-to-change-stance-on-mittaganahalli-tender/article30473115.ece
375,2020/01/03,Protests against Citizenship Amendment Act pick up pace,"Protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the proposed extension of National Register of Citizens (NRC) continued in the city on Friday, the 189th birth anniversary of social reformer and poet Savitribai Phule who campaigned for equality.

Over 25,000 people from the minority community gathered peacefully at the Eidgah Maidan at Chamarajpet to protest against the Act. This is the second such gathering by Muslims in the city, the first being on December 23, that reportedly saw the participation of nearly one lakh people.

The protest on Friday was organised by B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan, Congress MLA from Chamarajpet. Several Islamic religious leaders, activists and progressive thinkers participated in the protest.

Veteran freedom fighter and veteran Gandhian H.S. Doreswamy, who was part of the protest, addressed the gathering, and pointed out that those who had gathered to protest against CAA and NRC had participated not as Muslims or Hindus but as Indians. “Do not bring in the aspect of religion to the protest. The protests are secular and people of all religion have opposed CAA and NRC,” he said. “While Pakistan was founded on the basis of religion, our country was formed on the basis of secular principles, emphasising on pluralism. Hence, bringing Pakistan into the debate is not right,” he added.

Speaking on the sidelines of the rally, Mr. Khan said that they need not prove their patriotism to anyone. “We were born here and we will die here. This is our land. Muslims in India are anxious about what will happen to them if CAA and NRC are implemented.”

To mark the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule, several Dalit activists and students gathered in front of Town Hall to protest against CAA, NRC and the National Population Register (NPR). Nearly 500 protesters held placards that read #GoBackModi and demanded the Centre roll back CAA.

A citizenship quiz

At the Institution of Agricultural Technologists, protesters held a ‘“Citizenship Quiz’ where 10 teams tested their knowledge on citizenship in India, CCA, NRC and NPR.

“This event is part of a larger campaign to raise awareness about the issue,” said Clifton D’Rosario of Hum Bharat Ke Log, the organiser of the event.

“My partner and I are quiz enthusiasts. We have been participating in the anti-CAA protests. This is just another way of getting to know more about it. We also like the idea of using quizzing as a means of protest,” said Akhila one of the participants.

As many as eight events this weekend

At least eight events are being organised over the weekend against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. This includes multiple protests, a seminar and lectures.

The group India Against CAA, which was formed during the recent protests, has organised a day-long satyagraha against the Act at Freedom Park on Saturday.

Hum Bharat Ke Log, a coalition of organisations against the Act, have called for a protest in front of Town Hall at 4 p.m. Two protests have been organised at Eidgah-e-Bilal on Bannerghatta Road and at Aramgah-e- Asgari on Hosur Road on Saturday.

The Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha has organised a day-long seminar at Maharani Science College from 11 a.m. on Saturday where former IAS officer Sashikanth Senthil and law professor Babu Mathew are expected to participate.

Several protests have been lined up on Sunday as well, including a ‘Burqa and Bindi Protest’ to mark the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule and opposition to CAA, NRC and NPR. Protesters will gather in front of Town Hall at 4 p.m.

The same day, advocate Alok Prasannakumar, a senior resident fellow of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, will deliver a lecture ‘Exposing the CAA-NRC Agenda’ at Jai Bhim Bhavan at 5 p.m.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/protests-against-citizenship-amendment-act-pick-up-pace/article30473065.ece
376,2020/01/03,"After a long gap, the BMTC starts receiving new buses","After a long gap, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has started inducting new buses. It has received 70 diesel buses, and by March this year, a total of 357 buses will be added to the fleet.

“We have started receiving diesel buses. As per the rules, we have to register them by March 2020. We will operate all the 357 buses by March-end. For the 2020-21 financial year, a proposal will be sent to the State government seeking support to induct 1,500 more buses,” said C. Shikha, Managing Director, BMTC.

If all goes as planned, a few electric buses will also be operational by the end of the financial year. Under the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India), the BMTC is leasing 300 E-buses.

The addition to the BMTC’s fleet will come as a relief to commuters who rely on the bus network. In the last one-and-a-half years, the number of buses scrapped exceeded inductions. The corporation decommissioned 450 buses while adding only 292 to its fleet. Since the start of this financial year, only two buses have been added.

Various groups, such Bus Prayanikara Vedike and Citizens for Bengaluru, have been demanding that the State government release funds to boost BMTC’s fleet. The city's vehicle population has increased to over 83 lakh and many rely on private vehicles to commute. With the BMRCL yet to complete Phase II of Namma Metro, and the ambitious suburban rail project remaining only on paper, buses remain the primary means of public transport.

“The city needs a good public transport system. The existing metro network is not sufficient. The BMRCL will take many more years to connect locations like Whitefield, Electronics City and Outer Ring Road where lakhs of people travel on a daily basis. The suburban rail project is awaiting approval. Deploying more buses will help the public and ease traffic congestion on the roads,” said Shivananda a regular passenger of BMTC.

In the last five year, the number of BMTC buses have remained the same whereas private vehicles increased exponentially. At present, the BMTC has a fleet of 6,482 buses. In the last five years, it was able to induct 1,705 buses while scrapping 1,695 old buses.

The increased vehicular population on the roads is also having its impact on efficiency of services offered by the BMTC. In 2014-15, a city bus used to cover a distance of 214 km each day, but now the number has come down to 199 km. On certain routes, the average speed of a BMTC bus is below 15 kmph.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hoyu21/article30473046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBMTCBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/after-a-long-gap-the-bmtc-starts-receiving-new-buses/article30473048.ece

378,2020/01/03,Schools skip Kannada workshop,"As many as 130 private schools across Bengaluru will receive a notice for skipping a workshop organised on Friday by the Department of Primary and Secondary Education in association with Kannada Development Authority (KDA) regarding implementation of Kannada as the first and second language.

All schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations as well as International General Certificate of Secondary Education were invited for the workshop. Only 380 out of the 510 schools sent their representatives.

Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said, “We will issue a notice to the schools which were not present in the workshop and seek an explanation.”

The Kannada Language Learning Act 2015, which came into effect from the 2017-2018 academic year, mandates that all schools introduce Kannada as the first or second language in a phased manner. While authorities from KDA say that, as per their data, over 159 schools in Bengaluru are not following the rule, the department’s data indicates that only 21 schools in the city are not complying.

Mr. Suresh Kumar acknowledged that some schools are not complying with the department’s directions. ""During my visit to schools, I have realised that some have no teachers who are qualified to teach Kannada.”

Some school managements wanted to know if there is an option to teach Kannada as the third language, but the department categorically stated that it needs to be taught as the first or second language.

Several Kannada teachers rued the lack of time to teach Kananda.

In response, Commissioner for Public Instruction K.G. Jagadeesha said, ""It is mandatory for schools to allot 5 periods a week for Kannada second language and 6 periods a week for first language.""

The principal of a city-based school urged the department to bring out a policy making it mandatory for teachers to learn Kannada. He said that only 30% of the 180 teachers in his school speak Kannada. To this, the Minister said that they would examine this proposal seriously.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/schools-skip-kannada-workshop/article30472576.ece
379,2020/01/03,BDA finally floats tender for rejuvenation of Bellandur lake,"After being reprimanded by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for failing to rejuvenate Bellandur and Varthur lakes, the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) has finally floated a tender for desilting, rejuvenation and development of Bellandur lake with an estimated project cost of ₹250 crore.

For Varthur lake, the authority is likely to float a tender in three days with an estimated project cost of ₹150 crore.

BDA Commissioner G.C. Prakash told The Hindu that it would take one year to desilt and rejuvenate the lakes. “A tender has been floated for desilting and other related works of rejuvenation. We have already taken measures to drain out sewage water. There is close to 50 lakh cubic meter of silt in the lake that has to be removed. As part of the rejuvenation, strengthening tank bund, parks, walkways and other beautification works will be taken up.”

Frothing and fire in the highly polluted Bellandur lake has often made headlines, even internationally. The poor state of lakes and the apathy shown by the authorities concerned has caused much outrage among citizens.

After taking up suo motu cognisance of environmental degradation of lakes, NGT pulled up the State government for failing to take up corrective measures. The NGT had directed the government to deposit ₹500 crore in an escrow account and imposed a penalty of ₹75 crore for failing to follow its directives.

Former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde, who is heading a committee for rejuvenation of Bellandur lake appointed by the National Green Tribunal, said, “Our committee has made several recommendations to the NGT on rejuvenation, including a deadline for fencing the area, clearing the encroachment of lake, bund development and taking up de-silting work by March-end. Now, by floating the tender, the BDA has followed the orders issued by the NGT.”

Silt for free

Mr. Prakash said that the BDA has come out with a notification to provide silt free of cost to farmers and brick manufacturing units.

“Depending on the demand from farmers, we will provide the silt that can also be used as manure in agricultural fields. Interested farmers can make their own transport arrangements or else we are ready to provide transportation facility to the outskirts of Bengaluru,” he said.

The BBMP has identified five quarries for dumping the silt removed from Bellandur lake.

381,2020/01/03,Patients at Chennai’s Institute of Mental Health make soaps for sale,"Soon, a variety of soaps made by patients of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) will be on sale. As part of industrial therapy, the institute has started to train a handful of women patients in making soaps from natural ingredients.

Already, IMH’s Industrial Training Centre established in 1972 runs the hospital canteen, bakery, cover-making unit and soft toy unit. Patients, who improve with treatment, are employed at these units as part of rehabilitation. Now, the institute has added soap making to its list of efforts for rehabilitating patients.

“This is a very innovative project for our residents, and is being attempted for the first time with the help of The Candles, a NGO working for mental health. It will lead to our residents becoming self sufficient as this will bring in revenue and will be the first step towards them being integrated back into the community,” P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said.

The Candles is providing vocational training to two batches of women patients, who are improving with treatment, in making a variety of soaps. The soap varieties would include aloe vera, turmeric, cucumber, carrot, beetroot, charcoal, rose, ‘avarampoo’, lemon, orange and “vetiver”. The packs will carry the tag line of “a product made by residents of Mental Health Institute” to remove the stigma on the mentally ill in the society.

“As of now, the first batch of 15 are being engaged in soap making, while the second batch of an equal number will be trained after March. This is a cold processing method of making soaps. Except for caustic soda, raw materials that are organic and natural are being provided. They will use natural ingredients such as aloe vera, ‘kasturi manjal’, rose, hibiscus, ‘multani mitti’ and ‘avarampoo’ along with essential oils. The soap varieties will mostly be from ingredients native to the State,” Angelin Prince, director of The Candles said.

She added that this would help in empowering them. “Soap making was selected as many persons were shifting to natural products now. To start with, about 100 to 200 soaps would be made in a month. We will market these soaps through social media on our Facebook and Instagram pages, and through friends,” she said.

Crisil Foundation, as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, will be providing the ingredients to make the soaps, a press release said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p4dsr6/article30471259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03JANTH--IMH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/patients-at-chennais-institute-of-mental-health-make-soaps-for-sale/article30471262.ece
382,2020/01/03,Woman chokes to death while eating bajji in Chennai,"In a tragic incident, a 45-year-old woman died in Choolaimedu after she choked on a bajji she was eating.

The victim has been identified as Padamavathi, 45, wife of Gangadharan, 48. The husband works in a shop which sells two-wheeler spare parts in Royapettah. The couple was staying at the wife’s family’s home in Kamarajar street, Choolaimedu. On Thursday evening, Gangadharan was away at work. His wife Padamavathi, her mother and other family members had bajjis bought from a nearby shop.

When Padmavathi choked on the food, her mother gave her water to drink. Soon though, she had difficulties breathing, and though her family tried to resuscitate her, she did not regain consciousness. They rushed her in an ambulance to Government Kilpauk Medical College where she was declared brought dead by doctors.

While the tank is well protected by wrought iron gates from the outside, residents who live in the vicinity complained that waste water let out by those washing clothes and from nearby houses, is destroying the quality of water inside the tank.

Umashankar, a resident of Singaperumal Koil, complaining about the waste water and garbage being dumped into the tank rued that the water from the tank was used for the deities of the temple.

Residents of the area pointed out since the gates of the pond are always open, many anti-social elements drink liquor sitting on the steps during the night. Residents want the temple authorities to take steps to clean the water body and keep the gates locked to prevent the water being polluted.

384,2020/01/03,Heart transplants in Chennai that changed young lives,"Two girls aged 11 and 17 years, recently underwent heart transplants that have enabled them return to normal life.

Agalya (11) was diagnosed with breathlessness and a heart condition at the age of three. Her parents Devi and Meenakshi Sundaram, who live in Nagercoil, took her to a hospital in Thiruvananthapuram for treatment. She lived a severely compromised life until a few months ago, when she suffered bouts of bleeding through the mouth. She was then referred to chairman, cardiac sciences and director of heart and lung transplant and mechanical circulatory support of MGM Hospital, K. R. Balakrishnan.

Tushitha (17) will now be able to return to school. The commerce stream student has been suffering from breathlessness since she was 30 months old. A resident of OMR, when she was referred to Dr. Balakrishnan she had symptoms suggestive of severe heart failure.

Both girls hail from lower socio-economic families and did not have the money for a heart transplant. Aishwarya Trust supported them financially. The transplant surgeries, each costing ₹15 lakh were done during November/December last year.

On December 9, a compatible donor was found for Agalya in a private hospital in Coimbatore. The heart was transported in a commercial flight and transplanted on to Agalya. She was discharged on December 30, after the surgery, said Suresh Rao, K.G. co-director of heart and lung transplant and mechanical circulatory support.

Doctors found a matching donor for Tushitha on November 26 and the heart was transported from a private hospital in a two-hour trip to MGM Healthcare. She was discharged on December 20 and is reportedly doing well.

The idea of presenting the cases is to highlight the fact that a lot of patients need financial support. The outcomes are excellent when children undergo transplantation. These parents do not have the required money and the Trust stepped in, Dr. Balakrishnan said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/heart-transplants-in-chennai-that-changed-young-lives/article30469686.ece
385,2020/01/03,"Fog blankets Chennai, flights delayed due to poor visibility","Chennaiites woke up to a foggy morning on Friday. While most parts of north India witnessed heavy fog, as is usual for the season, several areas in Chennai too witnessed a morning blanketed by a thick fog.

Northeast monsoon is set to withdraw around January 8 and foggy Friday morning in Chennai was an indication of this. Until then, the State is likely to get stray showers particularly in coastal areas, according to Meteorological Department.

A blanket of fog covered most parts of the city till 8.30 a.m. on Friday and some other parts of the State, including Puducherry, also experienced foggy morning. Officials in Airport Meteorological Office, Meenambakkam, said visibility reduced to 100 metres by around 7.30 a.m. that led to suspension of flight operations. It improved after 8.30 a.m. on Friday after fog dissipated. It is normal for fog formation during this part of the year.

Fog forms when the land is cool and the air is warm and moist at lower level. The prevailing calm wind aided in fog formation. It dissipates as the land gets warmer during day time. This trend may continue for a few days, an official said.

During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Friday, Burliar in Nilgiris district recorded 4 cm and Tamaraipakkam in Tiruvallur recorded 3 cm. Such rainfall would continue till January 6 and 7 in south Tamil Nadu and some coastal areas. Chennai has a chance of light rains in some areas on Saturday, said N.Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre.

As a result, many flights arriving at the Chennai airport were delayed anywhere between 15 minutes to half hour due to poor visibility conditions.

Flights that were scheduled to arrive from around 5 a.m. onwards from various destinations, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad and international destinations such as Bangkok and Doha, landed late as the visibility at the airport had dipped.

Similarly, several departing flights from Chennai airport to destinations, including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Port Blair, Kolkata, Thoothukudi, Coimbatore and Delhi, were delayed by nearly half an hour to more than an hour due to weather conditions. Due to a series of such delays, there may be a consequential effect on other flights too for sometime, sources said.

Meteorologists note that this is a normal phenomenon during January and visibility was up to 2,000 metres during early morning hours. Flight delays here could also be because of foggy conditions in the destinations of north India. “We are assessing the visibility level,” said an official.

Weather blogger K. Srikanth, who writes on Chennayil Oru Mazhaikalam, said rains for the past two days had increased the soil moisture. The ground has become cooler and the air temperature at surface level was warmer. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m., Meenambakkam recorded a minimum temperature of 25.2 degree Celsius.

The air temperature at higher level gets cooler. This one layer of inversion of warmer air has led to foggy condition, he said. Such fog can be noticed near water bodies more prominently.

Warmest December in two decades

Even as NE monsoon is on its last leg, weather bloggers note that 2019 witnessed warmest December in two decades. Though Chennai experienced only 20 cm of rainfall in December, rains at regular intervals led to temperature staying above normal and the city missed its nippy weather during the second half of December.

The average minimum temperature in December 2019 crossed 23 degree Celsius in Meenambakkam, which was warmest in two decades. Mr. Srikanth said whenever there is easterly winds, temperature in the city get modulated. It is not unusual for Chennai to get rains during December-end as Meenambakkam had rains in 2014.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/qw4mlo/article30467511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Fogjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fog-blankets-chennai-flights-delayed-due-to-poor-visibility/article30467508.ece
386,2020/01/03,Two die as van falls into KP canal,"Two persons — a 65-year-old woman and her granddaughter — died after a mini van by which they were travelling fell into Kandaleru-Poondi (KP) canal near Utthukottai in Tiruvallur district early on Thursday.

390,2020/01/03,Shore north of Adyar eroding fast: study,"The shoreline north of the Adyar river’s mouth, including near Srinivasapuram, is eroding with every passing year, according to a study on shoreline change analysis by IIT-Madras.

On an average, a two-km stretch of coastline, particularly near Srinivasapuram, is eroding at the rate of one to five metres every year.

The study had surveyed the extent of erosion between Chennai port and Palavakkam, for a distance of 15 km.

Taking the shoreline during 1990 as the baseline for the study, the Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT-Madras, had observed the shoreline oscillation in 303 transects at an interval of 80 metres.

According to the study analysing data between 2000 and 2019, the sand, which is moving gets trapped near the Adyar river’s mouth. This has led to sand being eroded along the shoreline near Srinivasapuram. The Adyar river’s mouth is dynamic and the instability of the river mouth has resulted in the eroding coastline on the northside.

Moreover, the breakwater structure near the Cooum river mouth has helped sand accretion. On an average, the stretch near Marina beach experiences a sand accretion of up to 2.2 metres every year. Groynes constructed at the Cooum river mouth have helped in the formation of the beach. After Marina beach, the sand deposit rate reduces along the shoreline even near Mylapore.

Dr. V. Sundar, Professor Emeritus, Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras said, “We noticed that the erosion beyond Adyar river mouth is more between June and September. The maximum rate of coastline erosion was noticed up to 10 metres in a year a few times. The coastline has had a maximum of accretion of 5.35 metres per year.”

Cost-effective solution

Disposal of sand was also important along with the dredging of the Adyar river mouth.

Encroachment near the Adyar river was another issue. The study suggested that the dredged sand could be filled in geosynthetic materials and used in constructing a training wall into the river.

This could be a cost-effective solution.

A technical study must be done for the stretch between the Cooum and Adyar river mouths to find a suitable solution for coastline protection. Some of the solutions could be use of geosynthetic materials for constructing groyne fields like near Ennore, offshore detached breakwaters or submerged reefs, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wdk91d/article30464888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THADYARRIVERMOUTH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/shore-north-of-adyar-eroding-fast-study/article30464889.ece
391,2020/01/03,1.6 lakh trees to be pruned in the city,"As many as 1.61 lakh trees along the 471 bus routes and 33,000 streets will be pruned by Chennai Corporation in the 15 zones of the city. Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash has asked residents to call 1913 to report civic issues caused by the overgrown trees in their neighbourhoods. “Most of the 1.61 lakh trees have thick foliage, obstructing streetlights. Some tree branches have been found to obstruct traffic flow along roads. Some branches pose a risk to the lives of pedestrians,” said an official.

Residents in many neighbourhoods have been requesting the Chennai Corporation to prune branches over the past few months. But the civic body has been unable to take up pruning in many of the localities. “A total of 358 workers of the Parks Department and 11 overseers have been pruning the branches following request from the residents. We have procured six hydraulic equipment for the purpose. Each has been procured at a cost of ₹20 lakh,” said an official.

Former Chennai Corporation Council floor leader V. Sukumar Babu said most of the junior engineers and zonal officers were reluctant to coordinate with the Parks Department as there were “many formalities” involved in pruning trees. “The delay in pruning trees has affected streetlighting along many stretches. The manpower is inadequate. Park overseers are also unable to help residents. This equipment is inadequate. We need more equipment,” said Mr.Sukumar Babu. “Many trees in Arumbakkam needs pruning. A dangerous tree in Arumbakkam Ayyavoo Colony Jayammal Street has not been removed yet. Residents have been making requests for months,” he said.

Chennai Corporation has shared the contacts of executive engineers in each of the 15 zones with residents to get assistance in tree pruning.

392,2020/01/03,"On counting day, Tiruvallur sees tempers running high","Counting of votes began at snail’s pace in Tiruvallur on Thursday morning. By 10 p.m., DMK was leading with 26 wins in the Panchayat Union ward members’ election, compared to 24 secured by the AIADMK.

The results across the several positions that went to polls remain unknown, and will be available only on Friday, officials said.

Besides the delay in starting counting, the staff in many of the 14 centres complained that breakfast and lunch were not provided on time to them, and in protest, walked out, refusing to be part of the process.

“To reach these centres we left our houses as early as 5 a.m. A few even brought their infants along as there was no one to take care of them and they had to be fed too. Sorting and counting is a tedious process and that too it is stifling to sit inside the classrooms for hours. Hence we got agitated when the breakfast and lunch were delayed,” said a staff in Ponneri.

Similar complaints arose in Gummidipoondi, Pandur, Perumalpet and other counting centres.

Meanwhile supporters of the candidates turned unruly and crowded the centres. In Cholavaram and Perumalpet, the police used mild force to disperse the crowd.

Out of the total 4,725 different posts, including Panchayat president and Panchayat Union Ward members in the district, 806 had already been declared winners unopposed.

393,2020/01/03,Can ASI share its revenue with town panchayat of Mamallapuram: HC,"The Madras High Court on Thursday wanted to know whether the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which reportedly charges ₹600 from every foreign tourist and ₹40 from domestic tourists visiting the Mamallapuram monuments, would be able to spare a part of its revenue with the local Town Panchayat to improve the civic amenities.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar issued the direction after Advocate General (A-G) Vijay Narayan submitted the Chengalpattu Collector’s report stating that the town panchayat could not burden visitors by levying parallel tax and therefore sharing of a portion of the collection by ASI could help in improving the facilities substantially.

The judges directed Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan to get instructions from the ASI by January 22. In the meantime, the Collector was ordered to find out the availability of non-governmental organisations and other volunteers who could assist the district administration and the local body in keeping the locality neat and clean.

The directions were issued on a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court on the basis of a letter written by Justice N. Kirubakaran last year to Justice Kothari when the latter was functioning as the Acting Chief Justice of the High Court until the incumbent Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi assumed office.

In his report, the Collector stated that Chengalpattu district was created after bifurcating Kancheepuram district with effect from November 29. The Mamallapuram Town Panchayat fell under Chengalpattu district. Thought it had ancient monuments and heritage sites only in two wards, the ASI declared four wards as heritage sites considering their proximity.

Any construction activity in those four wards were subject to scrutiny of the competent authorities. Despite mass encroachment drives conducted periodically to evict hawkers on roads and the pathway to the beach in Mamallapuram, they keep “resurfacing again and again as they have a strong patronage of tourists/visitors,” the Collector said.

Hence, discussions were on with the management of Sthalasayana Perumal Temple on accommodating about 40 vendors near the temple in order to keep the locality tidy and clean. Sensitisation programmes were also being conducted apart from engaging sufficient number of sanitary workers to clean the litter left behind by tourists, he said.

The panchayat had passed a resolution on April 6, 2017 to impose a fine of ₹1,000 on eateries, push carts, vegetable vendors and hawkers who litter public places, he added. In its report, the Municipal Administration department told the court that underground sewage system was created in Mamallapuram in 2016.

The court was told that on an average 2,000 tourists visit Mamallapuram on working days and that the number goes up to 10,000 on weekends.

395,2020/01/03,Homebuyer awarded ₹5.30 lakh compensation,"The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA), Chennai, has directed A.R.R.R. Constructions Chennai (P) Ltd. to pay a compensation of ₹5.30 lakh to a homebuyer for non-delivery of flat.

In their complaint, Sridhar Srinivasan and Subhasree Nangamangalam said they booked a flat developed by the builder in Nanganallur for ₹1.40 crore.

On July 8, 2013, they entered into a construction and sales agreement with the developer and paid ₹1.37 crore. As per the terms of the agreement, the builder was to complete and hand over possession of the flat within 12 months from the date of getting building plan approval.

In July 2015 the developer promised to deliver the flat within six months and in January 2017, he promised to hand it over by April 2017. He also agreed to pay a compensation of ₹20,000 per month till the delivery of flat, but the construction was not completed, the complaint said.

The developer said the project was developed on land less than 500 sq.m and the number of apartments was not more than eight. So it does not fall under the purview of the RERA Act and need not be registered. He also said 95% of the project was completed and that the realty business witnessed a downfall. However, G. Saravanan, Adjudicating Officer, TNRERA, noted that nowhere in the RERA Act was it mentioned that the Act was applicable only to registered projects.

396,2020/01/03,"Reconsider closure of Krishna Gate, VCK chief tells IIT","The IIT-Madras administration must reconsider the closure of its Krishna Gate on Gandhi Road, considering the concerns raised by students and residents of the area, said MP and VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Thursday.

After meeting IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Mr. Thirumavalavan said though the management highlighted security of female students as the key reason behind the gate’s closure, the students said the decision was against their interest and was implemented without prior information.

Similarly, he said the people of the locality, a majority of whom belonged to Scheduled Caste communities, had reported loss of livelihood. They had reported concerns over access to the campus for work and sending their children to schools located inside. “The area acquired for the creation of IIT-M included land taken from these people. They were assured of access to the campus at that time,” he said.

A woman working in housekeeping inside the campus said going to work was just a five-minute walk through the Krishna Gate. “My child uses the gate to go to Vanavani (Matriculation Higher Secondary) School inside. This was particularly helpful on days when my shift gets over in the night.

397,2020/01/03,"Kavalan app: personal safety at a click, but what about data?","In the wake of the rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad, the Kavalan SOS app of the Tamil Nadu Police has seen a huge jump in downloads. An intensive campaign conducted by the police across the State has also contributed to the spike.

The app is being promoted by the police especially amongst women and children. Anyone who feels vulnerable or threatened can press an alert button for police personnel to reach them at the earliest, they claim.

As on date, the number of downloads has touched 9.5 lakh. Post the Hyderabad incident and a promotional burst, an average of 10,000 people are reportedly downloading the app every day.

And, after filtering the test alerts, the State police control attends to 150-200 complaints from the alerts triggered by the Kavalan SOS app.

Data security

Some people have expressed apprehensions over the need to give the app access to personal details on the phone, and have even complained of difficulties in downloading the app/ accessing services. Mobile numbers of close relatives or friends and email IDs are collected while registering.

A.S. Fathima Muzaffer, a social worker, said, “Allowing access to phone calls and device location is not an issue for me. But recording audio, accessing storage, media files and accessing contacts — that seems to be intruding into the privacy of an individual.” Without allowing such access, it will not be possible to use the app at all, she added.

A technologist, who is closely associated with the back-end of the app, said this does pose a risk to privacy of the user and claimed that the data of the app is maintained by a private party.

“The registered person provides an alternative mobile number, location access, and address details. Hence, there is no need to ask for access to media files. If the download reaches 15 lakh to 20 lakh, it will become huge data and can be mined for various purposes. The app should be designed in such a way that the data is secure and there is no need to provide access to media or contact files,” he said.

Since the collection of information is for a specific purpose by a law enforcement agency, it would be exempt from privacy laws. “The department should have adequate measures in place to keep the information secure. Police department should have a data protection policy,” said Na.Vijayashankar, an expert in cyber law.

Chennai City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan said contact details of relatives or close friends as emergency numbers are optional and these are taken so that police personnel can alert them.

Fears allayed

“Moreover, all details collected will be stored in the secure server of the police department, which is handled by Technical Services. These details are collected only for the purpose of providing safety to citizens. The information is collected only for the purpose of reaching out or securing the person in distress.”

A senior police officer of Technical Services of Tamil Nadu Police clarified that no third party can access the information and there was no chance of misuse. “After collecting the details, we do not read any data on anybody’s mobile phone. Moreover, we are not collecting any background information,” he said.

He added that any technical glitches while downloading would be attended to duly and the application would be updated after receiving feedback from users.

Another officer said that in order to simplify the registration process, the app had been modified to support the latest Android version. The gathering of alternative numbers, email and work location had been done away with after users flagged privacy issues, he added.

Quick response

Once the person in distress triggers an alert, staff in the control room which is manned by a private firm receives a message and pass it on to police officers. The police locate the nearest patrol vehicle, police officer or police station to reach out to the victim.

The call centre staff also alert close relatives or family members if numbers are available.

During emergency, pressing the SOS button on the home page will automatically send the current location of the person in trouble along with a video to the Kavalan team.

Within a minute, the team will contact the person. Simultaneously, the location will also be sent to pre-registered emergency contacts as SMS alerts.

Shahnawaz Khan, Director of AMTEX, which handles the software and call centre support for the app, said, “We cannot go beyond a limit while invoking privacy. The details we ask for are absolutely for people’s own safety. All these details are stored in a very secure server. People are sharing everything on Facebook and Instagram these days. When it comes to safety, we need to be a little more cooperative.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/3d8wwm/article30467990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31octmalskns2GU46LBS3P3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kavalan-app-personal-safety-at-a-click-but-what-about-data/article30464558.ece
398,2020/01/03,In the ruins of unilateralism,"If one looks for an overarching theme that defined global politics in 2019, one might settle for protests. Angry crowds, especially the youth, revolted against the establishment in several parts of the world — from Santiago to Hong Kong, Beirut and New Delhi. But the year also saw some defining trends in geopolitics as well such as China’s growing assertiveness both in trade and foreign policy, Iran’s dangerously aggressive, yet calculated, behaviour, and the rise of Turkey as a new power pole in West Asia. The most important of them all, however, was the relative decline in America’s power, which was manifested through a number of crises during the year.

The U.S. is the world’s mightiest military power and arguably the centre of the post-Soviet world order. In the 1990s, the U.S.’s dominance was at its peak with international and multilateral organisations getting overshadowed by its pre-eminence. In 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, it got international support for its war in Afghanistan. In 2003, the U.S. went ahead with the plan to bomb Iraq despite the UN opposition, reminding the world of imperial invasions. But the global situation is different, and more complex today.

The Afghan experience

Changes under way over the past decade picked up pace in 2019, showing cracks in the post-Soviet order. At least three developments in 2019 suggested that the U.S.’s ability to shape global politics is clearly receding.

The U.S. went to Afghanistan in October 2001, with a vow to destroy al-Qaeda and topple the Taliban regime. Seventeen years later, the U.S., desperate to get out of a stalemated conflict, started direct negotiations with the Taliban. The talks almost led to a settlement last year, with both sides agreeing to a draft agreement under which the U.S. would pull out most of its troops from Afghanistan in return for assurances from the Taliban that it would not allow Afghan soil to be used by transnational terrorists. The agreement, however, was not signed as President Donald Trump cancelled the peace process in September after an American soldier was killed in a Taliban attack. A few weeks later, Mr. Trump resumed the talks.

The whole Afghan experience shows how the U.S. botched up the war. The U.S. has a superior hand in conventional warfare. But winning a war abroad is not just about toppling a hostile regime, but also about stabilising the country after the regime is toppled. The U.S., history shows, is good at the former but fares poorly in the latter. It is now left with no other option but to reach an agreement with the Taliban for a face-saving exit. That would leave Kabul’s fragile, faction-ridden government exposed to the Taliban insurgency, just like the Mohammed Najibullah government was left to the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 after the Soviet withdrawal. The Soviet Union disintegrated in two years, and Najibullah’s government collapsed after a few months.

The Iran stand-off

The latest spell in the U.S.-Iran tensions was triggered by President Trump’s unilateral decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. Mr. Trump’s plan was to put “maximum pressure” on Iran through sanctions and force Tehran to renegotiate the nuclear deal. But Iran countered it through “maximum resistance”, instead of giving in.

The year 2019 saw Iran repeatedly provoking the U.S. and its allies. It shot down an American drone over the Gulf in June, captured a British tanker in July and is believed to have either carried out or orchestrated multiple attacks on oil tankers that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that connects the oil-rich Gulf with the Arabian Sea through the Gulf of Oman. In September, two Saudi oil facilities came under attack, which temporarily cut the kingdom’s oil output by half. Iran was blamed for the attacks.

The attacks on Saudi facilities challenged the post-war partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that guaranteed American protection to the kingdom. Still, the only counter-measure the U.S. took in response to Iran’s growing provocations was imposing more sanctions. One can argue that the U.S.’s subdued response doesn’t have anything to do with a decline in its power but is rather due to the reluctance of the sitting President to launch new wars. Even if one buys this argument, the question remains: why is Mr. Trump reluctant to launch new wars? The answer, perhaps, is the wars the U.S. launched in the new century, be it Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya, were not won. Sections in Washington don’t want the U.S. to get stuck in another long-drawn conflict in West Asia. Here, the U.S.’s inability to shape outcomes of the wars it launches is acting as a deterrent against its own war machines.

Cracks in the NATO

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Cold War alliance that was formed as a counterweight to the Soviet Union, continued to act as a vehicle of Western military dominance under the leadership of the U.S. in the post-Soviet order. The alliance has come under pressure in recent years with the rise of nationalist-populist leaders, including Mr. Trump, who have a favourable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin and are critical of NATO. These contradictions sharpened in 2019, suggesting that there are growing cracks in the alliance. In October, Turkey invaded northeastern Syria’s Kurdish held-territories, which had housed U.S. troops during the war against the Islamic State. Ankara practically forced the Trump administration to pull back troops from the areas before it started air strikes. The U.S. was relegated to the role of a spectator when a determined Turkey first captured some towns on the border and then struck a deal with Russia to create a buffer between Turkey and the Kurdish-held territories of Syria, which will be manned by Russian and Turkish troops.

But the biggest crisis emerged when Turkey, the second largest military in NATO, purchased S-400 missile defence system from Russia, NATO’s primary enemy and the main geopolitical rival of the U.S., despite protests from the West. The U.S. expelled Turkey from the F-35 stealth fighter programme and has threatened to impose sanctions for the deal. It says Russia could use the system radars to spy on the F-35 jets. Turkey didn’t give in. It now says it could buy Su-57 jets from Russia if the U.S. does not lift the ban on F-35 sales. Moreover, in response to sanctions threats, Turkey has vowed to shut two U.S. bases in the country, which would mean a split within NATO.

These incidents do not mean that the U.S.’s dominance over global politics is over. But they do show that America’s long wars and its inability to shape post-war outcomes are impacting its stature in an international system that centres around it. If one translates Immanuel Wallerstein’s world systems theory into geopolitics, the U.S., the core of the strategic world system, is facing revolts in the periphery. If in the 1990s and early 2000s, the periphery continued to be dependent on the core and thereby sustained what Wallerstein called the “unequal exchange” between the two, the sands are shifting now. And this is happening at a time when new economic powers (China, for example) are on the rise and an old military power (Russia) is making a comeback. The relative decline in America’s power coupled with the rise of new and old powers point to a structural churning in the post-Cold War order. In the world system, the core has never been static. Hegemony of a single power is temporary.

399,2020/01/03,Lander in a hurry?,"Chandrayaan-2 cost a whopping ₹978 crore and, with the crash landing of Vikram, the entire project turned out to be a waste of not only the hard-earned money of the taxpayers but also the effort of the space scientists (“Vikram was not designed to handle large spike in speed,” Jan. 02). Now, when ISRO is planning another moon mission, it is shocking to learn from the organisation’s chairman K. Sivan that Vikram lander crashed on the moon because the navigation control and guidance mechanism in the penultimate phase was not designed to handle the large spike in speed that developed in the last 3-5 minutes of its descent and that they have now corrected this problem in the new modules of Chandrayan-3. Does this mean that the earlier mission was undertaken on a trial and error basis and that the ISRO team had not done their homework properly before the launch? While admitting that they have learnt their lessons from the failure, Mr. Sivan has contradicted his own statement by denying that Chandrayaan-2 was launched without doing thorough tests. One also wants to know the reasons why ISRO had to launch such a huge and prestigious lunar mission at an astronomical cost in such a great hurry, even before conducting thorough tests.

400,2020/01/03,Dream 2020 shattered,"The dream of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam that India should become a superpower by 2020 stands shattered now due to the wrong policies of the ruling dispensation like demonetisation, the haphazard manner in which the GST was implemented and the mounting NPAs in public sector banks that have brought an unprecedented economic slowdown in the country. Added to this, the agrarian distress, steep downward trend in industrial growth and manufacturing sector leading to severe unemployment problems have caused an economic havoc in the country. The downslide in the GDP and the uptrend in inflation have left the country in chaos and confusion. Moves of the government like the CAA and the NRC have caused national unrest and protests by the people from all walks of life who have accused the government of dividing the country in the name of religion and blatantly violating the constitutional provisions and tearing the democratic and secular fabric of the nation.

401,2020/01/03,NPR project,"The clarifications given by the Union Home Ministry that no person needs to submit any documents during house-to-house enumeration for updating National Population Register and that the information provided by individuals would be accepted and recorded are quite contrary to what is stated in National Population Register (NPR) manual. (“No documents need to be produced for NPR: Ministry,” Jan. 2). The manual clearly states that the government has decided to update the existing NPR database by verifying the details collected by the enumerators after house to house survey, including the details of Aadhaar card number, mobile number, voter identification card number, passport number, and driving licence number. The details of the birth place of father and mother are also stated to be included in an additional column. When the existing database is going to be updated for NPR, the Ministry’s statement that no documents would be required to be produced, is amusing. From the above, it is very clear that the updated information collected for NPR would form the basis for National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise. The government is trying to implement NRC exercise through backdoor method, in spite of the Prime Minister’s assertion that an NRC is not on the table. To gain the confidence of the people, the government should be transparent in its actions, and not mysterious, in its dealings.

403,2020/01/03,Diplomatic capital,"One of the prime achievements of the Indian democracy is its friendly and peaceful relations with other nations despite the hostility of some of them towards India. In this regard, the contributions of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru cannot be ignored. It is really intriguing that Mr. Modi, who initially invested so much efforts in reaching out to world leaders, is prepared to antagonise them all with highly regressive laws like the CAA which his government later justifies as ‘internal affairs’. (Editorial page, “The new worry of depleting diplomatic capital,” Jan. 2). India’s earlier policies of ‘panchsheel’ and non-alignment, though framed for the Cold War era, are as important now as before.

If Pakistan alone is opposing certain things happening in India, it can be brushed aside easily. However, now the situation seems to be somewhat different, as even lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. are voicing their concerns to varying degrees, the latest one being about CAA, and this cannot be brushed aside easily. Consequently, how far and how long Indian diplomatic machinery need to work for effective damage control is unpredictable. It is the time for doing some serious cost-benefit analysis, in the context of external affairs, of pursuing certain myopic agendas — leaving aside the constitutional validity of CAA.

He seems to forget that the resolution sponsored by him and passed by the Kerala Assembly against the CAA not only breached constitutional propriety, it openly challenged the Central government’s right to legislate on a subject that came under the Union List. Equally provocative and politically incorrect was his assertion that Kerala will not implement the CAA. One cannot simultaneously pontificate about constitutional values and openly defy a law approved by Parliament.

Federalism is a two-way street. It thrives on reciprocity and mutual respect between the Central government and the States. Ideological opposition cannot be an excuse to undermine the delicate balance of power between the Union government and the State governments. Kerala has only two choices in respect of the CAA — either peacefully protest or seek a judicial remedy. Anything else is avoidable brinkmanship.

405,2020/01/03,Right to protest,"Protests are an ‘essential dimension’ of mankind. In fact, they are intrinsic to human existence. To put it in a familiar idiom, the history of mankind is a history of protests. Humans protest not just as individuals but as groups, communities and nations. They usually protest against something they perceive or believe to be harmful to them. The ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act seem to be the most significant in post-independent India. They have come as a bolt from the blue to the government that mistook its election victories as a licence to reshape the country to its will. The rightness of the cause — India’s continued existence as a secular and pluralist democracy — has thwarted the attempts by some to give the protests a communal colour, lamentably with the aid of sections of the media. Humanitarianism underlies these animated protests (“An anatomy of anti-CAA protests,” Jan. 1).

G. David Milton,

Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu

The CAA was introduced as if it wasn’t going to adversely affect the Muslim community. Concurrently, the BJP government kept insisting that CAA should be linked to NRC. Perhaps, the Centre wouldn’t have anticipated that the protests would quickly escalate and fire up across India. These rallies only underline the anti-Constitution attitude of the Narendra Modi government. There is little doubt that the CAA has been intentionally introduced to sidetrack people from real issues, particularly the severe economic slowdown. The civil society, rightly so, is posing fundamental questions about India’s political existence as a constitutional democracy. Indeed, this assertion of the civil society is going to determine the political fate of India in the near future.

R. Sivakumar,

The CAA was drafted with the good intention of helping helpless minorities in the neighbouring nations where they were ill-treated. The media, which has been extremely critical of the Act, should recognise that there is a huge section of India’s silent majority getting disappointed by these rallies and the undue coverage given to them.

406,2020/01/03,"‘Richard Jewell’ movie review: This Clint Eastwood-directorial is flawed, but fierce","Security guard Richard Jewell is unwaveringly kind. Aspiring for a career in law enforcement, the 33-year-old overweight Atlanta native hands out free water to a pregnant woman and his colleagues at a concert; he’s always kind to his mother, hugging her as they enjoy a Kenny Rogers performance; keeps a man’s drawer stocked with Snickers so he won’t go hungry; and holds the law and its executors in the highest regard. Jewell is also peculiar: he hasn’t paid his taxes in a couple of years; collects an astounding number of guns to hunt; likens his security guard position to actual police work, taking it too seriously even out of jurisdictional boundaries. The popular opinion is that he’s odd. It doesn’t help when teenagers cruelly mock him with taunts of ‘lard and order’ and the Pillsbury doughboy.

In Richard Jewell, Clint Eastwood pans out a stirring narrative of an ordinary man whose compassion and generosity are horribly exploited by those in power on mere suspicion. It’s an ugly albeit metaphor for real-life where anyone cut from a slightly different mould is egregiously labelled. The audience gets a front seat to the trials and tribulations the real-life hero who saved several lives by calling attention to a bomb at the July 27 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996. Portrayed by comedian and actor, Paul Walter Hauser, Jewell’s life plummets into despair when he’s accused by the FBI of planting the bomb himself. As Jewell’s lone fight and his steady belief in the law crumbles, the consequences pile-up. A man’s life is shattered and so is the willingness of any other ordinary citizen to do the right thing. Eastwood’s direction, bordering on activism on behalf of Jewell, effectively does what it’s supposed to.

Richard Jewell Director: Clint Eastwood

Cast: Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, Olivia Wilde

Storyline: Richard Jewell spotted a bomb during a concert at the Centennial Olympic Park but now the FBI has targeted him as their primary suspect

But in persevering towards that lone focus, the director delegitimises his film’s primary antagonists. FBI agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm), a fictionalised character, unlawfully manipulates his suspect’s naiveté and trust with methods that are honestly unbelievable. But perhaps worst of all, is the portrayal of Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde), a ruthlessly ambitious journalist who breaks the story of the FBI’s investigation into Jewell. Insulting of her fellow female colleagues, disparaging their work and using sex as a means to get a scoop is a lazy and awful sexist characterisation that shouldn’t exist in this day and age. Especially when the facts pertaining to her acquisition of the information aren’t available and Scruggs, who has passed away, cannot defend herself. If calling out the corruption of institutions was meant to be a political statement for Eastwood, it’s failed miserably. The shockingly uni-dimensional and prejudiced depiction is frightening in how easily it can influence vulnerable sensibilities.

In spite of Richard Jewell’s glaring flaws, Eastwood’s mastery cannot be denied when he extracts brilliant delivery from every actor on screen. A highlight is Kathy Bates as the protagonist’s suffering mother, her son’s champion and rock. But it’s Walter Hauser’s breakout performance that dominates from start to finish, overpowering the film’s shortcomings.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/2he0k6/article30471405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4bm-pg2-Richard-Jewell,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/richard-jewell-movie-review-this-clint-eastwood-directorial-is-flawed-but-fierce/article30471406.ece

Cast: James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen,Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, Francesca Hayward

Storyline: An abandoned cat finds a new life among magical alley cats

Run time: 109.59 minutes

They are half-cat and half-human with human bodies and hands and feet instead of paws and claws. And so when they meeow and purr or do cat stuff like rub their heads, it comes across as plain weird. I am sure Eliot at the height of his surrealist self would not have imagined such a vision for his poems — those were definitely not pearls that were his eyes.

It is also thanks to the human bodies that the scale does not work. The gigantic car, the fire hydrant or railway sleepers when shown in close-up (for some strange reason there are very few long shots) make your brain bend over backwards trying to get a handle on human cats among gigantic props.

What works in the movie is the soundtrack. One cannot but help sing and tap dance with the Skimbleshanks, The Railway Cat and be carried along a wave of melody on Grizabella’s Memory. Also, full marks to the cast for gamely trying to slink around, spit and hiss at each other. That is an Oscar-worthy performance for sure.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/63vzoo/article30471092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILM-BOXOFFICE-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/cats-movie-review-not-completely-hideous-as-the-songs-and-acting-rescue-this-cgi-mess/article30471093.ece
408,2020/01/03,‘Bombshell’ movie review: The claustrophobia of workplace toxicity,"In a television newsroom — with an obsession with ratings, high-pressure turnovers and demanding deadlines — toxic work culture is inevitable. “TV is a visual medium,” is an almost daily — if not an hourly — reminder by screeching editors to anyone who may dare to prioritise substance over imagery. When the sleazy and powerful CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was fired for sexual harassment in 2016, repeatedly uses the same line in Bombshell in the guise of boosting business (“viewers want more legs”), it cuts deep. The atmosphere of internalised sexism, vanity and ‘it is what it is’ attitude, not only forms a fertile ground for sexual harassment but also sets a precedent for silence, under the garb of ‘accepted work culture’. Bombshell aptly demonstrates how these micro-aggressions are not just alarm bells but problems in themselves.

Beginning in a sprightly tone and periodically breaking the fourth wall, the film is told through the perspective of the women, mainly celebrity anchor Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Miss America-turned-anchor Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and a fictional young, self-proclaimed evangelical millennial Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie). While Kelly and Carlson are both powerful yet problematic, Pospisil is shown as the classic ‘victim’, shouldering the film’s most unflinching scene of sexual abuse. Even though Pospisil rebukes Kelly for keeping silent all these years and contributing to the normalisation of workplace sexual abuse, the film doesn’t pit ‘old’ feminism against ‘new’. It maintains a tone of solidarity, bringing out the sheer helplessness that governs even someone as powerful and ambitious as Kelly.

Bombshell Director: Jay Roach

Cast: Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon, Connie Britton, Malcolm McDowell, Allison Janney

Storyline: After television anchor, Gretchen Carlson accuses CEO of Fox News Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, it is upon other women at the network to bring him down

In American broadcast universe, Kelly has been a contentious presence, known for her white Santa remarks and taking on Donald Trump, but the film is unable to bring out her complexity. The focus boils down to ‘will she or won’t she turn against Ailes’ and simplifies her journey towards arriving at that position. “I’m either damned for doing it or damned for not doing it sooner,” she says, which is emblematic of several powerful women who faced a similar dilemma during the #MeToo movement in 2017. The film is understanding of that, and doesn’t vilify those women who arrived at their rebellion much later than the others. It successfully recreates a claustrophobic atmosphere that bred helplessness right before the #MeToo movement hit America, and the subsequent jubilation of some white women who managed to liberate themselves at Fox News.

But the film leaves a lot to be desired, particularly when it begins to unravel the power, dichotomy and hypocrisy of Fox News in supporting Donald Trump. There are systemic sexism and deep-rooted conservatism in the television channel, yet the film doesn’t fully articulate the complexities of the enterprise, those who have been complicit and the role of the Murdochs. In the end credits, the film informs us that Ailes’ severance package was much higher than the monetary compensation given to all the women combined. But when it comes to depicting that in the narrative itself, the film gives an easy way out to Rupert Murdoch, almost as if the makers were afraid of backlash from the tycoon. The messaging of the film, thus, filters down to a simple and known one, while Fox News is a much more devious entity, where business meets power meets political conservatism meets misogyny. Throw in a Trump, and there’s a lot more food for thought.

But in the limited terrain that the film explores, it does an exemplary job, mostly owing to its actors. Kidman, although sidelined eventually, is most memorable in a scene sans make-up, while Theron slips in effortlessly into the body language and tone of Kelly. Your heart goes out to a fragile Robbie, and Lithgow earns all the rebuke and hatred, despite the rather comical prosthetic double-chin. Kate Mckinnon, as Robbie’s lesbian friend, is merely a yardstick for discrimination and is mostly underutilised.

For the current times to adequately percolate into the arts, it often takes a long time, even decade sometimes. Bombshell couldn’t afford the luxury of hindsight, yet it isn’t confused about the present. It takes a stand with empathy. But it understandably does fall short of the complexity that time brings, when you look back and start connecting more dots, once the water has passed under the bridge.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/e6yukm/article30469242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bombshell,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/bombshell-movie-review-the-claustrophobia-of-workplace-toxicity/article30469243.ece

Doodh jalebi

at Makhan Lal Tika Ram, Bara Bazar Kashmiri Gate

This is an old, old tradition of Delhi and its neighbouring states. A delicious concoction best enjoyed in winter. You will find milk being thickened in a huge kadhai. One of the assistants in the shop will place a juicy jalebi in a tall glass, and then fill it with the creamy, unsweetened milk. A long spoon will help you negotiate the jalebi. Spoon it out with the milk and slurp it down, to keep warm on a cold day.

When the weather is still cold, savour some hot bedmi served with a dish of spicy potatoes and chholey and a piece of tart pickle. On Sundays, it comes with a special pumpkin dish. Bedmi is a crispy and deep-fried, puffed bread, stuffed with a lentil paste. Nagori halwa is another great breakfast dish, comprising a small disc, like a puri, with a helping of rich halwa placed within it. Pop it into your mouth, and you will taste ambrosia.

Chicken sandwiches

at Novelty Dairy and Stores, Birbal Road, Jangpura

Some of the best sandwiches – with chicken, ham, tuna or vegetables – can be found in this Pop Tate-like store in central-south Delhi. The bread is soft and white, and the stuffing comes with a light mayo dressing that adds to its taste. There is also green chutney on the side, if you like to add some zing to your sandwiches.

May

Chhole bhature

Baba Nagpal, Gupta Market, Lajpat Nagar IV

You get chhole bhature across Delhi, but some places are special. Baba Nagpal is one of them. His chholey has the perfect mix of spices, and it is neither too oily nor too dry. The bhatures again are wonderfully soft, and you can make a full meal out of a plate of chholey bhaturey, served with pickled amla on the side. Tear off a bit of a bhatura, wrap it around some chholey and then bite into it, along with a small piece of the amla. Aah!

June

Rabri falooda

Much before Giani became a neighbourhood name for all kinds of ice cream, it was known for its rabri falooda. Even now, die-hard fans land up here for this great dessert apt for hot summer months. In a glass, Giani’s army of men add some falooda and ice, and then top it with thick and creamy rabri full of nuts. The rabri falooda washes away the pre-rain, summer blues.

July

Samosa

at Duggal snacks, Pocket B Market, Mayur Vihar Phase 2

Duggal used to run a small stall from the interiors of a residential pocket in the neighbourhood, and there was such a queue in front of the shop that he moved to the main market area some years ago. His samosa is freshly made, deep fried in a manner that it leaves no oil on the surface, and has a delicious potato filling. Just right for a rainy evening.

August

Fruit sandwiches

at Jain Coffee House, Raghuganj, Chawri Bazar

Jain sa’ab serves the best and the most imaginative sandwiches, filled with sliced apples or pomegranate seeds, or even mangoes and bananas. He places the fruit in between two buttered slices and sprinkles a 'fruit powder' on top of the fruit. His malai sandwiches bring back your faith in humanity.

September

Fish pakora

Hurray for months with the letter ‘r’ in them when even those who refuse to eat fish in warm weather (May to August) ask for it. Stop at Paramjeet’s for sole, singara, surmai and pomfret. You get fish pakora and tandoori fish here, and it is, in one word, superb. Or, in two words, simply superb.

October

With the advent of the festive season, the soul yearns for something sweet. Bade Mian’s kheer is cooked overnight in his kitchen, and then left to cool, before being brought to the shop. The kheer is as thick as half a directory, and has a pleasant light pink colour and a smoky flavour infused by the wood fire it’s been cooked on. It is a kheer like no other.

November

Mutton curry

at Z Corner, 28/14, East Patel Nagar Market

Have some rich and spicy mutton cooked with dollops of desi ghee in a minced meat or keema curry. It is hot and spicy, and just what the weather ordered. The keema is finely minced and the mutton pieces are nicely tender. The dish is served with free rotis, and you can have as many as you want. You will be left licking your fingers clean.

December

Tikke

at Talib kabab corner, Zakir Nagar Main Market

There are quite a few outlets serving delectable food in this part of town, and Talib is one of them. His buff tikke are out of this world. The pieces are soft, and so juicy that once you finish, you are left with a plate of spice-infused sauce that you can happily lick up. The tikka are just right for a cold winter’s night.

410,2020/01/03,Ctrl+alt+delete meat: Where do you stand on plant-based protein?,"Barima, my paternal grandmother, had a penchant for things that were not as they seemed. Naqli (fake) omelette was a fixture on her breakfast table. Made to look and taste exactly like the real deal, it was a pancake of gram flour, mixed with milk, broken-up bread, chopped green chillies and onions that could put any masala omelette to shame.

Another family special was mock fish made with plantain cut to resemble fillets, seasoned with carom and fenugreek. Sometimes, there was kaleji ki subzi, vegetarian liver akin to dhoka (literally “falsehood”), the no-onion-no-garlic Bengali delicacy. And the dinner table often saw kathal ki tahiri — a mock version of goat meat yakhni pulao, one of the most popular dishes of the Kayasth community. In short, my grandmother would hardly have been surprised by all the wonder products flooding the global market today, from Burger King’s Impossible burgers to Beyond Meat’s many sausages and steaks, and the jackfruit and pea protein offerings being conjured up in labs for the benefit of those who want the taste of meat while staying staunchly vegetarian.

Woke to the mock

As we step into a new decade, this whole sector of vegetarian/vegan meats is poised to surge. According to the US market research firm Reports and Data, the global plant-based meat market, which was valued at $10.10 billion in 2018, is expected to reach $30.92 billion by 2026, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.8%. This huge interest is thanks to rising global awareness against ecological and health fallouts of heavy meat diets. Silvia Annavini, a 30-year-old wine consultant in Rome, tells me that she buys a lot of plant-based meat products because she wants to keep cholesterol in check. “Even more than the US, they are a big trend here because awareness of food in Italy is quite high. I now buy tempeh burgers, tofu cotoletta and so on, which are easy to cook, healthier, and taste and feel exactly like meat,” she says.

Just like Barima’s dishes, products like tempeh, a fermented soy product, and tofu have traditionally been used as mock meats in various Buddhist cultures. Europe and America are beginning to discover this ‘new’ use now. Similarly, jackfruit and pea protein (similar to our dals), used in different communities to make mock meats, are now being claimed by makers of vegetarian meats as novelty, to create products that seem as close to real as possible — including steak which when cut has mock blood oozing out!

Ground meat from Impossible Foods

Broader repercussions

Globally, the reasons for such overwhelming interest in plant-based meats are twofold: health and environment. There is a growing movement pitching vegetarian/vegan diets as healthier than meat (or animal products) centric ones, an argument that we will examine later.

Secondly, the meat industry is seen as harmful for the environment, contributing to deforestation, methane emission, water pollution and more. While opinion is still divided on methods of calculating the impact — and whether it is one of the prime factors contributing to the “current sixth mass extinction”, as some influential studies have pitched — the path-breaking 2006 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations does state that “the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems... Globally, it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity”.

An influential 2010 study on water scarcity by Water FootprintNetwork also tabulated that while vegetables had a water footprint of about 322 litres per kg, chicken had 4,325 l/kg, sheep/goat meat 8,763 l/kg, and beef a stupendous 15,415 l/kg (though nuts came in at 9,063 l/kg, too).

The Indian scenario

But apart from these prime drivers, does India make for a viable market, both for the international biggies such as Tyson, Smithfield, Perdue, Hormel and Nestlé, and the slew of Indian start-ups that are floating indigenous alternatives?

Karan Bajaj, co-founder of a brand called Better that is soon to launch in Mumbai and Pune, talks about how the company is launching with two product ranges.

This would be dairy-free cheese spreads and jackfruit-based ready-to-cook curries. He sees immense potential for innovation as well as finding a market. “Our target audience is not limited to just vegans or vegetarians, but just about everyone who is interested in healthier eating,” he says. Better is betting on health as a USP.

Better Food’s tandoori ‘chicken’

Then, there are ventures like EVO, which are at a concept stage still and aim to develop egg dishes with lentil protein. Shraddha Bhansali, who runs Candy & Green, a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Mumbai, started EVO six months ago. “Our first product is a liquid egg substitute. It has the same taste, texture and protein content as an egg, but without the cholesterol, risk of salmonella or antibiotics,” she says.

Bhansali believes vegan eggs will do well in India as they are a great “gateway product” — the Indian market views eggs in a grey area, as being vegetarian and non-vegetarian. However, she tells me candidly about the challenges facing mock meats here. “[When] we serve them at the restaurant, we see that vegetarians are put off by it and non-vegetarians would rather not eat fake meat. Our largest clientele is non-vegetarians who’ve turned vegan, which isn’t a big enough market yet,” she says. Yet, Bhansali hopes the segment will grow.

There are others like Vezley or GoodDo (with food trucks and outlets in Mumbai, Udaipur and Jaipur) that use soy as an ingredient. All pitch themselves as vegan companies. This is unlike many American companies like Impossible Foods, who’ve said that, in reality, they are not targeting the miniscule vegan population (pegged at 3% in the US, according to a 2018 Gallup poll) but the growing number of flexitarians (people who want less meat in their diets).

Chef Dhruv Oberoi of Delhi’s Olive Bar and Kitchen

Not the vegetarian choice

Let us examine the market dynamics in India. With more than 30% vegetarians (as opposed to the roughly 10% global average), and more who are selectively non-vegetarian (certain meats, certain weekdays, et al), vegetarians are an obvious target group. Some chefs I spoke to claim that these alternatives will do quite well in India. “I’ve been importing, preparing and selling these products at my restaurants to good response and the demand will be huge in the coming years,” says Varun Tuli, one of India’s top wedding caterers, who runs the Asian casual dining chain, Yum Yum Cha. Other observers add that some early examples of these dishes are doing well in colleges and work campuses in cities like Bengaluru.

Vegan’s pick Upscale restaurants that cater to the niche vegan segment are increasingly adding interesting options on their menus. At Delhi’s Olive Bar and Kitchen, chef Dhruv Oberoi uses jackfruit instead of pulled meats, a gluten steak packed with natural salts like seaweed, and so on. His gluten steak may in fact be quite akin to the chakki ki subzi Marwari grandmothers traditionally cooked, washing little bits of wheat dough under running water till only the gluten remained. This would then be roasted or fried, slathered in masala, and passed off as a meat treat. There are other experiments, too, such as “tapioca flour kneaded into fried dough balls” to prepare vegetarian food with umami and a “meaty texture”. However, chefs like Oberoi are clear that they want to prepare things from scratch instead of using processed foods. “Vegan is the current fad, but we should not forget that India has always been vegan,” he points out, and rightly so.

Many others, however, disagree. “My instinct is that it will not work. Vegetarians in India do not have a taste for meat; non vegetarians who want to cut down on meat are the target,” says Asma Khan of the UK-based Indian restaurant, Darjeeling Express. Chef Prateek Sadhu of Masque in Mumbai says 40% of his guests are vegetarian and he has, in fact, launched an exclusive all-vegetarian menu, which includes exotic and experimental dishes inspired by the flavours of Kashmir, including morels, chestnuts and onions in a broth of smoked yakhni made with sweet potatoes.

Sadhu points out that it is only quick service and mid-level restaurants in Southeast Asia and America who are using plant-based meat products. In India, the dining culture is different because even if an Indian is non-vegetarian, vegetables are a huge part of his or her meals. “Our meat alternatives are vegetables in their purest form,” he says.

Karan Tanna, founder Ghost Kitchens Pvt Ltd, a start-up into the cloud kitchen space, says he feels the market for plant-based meats in India is “too niche and already very cluttered. I’m not bullish about a single company riding this unless it has deep pockets to retain first mover position for a number of years,” he says.

Aside from this, points to ponder may be that we already have indigenous traditions of mock meats and a diet that is more carbohydrate and plant-based, even for meat eaters (potatoes in biryani, rice with fish curry, appam with chicken stew). So, health or even environment as a concern may not hold water. After all, if you are importing processed plant meats how valid can either be?",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/gwsun2/article30471583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/the-impossible-burger-raw-FT-BLOG0717-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ctrlaltdelete-meat-where-do-you-stand-on-plant-based-protein/article30471584.ece
411,2020/01/03,Suntory’s Shinji Fukuyo brings his expertise to India,"The first time I truly enjoyed a Japanese whisky was in 2009. Ironically, on a visit to Scotland, I was offered a dram of Yamazaki 10-Year-Old. The nose was charming (light spice with vanilla), the balance perfect, and my ‘love affair’ with Japanese whisky began.

Over the years, I’ve followed every new launch and distillery collection. So, it was a pleasure to learn that Beam Suntory, a subsidiary of Suntory Spirits Limited, one of the world’s largest spirits companies, recently launched the House of Suntory in India. It brought down the Yamazaki Distiller’s Reserve single malt, the Hibiki Japanese Harmony whisky, and a Japanese craft gin, Roku. The whiskies will retail at select stores for around ₹20,000 a bottle.

The Yamazaki Distiller’s Reserve single malt, part of the House of Suntory launch

The headline maker Fukuyo joined Suntory in 1983, as a scientific staff at the Hakushu distillery. His work in production and whisky research (including a two-year stint at Scotland’s prestigious Heriot-Watt University) saw him rise up the ranks, till, in 2014, he was appointed Executive Officer. In 2018, he was also appointed to the Whisky Quality Advisor of Beam Suntory Inc. He has blended such beauties as the Yamazaki Sherry cask, Hakushu Distiller’s Reserve and the Hibiki 21-Year-Old, which was awarded the Best Blended Whisky for a record sixth time at the World Whiskies Awards last year.

One of the highlights, however, was the unveiling of two made-for-India blends, OakSmith and OakSmith Gold. Shinji Fukuyo, the Chief Blender — responsible for the seven million cases of whiskey released from Suntory Distilleries — put a lot of research into the scotch and bourbon blends, including five trips to the country in 2019, to understand the Indian palate. As the 58-year-old told Business Today, “I tasted local whiskeys and drew from consumer research… I found Indians drink whiskey with water and soda; they dilute it to lower the alcohol content. But they still need good aroma.”

Even as Suntory promises more age statements soon (we’d like the Yamazaki 12-, 18- and 25-Year-Olds, for starters), I sit down with Fukuyo to understand his Suntory story better.

Whisky on your mind?

“One of my mentors said ‘you should think of whisky all the time’ to get the finest results. I follow that. I’m constantly creating new experiments in the distillery and challenging myself [to create] new products. I also work with my colleagues on new ideas and concepts based on customer preferences, [constantly] monitor evolving palates and assess the market. My role is to coordinate all areas and ensure all teams work together.”

Shinji Fukuyo demonstrates how he examines whisky at the Suntory distillery in Yamazaki, near Kyoto. “What’s important for whisky is that its deliciousness must deepen with aging, sitting in the casks for a long time,” he says | Photo Credit: AP Photo/Koji Ueda

The OakSmith range Rich on the nose, with a bright, smooth and unexpectedly long finish, OakSmith is categorised as an Indian made foreign liquor. Fukuyo says you can enjoy it “Indian-style”, with water and soda, or even with Coke. Retailing in Maharashtra and Telangana for ₹800 and ₹1,300 (OakSmith Gold), and ₹600 and ₹900 (OakSmith).

Creating the flavour profile?

“It lies in understanding the entire making process — from the quality of the water, the right grain, fermentation, casks and distillation. Personally, I start with the nose of the whisky and then work backwards to create the flavour profile. My travels across the world, and what I see, hear and taste, help me explore a variety of profiles. Blending spirits is about creating a harmonious flavour, by weaving culture and tradition along with one’s own form of self-expression. It is an art in itself.”

Is 2020 about sharing?

“In 2019, we released the Ao whisky, featuring whiskies from Japan, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and USA. [We realised that the Suntory production system can be good for other groups, so we’re sharing methods.] Based on its success, Suntory will now look at including more styles and countries. Craft distillation is catching up and craft whiskies — known for quality, new products and a personal connection with the customers — will only gain in popularity.”

Japanese craft gin, Roku, which was launched in India recently

Secret to the Highball?

“Mixology is not my core area, but I feel that it is really catching up. There are some good bartenders out there who are using new techniques and ingredients. It will be interesting to work on blends for new-age cocktails. Personally, I enjoy the Highball; I find it well-balanced, not very sweet or heavy. I’d give it a twist by adding the [Suntory] Yuzu, which will add a touch of citrus to it.”

Finding inspiration?

“I regularly nose hundreds of samples to understand the taste consistency of various whisky brands and to create new products. I also get inspiration from Japan’s seasons and try to develop blends based on nature. To do a blender’s job well, you need all your five senses, but mainly your tongue and nose. [Fukuyo is up every morning at 4 am to run because he believes one must follow a strict routine to keep one’s senses sharp.] I also try to balance travel, new projects and time in the distillery.”

412,2020/01/03,Is meatless meat good for your health?,"In Udaipur, among the many mutton biryani and tandoor stalls at Shobhagpura Circle, a white-and-green food truck attracts crowds for its vegan ‘chicken’ hakka noodles and tikkas. Gudduz, a venture by GoodDot — and number two on Lonely Planet’s 2019 list of the world’s Top 10 vegan food trucks — is part of a four-year endeavour to popularise plant-based products that look and taste like meat. “Our kiosk at Mumbai’s Colaba is a stone’s throw from Bademiya [known for its kebabs] and Leopold Cafe. It is great to be validated by meat eaters in areas popular for their non-vegetarian fare,” says Abhishek Sinha, CEO and co-founder, explaining, “Plant-based meats are healthier as they are high on protein, and free from antibiotics and growth hormones.”

Meanwhile, down South, every time Chennai-based Shakthi Girish returns from a trip to the US, her bags are packed with mock meat patties and sausages from Beyond Meat and Field Roast. “Rather than trying to fix a meat craving, we eat it for its advertised protein content and to experiment with progressive cuisine. It is also the perfect way to leave behind a much smaller environmental footprint,” says the co-founder of Galatta Media, who gave up meat nearly two decades ago, but recently discovered alternatives for her husband and children. The mother of two crumbles the patties and sausages to create taco fillings and ‘beef’ lasagne, and is looking forward to experiment with ground meatless-meat.

Pro mock Varun Deshpande, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute, India, says companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are seen as models for the potential growth of the sector in India. “We expect several launches over the next year in the country, aimed at addressing rising meat and protein demand with sustainable solutions.” He says that plant-based meat is aimed at being a simple switch for consumers, away from what is already a highly processed food — meat (owing to antibiotics fed to animals and post-slaughter processing). “Plant-based diets (including plant meats) have proven effective in addressing health concerns such as diabetes and hypertension. Because such meat is made from plants like yellow pea and ingredients like coconut oil, it doesn’t contain any cholesterol, or antibiotics — unlike meat. Different companies make their products from different ingredients, and it’s important to remember your health status and any dietary restrictions when thinking about what to eat,” says Deshpande who recommends people look out for sodium and sugar and maintain a balanced diet. “But if you’re eating burgers and hot dogs, you may want to consider making the switch to plant-based meat.”

No excuses

Processed plant-based and cultured products (made from animal tissue in a lab) are still quite nascent in India, though we are making strides — the world’s first government research centre focussed on the development of cell-based meat is set to open in Mumbai this year, while start-ups like ClearMeat plan to start distribution of cultured protein soon. “In the metros, the upwardly mobile and well-travelled don’t need any convincing to try out the products,” says Sinha, who shares that sales have been good in the East, Northeast and South India, especially among meat-eating consumers. Varun Deshpande, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute (GFI), says companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are seen as models for the potential growth of the sector in India. “We expect several launches over the next year [in India], aimed at addressing rising meat and protein demand with sustainable solutions.”

Meanwhile, the West has been at it for a while, especially the fast food sector. Last November, KFC Canada partnered with US vegan meat substitute brand LightLife Foods to add a plant-based chicken sandwich and popcorn chicken to their menu. And it wasn’t the fast food chain’s first attempt at bringing in meat substitutes. In August, a partnership with Beyond Meat to test plant-based ‘chicken’ nuggets and boneless ‘wings’ was a hit: they sold out five hours into the test run.

High-end restaurants are also joining in. Gordon Ramsay launched the Impossible Burger at his Singapore restaurant, Bread Street Kitchen, last March, while Adrift by David Myers, CUT by Wolfgang Puck, Radisson Jodhpur and Leela Bangalore are experimenting with alternative meats, too. “Drop the excuses and get people over the line to eating more plants,” says chef Derek Sarno, director of plant-based innovation at Tesco, who launched Plant Chef in September 2019 with the UK-based supermarket giant, featuring products such as battered fish-free fillets made with soy and pea-protein meat balls. “There is nothing healthy about killing animals or taxing our planet’s resources to raise and produce animal products,” he adds.

The health debate

But is plant-based meat truly healthy? In a 2019 interview with CNBC Make It, John Mackey, co-founder and CEO of Whole Foods, said that while it might be good for the environment, it is not good for your health. “If you look at the ingredients, they are super highly processed foods,” he stated. Of course, the comment courted controversy because his supermarket chain was the launchpad for Beyond Meat.

However, the facts speak for themselves. Meat replacement products are frequently high in fats and sugars, and contain binders, stabilisers and a cocktail of other ingredients that consumers may not understand. “By the time you unpick all this, are there any health gains at all?” asks chef Walter Marskamp of Amsterdam-based root-to-seed restaurant, Yerba. “Vegetable burgers, for example, used to be patties of julienned vegetables just held together with pureed beans. Now all sorts of supplements are used to alter the texture and disguise the vegetables. Consumers read vegan and think it automatically means healthy, but in the case of such heavily processed foods, this isn’t so,” he adds. Marskamp, instead, chooses to offer diners a side of wild meat, sourced from a licensed hunter (who has a strict quota within a small hunting ground, and only kills animals of a certain age so as to leave the general population intact).

Crowd favourite? Chennai-based vegan chef and food stylist, Neelima Sriram, whips up dishes with jackfruit, breadfruit and yams for her family. “These are excellent meat substitutes,” she says, adding, “Vegan meat and similar products are the way to go to reduce pollution caused by the meat manufacturing process. Research shows that we can significantly reduce carbon footprint [about 30%] by turning to such options. My mock meat Chettinad-style curry and chunky pastas are a favourite with my son. But we use them sparingly; only as indulgences once in 2-3 weeks because we avoid refined and processed food.”

Meanwhile, at Mini Vasudevan’s montly vegan potluck in Coimbatore “someone always ends up bringing in a mock chicken or mutton curry”. The co-founder of Humane Animal Society says that while she has tasted several mock meat products, she is not too fond of them “as I don’t enjoy its texture”. However, her husband, who turned vegan two years ago, eats plant-based meat tikkas, biryanis and fillets once or twice a week. “Any plant-based diet is better than meat products. But moderation is key,” she says.

Delhi-based nutritionist, Manjari Chandra, is of a similar mindset. “I’d rather people eat meat than opt for processed plant-based meat. Our ancestral diets [like paleo, for example] have proven that meat is good for the body. But you need to source your meat responsibly and in a hygienic manner.” The consultant at Max Healthcare explains that, ideally, mock meat should be made with greens and nuts, but as this is a costly proposition, companies use synthetics, additives and emulsifiers to gain the desired texture. “Such meats are counter-productive as they are high on chemicals. People can instead opt for fermented tempeh, soya, seaweed and sea vegetables to mimic the texture of meat,” she adds.

What’s the way out for consumers like Girish? To start with, being aware of what you buy. She recommends checking the food labels. “If you don’t like it, don’t buy it,” she says. “I love these products, but will I serve them every day? No. And that’s what I would decide for any processed, packaged product, whether it is noodles or [mock meat].”

Growing meat In 2018, Humane Society International (HIS) India partnered with Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology to develop laboratory-grown meat. Radhika Rao, campaign manager at HIS, says, “Since we have greater control over the components of cell-based meat, it is possible to create meat that is nutritionally superior [reducing fat content, or replacing saturated fatty acids, which are known to contribute to heart-related diseases]. Unlike highly processed foods, cell-based meat is a step forward to provide sustainable, wholesome nutrition to our future generations.”

Coming up

Nod to 3D: Israeli company Redefine Meat is developing technology to 3D print plant-based meat to replace beef. “Many fields are being disrupted, why should meat be different?” asks CEO Eshchar Ben-Shitrit, who is looking at launching a limited pilot of commercial machines by the end of 2020. “My experience in design and printing technology, and my realisation that new technologies must be found to replace animals led to the founding of the company [in 2018],” he says. His target is to create all the cuts found in beef using a “a combination of plant-based proteins and fats. It has no cholesterol, low saturated fat, is hormone and antibiotics-free, and has more fibre”.

Air protein: Hitting the market next year are meats made from air. Launched late last year by Kiverdi, a US-based company that seeks to make products out of carbon, air-based meat is inspired by NASA’s closed-loop carbon cycle concepts.

While the interiors are warm and inviting, what screams for attention are the colourful contents of its counter.

Opened on December 21, the outlet serves 15 varieties of cupcakes, macaroons and brownies. Seventeen-year-old Swetha Varma runs the store. “ I was selling these miniature confections at my father’s ice cream store in Kancharapalem. The positive feedback encouraged us to come up with this outlet,” she says. Swetha along with two other employees take care of the baking, while two more helpers man the counter at the mall.

It was learning about the New York based Patisserie, Baked by Melissa, that is known for making miniature cupcakes, that had Swetha hooked. She took to baking and replicating the kind of cupcakes offered by Baked by Melissa.

“I often come across people complaining that they cannot finish more than a cupcake even though they may want to try other flavours. These bite-sized cupcakes solve that problem. It is also for those who want to keep a check on their calorie count,” says Swetha who is currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Administration at GITAM University. Her days are spent juggling between college and the patisserie.

I start with the vibrant purple velvet cupcake topped with white cream and sprinkles. Though just a bite-sized the cupcake is packed with flavour. The dominating flavour is of Kala Jamun. “The Kala jamun cupcake is one of our best sellers. Apart from tasting good, the bright purple colour allures the customers,” she adds.

The tiramisu flavoured cupcake I pick out next sadly looks better than it tastes. The beige-coloured cupcake is too sweet and overpowering with the cream and sprinkles.

414,2020/01/03,Have you checked out the National Biryani Register,"I think this whole anti-CAA/NCR protest-thingie is a Machiavellian diversion engineered by the tukde-tukde gang to distract us from the real revolution that is quietly, aromatically, unfolding right under our noses. In fact, despite our naive nostrils getting daily whiffs of this horror as it arrives innocently at the homes of our so-called friends, our neighbours and relatives, we remain totally oblivious to it.

Patriotic readers, who form the very core of my fan base, this is for you: in 2019, Indians ordered an average 95 biryanis per minute from Swiggy. That is 4,99,32,000 biryanis in one year. You’d think the libtards would have stopped with that. Nooo. They ordered 17,69,399 gulab jamuns and 2,00,301 portions of halwa, too! And this is just Swiggy. Add what’s consumed via other home-delivery apps and by folks dining out, and you can see the scale of the evil being perpetrated in plain sight.

Biryani (not to mention gulab jamun and halwa), as any desh bhakt will know, was a diabolical Mughal plot to qawwali-fy and corrupt our simple khakra/dhokla/thepla-eating sanskari citizenry. If you know our history, you’d see that, thanks to a game of dice played just before Independence, Jinnah got to keep Pakistan, and Nehru, out of sheer spite, chose to keep biryani.

This is biological warfare. You’ve heard the old saying ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.’ Who do you expect the heart to sympathise with if the stomach is constantly supplying it with delicious biryani? Three guesses.

Had the right people been in charge, a large effigy of biryani would have been burnt at midnight, the recipe books thrown into the bonfire, and the plot would have been nipped in the leg-piece. And we would be celebrating August 16 as Mughal Biryani Vidhvans Diwas, by bathing in thandai and adorning pictures of Arnab Goswami (an avatar that our puranas foretold) with garlands of brinjal.

That was yesterday. We need to think of tomorrow. How do we de-mujra-fy and re-vegetarianise our gullible populace and get them eating fafdas, dal dhokli and other patriotic food items?

I think the first-order-of-the-day, instead of chicken biryani, should be getting Swiggy to share its data with us. And put everyone who has ordered this unholy trinity of edible evils in the well-appointed reformation centres that we have been building without much fanfare in our ancient land.

In a two-step programme, we could not only teach the former biryani-bingers and gulab jamun gobblers to be patriotic again, but also have them contribute to our $5 trillion economy in the process!

Step 1 is to extract the noxious biryani residue that has adhered to their intestines since Nehru’s time. This can be done by making them do our time-tested, highly effective pavana-mukta-asana. This will detox them of pernicious Mughlai thoughts and all else once and for all.

Step 2 would be to pipe the pavana that has attained mukti and give it free of cost to all the misled youth currently protesting and making kolams on the streets for no reason. This will rid them of their misgivings, make them rush home, and set up individual pakora units to uplift the country. Unemployment problem gone!

Trust me, it’ll be a lot cheaper than implementing NCR.

All of you made fun of our minister when she said she didn’t eat onions. Where do you think the maximum onions are consumed? In the raita that accompanies biryani. Don’t see you scoffing now, do we?

416,2020/01/03,"Ambedkar memorial work to be finished by 2022, says Ajit Pawar","Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday said the work on Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s memorial will be completed by 2022 once all requisite permissions are received for the project.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the memorial in October 2015. “We will try to complete the work by April 14, 2022...the government will ensure there is no shortage of funds for the project,” Mr. Pawar told reporters. April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar, the Dalit icon and architect of the Constitution.

Mr. Pawar, who was accompanied by another minister Nawab Malik, made the comments after visiting the Indu Mills compound to take stock of the memorial work. He said some permissions required for the project were not yet received. The deputy CM, however, did not specify which permissions were pending. “These permissions come under the purview of the State,” he said.

The previous BJP-led Devendra Fadnavis government had said the memorial work would be completed by 2020. The NCP and the Congress, which were then in opposition, had alleged that the memorial work was going on slowly.

Asked about unseasonal rain in parts of the State, Mr. Pawar said such a scenario is caused by global warming and the government always stands with farmers if they suffer crop losses.

“There has to be an inspection of the losses incurred by farmers due to the latest rain,” he said, adding the government will be speaking to district collectors on the farm loan waiver issue on Friday.

417,2020/01/03,"After mobiles, video streaming on TV is the next big trend","The popularity of video streaming, which started on mobile phones as a result of cheap internet bandwidth, has transitioned to television screens.

Over 30 streaming video apps are vying for attention, and their popularity is the result of on-demand viewing, which is a break from watching TV shows on a schedule. Analysts said creative original content provided by over-the-top content [delivered directly over high-speed internet] is also helping. The market size of video streaming in India is estimated at $1 billion and is growing at 40-45% a year, making the country the fastest growing OTT market in the world.

“For streaming video, mobile is the gateway but TV is the destination. Consumers are getting introduced to streaming videos on mobile. Then they are figuring out how to watch this on their TV screen,” said Nishith Shah, an industry analyst.

What has given video streaming a push is the natural disadvantage of viewing content on mobile phones: for videos of up to 30 minutes’ duration that can be watched on the go, mobiles are ideal. But for long-form content, which are between one to three hours long, it can get tiresome. “Streaming video apps are reporting better numbers on TV as compared to mobiles because of longer watch times. This has resulted in more spend per user,” said Mr. Shah.

The shift has also helped push smart TV sales.

“Television has emerged as the centre of the viewing experience for popular OTT platforms, which can be best experienced on the big screen,” said Pratyush Chinmoy, head, marketing, Mirc Electronics, which owns the Onida brand. “With TV, one can enjoy content along with one’s family and friends. This scores over the mobile because continuous interference of other apps or calls can hamper the viewing experience.”

The smart TV segment, he said, is itself witnessing a ‘big revolution’, following the high growth period smartphones have enjoyed in the past few years. “The biggest winners have been the consumers and OTT publishers, with higher investment in the OTT content space.”

Akhil Suhag, founder and CEO, FanFight, an online gaming platform for cricket said OTT platforms have been helping them to reach out to the right audience. “The increasing trend of OTT platforms moving from mobile to television gives access to a larger number of consumers for players like us. We have been associated with Hotstar and MX Player for reaching out to consumers, who are very excited to play fantasy cricket on our platform. With this engagement, we were able to scale up our subscriptions to 6 million players and are now aiming for 10 million.”

Every brand is now pushing smart TVs loaded with apps. In addition, leading cable and direct-to-home operators are introducing Android-powered, smart set-top boxes, the single device capable of handling regular TV broadcasting as well as streaming video.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qgis5r/article30465120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMSTREAMING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/after-mobiles-video-streaming-on-tv-is-the-next-big-trend/article30465121.ece
418,2020/01/03,Police housing project with 448 tenements to come up at Marol,"At the Maharashtra Police’s first Raising Day Parade on Thursday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray gifted the police force a housing project with 448 tenements at Marol.

He also performed the bhumipoojan for the project that will be constructed at a cost of over ₹225 crore. Mr. Thackeray received the guard of honour at the ceremony held at Marol Police Training Centre in Andheri.

“The Maharashtra Police should make us proud in the world. I will ensure they get all the support, training, and modern facilities. With changing times, there are a lot of challenges before the police force; anti-social elements are advanced now. In order to stay one step ahead, it is important that our police force gets the best training and resources. I am committed to giving them these,” Mr. Thackeray said.

Police teams did a march past during the ceremony. After witnessing the parade, the CM called it “a memorable moment of his life.”

The CM then inaugurated the police housing project, which consists of administrative buildings, hostel, rest house, sports centre, and residential quarters. The project with a built-up area of 49,877 square metres will be implemented by the Maharashtra State Police Housing and Welfare Corporation (MSPHWC) and it awarded the contract in September. The MSPHWC will construct 16 buildings, which will be of seven-storey each. The entire project will cost ₹225.13 crore and it will be completed within 30 months.

419,2020/01/03,Talks for MUTP 3A loan in advanced stage,"The Railways has started the process of securing a loan worth $1,000 million from two major international funding agencies for the ₹33,690 crore Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3A (MUTP 3A).

The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) is in an advanced stage of talks with the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB) and the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for loans worth $500 million each. The NDB also had its introductory mission last week.

According to railway officials, the two banks have expressed their interest in key projects under the MUTP 3A. The NDB has shown interest in the procurement of the 191 air-conditioned local trains and two new maintenance facilities that have been planned at Bhivpuri Road on the Central Railway and Vangaon on the Western Railway. The specifications of the 191 air-conditioned locals are being finalised.

The AIIB has said it is keen on providing financial support to upgrade the existing signalling system on the suburban network and introduce a communication based train control (CBTC) system across the network. The CBTC technology will enable the Railways to run more services at better frequency on the existing infrastructure.

The MRVC has already invited bids for a general consultant to help execute the CBTC project. Officials said the AIIB was also keen on financing the station improvement project, where 19 stations will be remodelled to provide better circulating area and access.

MRVC officials said they were in advanced stages of talks with the AIIB, which is also providing a loan for MUTP 3. The AIIB in November 2019 had announced its decision to provide a $500 million loan to finance three projects under MUTP 3.

In addition to the above mentioned projects, MUTP 3A has a series of suburban rail infrastructure projects, which include a fourth line between Kalyan and Asangaon, third and fourth line between Kalyan and Badlapur, fifth and sixth line between Borivali and Virar, and extension of the Harbour Line to Borivali.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mno66e/article30465051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMACCOACHES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/talks-for-mutp-3a-loan-in-advanced-stage/article30465052.ece

Doctors at St. George Hospital where he was treated said the patient had been unable to walk for the last three months but after treatment, he could stand on his feet.

Dilip Chavan, a journalist, started suffering from body pain in 2007. He consulted doctors in his home town but they treated it like a regular bone and joint pain. It was in 2013 that Mr. Chavan’s condition was diagnosed as sickle cell anaemia by a doctor in Latur, and he began the accurate treatment.

Sickle cell anaemia is a blood disorder caused by an inherited abnormal haemoglobin that causes distorted red blood cells. The disorder is managed by drugs and bone marrow transplant in some cases. While Mr. Chavan was on drugs, the disorder had led to compromised blood supply to his right hip joint.

“He developed a condition called avascular necrosis, wherein the bone’s tissue goes bad due to lack of blood supply. We diagnosed his condition and put him on medication,” Dr. Madhurkar Gaikwad from St. George hospital said.

“When the patient came to us on December 13, he was walking with the support of three of his relatives. When we discharged him on Wednesday, he walked on his own feet,” Dr. Gaikwad, who is also the medical superintendent of the hospital, said. Dr. Gaikwad said sickle cell anaemia is hereditary but Mr. Chavan’s three-year-old son has not inherited the disease.

Mr. Chavan said his home town lacked good medical facilities and he had no choice but to come all the way to Mumbai for treatment. “So many patients like me suffer due to lack of facilities.

422,2020/01/03,Uddhav to seek inputs from industry captains,"After taking over the reins of the Maharashtra government, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will soon hold his first interaction with top corporate executives to seek inputs on the State’s economic policy. The Chief Minister is likely to request industrialists to focus more on Mumbai, while retaining the enthusiasm on the ease of doing business parameters. Specific sectors that are labour intensive and have a strong manufacturing base will be the focus of the meeting, officials said.

Sources in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government confirmed that the Chief Minister has sought time with 45 top industry leaders, CEOs and associations for a meeting on January 7, 2019. Greater investment and inputs on policy matters for the new MVA government will top the agenda, senior officials said. “We are meeting them and are in the process of preparing a presentation or a background paper for the meeting with (corporate leaders),” Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta told The Hindu.

Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), told The Hindu that the industry will also press the CM to ensure Ease of Doing Business benefits percolate down to the district level. “We have accepted the invite from the honourable Chief Minister. There are three important issues — to extend benefits of ease of doing business to the rest of the State, greater investment in specific sectors such as food processing and agriculture in general,” he said.

CII will also push for greater focus on small industries and not just large businesses in the State, besides a joint roadmap to enhance competitiveness, higher quality education and capacity development, Mr. Banerjee said. “Broadly, we want genuine ease of doing business to ensure the State is economically stronger, and is able to attract greater investment in the future.”

Maharashtra has been steadily climbing on the ease of doing business parameters under the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. However, the then Opposition had hit out at the government for focusing on certain regions, such as Vidarbha, where much of the senior BJP leadership is located.

423,2020/01/03,Man held for attacking sessions court judge,"The Dindoshi sessions court was witness to some amusing drama on Thursday morning, after a man walked into a courtroom, invoked Krishna’s name and threw a flute at the Judge. He was later arrested by the police.

According to the police, Omkarnath Pandey (60), who works as a watchman in Andheri, was slated to depose as a witness at a hearing in his brother’s 2017 murder case. Though the hearing was scheduled for later in the day, Mr. Pandey stormed into court room no. 10, where Judge S.U. Baghele was presiding, much earlier.

Clothed in robes

“He entered the court room wearing a lawyer’s black robe over his clothes and sat for a short while. In the middle of the hearing, he stood up and declared that it was Krishna Janmashtami, and threw a flute at the Judge. The flute, however, hit the court stenographer,” senior police inspector Babasaheb Salunke, Kurar police station, said.

After this, Mr. Pandey was overpowered and handed over to the police personnel posted on duty at the court. He was later taken into custody and arrested by the Kurar police.

Mr. Salunke said the accused has not offered any coherent reason behind his actions, and only keeps saying that Krishna was happy with him. “Based on his actions and his subsequent behaviour, we are arranging for a counselling session with a psychiatrist for him,” the police officer said.

Meanwhile, security was beefed up at the court following the incident, and an order was passed instructing security personnel to frisk all the people entering the court to avoid such incidents in the future.

425,2020/01/03,Body of woman in her 20s found near Thane skywalk,"An unidentified woman in her 20s was found to have committed suicide near a residential locality in Thane on Tuesday night.

According to the Wagle Estate police, the incident was reported to them around 8.30 p.m. by a resident of Raheja Colony in Thane (West). A team rushed to the spot and found the victim lying lifeless under the skywalk which connects one side of the main road to the another. She was rushed to Jupiter Hospital, where she succumbed while under treatment. Officers said the deceased had injuries consistent with a fall from a height.

“We have also found an eyewitness who saw the woman take the extreme step, and no indications of foul play have come to light so far. The eyewitness, however, did not know which direction she came from and the victim did not have any kind of identification on her person, or even a cell phone,” senior police inspector A.S. Pathan said.

He added that no suicide note was found on the deceased either. The police have for the moment registered an accidental death report and are trying to identify the victim.

A police officer said the fact that the victim did not have any belongings on her indicates that the suicide was pre-planned.

“It is possible that the deceased had identified the spot beforehand to take her own life, and we are checking with all residential societies in the vicinity if anyone corresponding to her description has gone missing recently. We are also circulating messages about the woman in all WhatsApp groups we are part of to seek information, while all police stations have been asked to update us about any missing person complaints registered about a young woman,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, CCTV camera footage around the spot is also being examined to try and retrace the movements of the victim, the police said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a9aucc/article30464764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16bmsuicidehelplinecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/body-of-woman-in-her-20s-found-near-thane-skywalk/article30464765.ece
426,2020/01/03,VVIPs petition Maharashtra government over reduced security cover,"The State has received petitions from VVIPs whose security cover was recently reduced after the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government assumed office. At least three BJP leaders and a well-known public prosecutor have expressed their displeasure following the security rejig.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has received letters from two people requesting intervention in the decision taken by State’s security establishment. Sources in the home ministry confirmed to The Hindu that the issue has been flagged by some persons not happy with the reduction, while they reserve the right to raise a review petition.

The high power committee on VVIP threat perception had last month reviewed the security cover of 97 people. The committee took a decision to reduce the cover for 29 individuals, while decategorising the cover for 16 VVIPS, officials said. Those who have petitioned the CM have urged that in the wake of the continuing threat to their lives the decision of the committee be revised. “Yes, we have received a petition from some of these persons. They are upset and maintain there is a continuing and existing threat to their lives,” said a senior official of the State home department.

The MVA government had last month downgraded cricketer Sachin Tendulkar’s security cover from X category; BJP leader Eknath Khadse’s reduced from Y; and downgraded BJP leader and former U.P. Governor Ram Naik’s security category from Z+ to X. Among others, the committee had also reduced the cover of BJP leader and former cabinet minister Ashish Shelar and BJP MLC Prasad Lad. The security cover for prominent public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam was also reduced from Z+ to Y.

This after the cover for both Aaditya Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray was increased. “I am disappointed at the reduced cover and have made my displeasure known to CM and Home Department. The downgrading of the cover should not happen based on political vendetta,” said a VVIP who lost his cover.

427,2020/01/03,50-year-old held with 14 kg cannabis,"The Andheri police on Wednesday arrested a 50-year-old woman after she was allegedly found to be in possession of 14 kg cannabis.

According to the police, Usha Kanjarbhat (50) was spotted by a police team on a routine patrolling round in Teli Galli in Andheri around 5 p.m. Officers said she attracted suspicion as she tried to slip away as soon as she spotted the police.

Senior inspector Vijay Belge said, “The accused was carrying a gunny bag and due to her behaviour, our team initially suspected that she was carrying stolen goods in it. When we intercepted her and searched the sack, we found the drugs in it.” Ms. Kanjarbhat was then taken to Andheri police station along with the seized drugs and arrested after preliminary questioning. Officers said the current value of the seized cannabis in the illegal drug trade market is around ₹3.5 lakh.

The police are interrogating Ms. Kanjarbhat to find out the source and the intended recipient of the drugs. Based on their quantity, it is suspected that Ms. Kanjarbhat was delivering a wholesale consignment obtained from a bigger supplier to be dispersed among street-level peddlers.

“Women are frequently used as mules to smuggle drugs, since they tend to attract less attention than men. Drug runners also like to use these women only one or two times before changing their mules, as it further helps evade the authorities. The mules are typically chosen from weaker economic backgrounds as they are willing to take the risk, if the payout is good. Based on her overall demeanour, we suspect that this was Ms Kanjarbhat’s first, or at the most second time running drugs, which is why she reacted so visibly,” an officer with the Andheri police said.

The police have so far not found any past cases registered against Ms. Kanjarbhat in their jurisdiction, but are checking with other police stations in the city.

Ms. Kanjarbhat has been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. After being produced at the metropolitan magistrate’s court, she was remanded in police custody till Saturday, officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/utd805/article30464630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bmconsignment-seized,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/50-year-old-held-with-14-kg-cannabis/article30464633.ece

The senior BJP leader has openly expressed his resentment against his party colleagues on several occasions. He recently gave an interview to a Marathi channel where he said former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and senior leader Girish Mahajan wanted to finish his political career. However, BJP leaders have clarified that there is a misunderstanding that will be resolved soon, that they would be getting in touch with him and that he would continue to be with the BJP.

Meanwhile, Mr. Patil was speaking to mediapersons in Jalgaon in the backdrop of the scheduled Zilla Parishad (ZP) elections.

“Mr. Khadse and I have discussed the ZP elections, and he has agreed to help us. His network will be beneficial to us. A reporter asked me, ‘What is your strength in the ZP?’ I said our numbers are less, but five BJP members and Mr. Khadse are in touch with us. I will meet Uddhavji day after tomorrow. It’s up to him (Mr. Khadse) to decide where he wants to go,” Mr. Patil told The Hindu.

430,2020/01/03,It’s not a fine line,"The line that divides millennials and Gen-Z seems dotted at best. But, in truth, it is a thick border, replete with a No Man’s land zone in-between. There is more that separates these two species than the boomers and the Gen-X. But this piece isn’t about the older set. Here are a few ways to tell who you are dealing with.

1. Millennials are Insta-loving. They like shiny happy things. They like filters. Love filters. Having had only a rudimentary idea of what real life is like, filters have always helped tone down the onslaught of reality around them. Gen-Z, by contrast are more realistic and, to balance it out, also more fantastical. They thrive on TikTok. If Instagram makes you feel like a celebrity, TikTok can deliver the superstar high because here you don’t just need to look good, you also need to move and lip-sync good. Back in the day, a skill set like that took Milli Vanilli to Grammy fame. No? Britney Spears then. Better?

2. Millennials don’t like alcohol too much. I don’t blame them — they possibly saw the older lot (us) make a fool of them/ourselves on a regular basis and decided to stick with sensibility through moderation. So, they drink wine and beer, maybe Sangria if it’s a Sunday. The Gen-Z takes it a step further by shunning alcohol like a Bihar-election manifesto and sticking with tea, coffee and, when they really want to rack it up a notch, maybe the occasional kombucha.

3. Millennials, as I mentioned above, have had a comfy upbringing. The sense of accomplishment has a completely different measure with them. For example, when it comes to saving the planet, the Boomers and Gen-X simply don’t seem to care, continuing to be plastic-propagating petrolheads. Gen-Z, of course, are the most focussed of the lot, but their consternation stems from a very personal level of concern considering that they will be the only ones around when the apocalypse and meltdown begin. Millennials, given their only superficial understanding of most things, believe that setting the screensaver to 15 seconds instead of 30 is akin to “doing their bit” for Mother Nature.

4. Food is another moot point. Here again, the pyramid slopes from the meat-loving oldies to the tree-hugging millennials and now, the uber-vegan Gen-Z. Veganism, for those who may not know, is a kinkier form of vegetarianism, and proscribed to those who have tired of Paleo, Atkins, and other shoddy fads.

5. Finally, the one thing that everyone hates the Gen-Z for is how they can take things out of context and reinvent them. For example, pole dancing. It was a completely harmless past-time, giving young boys their first taste of smut while spawning an entire economy — from the dancers to the servers and bouncers. But Gen-Z couldn’t leave good enough alone and somehow took this totally stag night activity and made it into a clean quasi-sanskari form of a workout. How are we supposed to find something sexy once it is so mainstream and non-vilified? What’s next, will Tinder find new meaning as a revolution catalyst? Will Jerry Springer be the next Oprah?

This column is for anyone who gives an existential toss.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/its-not-a-fine-line/article30470707.ece
431,2020/01/03,A bitter-sweet decade,"The past decade had been eventful for the real estate and home loan segments. With significant improvement in disposable income and falling interest rates there was a profound increase in real estate investment. Home loan disbursals increased significantly in banks and housing finance institutions. During 2017-18, HFIs disbursed ₹2.24 lakh crore out of which 66% was for acquisition of constructed houses and construction of new houses; loan amount of above ₹25 lakh per individual borrower saw increased traction.

There have been progressive changes in management of monetary policy transmission at the government level. The frequency of announcing monetary policy was made bi-monthly that enabled the Reserve Bank of India to monitor the liquidity, money supply, inflation and repo rates on more frequent basis. The government also set an inflation management target for the RBI, to strictly maintain the levels at not below 2% and not above 4%.

In September 2016, the RBI’s autonomy in monetary policy decisions was taken away by introducing a Monetary Policy Committee. It comprises six members; three government-appointed (external to RBI) and three from the RBI including the Governor who would deliberate on key policy decisions including setting the repo rates.

In the last 10 years the repo rate oscillated between 5% and 9% that mirrored the challenges the economy faced; in December 2019 it was 5.15%. Reflecting the volatility in repo rate, which is largely considered as the benchmark for fixed deposits and lending rates, the home loan rates too fluctuated.

The RBI and banks dabbled with the method of fixing home loan rates; two methods made headlines. First it was MCLR (marginal cost of funds-based lending rate) method that RBI introduced in 2016.

The MCLR method was replaced in 2019 by repo linked lending rate (RLLR). The home loan lending rates were linked to the RBI’s repo rate. This method was considered to be less complicated and importantly benefited home loan borrowers. Every time RBI changes the repo rate the lending rates too would change; this, of course, would be beneficial to borrowers during falling interest rate scenario and be detrimental in rising interest rate scenario.

The biggest annoyance for the RBI was that banks and financial institutions were not effectively passing on the rate cut benefit to home loan borrowers whenever the cuts were announced. The RBI Governor urged lenders to fully pass on the benefit to the borrowers, which most of the time received a tepid response.

The surge in economic development also witnessed the mushrooming of builders and developers, a few of them duping unsuspecting buyers by not completing the projects and/or mismanaging the funds. As an antidote, the much delayed Real Estate Bill was approved by the government and RERA was officially introduced; the real estate segment went from being an unorganised to an organised segment with this Bill.

The government during 2017 also announced its ambitious Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana that aimed at building over four crore houses in five years under the affordable housing project.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/a-bitter-sweet-decade/article30471629.ece
432,2020/01/03,Build differently,"Today there are thousands of institutions, architects, engineers and builders across India trying to promote non-conventional, eco-friendly alternatives in architecture and construction. And they all know why these appropriate ideas stay in the back burner – majority of potential owners who are inclined to the non-conventional are apprehensive, and the rest anyway are not convinced!

After all, customised houses cannot have prototypes, demonstrations, samples, test walls, material trials, model houses or any kind of construction rehearsals. Naturally, worries persist tempting people go with the mainstream cement and steel-based house. Habits die hard, even in this age of attraction of the innovation.

Given this apprehension most house owners have, the Hyderabad-based National Institute of Rural Development embarked upon a novel idea – actually constructing rooms and houses using the alternative, eco-friendly, local, vernacular and rural typologies handpicked from different regions of India.

Visually sweeping

Innumerable design, material and construction options can be seen, walked into and experienced across 15 built structures, with a visually sweeping master plan.

The list of ideas demonstrated is long, but to state a few – mud walls in stabilised blocks, adobe, cob and rammed earth; stone in random rubble walls; arch foundations; fly ash columns and walls; vaults with conical tiles; jack arch roof; ferro-cement channels; bricks; laterite; bamboo mats; wattle and daub; filler slabs; stone roofs; corbels; brick domes; CGI sheets, MCR tiles; perforated jaali walls; brick panels roofs; precast slabs; catenary curves; conical tiled roofs; round Bhunga huts; stone and timber lower Himalayan house; skylights; rat-trap bond; bamboo house; stabilised non-eroding mud plastering; walls with exposed materials; rainwater harvesting; lime mortars; boulder pack foundations; sanitation methods; solar energy; tile support in wood and steel; and pre-cast lintels.

What makes these structures convincing is partly due to the expert teams who made the centre possible – AP Habtech; CSV – Wardha; Habitat Group of Thiruvananthapuram and Hunnarshala from Bhuj with secondary literature inputs from varied sources. As such, the Rural Technology Park demonstrates the do-ability of cost- and resource-efficient architecture.

Considering that such a unique centre for demonstrating the feasibility of ecological alternatives was done way back in 2003-04, it’s sad to see most of the ideas still being relegated to the back burner.

Being termed as Rural Technology Park could be a reason, for all that we see here can be in our unsustainable urban centres of today. For those who cannot travel all the way to Hyderabad just to see the model constructions, an extremely well-illustrated compilation by the technically qualified project team is available at the centre.

Seeing is believing

Scepticism and apprehension cannot be ruled out by assurances, especially while investing lifelong savings in one house. We cannot experience the house before it’s built, but at least seeing can be believing.

That’s what RTP at NIRD provides and proves.

433,2020/01/03,The return of Jose Dominic,"“Kenny used fish as bait and I took it,” Jose Dominic says, his laugh filling the foyer of AB Salem House, his new 10-room guest house in Kochi. He is describing how he got seduced into a second innings as an entrepreneur, just a year after he stepped away from the leadership of the CGH Earth hotels group, which his father founded in 1954. AB Salem House is a historic building, just down the road from the famous Paradesi Synagogue, in Kochi’s Mattancherry or Jew Town area. And the Jewish meal Dominic refers to was cooked for him by the owner of the house, in an effort to convince him to buy it and turn into a guest house. It did its job.

AB Salem House is not your average 350-year old home that needed saving. It was the residence of a late elder of the Jewish community. Abraham Barak Salem, a descendent of the Sephardic Jews who migrated to India from Europe, was a lawyer and politician. He fought in the freedom struggle and negotiated the emigration of Cochin Jews to Israel in 1955. As a result, this home has seen much activity — both political and cultural. Evidence of this: a black-and-white photograph of Salem with then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion that hangs in the foyer.

The facade of AB Salem House on Synagogue Lane, Jew Town

“It came about as an accidental venture. But having got into it, I saw enormous historical context and potential,” Dominic, 69, says. “It is not just about building a place to stay. The house has a story; it is about how that builds into the experience we offer.”

Back to the glory days

To make that offering authentic, Dominic reveals he quizzed Kenny and his sister, Linda, on various aspects of the house — including the placement of furniture. The research is seen in the four lovingly-restored bedrooms, two on each level, with the original living room acting as a common area. Each room is furnished with antiques, from four-poster beds to writing desks. A modern kitchenette offers guests the opportunity to make themselves a quick snack, but proper meals will have to be had elsewhere, at least till a kosher vegan café opens later this year.

The café and six rooms (of the total 10) will be in Ezekiel House, a few doors down from AB Salem House. It was the residence of Rahabi Ezekiel, another prominent Jewish community elder who donated to the renovation of the Synagogue; his effort, Dominic tells me, is visible in the tile work we see today.

It is evident that Dominic is also influenced by nostalgia, and feels a strong urge to restore the area to its former glory. “When we were kids, people used to have tables out on the street in the evenings. There was a lot of eating, drinking and dancing. Today, many have emigrated and rented their homes to shops selling Kashmiri handicrafts. When these shops shut down in the evening, it is deserted. I want to make Jew Town a place where even locals will come post sundown.”

Master of it all

In an attempt to create more “places of interest”, the entrepreneur has opened a tribal art gallery, Desiga, on the upper floor of an old spice warehouse nearby. “There are plenty of modern art galleries, but none that mirrors the art of the original inhabitants,” he says. Curated by former Kerala Lalithakala Akademi chairman, TA Satyapal, the galley sources works from groups such as the Bhils, Gonds and Warlis. “Initially, I wanted works from tribes in Kerala, but it wasn’t possible. So, we had to expand our palette.”

The lower floor of the warehouse will be dedicated to yet another venture: the flagship store of Madukakunnu Estate, a farm and plantation that Dominic’s wife, Anita, manages. While the estate also offers a four-bedroom property, The Estate Bungalow (estatebungalow.com), the store will retail organic produce grown there, including pepper, nutmeg, turmeric and rice. But Dominic’s favourite part is the one housing his live edge homeware line.

The venture — created under the estate’s Maduka brand — also came about by accident. When he had to cut down an old mahogany tree gone to rot, the cost was too prohibitive, so he had it hand sawn into pieces instead. A visitor at the Bungalow, on seeing the natural, curvy edges of the wood, suggested he turn them into live-edge furniture. “As I read about it, I realised there was so much more I could do with it. So I have everything from table tops to cheese platters polished with food-grade materials like linseed oil,” he says. He is now sourcing trees that were victims of infrastructure projects or left to waste by the timber industry. “Now that I am no longer worried about building a career or furthering a legacy, I have the freedom to look beyond the obvious, and take up opportunities that need nurturing,” he concludes.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/65opug/article30471220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jose-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/the-return-of-jose-dominic/article30471221.ece

Instead, engaging deeply with our surroundings will add value to our lives, ” says Sreedevi Lakshmikutty of Bio Basics, a social enterprise that provides organic solutions.

For her, anything that is organic, protects the environment, helps the farmer and protects health is sustainable. “Buy less and pay more. Go for things with real value, pay a price that will provide a fair living for the people who make it and use them for long,” she urges.

Farmer and landscaping consultant Shanthni Balu believes helping farmers is a big step towards going green. “Buy local produce. If it is seasonal, it tastes better and, besides helping the people who grow your food, it is also healthier and cuts down on your carbon footprint when fruits and vegetables have not travelled hundreds of miles to your kitchen.” Another tip is to minimise packaging by buying in bulk. “Buying larger quantities will save fuel costs, as you don’t have to keep going back for more. Buy vegetables and provisions from your neighbourhood grocer; it means less packing materials and therefore less rubbish in the landfill.”

Gowri Madhu, who runs Seeragam Native Store, says she tries not to generate much waste and reuses most of what she has. She will even go to the extent of postponing her shopping if she does not have a cloth bag. She also carries water with her and will not use single-use plastic bottles. “Use home-made and chemical-free cleaners. I make bioenzymes myself and do not buy commercial cleaning products. It’s easier than you think,” she promises. Gowri has also stopped using store-bought soaps, shampoos and cosmetics. “I use home-made herbal bath powders, shikakai, kajal and lip balm.”

NA Sujatha | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

NA Sujatha, Marketing Manager at Brookefields Mall, has done the same. “I have stopped using scrubs with microplastics. I have replaced plastic scrubs with coconut fibre to exfoliate, and soaps and shampoos with besan. I fill a bucket when I bathe instead of showering to save water. I know that I am responsible for anything that leaves my home as waste. If I wash my vessels or my bathroom with chemical-laden cleaners, the water going out pollutes the ground. So I now use bio-enzymes and non-chemical cleaners.” Sujatha lives without a fridge and it is not at all hard, she says. But her switch did not happen overnight. Interacting with people such as Sangeetha Subhash influenced her to go green.

Sangeetha Subash | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

A furniture designer and environmentalist who holds workshops and awareness drives on non-toxic, home-made cleaners, Sangeetha says she is keeping a strict control over her clothes shopping sprees! “Every time I am tempted, I ask myself, ‘do I really need this?’ I upcycle old clothes by dyeing them naturally. I am not so compulsive now when I buy clothes.” Even thinking about scaling down is half the battle won. “Resist the temptation a couple of times and it gets easier. I now find out the story behind the cloth I buy and if it impacts the environment negatively in any way. I look for traditional weaves or handlooms that have a direct connect with a community of craftspeople. They put their heart and soul into making them. We ought to recognise that.”

Gowri is also moving towards naturally grown, handspun and naturally dyed clothes. “I hand wash my clothes and iron only those that need it.” She also makes good use of her mother’s old cotton saris and other unused clothes to make menstrual pads. “I have stopped using tissue paper. I carry a handkerchief or, in the worst case, use my dupatta or sari pallu,” she smiles",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/951o27/article30469644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Green-sustainable,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/tips-to-lead-a-sustainable-life-from-people-who-walk-the-talk/article30469655.ece
435,2020/01/03,"Let us not break rules but bend laws for public good, says Puducherry Chief Minister","Advising senior officials to approach issues with an “open eye,” Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said “let us not break the rules but bend the laws for public good.”

Hosting a dinner for the Chief Secretary, Secretaries, and senior PCS officers on Thursday to acknowledge their contribution in making the Union Territory best governed as per the ranking made by Centre, the Chief Minister said officers should not just think of putting queries only but should concentrate more in solving issues.

“Delaying the file, returning the file and putting queries is very easy. Solving the issue is more important. The officers should not see things with a closed eye. Let us not break the rules but bend the laws for the welfare of people,” he said.

Seeking cooperation of officials in implementing poll promises, the Chief Minister said as elected representatives the Ministers and legislators get regular feedback. “We bring to your notice the feedbacks and it is your job to solve the issues,” the Chief Minister said.

Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam in his address urged the Secretaries to listen to the views of public before taking a decision on adopting Direct Beneficiary Transfer mode instead of distributing free rice.

“Your (officials) stint is for a long duration. Ours will end in five years if we are not able to fulfil election promises. Distribution of free rice is an election promise,” he said.

Addressing a press conference on Friday, party leader in the Assembly A. Anbalagan said the cabinet should recommend to the Lt Governor to sanction the distribution of ₹1,000 to ration card holders as done in Tamil Nadu.

If the Lt. Governor was not permitting distribution of free rice, the cabinet should seek sanction to transfer cash instead of rice for the last five months, he said. The amount would be useful for people during the festival, he added.

“If the Lt. Governor fails to give sanction to any of these schemes, AIADMK will certainly launch an agitation against the Lt. Governor. But the government should first show its resolve to take a decision,” Mr Anbalagan said.

He also demanded immediate convening of the Legislative Assembly. A short duration session with the customary address of Lt. Governor should be held this month and again re-convened next month to present the budget. In the last three and a half years of the government, the financial year never commenced with a full budget. The norm followed was to present a vote on account in March and present a full budget four months later, he said.

According to sources, the victim Priya, wife of Rajkumar, 27 of Kalarkuppam near Virudhachalam was admitted to the GH on December 27 for delivery. The doctors performed a Caesarean section and she gave birth to a baby girl.

However, Priya complained of severe pain in her abdomen following the surgery. As her condition deteriorated, doctors in the GH referred her to the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) in Puducherry on December 31.

Doctors in Jipmer performed a surgical procedure and found a cotton wad in her abdomen and removed it. However, Priya succumbed in Jipmer on January 1.

A senior Health department official said that a departmental enquiry had been ordered against five staff members of the Virudhachalam GH including the duty doctor and nursing assistant who were present in the theatre during the surgery.

“The victim had most probably died due to sepsis. We are yet to receive the complete report from Jipmer.

439,2020/01/03,High drama at counting centres,"The ruling AIADMK was leading in the panchayat union councillor posts in early trends.

Cuddalore, Kammapuram, Kurunjipadi, Mangalur, Mel Bhuvanagiri, Panruti and Parangipettai, Kattumannarkovil, Vriddhachalam, Kumarachi, Keerapalayam, Annagramam, Nallur and Srimushnam were the 14 panchayat unions in Cuddalore district that went to the polls in two phases on December 27 and 30.

The first phase of elections registered 79.68% turnout and the second phase 80.89%.

Commotion prevailed at the counting centre in the Kolanjiappar Government Arts College in Vriddhachalam on Thursday after supporters of an Independent candidate ghearoed the election officials alleging that the authorities had wrongly counted votes in the election favouring the AIADMK candidate for the post of panchayat union councillor.

The counting of votes for 19 wards in Vriddhachalam Panchayat Union was under way. Of the 3,663 votes polled for ward number 1 in the union, Independent candidate Anand Kannan was leading with around 987 votes. However, the AIADMK candidate Arjunan who was trailing him with 860 votes, was declared the winner.

Mr. Kannan, along with his supporters, ghearoed the officials and objected to the results alleging that the authorities favoured the AIADMK. However, as the election officials were about to declare Mr. Kannan as the winner, the AIADMK candidate objected and demanded recounting. Mr. Kannan was declared winner at the end of recounting.

Counting stopped

The counting of votes for Sathamangalam Panchayat in Keerapalayam Panchayat Union was stopped midway after the name of one of the contesting candidates was missing from the draft electoral roll. The decision was taken on the basis of a petition filed by a few other candidates with the Returning Officer Balakrishnan.

According to official sources, the counting of votes for election to the post of panchayat president was on when District Collector V. Anbuselvan ordered that votes should not be counted until further orders.

Five candidates, including Arulselvam, were in the fray.

Addressing a press conference, he said trade unions of major political parties, barring the BJP, had decided to hold all-India general strike on January 8 against the prevailing political and economic situation in the country. “Considering the seriousness of the issues, we have decided to hold a bandh instead of a strike,” he said.

Besides AITUC, INTUC, CITU, LPF and AICCTU have extended support for the bandh.

The trade unions will seek the support of like-minded organisations and student bodies for the bandh, he said.

Their major demands include a minimum wage of ₹21,000 a month, ₹6,000 pension and assurance from the Centre not to sell shares of public sector undertakings to private players, he said.

441,2020/01/03,Airport runway expansion project in a limbo,"Three years after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) submitted a proposal to the territorial administration to acquire around 200 acres of land in Tamil Nadu for expanding the runway by another 500 to 600 metres, the plan is yet to take off.

The plan was to expand the runway from the existing 1,502 m to 2,000 m to facilitate operation of wide-bodied aircraft. The runway was last expanded in 2007.

Land acquisition has become a major stumbling block in the expansion of airport.

Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said funds needed for acquisition was a major issue. The fund requirement was estimated to be about ₹300 crore.

Earlier interactions with Tamil Nadu officials suggested that they would help in acquisition on condition that the Government of Puducherry bear the cost of land acquisition. Tamil Nadu was not interested in sharing the cost of the project, the Chief Secretary said.

Kochi model

Meanwhile, a high-level committee had been constituted to engage with, and gain experience from the trail-blazing Kochi International Airport Society, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up by Kerala to establish an international airport at Nedumbassery on a public-private partnership model

The SPV had mobilised nearly ₹300 crore from investors in a span of few months and in just three years, the registered company (Cochin International Airport Ltd) had completed construction and launched commercial services.

A committee had been constituted comprising Development Commissioner, Secretary, Department of Tourism and Secretary, Department of Industries, to discuss the way forward.

“A proper airport is a must for the growth of tourism sector here,” Mr. Ashwani Kumar said.

“People, including some officials, were not optimistic when we renewed air operations in 2017. They cited previous unsuccessful attempts to provide air connectivity between Puducherry and other cities. But now the two flights operating from Puducherry were successfully running. It is the same mindset of a section of people that prevents going all out in getting runway expanded and facilitate operations of bigger aircraft,” said a person from the tourism industry who works in close coordination with the Tourism Department. The Union Territory had good scope for operating bigger aircraft considering its industrial base and standing in the tourism sector.

According to Shrikanth R.D., past chairman of Puducherry Chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry, many companies moved cargo in and out of Chennai. “Industries would prefer to fly in and fly out their cargo if our airport had facility to operate large aircraft,” he said.

Private partnership

The government should consider private partnership in developing the airport. “The expansion of the airport is a must with the government keen on developing the region as an auto hub. It will help in creating employment and revenue,” said Mr. Shrikanth. With hurdles in expanding the runway, secretary of Sederapet Industries Association Secretary M. Nandakumar said the government should push for increasing air operations with the existing facility.

From the existing two ATRs operating in Hyderabad-Puducherry-Hyderabad and Bengaluru-Puducherry-Bengaluru sectors, the government should try to prevail upon private operators to provide connectivity to more cities. Flights to destinations such as Kochi, Coimbatore, Pune and Visakhapatnam would have good patronage, he added.

“The government should persuade AAI to set up night landing facility at the airport. The government should give concession in parking fee to airlines. It will certainly attract more tourists,” he said.

Mr. Shrikanth said flight service to Chennai should be considered as international tourists and businessmen would prefer taking a connecting flight to Puducherry instead of travelling by road. He wanted re-scheduling of the Bengaluru flight as the present timing was inconvenient. “We have many corporate companies here and leadership teams/staff find it very difficult to reach as the timings of current flights is very odd. In addition to the morning flight, the private player should consider starting one more service during evening hours,” he added.

Vijay Upadhya, Director of Puducherry Airport, told The Hindu that AAI was keen on expanding the runway and operating bigger aircraft. However, the preliminary step of land acquisition had to be done by the government, he added.

The air traffic had doubled last year. The aircraft movement has increased from 533 services to 1,308 last year. It had handled 87,000 passengers last year compared to 34,000 the previous year, he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/a2w5w1/article30464811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THPUDUCHERRYAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/airport-runway-expansion-project-in-a-limbo/article30464812.ece
442,2020/01/03,Bedi moots drafting of service rules,"Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi said a training calendar for heads of department in drafting service rules should be framed as this was an area that needed attention.

Chairing the first Raj Nivas meeting to kick off the year, Ms. Bedi said the Additional Secretary Home in the Chief Secretariat, who reported to the Chief Secretary, would begin implementing the decision from this month itself. “This will help Puducherry deal with a legacy of backlog ad hocism and absence of recruitment rules in several departments,” Ms. Bedi said.

Engaging more closely with the UPSC should be done as their approval was required in several cases. In fact, such an exercise had been in place since last two months. The idea was to sustain and strengthen this process this year, she said. It was proposed to share track record of each department as an incentive to perform better. Ms. Bedi had asked all departments to update the dashboard of NITI Aayog well in time for Government of India Ministries to keep abreast of work done in Puducherry. She wanted departments to maintain good practices which served the people well and further improve areas identified by supervisors concerned.

Ms. Bedi stressed the importance of an action plan with follow up in each case area demanding special attention. “Priorities and needed action plan had been sent out to all department heads and circulated. We did well last year but can better this year,” Ms. Bedi said.

For instance now the control room would record in the log book the time taken for redress of a grievance and whether that much time was justified.

“We shall then help identify areas for improvement department wise,” she said.

An official identified them as “Alexander and family and Evgeny and family”. He said the Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB) had flagged their activities at Varkala as suspicious.

The Russians had arrived in the country on a business visa. They partnered with a local businessman to invest in the tourism business.

However, Central agencies found they had repeatedly violated their visa conditions by seeking employment as bakers and tea-makers in hotels and restaurants in the resort locality.

False data

Officers said they had also furnished false data about their provenance and business to the Central government. They suspected the Russians to have used their business visa as a cover for unknown covert activities. However, no concrete evidence has emerged so far.

Based on the findings of the Central agencies, the FRRO issued a notice asking them to leave the country. An official said the Russians left the country by flight to Russia on New Year’s eve.

448,2020/01/03,Fight modern corporations: William Dalrymple,"The need to make profit underlines corporate organisations’ genetic makeup. The East India Company was controlled by an Act of the British Parliament, but modern corporations are much more powerful and drive what a person wants and needs. There is need to fight them back, historian William Dalrymple has said.

He was speaking at an interaction with critic C.S. Venkiteswaran at the launch of his book The Anarchy: The Violence of the East India Company, and the Pillage of an Empire here on Thursday.

Mr. Dalrymple said East India Company was looked as bringing in profits and the biggest employer of people and benign, but from the Indian perspective it was an unregulated monster.

National glory

On the reading of this crucial chapter in history, Mr. Dalrymple said Victorians parroted it to be a story of national glory, and for Indian nationalists it was one of national liberation.

So it became a story about two nations rather than one of a corporate house seizing control of India.

The actual Raj was only a 100 years, while the East India Company ruled for nearly three times that. “The audacity of East India Company was to conquer India with Indian finance and Indian manpower,” he said.

About the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, said an incredibly strong Centre was a rare moment in India history.

In the years after Indira Gandhi the power went to the States, but now, probably for worse, the country was under a very strong Centre.

The past month had seen the first signs of resistance to it. India’s strength was its plurality.

This gave India an incredibly rich mix of culture and complexity. This could be the iceberg which broke the Titanic, he said.

About his approach to writing history which involve narratives of violence, he said unlike the German apology for the Holocaust, Britain had offered none for what it had done. There was a romanticised view of British rule, and it was important not to do that. “I think nations need to remember and then they can move on.”

Earlier, speaking at length about his book, he said it was not the British or the British government that took over India. “It was one British company, the first multinational – the East India Company.”

The company, he said, was publicly funded and employed at its head office 35 people. It eventually came to take over the richest country in the world.

Sophisticated operation

“Ït was the most sophisticated capitalist operation in the world. No one since then has controlled more of the world trade than the East India Company controlled,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/k1d7yf/article30464593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvwilliamdalrymple,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/fight-modern-corporations-dalrymple/article30464586.ece

The Parassala police recorded the arrest of Pradeep, 29, of Naduthottam, near Parassala.

The accused is the party’s Naduthottam branch secretary.

He has been accused of brutally attacking 39-year old Senthil Roy of Valanvila, near Injivila, along with six others during the wee hours of Wednesday.

According to the police, the victim refused to hand over money that was demanded by the accused for their New Year celebrations. Incensed by Senthil’s resistance, the group manhandled him and ran an autorickshaw over his body after pinning him down on the road.

The victim, who sustained serious rib fractures and injuries to his head and lungs, has been battling for his life at the Government Medical College Hospital here.

While the incident had occurred by around 1 a.m. on Wednesday, the police recorded Senthil’s statement later in the day, following which they apprehended Pradeep on Friday.

While the police have registered a case against seven people, only four including Pradeep have been identified thus far.

Efforts were under way to apprehend the others who were allegedly involved in the incident.

451,2020/01/03,Protest against CAA at LKS venue,"The wave of protest sweeping across the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) had its echo at the second Loka Kerala Sabha.

The opposition to the CAA and NRA at the venue of the deliberations in the Legislative Assembly building was raised by Non Resident Keralite Habib Rehman, a native of Punnappara in Alappuzha.

Mr. Rehman, who is in Sultanate of Oman for 12 years, sported a white shirt with slogans “No NRC, No CAA, No CAB’ and was the cynosure of all eyes when the Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan presented the approach paper and during the deliberations on Thursday.

“I am registering the protest against unconstitutional measures being initiated in the country. Why this discrimination is taking place against a section,’’ he asks when quipped on selecting the LKS platform.

Mr. Rehman said he wanted to protest in front of the Indian Embassy in Oman but was denied permission.

Social cause

For Rehman, such types of protest and intervention for a social cause is not new. He had printed stickers for taxies in Oman urging them to contribute for the flood relief when Kerala was ravaged by natural fury. “I will sport this protest on the last day of the LKS,” Mr. Rehman says before returning to the venue to attend the deliberations.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/5o1q1i/article30464509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV03LOKASSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/protest-against-caa-at-lks-venue/article30464499.ece
452,2020/01/03,‘India’s rich diversity at stake’,"The raging debate over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) resonated at the second Loka Kerala Sabha summit on Thursday.

Many delegates expressed concern over the possible ramifications that these could have on migrants at an open forum on ‘Indian Democracy and Migration’ that was organised at the Legislative Assembly Complex on the sidelines of the summit.

Absurd endeavour

A vehement critic of the Centre’s attempts to redefine citizenship, poet K. Satchidanandan said that while the country’s rich diversity has always remained its strength, the prevailing scenario threatened to weaken its unity. He also opined that the endeavour to determine citizenship was absurd, considering that the country comprised a population with high levels of genetic diversity.

“No country can boast of comprising the original inhabitants alone. While civilisations had never pursued efforts to identify indigenous communities, the idea of citizenship came into being after the formation of nation-states,” he said.

Joining other cultural icons and prominent leaders who have vowed not to cooperate with the NRC exercise, Prof. Satchidanandan called for launching a non-cooperation movement against the Centre’s efforts in line with the non-violent freedom struggle that had been led by Mahatma Gandhi.

Condemned

Oscar-winning sound designer Resul Pookutty condemned efforts to divide the population on the basis of culture.

“While lines drawn on maps could define the borders of a nation, no borders could be created for cultures, a confluence of which had come to be known as India. We must not repeat the Partition of 1947, the greatest tragedy the world has ever seen, which resulted in the loss of the lives of over 10 lakh people. The time has come to introspect on how we have reached a point in which we were required to prove our citizenship in a country that is known the greatest torch-bearer of culture in the world,” he lamented.

Senior journalist Venkitesh Ramakrishnan, who moderated the discussion, feared that the detention camps that were expected to come up in various parts of the country will ultimately become labour camps for capitalist forces. He added that Dalits, tribespeople and marginalised groups were likely to be severely affected with the implementation of the CAA.

In an apparent reference to criticisms raised against the conduct of the Loka Kerala Sabha, Kerala Non-Resident Keralites’ Welfare Board chairman P.T. Kunji Muhammed said that efforts to stitch together a collective of migrants must never be opposed, considering the instrumental role played by the Malayali diaspora in the all-round development of the State. NRKs must never be isolated from the decision-making process, he remarked.

Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 59th minute, but the advantage was quickly wiped out by Hugo Boumous. Chhetri, though, delivered yet another reminder of his immeasurable worth. Six minutes from time, the 35-year-old expertly finished off a breakaway.

454,2020/01/03,Premier League | Liverpool sink Blades to make it a year unbeaten,"Liverpool made it an entire calendar year without a Premier League defeat as the runaway leaders beat Sheffield United 2-0 on Thursday.

Jurgen Klopp's side moved 13 points clear of second placed Leicester thanks to goals from Egypt forward Mohamed Salah and Senegal winger Sadio Mane at Anfield.

Liverpool's 19th win in 20 league games this season completed an incredible 12 months for a team at the peak of their powers.

The Reds haven't lost in 37 league games since a defeat at Manchester City on January 3, 2019 and it looks certain they will win the English title for the first time since 1990.

With a game in hand to further bolster their advantage, it would take an astonishing collapse to deprive Liverpool of their holy grail.

Winners of their last 18 home league games, Liverpool are unbeaten in 51 top-flight matches at Anfield dating back to April 2017.

As if it wasn't hard enough to beat Liverpool already, they are proving more impregnable than ever lately.

This was their fifth consecutive top-flight clean-sheet -- the first time they have managed that since 2007 -- and they completed more passes than any team in one match in the Premier League era.

After a golden 2019 saw Liverpool crowned European and Club World champions, the next target is ending Manchester City's two-year spell as champions after narrowly missing out last season.

Their sights set on domestic bliss, the new year started just as the old one finished, with Liverpool setting standards of excellence that rival anything achieved by City's breath-taking team.

Premier League immortality is within touching distance as Klopp's men are already over halfway towards an unbeaten league season that would replicate the incredible feat of Arsenal's 2003-04 Invincibles.

Even the strain of Liverpool's sixth game in 16 days, which had left Klopp claiming he was down to 13 fit senior outfield players, couldn't derail the leaders.

Liverpool hadn't even kicked off when that number dwindled further as Naby Keita suffered a groin injury in the warm-up and was replaced by James Milner.

But Liverpool are far too polished to lose focus and they were in front within four minutes.

Flushed with success

Their win at Bramall Lane in September had come thanks to a mistake from United keeper Dean Henderson and once again Liverpool benefitted from a Blades blunder.

When Virgil van Dijk played a long pass towards Andrew Robertson, it should have been easy for George Baldock to deal with.

But Baldock lost his footing and fell over, allowing Robertson to advance and cross low to Salah, who got in front of Jack O'Connell to steer in a clinical close-range finish for his 14th goal of the season.

David McGoldrick tried to drag United back into it with a dipping strike from the edge of the area that Alisson Becker tipped over.

Salah went close to a second when his instinctive half-volley was pushed over by Henderson at full stretch.

Ahead of their first visit to Anfield for 13 year, Chris Wilder's down-to-earth side took the unusual decision to train alongside the public on Stanley Park in the shadow of the famous stadium.

The session was interrupted when a dog decided to use one of the training cones as a toilet.

That unpromising omen proved apt as the visitors' hopes of a shock result were flushed away.

Salah was a constant menace and he met Trent Alexander-Arnold's superb pass with a first-time drive that Henderson turned away for a corner.

Liverpool's ability to press any opponent into submission and deliver the knockout blow with their lethal front three has made them virtually unplayable over the last 18 months.

United were the latest victims as Mane wrapped up the points in the 64th minute.

Running onto Robertson's pass, Mane broke into the area and took Salah's return pass before firing gleefully into the roof of the net after his initial shot was saved.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bemool/article30466040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINSOCCERPREMIERLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-liverpool-sink-blades-to-make-it-a-year-unbeaten/article30466041.ece
455,2020/01/03,La Liga | Barca and Real continue title tussle ahead of Super Cup,"Barcelona and Real Madrid recommence their war of attrition on Saturday as Spanish league action returns briefly before the pair controversially head off to Saudi Arabia for next weekend's Super Cup.

League leaders and defending champions Barcelona have an easy trip to cross town rivals Espanyol, who are floundering at the bottom of the table.

However Espanyol hired former Barca player Abelardo Fernandez in the hope of turning their fortunes around after losing to second-bottom Leganes just before the Christmas break.

Ernesto Valverde's Barca are unbeaten in all competitions since the start of November and sit two points ahead of Real Madrid despite some below-par performances.

Madrid meanwhile return to action off the back of three straight draws before the break, including a goalless stalemate in the politically charged 'Clasico' in December.

They have a trickier task than Barca too, with another derby against a Getafe side showing that their fifth-placed finish last year was no fluke.

Coach Zinedine will be without the injured Eden Hazard for the clash, captain Sergio Ramos is suspended, although James Rodrţguez, Brazilian Marcelo and Lucas Vŕzquez are all available.

Both Barca and Real may switch up their line-ups given their controversial voyage to Saudi Arabia to contest the Super Cup, alongside Atletico Madrid and Valencia, from January 8.

The decision in November hold a four-team tournament in Saudi Arabia in the European winter for the next three years has caused a storm in Spain.

Spain's public broadcaster RTVE refused to bid for the rights to the match due to it being held in a country where “human rights are not respected”.

Barca will face Atletico and Valencia will play Real before the final on January 12, a radical revamp to what has traditionally been a the season's curtain raiser between the league champions and Copa del Rey winners.

The tournament's scheduling means that La Liga will take another break while the Super Cup is being played, with league action restarting on January 17.

Atletico will go to the tournament looking over their shoulder in the league.

Diego Simeone's side were wildly inconsistent before the winter break, and have found goals hard to come by despite spending 126 million euros ($142 million) on Joao Felix in the summer.

Fourth-placed Atleti have score just 20 times in 18 matches and have Getafe, Real Sociedad, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao all snapping at their heels for the final spot in the Champions League.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rjhz8z/article30464891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FBL-ESP-LIGA-BARCELONA-REALMADRID,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/la-liga-barca-and-real-continue-title-tussle-ahead-of-super-cup/article30464892.ece

458,2020/01/03,"72,000 quintals of onion procured in 4 months","The State government procured over 72,000 quintals of onion from various sources to supply the stock to Rythu Bazaars (farmers’ direct selling points) in the State in the wake of spiralling prices of the vegetable.

The onion stocks were procured from Solapur, Alwar, Kurnool and Tadepalligudem as well as from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED). Onion was purchased at prices varying from ₹28 a kg to ₹120, and was sold at a heavily subsidised price of ₹25 per kg at the Rythu Bazaars.

The onion scarcity was first felt in Andhra Pradesh on September 27, 2019. Acting swiftly, the government bought 6,730 quintals of onion at ₹28.69 a kg. The burden on the exchequer then came to ₹34.92 lakh. The government continued purchasing onion at regular intervals. On January 1, the procurement stood at 281 quintals worth ₹16.95 lakh.

The government reportedly procured 5,869 quintals of onion through NAFED. The highest procurement was from Kurnool at 26,565 quintals. A huge quantity of onion stock was purchased at Solapur and Alwar (23,993 quintals) if markets outside the State are to be considered. Around 2,860 quintals were procured from Lasalgon, which is a prominent onion market.

“The State government has taken steps such as providing subsidy through a Market Stabilisation Fund to supply onion at subsidised prices. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has been closely monitoring the situation,” said Marketing and Animal Husbandry Minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana.

The government procured onion at an average price of ₹76.72 a kg, and sold it at ₹25 a kg. Onion worth ₹54.21 crore was purchased but supplied to consumers at Rythu Bazaars at a subsidised rate. The government would have to shoulder a burden of ₹37.28 crore towards subsided onion. Even as onion prices skyrocketed above ₹100 a kg in many States, Andhra Pradesh managed to retain it at ₹25 per kg at the Rythu Bazaar outlets. Onion would be supplied at ₹25 per kg through Rythu Bazaars till the prices in the open market stabilise,” Mr. Venkata Ramana said.

Despite the efforts of the government, onion stalls at Rythu Bazaars continue to witness serpentine queues.

460,2020/01/03,District administration gears up to implement slew of welfare measures,"The district administration is gearing up to implement a slew of welfare measures across a number of sectors, based on a directive from the Chief Minister.

To begin with the list of diseases under the Aarogyasri is being expanded from 1,259 to over 2,100.

Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, District Collector V. Vinay Chand said that the entire existing ambulance fleet of 68 vehicles will be removed to accommodate a 100-strong 104 and 108 ambulances. “The tender process has been set in motion and we will have the vehicles inducted by mid April,” he said.

The administration has also notified all government hospitals to use and supply drugs approved by the WHO only.

Under the Aarogyasri, we will give ₹225 per patient on a daily basis, undergoing treatment in government hospitals, up to a maximum of ₹ 5,000. “This is subject to doctors suggesting more hospitalisation,” said the District Collector.

According to him, the State government has sanctioned about 5,000 new health sub-centres and at least 500 will be located in Visakhapatnam district, with around 205 in the Agency area.

Digitised card

Steps are being taken to speed up the delivery of new Aarogyasri cards and the new card will come embedded with a QR code. “The QR code will be linked to the central database and on scanning it the patients medical history will display on screen. The process of digitisation of medical history is on, and this can be accessed from anywhere in India,” said Mr. Vinay Chand.

The Aarogyasri card will now be accepted in about 150 super speciality hospitals located in the cities of Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.

Confirming that the new rice card will not remove the existing ration cards, he said, “The CM has four priority cards: Pension, Rice, Aarogyasri and Jagan Anna Vasati Deevena (hostel fees). But this does not indicate that ration cards will become non-existent. They will continue to be operational,” he said.

On a priority basis, the pension card (YSR Pension Kanuka) will be given from February 1 and Amma Vodi will be launched from January 9.

Farmers’ suicide

The district administration has also identified nine farmers who have committed suicides and their family members are yet to receive the relief amount.

We have compiled a report based on data given by the District Crime Record Bureau from 2014 to 2109, and there are nine such cases in our district out of 556 across the State. On February 12, we will give the relief amount that has been enhanced to ₹7 lakh per case, said Mr. Vinay Chand.

Rythu Bharosa

Taking forward the Rythu Bharosa scheme, the district administration is in the process of finalising centres, where farmers can come and discuss agriculture related matters. “We will rope in experts from the nearest agriculture research centres to impart knowledge to the farmers and also have a counter to sell ISI marked fertilizers and pesticides,” he said.

Poster released

A poster related to the proposed strike was released at the CITU Office at Jagadamba Junction on Thursday.

Speaking on the occasion, CITU general secretary M. Jaggu Naidu alleged that the BJP-led NDA government was trampling upon the rights of workers by privatising the public sector units.

“Oil majors such as HPCL, IOC, BPCL, apart from steel plant, NTPC, Visakhapatnam Port, Railways and BSNL are facing the threat of privatisation. In total, 44 labour laws and four labour codes are being amended, throwing the rights of six lakh workers and employees in jeopardy,” alleged Mr. Jaggu Naidu.

He further alleged that the Labour Department was being deprived of its powers and employees were facing a threat to their job security in the name of ‘fixed term employment’.

“The orders of the Supreme Court on ‘equal pay for equal work’ are not being implemented. Farmers are committing suicides due to lack of remunerative prices for their produce,” he added.

Major demands

The trade unions have put up a charter of demands which includes minimum wage of ₹21,000 for workers at the lowest level, checking the rising prices, supply of essential commodities through fair price shops, stopping privatisation of PSUs, refraining from amending the labour laws, payment of ₹10,000 as minimum pension and abolition of Contributory Pension System (CPS).",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/citu-drums-up-support-for-january-8-strike/article30467346.ece

463,2020/01/03,‘MeeSeva’ operators seek continuation of services,"A large number of ‘MeeSeva’ operators staged a protest rally in the city on Thursday, seeking continuation of their services.

The operators are worried that their services would be terminated by the government in the wake of introduction of village and ward volunteers across the State. The operators say they want the government to provide a level-playing field or utilise their services at the newly-established Village and Ward Secretariats.

The rally began from Saraswati Park and made its way to Dabagardens. A protest was later staged at the Gandhi Statue.

The participants, who took out the rally under the banner of MeeSeva Operators Welfare Association, raised slogans demanding continuation of their services. While the operators are not against the rollout of online services through the Village and Ward Secretariats, they are demanding uniformity in services offered at the MeeSeva branches and the Village and Ward Secretariats.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to do justice to us during his pre-election padayatra. We are not against the establishment of secretariats. But when the same services are provided at a lower service fee and in less time by the government, no one would come to us any more for these services,” said A. Appala Naidu, president of the Visakhapatnam district unit of the association.

Around one lakh people avail various government services through the MeeSeva centres in the State on a daily basis. The number of people served through these centres is around 3 crore a year. There are over 3,000 operators in the district and around 30,000 in the State. These centres earn some revenue and part of it is paid to the government. The government earns ₹200 crore a year as revenue through these MeeSeva centres.

The centres function all round the year, including on government holidays, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The operators act as a bridge between the public and the government by providing 540 kinds of services.

‘Protect livelihood’

“We have invested a lot of money in buying equipment at the MeeSeva centres for our livelihood. The government has not asked us to wind up our services, but when the public will get the same service at a lower fee and in lesser time, they will no longer come to us. We appeal to the government to ensure uniformity in services or merge the MeeSeva centres with the secretariats and protect our livelihood,” said Srinivas, who runs a MeeSeva centre at Gopalapatnam.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/6mjzap/article30464399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VZ2MEESEVAWORKERSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/meeseva-operators-seek-continuation-of-services/article30464400.ece

465,2020/01/03,"Now, app can show details of pending challans of motorists","Two days ago, Rajesh (name changed) was stopped by a police team at Siripuram when he was riding his two-wheeler from Jagadamba Junction to Old CBI office. He was surprised as he was wearing a helmet and carrying all the required documents for the vehicle.

A policeman then fed the registration number of the two-wheeler to an app installed in a handset and informed Rajesh that he had two old cases of signal jumping pending and he needed to pay a penalty of ₹100 for each violation. The policeman also showed Rajesh the proof of him violating the rules, along with the location and photographs. Caught on the wrong foot, Rajesh had to pay the fine.

This is the latest E-Challan app the city police are using to identify the motorists who has pending challans issued for the violation of traffic regulation in the past. This app is linked to the database of the police and the Andhra Pradesh Road Transport Authority (RTA).

“The app has been linked with the central database and the serves at the Command Control Centre (CCC). All the details pertaining to the violations such as signal jumping, not wearing helmet, triple riding, lack of documents, no driving licence and no uniform for drivers under the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act recorded since 2016 have been updated on the database,” says ACP (Traffic) M.R.K. Raju.

How it works

The app works on two modes: be it when traffic personnel or RTA officials issue E-Challans or the violations is caught on CCTV cameras, the details are updated on the central database immediately.

The moment a violation is spotted by CCTV cameras installed at traffic junctions, an alert is sent to the Command and Control Centre and an E-Challan is generated automatically.

“Now, the violations can be recorded even in the absence of traffic personnel and it pops up the moment the vehicle registration number is fed to the app,” explains the ACP.

App open to all

According to Traffic inspector (Kancharapalem zone) T. Krushna, anyone can download the app from the Google Play Store. “Motorists can install the app on their cellphones and the app allows them to check the past record or violation status only. Only sub-inspectors and officers above the rank can register cases through the app,” he says.

At present, the app is linked to the central database of the Police Department, RTA and CCC and database is confined to the city and the district.

“Plans are afoot to link the app with the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS). Once it is done, the database will cover the entire country.

Invited by the Crafts Council of Andhra Pradesh, Bengaluru-based Jagadish had displayed earrings made from peepal leaves, a pen stand made with discarded cassettes, a terrarium built in a light bulb and tissue paper holder made from a motherboard, and so on. He says what he loves most is using peepal leaves to create designs on lampshades, coasters, wall hangings and table mats.

At the exhibition in Visakhapatnam which was held at Hotel Green Park, wall hangings in which he converted peepal leaves into a flock of birds were a rage among the visitors.

“Before I completely switched to upcycling products I worked as a kit designer at a design house for over a decade. However, I realised that there was very less room for creativity there when it came to reusing or upcycling things. Hence I decided to channel my designing talent for something better ,” says Jagadish.

This lead to the conceptualisation of Jaggusays Creative Works, a startup where Jagadish spends his days brainstorming for ways in which he could convert parts of discarded television sets, the insides of a CPU into earrings, and so on. “The best thing about doing this is that no two products are similar. Everything depends on the trash one gets to work on. Every day is a challenge as you have to come up with something new,” he says.

His products are mostly eco-friendly and use metal and cloth. “It makes no-sense for me to do all of this if eventually my products are going to end up for years in a landfill,” he says.

In the initial days, he frequently visited watch stores and hardware stores to collect spare parts that he could use for upcycling. “Over the years, people have started recognising my work and rather than throwing away the e-waste they come and give it to me,” he says.

While Jagdish tried to sell his products to big brands that dealt in home decor, it was not a feasible option as he hardly made anything from it. “Hence I decided to market my own products,” he says.

After from bazaars and craft exhibitions, Jagadish also shares his philosophy and expertise at educational workshops to raise awareness amongst people, especially students. He has conducted sessions at institutions like Delhi Public School and the National Institute of Fashion Technology and a few government-run schools on upcycling.

467,2020/01/03,Women in architecture: Anonymous no more,"Twenty years ago, at a time when women architects were mostly “anonymous designers”, and their body of work were not recorded or exhibited anywhere, architect Brinda Somaya curated ‘Women in Architecture - 2000 Plus’, a conference that brought together South Asian women shaping the field. “We had women from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” recalls the 70-year-old. “Then some from Singapore and Australia also wanted to [join].” Today, as she puts together the second edition, Women in Design 2020+, in Mumbai, the participation is far wider — with 35 panellists and speakers from around the world eager to expand on the conversations from two decades ago.

Organised by the HECAR Foundation, the conference, and a parallel exhibition, will push the boundaries of architecture and design, diving into their intersections such as photography, art, film and literature. “Architecture goes beyond being a technical [profession],” says Somaya, “Did you know, some filmmakers [and set designers] are trained in architecture (like Anshuman Prasad, who has worked in films like Captain America: Winter Soldier and The Hangover)? Their films are created in connection with human beings and spaces.”

Brinda Somaya

Archive in the making An exhibition will display works submitted to the Design Manifesto 2020+, a digital curation of generations of works by women designers from around the world, which serves as a snapshot of contemporary design and the beginning of an archive of women’s contributions in the field. It will also include works by city photographer, Chirodeep Chaudhari, who documents the metropolis’ quotidian charms, and installations by textile revivalist Vinay Narkar. January 7-February 20, Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan.

Celebrating sisterhood

When Somaya started her firm, Somaya and Kalappa Consultants, in 1978, “in the days without internet”, there were few opportunities for peers to network and share stories. “It was a lonely journey because there were not many women at the time who headed their own studios,” she says, explaining that she wanted the conference to be a celebration, where women found mentors and confidence in themselves. “When I was in college 40 years ago, only 10% of the class was women. Today, it is 65%! A generation from now, the majority of architects may end up being women. Unfortunately, the percentage of women heading their own companies is still very small, which is where we want to see a change.”

The first edition saw the likes of Yasmeen Lari, the first woman architect of Pakistan, attending. “For me it was like recording history,” says Somaya, “I was determined to find out what was happening in the countries around us.” The event culminated in a book, An Emancipated Place, that documented the conference. This time, the conference will bring together names like Billie Tsien — one half of the Manhattan studio, Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, who are designing the Obama Presidential Library — Annabelle Selldorf, who designed the Rubell Museum, and Mumbai-based conservation architect, Abha Narain Lambah, among others.

468,2020/01/03,Saying it with flowers,"On a hot weekday in Srirangam’s Sathara Veedhi, framed through the stone archway, is a scene that looks like something straight out of a Hollywood movie about ‘exotic’ India: stalls with rows and rows of shallow metal platters holding flowers in a merry profusion of colours. This is the street where the temple town’s flower trade has thrived for over a century.

“It’s winter time, so the white jasmine varieties malli, mullai and jaathi won’t be as commonly available as the colourful blossoms like saamanthi (chyrsanthemum) and roses,” says TSM Rangathurai, a flower commission agent who has been in the business on the street for over 25 years. He has followed his father T S Mani, the former head of the Srirangam Pushpa Vyabari Sangam (an association of flower commission agents founded in 1966) in the trade.

Open all hours

In a business that flies on just an overwhelming public demand, the sale of flowers seems to keep no real hours. The blooms, all of them picked by hand directly or with special tools, are in transit over road from the previous evening from growers within Tamil Nadu and without, timed to reach the market before sunrise the next day. Prices per kilo are fixed by consensus, with the most abundant flower being the most affordable. Trading begins by 3.30am and carries on late into the night.

Around 10 traders have their residences behind their stores on the street, making it a safe place for visitors at all hours, says Rangathurai.

A few stalls away, is the PSM Pushpa Commission Mandi, where chrysanthemums and marigolds vie for attention with blush pink and yellow roses. “We have around 100 suppliers from Hosur, Rayakottai (Krishnagiri district), Dharmapuri and so on. We also have flower farmers based in Tiruchi district who deliver their stuff on two-wheelers every day. The more exotic flowers like roses are sourced from Bengaluru. Around 1 lakh small-time flower sellers outside Srirangam come to us for their stock,” says A Raja, proprietor of the 50-year-old agency.

The profit of the previous day determines business for the next. Jasmine prices have been affected by the excessive rain this year. The jaadi poo, for instance, is selling for a steep ₹100 per 100gm.

Supply and demand

“We already have an idea about which flower is in demand before we fix the price. Some flowers like sampangi (Polianthes tuberosa) and chrysanthemum are in over-supply this year, so they are going for ₹50-60 per kg. On an auspicious day, it can go for up to ₹300 per kg,” says Raja, adding that the market sells 1 tonne of flowers on a normal day, while it goes up to five tonnes during festivals.

The ongoing Vaikunta Ekadasi festival at the nearby Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple has added to the activity of the bustling market. Garland makers are in great demand now as custom-made floral accessories, especially the maalai to adorn deities in Vaishnavite temples, are sent from here daily to Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh for 10 days by refrigerated trucks.

Functional purpose

“People buy flowers for happy and sad occasions,” says N Mohamed Omar Farouk at the KMK Khaja Malar Mandi in Gandhi Market, that forms the heart of Tiruchi’s commercial district. At 11am, the flower stalls here are overrun by buyers, sellers and the merely curious, as prices are yelled out and the heady fragrance of sampangi mingles with that of roses. As in Srirangam, commission agents here have been awake since early morning, and each stall hopes to move most of its perishable stock by the close of day.

Garlands to go Karthik has been making flower garlands in Srirangam’s Sathara Veedhi for the past 13 years, and has his hands full with orders for the various religious and matrimonial ceremonies that take place in the temple town through the year.

“Srirangam garlands are held in high regard by devotees of Lord Perumal, as they are made with a specific design and selection of flowers,” he says, while expertly twisting banana fibre around the blossoms into a colour-coordinated strand.

The Aandal maalai and Perumal maalai made here are famous, not just for religious purposes, but also for weddings. “The virichi poo (jungle geranium) and the magilam poo (Spanish cherry) are exclusive to the Tiruchi district, and are commonly used for the devotional accessories,” he says.

Wedding orders (for the bride and groom) usually involve sets of four garlands, which have to match the grand costumes for the big day.

Floral workers are contracted to supply fresh garlands daily to the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, during the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival.

Though their income is modest through the year, garland makers can earn up to ₹5000 per day during the Ayudha Pooja period, when demand outstrips supply, says Karthik. “We are paid according to the size and labour that a garland requires. On average, the cost for a 1.5 metre garland is from ₹400 to ₹1000, depending on the flowers used.”

Seasoned plantain fibre is still preferred over twine for the garlands, mainly due to religious requirements, says Karthik.

He’s happy that his work cannot be mechanised. “Machines produce heat that will make the flowers wilt faster. It’s better to do it all by hand,” he smiles.

“During festival time, any flower that is used to adorn the hair such as jasmine and rose, is in great demand. For funerals, the chrysanthemum is preferred by the Christian community. People buy it loose, and also as garlands. We sell the flowers for growers and claim a commission of ₹10 for every ₹100 worth of flowers sold,” he says.

Many agents in Gandhi Market have diversified into stage and room decoration to keep up with the changing customer base. Quite a few of them also maintain websites with galleries featuring pictures of their recent work.

“Besides decorating stages and bridal suites with flowers, we also create wedding accessories like sehra (flowers interwoven with beads to form a decorative screen) for the newlyweds,” says Farouk.

Smells like change

Traders in both markets agree that the reliance on high-yield crops and chemical fertilisers has changed the quality of the blooms over the years.

“People often remark that the roses and jasmines don’t have the same fragrance as before, and they are right,” says Rangathurai.

“Organic farming is not economically viable in floriculture, so we are getting to see more hybrid blooms than before. The naatu sampangi, for instance, used to be smaller, but had a stronger fragrance than the hybrid variety that has become more popular now. But buyers prefer the hybrid version, because it is bigger and can be strung in garlands more easily,” he says.

Added to this are developmental woes, which have reduced the space to do business.

The Sathara Veedhi traders wouldn’t mind moving to a bigger premises nearby, but haven’t found any support from the authorities so far on this.

On the other hand, Gandhi Market stall operators have been protesting an initiative mooted by the Corporation to shift them to a purpose-built complex in Kallikudi, a few hours away by road from the city.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/dh0h4c/article30470985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TYMPFLOWERMARKETSRIRANGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/exploring-the-flower-markets-of-srirangam-and-tiruchi/article30470989.ece

470,2020/01/03,Check out these calenders with a message from Kerala,"It is time to turn over a new leaf. The glossy calendars of yore have given way to eco-friendly calendars or thematic ones.

City-based The Center for Autism and other Disabilities Rehabilitation Research and Education (CADRRE) focusses on a theme based on autism every year. “Last year, we celebrated some extraordinary mothers who walked the extra mile for their children on the autistic spectrum. This year, we are throwing light on organisations from all over the world that support those on the spectrum in different ways by helping them live with dignity and earn a livelihood,” says G Vijaya Raghavan, honorary director of CADRRE.

So, there is Cafe Arpan in Mumbai that is perhaps the first eatery run by adults with different levels of developmental and intellectual challenges. While an art gallery in Singapore showcases the art work and merchandise designed by those on the spectrum, an innovative programme in Israel trains youngsters with autism to work on certain specialised tasks for the Israeli army and so on. Each leaf of the CADRRE calendar has two sides: one shows activities in CADRRE, while the other side highlights the work of organisations that empower differently-challenged individuals. Some of the other organisations featured in the calendar are Specialisterne Foundation in Denmark, New York-based Spectrum Enterprises and Smile Biscotti in Arizona among others.

Meanwhile, a calendar of the Palakkad chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) highlights a “set of remarkable individuals, across disciplines, from the region whose legacies continue to be relevant to this day. Each leaf will be on one such person born in that month,” says Arun Narayanan, convener of the chapter.

What’s special about the calendar brought out by Trivandrum International School (TRINS) is it’s an “anthology” of snaps clicked by its students. In 12 leaves, this spiral desktop calendar for 2020 captures the essence and spirit of the capital city and its surroundings. Flipping through, the photographs evoke a happy sense of familiarity through some common sights and scenes one cannot miss while gallivanting around the district.

“Every year, the Trivandrum International School brings out a statement calendar under a topical theme to ring in the New Year, but done with the help of professionals. This time, we turned to the students themselves who pooled in their entries around the theme ‘Trivandrum from your Eye’,” says Sapnu George, executive director, TRINS.

Documenting landmark spots such as mist-wrapped Ponmudi, Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, the Napier Museum, the mermaid sculpture at Shanghumugham beach and slice-of-life scenes such as a chaayakkada, coconut orchards and so on, the calendar zooms in on the quintessential Thiruvananthapuram glimpses.

“The idea for this year’s theme was suggested by our HR executive, Revathy Radhakrishnan. Entries were open to students from grades 8 to 12 who were given a month’s time for submissions,” says Sapnu, adding that the calender is given to students, teachers and well-wishers.

Entries by seven young photographers — Devi Shivani, Kaushik V, Mukunhan B, Janaki Rajeev, R Prajna, Rishi R and Sheetal Suralal — eventually made their way into the final work. Each photograph comes with a short, succinct description of the subject’s cultural relevance to the city. “Many students in our school are interested in photography and we have a photography club as well. The pictures were taken using DSRL and mobile phone camera. There were no restrictions or instructions about the subjects as the idea was to let the young shutterbugs tap their creativity. The only condition was that the photos must be unedited and have the required resolution,” says Sangeetha Biju, coordinator of the project, who teaches computer science.

Class 10 student Janaki, who contributed the snaps on Vizhinjam harbour, Shanghumugham beach and Sree Padanabhawamy temple, says she felt the “thrill” of a competition. “I like photography and use a DSLR that my dad has passed on to me. I felt that anybody from the city can easily identify the three iconic places I clicked,” she says.

For Rishi, a Class 10 student, his passion for photography grew after doing a “personal project” on the art as part of co-curricular activities last year. “My picture depicting a bubble seller was shot at Vellayani,” says Rishi.

In the case of shutterbug Dilip Nair, a resident of the city, it was his desire for an eco-friendly calendar that could be recycled that motivated him to design table calendars that can double up as postcards. “I used to feel sorry about the leaves that would be turned to waste as soon as the month or year was up. That is how I came up with my calendar that can be used as postcards as well,” he says.

Beautifully composed photographs clicked by him form one half of each leaf while the other has a blank space with the calendar beneath it. “That blank space is to write and mark something important that month. Once that month is over, you can tear away the calendar along the dotted lines and it becomes a postcard,” says Dilip.
