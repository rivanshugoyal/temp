3,2020/01/23,Shared mobility start-up Bounce raises $105 mn in fresh funding,"Shared mobility start-up Bounce on Thursday said it has raised $105 million (around ₹748 crore) in fresh round of funding led by Accel, a leading venture capital firm, and B Capital Group which is a global technology fund.

The fresh funding will fuel a deeper electric vehicle (EV) integration, platform play and help drive profitability, the company said in a statement.

The series D funding also saw participation of existing investors, Accel Partners India, Chiratae Ventures, Falcon Edge, Maverick Ventures, Omidyar Network India, Qualcomm Ventures and Sequoia Capital India, it added.

“The main vision of Bounce is to democratise mobility and thus make a significant socio-economic impact. This fresh funding will help us towards this vision,” Bounce CEO and co-founder Vivekananda HR said.

He further said, “It will also enable us to build a mobility platform that will help bringing in different forms of mobility solutions, that are hyper-suited to the needs of cities and towns we plan to expand into, over the next few months.”

Commenting on its investment in Bounce, Partner at Accel Anand Daniel said the brand identifies one of the key gaps in the mobility sector and has managed to provide a convenient and cost-efficient solution with their tech capabilities.

“The innovations around the keyless mechanism of using a scooter coupled with other Internet of Things (IoT) modifications, make Bounce very unique. We are excited to continue partnering with the Bounce team,” Daniel added.

Bounce currently operates its dockless scooters in Bengaluru and Hyderabad with a fleet of 13,000 and 2,000 vehicles respectively. It’s docked scooter rental service is available to commuters in over 35 cities.

4,2020/01/23,Mphasis inks pact with QEDIT to offer privacy-enhancing tech,"Bengaluru-headquartered information technology solutions provider Mphasis on Thursday announced a partnership with Israel-based QEDIT to offer privacy-enhancing technology solutions on Blockchain to enterprises.

QEDIT is an enterprise solution provider that uses privacy-enhancing technology and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) cryptography to help companies transact and leverage their business data in a privacy-compliant manner, Mphasis said.

Under this partnership, the two entities will co- innovate and develop ZKP solutions to enable enterprises fight fraud, verify identities, and uphold compliance with local data privacy regulations, it said in a statement.

“All this while preserving full control over proprietary and confidential information”, Mphasis, specialising in cloud and cognitive services, said.

Blockchain is structured in a way that anyone with access to a blockchain transaction can view data provided across all nodes.

This inherent principle of transparency is an obstacle for companies that wish to gain efficiencies using a shared ledger, but simultaneously need to protect confidential transactional details.

QEDIT’s Private Asset Transfer solution employs ZKPs, a cryptographic algorithm that enables Party A to share the proof of knowledge with Party B without sharing the underlying data itself, the statement said.

This technique can be leveraged by Mphasis’ clients in regulated industries, especially financial services.

QEDIT’s solution can be integrated into large application projects for Mphasis’ Financial Services clients, it was stated.

“ZKP solutions are slated to demand techniques that secure information further on blockchain and Mphasis believes ZKP will become that horizontal layer of security for digital identification,” it said.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tydgex/article25290487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AVDMPHASIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mphasis-inks-pact-with-qedit-to-offer-privacy-enhancing-tech/article30631783.ece
5,2020/01/23,Google discovers security flaws in Apple Safari browser,"Google security researchers discovered several security flaws in a privacy software in Apple web browser Safari that could have helped third-party vendors track users’ browsing habits.

According to a report in the Financial Times which cited a soon-to-be published paper from Google’s ‘Project Zero’ team, the vulnerabilities were found in an anti-tracking feature known as ‘Intelligent Tracking Prevention’

Once disclosed by Google researchers to Apple in August last year, the Cupertino-based iPhone maker immediately patched the flaws.

Apple launched the ‘Intelligent Tracking Prevention’ tool in 2017 to, in fact, protect Safari users from being tracked around the web by advertisers and other third-party cookies.

According to Google researchers, the vulnerabilities left personal data of Safari users exposed. They also found a flaw that allowed hackers to “create a persistent fingerprint that will follow the user around the web”.

Apple confirmed it patched the issues.

This is the third time Google researchers have found flaws in the Apple ecosystem.

In September, Apple slammed Google for creating a false impression about its iPhones being at hacking risk owing to security flaws that allegedly let several malicious websites break into its iOS operating system.

Researchers at ‘Project Zero’ team had discovered several hacked websites that allegedly used security flaws in iPhones to attack users who visited these websites —— compromising their personal files, messages, and real—time location data.

In a statement, Apple said the so—called sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad—based exploit of iPhones “en masse” as described.

According to Google, the websites delivered their malware indiscriminately and were operational for years.

According to the iPhone maker, “all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not “’two years” as Google implies.

Google researchers also said they identified a vulnerability that accessed all the database files on the victim“s iPhone used by end-to-end encryption apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and iMessage.

Apple said that it fixed the vulnerabilities in question -- working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after it learnt about it.

In July last year, the ‘Project Zero’ team found six critical flaws in Apple iMessage that can compromise the user’s phone without even interacting with them. These security vulnerabilities fell into the ‘interactionless’ category.

Two members of ‘Project Zero’, Google’s elite bug—hunting team, published details and demo proof—of—concept code for five of six ‘interactionless’ security bugs that impact the iOS operating system and can be exploited via the iMessage client.

All the six security bugs were patched with the iPhone maker’s iOS 12.4 release.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/j9dvre/article30631498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26NETAPPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-discovers-security-flaws-in-apple-safari-browser/article30631579.ece

8,2020/01/23,India helps Maldives tackle measles outbreak,"India has stepped in to help the Maldives tackle a recent outbreak of measles, identified at a government hospital about three weeks ago. The Indian Embassy in Male on Thursday handed over 30,000 doses of measles and rubella (MR) vaccine to the Maldivian Health Ministry.

The outbreak comes less than three years after the World Health Organisation declared the Maldives measles-free. As many as six persons have so far been affected by the contagious viral infection. Following the development, health authorities in the Maldives said they have intensified the vaccination drive, to prevent the infectious disease from spreading further.

Preventive measures

“The first case was identified on January 9. Since then we have stepped up screening and preventive measures to ensure we contain it,” Minister of State for Health Shah Abdullah Mahir told The Hindu over telephone. “On rare occasions, there could be an outbreak of a disease considered to have been eradicated in a country. However, if we contain it swiftly and effectively, we will not lose the eradication status,” he said.

The six cases of measles so far identified are from Hulhumale — the reclaimed island adjoining capital Male — and capital Male, according to the Minister, who is heading a task force to handle the outbreak. The Maldives, he said, is observing 2020 as the year of public health, when an unexpected public health challenge emerged. “With our ongoing vaccination and re-vaccination drives, we hope to be able to contain it soon. We are grateful for the support from the Indian government at such a time,” he added.

The vaccine provided by India reached Male within 72 hours after the government made a request, a statement from the Indian Embassy said, adding that Minister of Health Abdulla Ameen presented a certificate of appreciation to Indian Ambassador Sunjay Sudhir, thanking the Government of India for the “gesture of goodwill and solidarity.”

MoU on health

The Indian government’s initiative comes even as the two countries implement the Memorandum of Understanding on Health cooperation — signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Male in June 2019. Secretary-level delegations met in Male early January to draw a roadmap for cooperation, in capacity building and training of doctors and medical professionals, disease surveillance, training of mental health professionals, setting up of digital health capacities in Maldives, officials said.

India is also helping build a 100-bed Cancer Hospital in Hulhumale as part of its $800 million Line of Credit to the island nation, a popular tourist destination and home to over 4,00,000 people.

New Delhi’s bilateral ties with Male witnessed a significant shift after President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was elected to office in 2018, following a tenuous relationship with his predecessor President Abdulla Yameen’s administration that New Delhi considered to be favouring stronger ties with China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lrwoej/article30636931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Maldives,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-helps-maldives-tackle-measles-outbreak/article30636932.ece
9,2020/01/23,Russian lawmakers approve sweeping Vladimir Putin reforms,"Russian lawmakers on Thursday unanimously approved a sweeping constitutional reform Bill put forward by President Vladimir Putin in its first reading, after less than two hours of debate.

All 432 lawmakers present in the lower house State Duma voted in favour of the Bill, just three days after the amendments were presented to Parliament. “This was a powerful show of unity,” Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said after the vote, adding that the key second reading was expected on February 11.

The Bill will then face a third reading, but with parliament dominated by Kremlin-loyal lawmakers it is unlikely to face much pushback.

Mr. Putin made the call for reforms last Wednesday and it was quickly followed by the resignation of the government and the appointment of a new premier and cabinet.

The breakneck speed of the changes has fuelled speculation about Mr. Putin's plans, with some saying he is laying the groundwork to hold on to power after his current term expires in 2024.

The Russian leader has kept observers guessing with the plan, saying it will transfer more authority to parliament and other state bodies, but also maintain a strong presidency.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russian-lawmakers-approve-sweepingvladimir-putin-reforms/article30636870.ece

11,2020/01/23,Residents of China’s virus-hit Wuhan call for support,"Wuhan residents called for help and shared worries of food shortages, with some on the “verge of tears”, after the virus-hit central Chinese city was put on effective lockdown on Thursday.

Planes and trains out of Wuhan — the outbreak epicentre of the SARS-like virus — were cancelled, with public transport also suspended as authorities told residents not to leave in a bid to control the spread of the virus.

Some residents said they were on the “verge of tears” as they read news of the lockdown, adding that their families’ lives were “threatened constantly and the target of online abuse”.

“We consciously avoid going out, disinfect diligently and wear masks,” wrote one user in a social media post.

“But there is a lack of food and disinfectants, and we need more resources. We hope everyone can understand that we are feeling as though it is the end of the world. “We really need everyone’s help”.

Some called on the government to provide more resources to Wuhan, saying there were not enough masks to buy and that food prices were rising.

Rising food prices

One user said: “Could the government help to resolve the issue of resources? Can we control food prices?”

The number of confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the new SARS-like virus is over 571, according to China’s National Health Commission, with most in Wuhan.

One video being shared on social media showed a bride in a nearby city wearing a surgical mask, and saying that all the guests who had visited Wuhan for work had been seated at the same table.

Lunar New Year celebrations begin on Friday, and it is a popular time for weddings in China.

Another social media user, whose location was tagged as Wuhan, said she is skipping a reunion dinner this year and apologised to her family online.

Many Internet users from outside the city expressed sadness and concern for residents, urging them to stay safe.

Others expressed anger at the authorities, questioning why the city was not sealed off sooner.

Some blamed people in Wuhan for eating wild animals. It is believed that animals are the primary source of the outbreak.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ss1wjh/article30636770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Wuhan-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/residents-of-chinas-virus-hit-wuhan-call-for-support/article30636772.ece
12,2020/01/23,Trump’s policy towards India is abdication of leadership: Ami Bera,"As election season gets under way in the U.S., Congressman Ami Bera called the Trump policy towards developments in India such as Kashmir and the “citizenship test” an “abdication of American leadership”. Mr. Bera’s remarks were made during a call with reporters as part of outreach to the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community for former Vice-President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign for the presidency — which Mr. Bera is supporting.

As the new head of the important U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation, Mr. Bera’s comments have significance for U.S.–India relations. The Subcommittee, under its former chairman Brad Sherman, held a hearing on Kashmir following Parliament’s abrogation of Article 370 last year.

“The Trump administration has been wholly silent on some of what’s happened in Kashmir as well as some of what’s happening with the citizenship test. Under a normal administration, America would be using its influence and dialogue in opening those channels of communication,” Mr. Bera said, reiterating that India’s strength is its secular democracy.

“I would argue that India should not lose that secular democracy because that is what separates it from other states and other countries. You don’t hear Donald Trump out there talking about it or even Secretary Pompeo. I think it’s not up to us to tell other countries what to do but with strong allies, we certainly can have those conversations and that dialogue,” he said.

The Congressman also confirmed that he had conveyed his concerns — particularly on Kashmir being opened up to the press and diplomats — to the Indian government privately, in addition to using public channels.

Criticism from the U.S. has rankled India, which views the Kashmir issue and citizenship-related policies and legislation (the National Register of Citizens or NRC and the Citizenship Amendment Act or CAA) as internal matters. While in Washington last month for the India-U.S. 2+2 dialogue, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had cancelled a meeting with Democrat Congresswoman of Indian origin, Pramila Jayapal. Who had introduced a resolution in the House asking India to lift the restrictions in Kashmir that had been instituted following the abrogation of Article 370.

He also said that there was bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for a strong U.S.- India relationship.

“Vice-President Biden, President Obama talked about... the U.S.- India relationship potentially being the defining relationship in the 21st Century,” Mr. Bera said.

On Biden

Mr. Bera said the Trump administration family immigration – an important issue for the AAPI community. Mr. Biden would “probably reverse” some of the policies that the Trump administration put in to restrict the spouses of H-1b workers from working, as per Mr Bera.

Certain H1-b spouses (H4 visa holders) were allowed to apply for work permits under the Obama administration. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Trump administration has proposed restricting the ability of H4 visa holders to work, although a final rule on this is yet to be published.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l0erpz/article30636559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23IN-AMIBERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-police-towards-india-is-abdication-of-leadership-ami-bera/article30636551.ece
13,2020/01/23,Brexit bill becomes law after receiving royal assent,"Britain’s delayed and disputed Brexit bill has become law, removing the last U.K. obstacle to the country leaving the European Union in just over a week.

The queen’s assent came hours after the bill completed its passage through Parliament by getting approval from the House of Lords.

“At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after that milestone late on Wednesday.

The European Union’s parliament also must approve the Brexit divorce deal before January 31 if Britain is to leave on time. Lawmakers in Brussels are due to vote on it next week.

The U.K. is finally leaving the EU more than 3-1/2 years after voters narrowly opted for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum — and after many rounds of political wrangling.

After years of negotiations between the British government and the EU, U.K. lawmakers repeatedly defeated attempts by both Johnson and predecessor Theresa May to finalize the departure terms with the other 27 nations of the bloc.

That changed when Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won the December 12 election, giving the government the ability to override the objections of opposition parties.

Despite Mr. Johnson’s repeated promise to “get Brexit done” on January 31, the day of departure only marks the start of the first stage of the country’s EU exit.

Britain and the EU are to then launch into negotiations on their future ties, racing to strike new relationships for trade, security and a host of other areas by the end of 2020.

Mr. Johnson insists he won’t agree to any delay beyond the end of the year. The U.K. is also keen to begin talks on a free trade deal with the United States, and intends to negotiate simultaneously with the EU and the U.S.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a deal with Britain was “an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the two countries shouldn’t be too difficult because their economies are similar.

“Both are very heavily services oriented and within services, such as financial services there’s already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination so it should be much easier mechanically,” he said in Davos.

But British opposition politicians are already raising concerns about issues ranging from food-safety standards — especially the U.S. practice of chlorine-washing chicken to kill germs — to drug prices.

Ross sought to dampen concerns that a trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain’s state-run National Health Service.

“What we think is that drugs should have similar prices wherever they are but I don’t believe we are in any position to tell the U.K. what they should pay for drugs,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nunkfu/article30636083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/QUEENELIZABETHII-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-bill-becomes-law-after-receiving-royal-assent/article30636084.ece
14,2020/01/23,Pakistan conducts successful training launch of nuclear-capable ballistic missile,"Pakistan on Thursday conducted a successful training launch of nuclear-capable surface-to-surface ballistic missile ‘Ghaznavi’, which can strike targets up to 290km.

“The training launch was part of Field Training Exercise of Army Strategic Forces Command aimed at rehearsing operational readiness procedures during day and night,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the army, said in a statement.

The ‘Ghaznavi’ missile is capable of delivering multiple types of warheads up to a range of 290km, the statement said.

The launch was witnessed by Lt. Gen. Nadeem Zaki Manj, Director General Strategic Plans Division, Commander Army Strategic Forces Command, senior officers from Strategic Plans Division, Army Strategic Forces Command, Scientists and Engineers of the strategic organisations, according to the state-run Radio Pakistan.

“Director General Strategic Plans Division appreciated the operational preparedness of Army Strategic Forces Command for displaying a very high standard of proficiency in handling and operating the weapon system,” the statement said.

He also “expressed full confidence in the robust Strategic Command and Control System and the capability of Strategic Forces”, it added.

Pakistan test-fired ‘Ghaznavi’ on August 29, 2019 also, days after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5.

India and Pakistan have been at odds after New Delhi abrogated the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

Pakistan reacted strongly to India’s decision and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter. It has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mt0wck/article30635905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-pakistan-parliament,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-conducts-successful-training-launch-of-nuclear-capable-ballistic-missile/article30635907.ece
15,2020/01/23,"All nations must come together to bring down global warming, question of planet’s survival: Angela Merkel","German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday said each and every country needs to contribute to bring down global warming as it is now a question of survival of the entire planet.

Attending the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Ms. Merkel said the world has indeed become a better place in the last 50 years.

The Cold War is over, Germany is united and at the same time the world has become a multi-polar world, the 65-year-old German leader said.

“All this wouldn’t have been possible without cooperation between countries. We still have new problems almost every year. Now environmental problems are there and we need to work towards making a sustainable world,” she said while attending the Davos summit of WEF for the 12th time.

“We want to achieve those sustainable development goals. We still have a lot on our plate. The question is of survival of the entire planet. We need to bring global warming down to below 1.5 degrees. Global community has to act together. Each and every country has to make a contribution. There are transformative processes that we need to go through,” she emphasised.

Ms. Merkel, Chancellor of Germany for 15 years, has always been known as a strong supporter of multi-lateralism. Germany is one of the most robust European economies and is ranked 7th on the WEF Global Competitiveness Index.

Ms. Merkel also advocated dialogue with global warming sceptics.

“We have a group of people who don’t think climate change is so urgent. As a democracy, we have to take those people along with us,” she said.

Whenever facts and emotions are in play, one can always develop an anti-fact narrative, she warned, urging people to talk together and bridge any divide.

“That’s what we have to reconcile - facts and emotions,” Ms. Merkel said.

The question of whether we will attain the Paris goals on climate change may well be one of survival for the whole planet, she said.

“We are under pressure and this is a decade of action,” she said.

There has to be an enormous transformation in the whole way we do business, developing whole new value chains, she added.

The Chancellor further said Germany’s energy mix was being completely overhauled to move away from coal and nuclear and in favour of renewables. Green hydrogen will also play a big role in the future of energy mix, she said. Ms. Merkel also said there were serious conflicts in society to overcome.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/frrfks/article30300066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANGELA-MERKEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/all-nations-must-come-together-to-bring-down-global-warming-question-of-planets-survival-angela-merkel/article30635613.ece
16,2020/01/23,Kofi Annan Commission calls for urgent action to save elections from digital threats,"The Kofi Annan Commission, a not-for-profit group, on Thursday called for an urgent action by governments, business and civil society to protect democracy from digital threats.

In a report released here during the WEF 2020 week, the Commission set out actionable recommendations in five major areas – polarisation, hate speech, disinformation, political advertising and foreign interference.

The Commission said the current debate on the impact of digital platforms is dominated by claims based on inconclusive evidence and competing or incomplete data.

Besides, the rise of the transnational business of election influencing poses risks to democracy if it is not regulated, while democracies in the Global South are the most vulnerable to digital threats.

It also said countries with pre-existing polarisation, a history of violence, and highly partisan media are particularly vulnerable to the weaponisation of social media.

“The use of digital technologies during elections have become a source of concern after they have been weaponised during key events such as recent protests in Hong Kong, the 2019 EU Parliamentary elections, and the past U.S. Presidential campaign,” it said.

This report comes at an inflection point where if action is not taken, electoral integrity will be at risk in key elections around the world this year, it added.

Laura Chinchilla, Chair of the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age, said much of global attention has been on digital threats and foreign manipulation of elections afflicting Western countries.

“For the first time, we take a particular look at the Global South, where new democracies or those in transition are particularly vulnerable to digital threats but where promising democratic developments are also taking place.”

The Commission called on governments to compel digital platforms to release their data to independent researchers. Without this critical information, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of technology on democracy cannot be completed and will continue to pose threats to the democratic process, it said.

Social media platforms should create a coalition to address digital threats to democracy, as they have done collaboratively to address terrorism or child exploitation, it added.

Alan Doss, President of the Kofi Annan Foundation, said, “Mr. Annan cared deeply about democracy and established this Commission to ensure that the power of digital technologies could be harnessed to empower and engage citizens.

“The Commission was his last major policy initiative and is a fitting testament to his legacy as a defender of the right of people to have a say in how they are governed, and by whom.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/nolqfi/article30635144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chinchilla-99,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kofi-annan-commission-calls-for-urgent-action-to-save-elections-from-digital-threats/article30634774.ece
17,2020/01/23,"Nepal ends search for missing South Korean trekkers, guides","Nepalese authorities decided on Thursday to end the search for four South Korean trekkers and three Nepali guides who were buried by an avalanche on a popular trekking route.

Despite several attempts to locate them, including digging deep through snow at several spots on the Mount Annapurna Circuit trail, crews have not been able to find any clues of their whereabouts, Nepal army spokesman Brig. Gen. Bigyan Dev Pandey said.

Rescuers have been searching since an avalanche swept the South Korean team and their guides on Friday.

Fresh snowfall and smaller avalanches on the trail have made the operation difficult. Authorities had mobilized army experts, mountaineering guides and local villagers to help in the search.

Attempts were being made to pull out the rescue team from the avalanche site but weather conditions were delaying the effort.

It could take weeks or months for the snow to melt and for the bodies to surface.

The missing South Koreans were two women in their 30s and 50s and two men in their 50s, all teachers who were doing volunteer work in Nepal.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/74hdk5/article30622793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEPALMISSINGTREKKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-ends-search-for-missing-south-korean-trekkers-guides/article30634657.ece
18,2020/01/23,It’s like saying Earth doesn’t revolve around sun: Ashraf Ghani on Imran Khan’s Haqqani denial,"Afghanistan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani on Thursday took a jibe at Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan for denying the existence of the Haqqani network in Pakistan, saying it was like claiming the Earth does not revolve around the sun.

Mr. Ghani said he is yet to see a breakthrough in his talks with Pakistan on this issue, and has only seen some “good statements” coming out from Islamabad so far.

During an International Media Council (IMC) interaction in Davos at WEF 2020 on Wednesday, Mr. Khan had said the Haqqani network militant group was not operating in his country anymore.

Asked to comment on this claim during his own IMC interaction on Thursday, Mr. Ghani said, “One can also very well say that Earth doesn’t revolve around sun.”

He added that it was good to see Mr. Khan presenting a very good reform agenda in Davos, but such denials were not good.

“I have not seen a breakthrough. I have seen good statements but the jury is out on the outcome. If Haqqani didn’t exist there, then why did Prime Minister Khan take credit for release of hostages,” Mr. Ghani asked.

“This is a denial which is not for good. We need to engage in a dialogue and that would be good for Afghanistan and for Pakistan and the entire region,” he said.

Mr. Ghani further said Afghanistan is dealing with a great deal of uncertainty and it is important to deal with each and every issue one by one.

He said a big majority of Afghan people believe the country is going in the right direction.

On any ceasefire in Afghanistan, he said any peace deal involves trade-offs but one needs to convince the people about that.

Regarding withdrawal of the U.S. troops, he said, “We will be discussing it in more detail in coming weeks about quantum of the U.S. troop withdrawal but at the time the idea is about 4,000 troops. The timing and other final details need to be discussed.”

On whether these troops can be used in Iran, he said there is a bilateral understanding that these cannot be used on any third party. Their ground base will have to be changed if at all any such need arises, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/70wil6/article30545118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12-DESPATCH-RUCHI21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/its-like-saying-earth-doesnt-revolve-around-sun-ghani-on-imran-khans-haqqani-denial/article30634390.ece
19,2020/01/23,US to impose visa restrictions for pregnant women,"The Trump administration is coming out on Thursday with new visa restrictions aimed at restricting “birth tourism,” in which women travel to the US to give birth so their children can have a coveted US passport.

Visa applicants deemed by consular officers to be coming to the US primarily to give birth will now be treated like other foreigners coming to the US for medical treatment, according to State Department guidance sent Wednesday and viewed by The Associated Press.

The applicants will have to prove they are coming for medical treatment and they have the money to pay for it.

The State Department planned to publicise the rules Thursday, according to two officials with knowledge of the plans who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The rules will take effect Friday.

The practice of coming to the US to give birth is fundamentally legal, although there are scattered cases of authorities arresting operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud or tax evasion.

And women are often honest about their intentions when applying for visas and even show signed contracts with doctors and hospitals.

The Trump administration has been restricting all forms of immigration, but the president has been particularly plagued by the issue of birthright citizenship — anyone born in the US is considered a citizen, under the Constitution.

He has railed against the practice and threatened to end it, but scholars and members of his administration have said it’s not so easy to do.

Regulating tourist visas for pregnant women is one way to get at the issue, but it raises questions about how officers would determine whether a woman is pregnant to begin with, and whether a woman could get turned away by border officers who suspect she may be just by looking at her.

Consular officers don’t have the right to ask during visa interviews whether a woman is pregnant or intends to become so. But they would have to determine whether a visa applicant would be coming to the US primarily to give birth.

Birth tourism is a lucrative business in both the U.S. and abroad. American companies take out advertisements and charge up to USD 80,000 to facilitate the practice, offering hotel rooms and medical care. Many of the women travel from Russia and China to give birth in the US.

The US has been cracking down on the practice since before Mr. Trump took office.

There are no figures on how many foreign women travel to the US specifically to give birth.

The Centre for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for stricter immigration laws, estimated that in 2012, about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S., then left the country.

The draft rule is “intended to address the national security and law enforcement risks associated with birth tourism, including criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry,” a State Department spokesperson said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/o3tnag/article25269393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-h1b-visa-immigration,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-to-impose-visa-restrictions-for-pregnant-women/article30634155.ece
20,2020/01/23,UN top court orders Myanmar to prevent Rohingya genocide,"In a sweeping legal victory for members of the Rohingya Muslim minority, the United Nations’ top court on January 23 ordered Myanmar take all measures in its power to prevent genocide against the Rohingya people.

The court’s President, Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, said the International Court of Justice “is of the opinion that the Rohingya in Myanmar remain extremely vulnerable”.

The court added that its order for so-called provisional measures intended to protect the Rohingya is binding “and creates international legal obligations” on Myanmar.

At the end of an hour-long sitting in the court’s wood-paneled Great Hall of Justice, judges also ordered Myanmar to report to them in four months on what measures the country has taken to comply with the order and then to report every six months as the case moves slowly through the world court.

Rights activists immediately welcomed the unanimous decision.

“The ICJ order to Myanmar to take concrete steps to prevent the genocide of the Rohingya is a landmark step to stop further atrocities against one of the world’s most persecuted people,” said Param-Preet Singh, associate international justice director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. “Concerned governments and U.N. bodies should now weigh in to ensure that the order is enforced as the genocide case moves forward.”

The world court order for what it calls provisional measures came in a case brought by the African nation of Gambia on behalf of an organisation of Muslim nations that accuses Myanmar of genocide in its crackdown on the Rohingya.

At public hearings last month, lawyers for Myanmar’s accusers used maps, satellite images and graphic photos to detail what they call a campaign of murder, rape and destruction amounting to genocide perpetrated by Myanmar’s military.

The hearings drew intense scrutiny as Myanmar’s former pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi defended the campaign by military forces that once held her under house arrest for 15 years.

Ms. Suu Kyi, who as Myanmar’s State Counselor heads the government, was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for championing democracy and human rights under Myanmar’s then-ruling junta. She wasn’t present in court for Thursday’s hearing.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be “Bengalis” from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.

In August 2017, Myanmar’s military launched what it called a clearance campaign in northern Rakhine state in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh and led to accusations that security forces committed mass rapes, killings and burned thousands of homes.

Ms. Suu Kyi told world court judges in December that the exodus was a tragic consequence of the military’s response to “coordinated and comprehensive armed attacks” by Rohingya insurgents.

She urged judges to drop the genocide case and allow Myanmar’s military justice system to deal with any abuses.

Thursday’s ruling came two days after an independent commission established by Myanmar’s government concluded there are reasons to believe security forces committed war crimes in counterinsurgency operations against the Rohingya, but that there is no evidence supporting charges that genocide was planned or carried out.

The report drew criticism from rights activists. Pending release of the full report, Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, said the panel’s findings were “what would have been expected from a non-transparent investigation by a politically skewed set of commissioners working closely with the Myanmar government”.

At December’s public hearings, Paul Reichler, a lawyer for Gambia, cited a U.N. fact-finding mission report at hearings last month that said military “clearance operations” in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state spared nobody. “Mothers, infants, pregnant women, the old and infirm. They all fell victim to this ruthless campaign,” he said.

Gambia’s Justice Minister Aboubacarr Tambadou urged the world court to act immediately and “tell Myanmar to stop these senseless killings, to stop these acts of barbarity that continue to shock our collective conscience, to stop this genocide of its own people.”

The world court’s orders are legally binding but it relies on the United Nations to add political pressure, if necessary, to enforce them. The court is expected to take years to issue a final ruling in the case.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z70gbr/article30633935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANGLADESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-top-court-orders-myanmar-to-prevent-rohingya-genocide/article30633937.ece

China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if needed. It has routinely sent bombers and other aircraft close to the island since President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in 2016.

Beijing believes Ms. Tsai is pushing for the island's formal independence.

Ms. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. She won re-election by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to China.

In a short statement, the Defence Ministry said Chinese aircraft including H-6 bombers and KJ-500 early warning and control aircraft flew to the south of Taiwan through the Bashi Channel which separates the island from the Philippines.

After carrying out drills above the Pacific Ocean the aircraft returned to China, the ministry said.

Taiwan's armed forces have a well-honed system to monitor and respond to such drills, it added, without giving details or saying whether Taiwanese fighter jets were scrambled.

China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Following Ms. Tsai's re-election earlier this month, Chinese state media suggested the country could flex its muscles near Taiwan to register Beijing's continued displeasure with Ms. Tsai.

The seas around Taiwan are a closely-watched zone not only for Taipei and Beijing.

A U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait last week, and the U.S. Navy has been conducting sporadic sailings there since 2018.

22,2020/01/23,Firefighting plane crashes in Australia with 3 aboard,"Three people died on Thursday when a C-130 Hercules aerial water tanker crashed while battling wildfires in the Snowy Monaro region of Australia’s southern New South Wales state, officials said.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the deaths and crash in comments to reporters as Australia attempts to deal with an unprecedented fire season that has left a large swath of destruction.

""The only thing I have from the field reports are that the plane came down, it’s crashed and there was a large fireball associated with that crash,” said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.

""Unfortunately, all we’ve been able to do is locate the wreckage and the crash site and we have not been able to locate any survivors,” he said.

Berejiklian said there were more than 1,700 volunteers and personnel in the field, and five fires were being described at an “emergency warning level.”

Also Thursday, Canberra Airport closed because of nearby wildfires, and residents south of Australia’s capital were told to seek shelter.

The blaze started Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures caused conditions in Canberra to deteriorate. A second fire near the airport that started on Thursday morning is at the “watch and act” level.

""Arrivals and departures are affected due to aviation firefighting operations,” the airport authority said in a tweet.

Another tweet from traffic police said “the fire is moving fast and there are multiple road closures in the area. Please avoid the area. Local road blocks in place.”

Residents in some Canberra suburbs were advised to seek shelter and others to leave immediately.

23,2020/01/23,International Court of Justice to rule on Rohingya genocide case,"The UN’s top court will announce on Thursday if it will allow a case accusing Myanmar of genocide against Rohingya Muslims to go ahead and if it will impose emergency measures to stop further violence.

The ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) comes days after a Myanmar commission concluded that some soldiers likely committed war crimes against the minority group but that the military was not guilty of genocide.

Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to The Hague in December to personally defend her Buddhist-majority country against the allegations over the bloody 2017 crackdown against the Rohingya.

The mainly Muslim African nation of The Gambia brought the case against Myanmar after over 7,40,000 Rohingya fled over the border into Bangladesh, carrying accounts of widespread rape, arson and mass killings.

“The first question is whether or not the Court will declare to have jurisdiction. My guess is that that will be the case, although you never know,” Willem van Genugten, professor emeritus of international law at Tilburg University, told AFP.

The ruling on Thursday is just the first step in a legal battle that is likely to take years at the ICJ, which was set up after World War II to rule on disputes between nations.

The Gambia brought the case with the backing of the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation. Canada and the Netherlands have since also lent their support.

At the December hearing, The Gambia alleged that Myanmar had breached the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, asking for special steps to prevent the “serious and imminent risk of genocide recurring” and to stop Myanmar from destroying any evidence.

While the UN’s top judicial organ has no power to enforce orders for provisional measures, the “significance... shouldn’t be written off”, said Cecily Rose, assistant professor in international law at Leiden University.

“The court’s orders and judgments tend to carry relatively great authority or legitimacy. Even though the situation in Myanmar is highly political and fragile, international law still plays a role by informing decision-making among international actors,” she told AFP.

Suu Kyi is not expected to attend Wednesday’s ruling.

In The Hague in December, she argued her country was capable of investigating any allegations of abuse and warned that the case could reignite the crisis.

On Monday a Myanmar-appointed “Independent Commission Of Enquiry” went the furthest that any investigation by the country has gone so far in accepting atrocities occurred.

The panel said some security personnel had used disproportionate force and committed war crimes and serious human rights violations, including the “killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes.”

But it ruled out genocide, saying: “There is insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical (sic), racial or religious group.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wux2uk/article30631678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MYANMAR-ROHINGYACOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/international-court-of-justice-to-rule-on-rohingya-genocide-case/article30631679.ece
24,2020/01/23,World leaders rally in Jerusalem against anti-Semitism,"Dozens of world leaders descended upon Jerusalem on Thursday for the largest-ever gathering focused on commemorating the Holocaust and combating modern-day anti-Semitism.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Prince Charles, Vice President Mike Pence and the presidents of Germany, Italy and Austria were among the more than 40 dignitaries attending the World Holocaust Forum, which coincides with the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.

The three-hour-long event at Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial - called “Remembering the Holocaust- Fighting Antisemitism” - looks to project a united front in commemorating the genocide of European Jewry amid a global spike in anti-Jewish violence in the continent and around the world.

But the unresolved remnants of World War II’s politics have permeated the solemn assembly over the differing historical narratives of various players. Poland’s president, who’s been criticised for his own wartime revisionism, has boycotted the gathering since he wasn’t invited to speak while Mr. Putin was granted a central role even as he leads a campaign to play down the Soviet Union’s pre-war pact with the Nazis and shift responsibility for the war’s outbreak on Poland, which was invaded in 1939 to start the fighting.

On the eve of the gathering, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin implored world leaders assembled for a dinner at his official residence to “leave history for the historians.”

“The role of political leaders, of all of us, is to shape the future,” he said.

The event marks one of the largest political gatherings in Israeli history, as a cascade of delegations including European presidents, prime ministers and royals, as well as American, Canadian and Australian representatives, arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport. More than 10,000 police officers were deployed in Jerusalem and major highways and large parts of the city were shut down ahead of the event.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lszh2c/article30631605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAELAUSCHWITZLIBERATIONANNIVERSARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-leaders-rally-in-jerusalem-against-anti-semitism/article30631606.ece
25,2020/01/23,"World leaders gather in Jerusalem for Auschwitz forum, without Poland","Dozens of world leaders will convene in Jerusalem on Thursday to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, amid a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the United States.

However, Poland's president will stay away due to rankling disputes with both Russia and Israel.

Israel has hailed the World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre as the biggest international gathering in its history, and Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence are among the attendees.

Poland will host its own commemorative event at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum south of the country on January 27. More than one million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp. Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.

Speeches at the Jerusalem event are likely to focus on the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust as well as a more recent rise in anti-Semitism rhetoric and attacks worldwide.

In Jerusalem, the high-profile guest list, which includes French President Emmanuel Macron, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Britain's Prince Charles, could also burnish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's image as a statesman at home ahead of a March 2 election.

Fighting for political survival in Israel's third ballot in less than a year, Netanyahu has been using sideline meetings with international leaders at the conference to call for more sanctions against arch-enemy Iran.

France, along with Britain and Germany, declared Iran in violation of a 2015 nuclear pact last week. They launched a dispute mechanism that could lead to reimposition of U.N. sanctions lifted after the agreement to limit Tehran's atomic activities was signed.

Polish President Andrzej Dud turned down an invitation to the conference, expressing dissatisfaction that representatives of Russia, France, Britain, the United States and Germany would speak, while Poland was told it would not be able to.

Israeli organisers said only the four World War Two allies, and Germany, would address the gathering.

Polish leaders have also been angered by comments made by Putin last month suggesting Poland shared responsibility for the war.

Warsaw will be scrutinising speeches by Putin and Netanyahu, who Israel's Channel 12 TV reported might echo some of the Russian leader's accusations against Poland in return for the pardon of an Israeli woman imprisoned in Russia on drug charges.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gf4i8/article30631591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23REUHOLOCAUST-MEMORIALAUSCHWITZ-RECEPTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-leaders-gather-in-jerusalem-for-auschwitz-forum-without-poland/article30631592.ece
26,2020/01/23,"Pakistan ‘spews venom’, takes to hate speech like fish takes to water: India at UN","India has slammed Pakistan for “spewing venom and false narratives” of monumental proportions in the United Nations, saying it takes to hate speech like fish takes to water and “obfuscates” the international community from the truth as Islamabad yet again raked up the Kashmir issue at the world body.

Pakistan consistently rakes up the Kashmir issue at various UN platforms in a bid to internationalise it but has repeatedly failed to get any support.

Last week, Islamabad failed in its efforts to get any traction from the membership of the UN Security Council when its ‘all-weather ally’ China made another pitch to raise the issue in the 15-nation Council. There was consensus among the rest of the Council members that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu, speaking at a session of the General Assembly on ‘Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization’ on Wednesday, said Pakistan “indulges in confabulations and obfuscates the international community from the truth” instead of putting an end to the “bellicose and vitriolic diatribe” and taking steps to restore normal ties.

“Just like a fish takes to water, one delegation has again taken to hate speech. Every time this delegation speaks, it spews venom and false narratives of monumental proportions.

“It’s extremely surprising that a country that has completely decimated its minority population talks about protecting minorities. Pakistan’s practice of using false pretenses to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. Pakistan needs to reflect that there are no takers for its false rhetoric and should get down to the normal business of diplomacy,” Mr. Naidu said.

The Indian diplomat’s strong response came after Saad Ahmed Warraich, Counsellor at Pakistan mission to the UN, raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in his remarks during the session, saying no other situation reflects the “abdication” of the UN’s responsibility to discharge its responsibilities more than the decades-old Jammu and Kashmir issue.

China’s latest attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan’s behalf failed last week, with an overwhelming majority of the body expressing the view that it was not the right forum to discuss the bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.

It was China’s third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC since August last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories.

“We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others. We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,” India’s Permenent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said last week.

“We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,” Mr. Akbaruddin said after the January 15 Council meeting.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/31e0ej/article29475333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYEDAKBARUDDIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-spews-venom-takes-to-hate-speech-like-fish-takes-to-water-india-at-un/article30631429.ece
27,2020/01/23,"Tulsi Gabbard sues Hillary Clinton for defamation, seeks $50 mn over ‘Russian asset’ comment","Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu lawmaker in the U.S. Congress, has filed a defamation lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seeking $50 million in damages, alleging that she tarnished her reputation by suggesting her to be a “Russian asset” and “favourite of the Russians” in the 2020 White House race.

The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York on Wednesday, has also claimed that Hawaii Democrat Gabbard suffered an economic loss to be proven at trial.

“Hillary calling me a ‘Russian asset’ is not only intended to smear my reputation and derail my campaign for president, it’s also intended to silence any voice that dares to speak out against the establishment status quo,” Ms. Gabbard (38), said in an email to her supporters explaining the reason for her suing the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential elections.

Ms. Tulsi has been harmed by Ms. Clinton’s lies and American democracy has suffered as well, according to the lawsuit.

“With this action, Tulsi seeks to hold Clinton and the political elites... accountable for distorting the truth in the middle of a critical presidential election,” said the lawsuit.

Hillary Clinton (72), who unsuccessfully fought the 2016 presidential election against President Donald Trump, in an interview in October last year said that the Republican party was “grooming” a Democratic presidential candidate to run as a third-party candidate. Although she did not name Ms. Gabbard, her comments were seen directed to the Hawaii lawmaker.

According to the lawsuit, “millions of Americans heard [or read about] Clinton’s defamatory statements. Scientifically conducted opinion surveys have shown that Clinton’s false, malicious statements about Tulsi, including that Tulsi is a ‘Russian asset’ and ‘the favourite of the Russians’ were accepted as true by millions of Americans, including large numbers of voters in battleground presidential primary states.

“The defamatory statements have caused Tulsi to lose potential donors and potential voters who heard the defamatory statements. Tulsi has suffered significant actual damages, personally and professionally, that are estimated to exceed $50 million - and continue to this day”.

The lawsuit alleges that as a direct and proximate result of Hillary Clinton’s intentional and malicious misconduct, Ms. Gabbard has suffered anguish and damage to her reputation, with direct and substantial injury to her positions as United States Congresswoman; Presidential candidate; and officer in the Army National Guard.

“These substantial injuries are continuing in nature and will continued to be suffered in the future, unless and until they are remediated by this court,” it said.

“One would expect someone of Ms Clinton’s political background to act with a greater level of maturity and dignity, but her personal hostility toward Representative Gabbard apparently clouded Mrs Clinton’s reason and blinded her to the US,” said Ms. Gabbard’s legal counsel Brian Dunne.

“She resorted to a damaging whisper campaign founded on lies, and when presented with the opportunity to retract her damaging remarks, she refused. Rep. Gabbard must defend her good name and hold Mrs Clinton responsible. This lawsuit intends to do just that,” he said.

But given the U.S. laws, it would be very tough for Ms. Gabbard in the defamation case against Ms. Clinton.

“To prevail in her defamation claim, Representative Gabbard has to prove that Secretary Clinton made a false statement of fact. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that mere ‘loose and figurative’ expressions, even ‘vigorous epithets’, don’t qualify. And, the courts are especially protective of the right to engage in sharp-elbowed political debate,” Jeffrey J Pyle, a Boston-based attorney, told ABC News.

“Representative Gabbard will have a difficult time convincing the court that Secretary Clinton’s statements were anything other than non-factual ‘rhetorical hyperbole’ which is thoroughly protected by the First Amendment,” said Mr. Pyle, who has represented a number of cases involving defamation, libel and First Amendment.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z938gu/article29464599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020TULSIGABBARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tulsi-gabbard-sues-hillary-clinton-for-defamation-seeks-50-mn-over-russian-asset-comment/article30631298.ece

Local media said at least one suspect was being sought in connection with the mass shooting that took place near a McDonalds fast food restaurant, just blocks away from the Pike Place Market.

It was the third shooting in the area in less than two days.

""Officers investigating shooting near 4th and Pine,"" the Seattle Police Department said in a tweet. ""Multiple victims. The suspect has fled, and police are searching for him. Officers and medics are providing first aid to the injured.""

Local media quoted police chief Carmen Best as saying that one person had been killed and five others, including a child, were critically wounded in the shooting that occurred shortly after 5:00 pm.

Police ordered people to stay out of the area and shut down a subway station as they searched for a suspect.

Tyler Parsons, an employee at Victrola Coffee Roasters, told The Seattle Times that he was working when he suddenly saw victims falling to the ground as shots rang out.

30,2020/01/23,U.S. President Donald Trump to attend anti-abortion rally in Washington,"The White House says President Donald Trump will become the first president to attend the annual anti-abortion gathering in Washington called the March for Life.

Mr. Trump has made it a priority to embrace social conservatives, particularly on the issue of abortion. In past years, he has sent members of his administration to speak at the march and has spoken via a video link. He’s going in person to this week’s event.

31,2020/01/23,U.S. senators on ‘digital detox’ as they hear Trump’s impeachment trial,"Some members of the U.S. Senate hearing President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, a proceeding following decades-old precedent, said they welcomed at least one of the chamber's anachronistic rules: a ban on cellphones.

“We're all on a digital detox,” said Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, during a break in what is just the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. “It meant people actually had to look at each other instead of looking down at their phones.”

The rules, which also require senators who love to talk to listen in silence as each side presents its case, are intended to keep the chamber's 100 members focused on the momentous task at hand..

At the same time, senators might find it difficult, if not impossible, to wander from the Capitol campus during the trial to solicit campaign contributions or just keep in touch with family members.

The senators are serving as jurors as the chamber considers whether to remove the Republican president from office on charges brought by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

During a break in Wednesday's proceedings, Senator Ben Cardin spoke to reporters while pecking out an iPhone message to his granddaughter. He said he did not mind being unable to get messages during the session.

“That's another advantage,” Democrat Cardin said. “I want to pay attention to what's going on, so it doesn't disturb me at all. I don't mind being free from my electronic devices.”

The cellphone rule is a perennial one in the Senate, but is being more strictly enforced as the chamber holds to a schedule that could see 48 hours of argument in six days that stretch well into the night.

Members of both parties, including the four Democratic senators running for president, relied on their staffs to keep up communications with voters, constituents and others outside the chamber.

Klobuchar, who is one of the presidential contenders, handed over control of some of her social media to her daughter, Abigail, who was campaigning for her in Iowa in the run-up to the Feb. 3 caucus when Democrats will cast their first votes in the race for their party's nomination to face Trump in November's election.

“My mom is in D.C. today, so I'll be taking over her Twitter account as I travel across Iowa,” Klobuchar's daughter said.

A CNN political analyst asked whether tweets from Republican Senator Ted Cruz meant he had smuggled in his phone, prompting his office to respond that staffers were putting out the messages.

“Interrupting impeachment coverage for one second to answer all the incoming inquiries asking: 'Did Sen. Cruz sneak his phone onto the Senate floor?,'” spokeswoman Lauren Aronson said in a statement. “The answer is, 'No, of course not.'”

Senator Mitt Romney, one of four centrist Republicans seen as open to a Democratic push to call witnesses and introduce new evidence in the trial, admitted disliking not being in touch with his staff in the chamber.

“Ha, I do miss my electronic connection, I've got to tell you,” Romney said during a short break. “No doubt about that.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qmd185/article30573185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPIMPEACHMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senators-on-digital-detox-as-they-hear-trumps-impeachment-trial/article30631062.ece
32,2020/01/23,Russian hackers targeted Ukrainian company at center of impeachment storm: cybersecurity firm,"Russian military hackers tried to steal emails from the Ukrainian energy firm where Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden, had a seat on the board, an American cybersecurity firm said on Monday.

Energy company Burisma Holdings Ltd was at the center of attempts by President Donald Trump last July to pressure Ukrainian authorities into announcing an investigation into the Bidens for purported corruption, an effort that has led to the Republican being impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Mr. Trump denies he did anything wrong by asking Ukrainian officials to investigate Hunter Biden's relationship with Burisma. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, who reject Mr. Trump's allegations of graft.

California-based Area 1 Security identified the hacking of Burisma and linked it to Russia's Main Directorate of Military Intelligence, or GRU. The same hacking group, known as “Fancy Bear” or “APT28” by cybersecurity researchers, breached the Democratic National Committee in 2016 in what U.S. investigators described as part of an operation to disrupt that year's election.

“You can see this attack really is starting to parallel with what we saw in 2016,” Oren Falkowitz, Area 1's chief executive, said in an interview.

The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials at the U.S. National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.

Burisma did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A source close to Burisma told Reuters the company's website had been subject to multiple break-in attempts over the past six months but did not provide further details.

What data the hackers were looking to steal is not clear, Area 1 said. Breaching Burisma could yield communications from, to, or about Hunter Biden, who served as a director between 2014 and 2019. A leak of stolen data could potentially affect the impeachment process and the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Area 1 said it became aware of the Russian targeting of Burisma after its email security scanning product found suspicious evidence online, including “decoy domains”: websites designed to imitate legitimate email services used by Burisma's subsidiaries.

Publicly available domain registration records examined by Reuters show that the hackers created the decoy domains between Nov. 11, the day before U.S. Democrats began their first public impeachment hearings, and Dec. 3, the day before the House Judiciary Committee took up the matter.

The records show that the same people also registered fake domains for a Ukrainian media company, named Kvartal 95, in March and April 2019. Kvartal 95 was founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and multiple employees of the company have since joined his administration.

Kvartal 95 and representatives for Mr. Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Area 1's report said it discovered the GRU had targeted two subsidiaries of Burisma - KUB Gas LLC and Esko Pivnich - as well as CUB Energy Inc, which previously did business with the company, using lookalike domains intended to trick employees into providing their email passwords.

Burisma and its subsidiaries share the same email server, Area 1 said, meaning a breach at any of the companies could expose them all.

The report gave a limited indication of how Area 1 determined that the lookalike domains were the work of the GRU, pointing mainly to similarities in how the hackers had previously set their digital traps. Area 1 co-founder Blake Darche said unpublished data gathered by his firm linked the operation to a specific officer in Moscow, whose identity he was unable to establish.

But Darche said “we are 100 percent certain” that the GRU was behind the hacking.

An outside researcher, Kyle Ehmke of Virginia-based cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect, who reviewed the malicious domains flagged by Area 1, said based on the information he had seen, he believed “with moderate confidence” that the websites were devised by the GRU.

Ehmke said that the hacking operation against Burisma used methods consistent with Russian hackers associated with the GRU, but that a complete picture was lacking.

John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis with U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye, told Reuters the domains discovered by Area 1 are “consistent” with other known APT28 activities.

Russian spies have routinely targeted Ukrainian energy firms with cyberattacks since Russia threw its weight behind a separatist takeover in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

U.S. intelligence officials have issued warnings that Russia is working to intervene in the November 2020 election. Trump is seeking re-election and Biden is a leading opponent out of a dozen Democrats seeking their party's nomination.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Joe Biden, did not comment directly on the hack but said in an email: “Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fl55kn/article30579728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VZ3CYBERCRIMEKI22,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russian-hackers-targeted-ukrainian-company-at-center-of-impeachment-storm-cybersecurity-firm/article30631012.ece

At the very start of his career, way back in 1999, he had made a much celebrated documentary, called The Forgotten Army, on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army (INA), also known as Azad Hind Fauj, that had played a key role in India's fight for independence from British colonialism. “I was 25 then. It’s a story that never left me. It made me want to become a filmmaker,” he says.

He had always nursed the desire to turn it into a feature film to cover the subject with more depth and in its rightful magnitude and to take INA’s untold stories to the masses. Producer Aditya Chopra was the natural ally but even he was overwhelmed and intimidated by the sheer size and scope of the enterprise.

Fighting for ideals

It celebrates the contribution of Indian soldiers who quit their jobs in the British Indian Army during World War II, to free their motherland from the British. According to Khan, their contributions went unrecognised in the light of Mahatma Gandhi’s popular non-violent movement and also for its controversial association with the Imperial Japan Army. The bit we know about the INA also has to do more with Netaji. “We don’t have the foggiest idea about the 55,000 foot soldiers. The series sees the times through their eyes. It’s about their trials and tribulations,” says Khan, of his first foray into the web space.

In retrospect, he is happy for it to have taken the original series rather than the movie route. “Mainstream cinema demands oversimplification to reach out to the lowest common denominator,” Khan thinks. How? Like the insistence that every character speak in Hindi. He was able to do away with that but retained the smattering of languages represented by the INA’s diverse set of soldiers.

True to history

It took him six months to rewrite the original film script and break it into the five episode structure. Much of the series has been shot on location, in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and India. But elements like the City Hall of 1942 Singapore had to be recreated on a big scale. “Sometimes the scale itself is the story,” he says, explaining that if it were not for the scale we would continue buying the rather dismissive British narrative of the INA being just a “ragtag bunch of rebels”. “In fact, it was a proper, structured army,” he asserts.

The extensive research done on the documentary, all those years ago ensured that Khan had internalised the details well into his system. He has remained a “slave to history” here as well, in the sense that the events portrayed are true. Where Khan has taken liberty is in merging the stories, say of three real dramatis personae into one character on screen. The series has the love story of two soldiers — Sodhi and Maya — at the heart of it.

The INA, incidentally was the founder of world’s first and only woman infantry regiment, the Jhansi Ki Rani regiment. The show, also raises several questions about identity, cost of independence and the idea of motherland. Set in two different eras and generations, it has a contemporary resonance to it, especially in the way it examines the idea of patriotism that has become unduly contentious, and moves away from the toxic tone it has acquired of late. “It looks at who is Indian or Indian enough,” says Khan. The theme of nationalism gets carried forward in his forthcoming sports film 83 as well with Ranveer Singh playing Kapil Dev, the captain of the Indian cricket team that had lifted the World Cup in 1983. Says Khan: “In a way it’s also about showing love for your country through sports, about loving your country without hating the other.”

36,2020/01/23,Netflix’s 'Spinning Out': Skating show that takes its sport and sportspeople very seriously,"I’ll admit that I didn’t know much about figure skating before I started tuning into Netflix’s Spinning Out. I hadn’t watched beyond a dozen videos on YouTube until I binged on the show. Not that I’ve been completely inspired to take to the ice now; I broke my ankle once while running down the stairs, so, it’s definitely hard for me to imagine myself prancing around in those deadly skates. And the takeaways don’t involve the sport per se, as it’s got more to do with being honest and accepting the truth. Those traits could have been added anywhere and it’d have probably felt the same, but when they come out of conversations that take place in the rinks, hospitals, and luxurious lodges, they become doubly interesting. And when you glance at those snowy mountains, where most of the exterior scenes have been filmed, it’s sure to take you to another world.

Kat (Kaya Scodelario) and Serena (Willow Shields) are sisters, who sometimes can’t stand each other, but when they’re not yelling, they’re thick as thieves. It’s not unusual for familial relationships to have so many up-and-down swings in a span of 24 hours. You may have to remember that the bond they share with their mother, Carol (January Jones), is also fried in a similar pan. You might call it a crazy family, since outsiders refer to the three of them as such in many places. However, they’ve their own sweet-and-sour reasons to go berserk. Carol and Kat both suffer from bipolar disorder and their mental health issues are supposed to be secrets, for they live in a world of tough competition.

The first season, which has ten episodes, is layered with each character, even those of the coaches’, getting their own arcs. Their screen time isn’t divided equally, as this isn’t an ensemble in those terms. But they’re well-rounded and that’s what makes this show appear pristine in its form. When a Russian coach recalls how she had to let go of the woman she was truly in love with, as she had to choose between owning her sexuality and focusing on the Olympics in the decades that had no big rainbow flags, you sense a kind of sadness wherein words won’t be able to do justice. If the series had delved into it for a bit longer, it would have, perhaps, become a companion piece to Jill Soloway’s Transparent. Yet, with a handful of dialogues and scenes, it makes a grand statement.

Samantha Stratton, creator of Spinning Out, also shakes up the rich-boy-bad-attitude template to give us a young guy who’s not a man-child at heart. Justin (Evan Roderick) is an uncomplicated and a simple-to-understand fellow who misses his mother every now and then. Had this been a straightforward romantic comedy like To All the Boys I've Loved Before, his smiling face would have gently been made fun of. Along with Kat, his skating and romantic partner, his journey, too, seems fascinating. He goes from throwing flirtatious looks at women he meets in parties to saying, “I love you,” (a huge three-word sentence that he seldom uses) and getting hurt when he doesn’t get what he wants. And there’s never a place where he acts like he’s the boss, even though he actually is.

We get a couple of lines that talk about his love for skating, but it’s not a moment that’s written in capital letters, like the one Kat says, “Skating is like breathing… and if I stopped, it’d feel like drowning.” Do spoiled brats care about their careers as much as the common, middle-class folks? Well, if Justin becomes an inspiration for the moneyed Generation Z kids, they might finally learn to do something with their lives. Or is he just a drop in the ocean? Anyway, Spinning Out doesn’t roll out characters that have issues (mental health, trust, fear, dependency) just for the sake of being “woke”. It believes in being a show that takes its sport and sportspeople very seriously.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vio8qn/article30632853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bgfrtv2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/netflixs-spinning-out-skating-show-that-takes-its-sport-and-sportspeople-very-seriously/article30632854.ece
37,2020/01/23,Indian Army’s physical casualties get a helping hand,"Colonel Vembu Shankar, SC (Shaurya Chakra), sits across the table and taps his phone. I tell him the name of the vivacious girl from over a decade ago who became an Indian Army officer and did our college proud but died in a road accident. She was from another State, no one seemed to know anything about her Next of Kin (NOK). Shankar, his miniature medals pinned to his jacket and side cap firmly on his head, looks up from his phone and tells me her name, regiment and the last known address of her family, surprisingly in Chennai.

“You should look them up,” he says. “It would mean a lot.”

Shankar’s Project Sambandh is a one-man, 1,000-day philanthropic programme that sees him traversing the country, making pit-stops in booming metropolises and villages that have fallen off the map, to connect with the NOK of Indian Army physical casualties (deaths due to non-operational circumstances). This is his second calling to serve the armed forces.

Back from Gujarat where he recently met widows of physical casualties — he has compiled a database of 35,000 and has met nearly 27,000 — Chennai-based Shankar, 45, says, “I connect with families of Indian Army personnel who have died while in service due to accidents, medical conditions, suicide or fratricide over the last 20 years and link them with stakeholders such as their Army units and the Government. I launched the project on August 15, 2017, and it will be completed by May 11, 2020. I retired after 20 years of service and have earmarked 15 days a month and 30% of my pension for this.”

While the Indian Army’s battle casualties occupy hallowed spaces in public and regimental memory, it is not so for physical casualties. Their youth spent at the altar of sacrifice and the future of their families fall through the cracks. “Widows of battle casualties have a better security umbrella. Children’s education is taken care of by the Government. She is better off financially and socially although emotionally it is the same. The wives of physical casualties are often young, barely educated, and draw only 30-60% pension,” says Shankar.

He explains: If a soldier from interior Bihar serving in a city dies due to snake bite, his wife receives insurance, his ex-gratia and goes to her in-law’s place. This is the address that the Army has with regard to village/tehsil/district. Her children move from a city CBSE school to a local school. The corpus may dry up soon due to wrong investments. After that, she is an unpaid maid in that house. So she moves to the city for a better future for her children; the Army does not have this updated address. “Often I find widows in one-room tenements dealing with the insecurities of being a single woman in India.”

Even wives of officers have it tough. “The Army has a corpus of crores, including donations from a generous public, scholarships for these children, and social outreach schemes. Money and policy is in place but the connect is not, and the schemes go largely unclaimed due to bureaucratic and communication hurdles. If they take one step, the Army will take 10, but unfortunately most units are so busy with operational duties that they can’t spare personnel.”

That’s where Shankar steps in, with the help of a few volunteers — Sambandh sahelis and sahayaks.

Man of many passions An avid quizzer, Col Vembu Shankar, SC has been a Mastermind India finalist and expert at Kaun Banega Crorepati.

A polyglot, he is credited with compiling the first English-Dzongkha-Hindi dictionary.

He has collected 8,000 autographs of luminaries from many fields. He learnt Portuguese to win Pele’s attention to get his autograph. “Getting autographs is like an ambush. You have to prepare for it.”

An amateur magician, he performs for charity at military hospitals.

Before he became the pointsman for his project, individually verifying kin and talking to Army formations, Shankar, born in Calcutta and raised in Madras as the youngest of three sons of a publisher, had a childhood filled with books. “I decided to join the forces when I was 11, inspired by a book on the Indian Army by the NBT. As a Rashtrapati Scout, I loved the feel of the uniform, and represented India in Japan for a jamboree.” He then joined the National Defence Academy as a 17-year-old; and was commissioned in 1997 into the Intelligence Corps.

It was while on attachment with the Dogra Scouts, a unit skilled in mountain warfare, that Shankar was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for gallantry in Kupwara. He was posted in Bhutan, where he worked in close alliance with the present king and his father. Shankar rounded off his career by commanding his unit in Bagdogra.

“Among my duties was to report on unnatural, non-operational deaths. When I liasioned with the kin, I didn’t get satisfactory answers because of holes in the data. Records maintained it as long as they were in service and the Army handheld them till the pension flowed in. After that, they were just a number. It rankled.”

Shankar says that people are more than willing to help with mentorship and monetary aid. Often, when he first meets the family the overwhelming reaction is of anger though he has gone on to forge warm bonds with many of the children. “Many feel they have been forgotten. As a nation, I feel we should set that right.”

38,2020/01/23,ED summons Tata Trusts’ ex-managing trustee,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned former Tata Trusts managing trustee R. Venkataramanan to be present before it on February 10, 2020, at 10 a.m., along with relevant documents in connection with a money laundering case.

The summons, a copy of which was reviewed by The Hindu, was sent by the ED’s Assistant Director Rajeev Ranjan, who is investigating the case under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Calls made to Mr. Venkataramanan, popularly known as Venkat, for his comments remained unanswered till the time of going to press.

Mr. Venkataramanan quit Tata Trusts last year amid allegations of misuse of I-T exemptions and is under the lens of investigative agencies.

Venkataramanan had also resigned from RNT Associates Private Limited, the personal investment vehicle of Tata group patriarch Ratan Tata.

ED had earlier summoned senior functionaries of AirAsia, including its chief executive officer Tony Fernandes, for recording statements in connection with a money laundering case.

The ED had earlier registered the case on the basis of an FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation in April 2018. Mr. Fernandes, AirAsia India Limited (AAIL) and its director R. Venkataramanan, AirAsia Berhad (Malaysia) and others were accused of violating FDI norms and paying bribes in an attempt to get an international operations licence.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cilj2d/article24040904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th30-jagriti-TaG0H43229M3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ed-summons-tata-trusts-ex-managing-trustee/article30637094.ece
39,2020/01/23,"KMF eyes new markets, exports to achieve ₹25,000-crore sales","Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), the second-largest milk co-operative after Amul and which manufactures and retails its products under the Nandini brand, has announced plans to penetrate new markets and enhance milk procurement by over 20% in six months to meet the projected demand.

The company has chalked out plans to increase the milk output to 1 crore litres per day, a top official said.

“In consultation with our chairman, we have decided to increase procurement of milk to 1 crore litres per day within six months, from 80,000 lakh litres per day. We will do this by getting more co-operatives under our fold and increasing the number of cows our farmers have,” B.C. Sateesh, managing director, KMF, said in an interview. He said KMF, which was focussing on value-added milk products for better yields, was planning to supply these products all over India in the next 18 months. “Currently, except for four States, we are present everywhere. Our aim is to cover the whole of India and we are doing it,” he said.

KMF is also laying emphasis on exports. After finding success in the Singapore market, KMF has initiated talks with suppliers in West Asia to export cow ghee, which is in demand there.

“The UAE market is very promising and we will start exports to that country shortly. It is a ₹300-crore market for ghee and we expect good response,” Mr. Sateesh said. Currently the company has 100 types of products in its portfolio which will be introduced in different markets in phases, he said.

KMF is increasing its presence in Maharashtra and is close to acquiring a dairy plant. Negotiations are on with three companies and an announcement is imminent. “I have visited facilities in Panvel near Mumbai and Goa. I am going to see a facility in Pune. We will be announcing the acquisition soon. There is also proposal for contract manufacturing,” he said.

After successfully introducing Nandini branded milk and milk products in Maharashtra, mainly Mumbai, about three years ago, KMF has now introduced Nandini cheese. Initially it will focus on the institutional market of Mumbai which comprises hotels, restaurants, cafés and B2B sector.

It is targeting a 20% market share of cheese of this institutional segment in Mumbai within two years, top executives said.

KMF, which has a turnover of over ₹15,000 crore, is eyeing ₹25,000 crore in sales over years.

Having invested ₹2,000 crore in building plant and infrastructure, KMF will now invest ₹100 crore every year on both green field and brown field expansion within Karnataka and elsewhere, officials said.

“Nandini’s cheese manufacturing plant is spread across 45 acres and has come with an investment of ₹600 crore. We expect to capture major chunk of institutional cheese market in Maharashtra,” M.T. Kulkarni, marketing director, KMF, said.

“Our cheese plant has a capacity 40 metric tonnes per day, which can be increased by ten-fold,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9bwyen/article30636894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBUNandini,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kmf-eyes-new-markets-exports-to-achieve-25000-crore-sales/article30636895.ece

43,2020/01/23,"SEBI eyes AI, machine learning to fix market manipulation","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) plans to acquire technology to monitor social media, which, as per the watchdog, is being extensively used for market manipulation.

The regulator has already issued a tender to acquire such technology and also has plans to further augment its analytical capabilities using advanced technology-based tools.

“Social media platforms are increasingly being used by manipulators for market manipulation,” SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi said while addressing a conference jointly organised by the regulator and the National Institute of Securities Markets.

“We want to acquire technology and un-structure data analysis because the structured data analysis is not helping much. Manipulators use all sort of things. So, analysis of what is coming in social media, which largely is unstructured data, and language processing is a must to see in addition to pricing volume changes. We intend acquiring that technology,” he said on the sidelines.

The SEBI chief also said that the watchdog had already issued a tender to acquire such technology even as monitoring of social media was already on at the regulatory body in the context of price or volume issues.

Meanwhile, the capital markets regulator has also planned a ‘data lake’ project using tools like machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data analysis among other things.

Data lake refers to a repository of data that is stored in a very raw or unstructured manner.

“Use of advanced technological tools such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, natural language processing etc., that enable collection, filtering and analysis of such unstructured data will greatly augment surveillance capabilities,” Mr. Tyagi said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-eyes-ai-machine-learning-to-fix-market-manipulation/article30636862.ece
44,2020/01/23,No coercive action for missing AGR date,"The Department of Telecom will not take any ‘coercive’ action against telecom companies that fail to meet the January 23 deadline to pay dues related to adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

“You are directed not to take any coercive action against the licencees in case they fail to comply with the Supreme Court order, until further orders,” a directive from DoT’s Licensing Finance Policy Wing sent to its Controllers of Communication Accounts (CCAs) and Controller General of Communication Accounts (CGCA), said.

The Licensing Finance Policy Wing, in its order, has also sought a detailed status report of compliance to be sent to the CGCA by January 24. According to sources, while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have sought more time to pay their dues, given that the Supreme Court would hear their plea to modify its October 24 order next week, Reliance Jio has paid about ₹195 crore to the telecom department to clear all AGR-related dues up till January 31, 2020.

Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India had approached the DoT, requesting the government to wait for the Supreme Court’s direction on the modification plea filed by them.

‘Willing to comply’

They had, however, clarified that they were willing to comply with the apex court’s order, the source added.

The two firms are among the worst impacted by the Supreme Court order. In the case of Bharti Airtel, the liabilities add up to nearly ₹35,586 crore, of which ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and ₹13,904.01 crore SUC dues (excluding dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).

In the case of Vodafone Idea, the number stands at a cumulative ₹53,038 crore, including ₹24,729 crore of SUC dues and ₹28,309 crore in licence fee. Following the Supreme Court’s October 24 order on calculation of AGR in favour of the government, telecom operators together owe the government around ₹1.47 lakh crore in licence fees and spectrum usage charge, including interest and penalties.

The Supreme Court had asked the telcos to clear the dues within three months.

While the telcos had filed a review petition, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, earlier this month, dismissed petitions filed by them.

The operators — Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices — have since then filed a modification plea, seeking more time to pay the statutory dues.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rdik35/article30636853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Missed-Callbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-coercive-action-for-missing-agr-date/article30636856.ece

48,2020/01/23,Reliance to ramp up gas output from R cluster fields,"Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) is gearing up for new gas production from its Krishna Godavari (KG) basin fields on India’s east coast.

The development comes in the backdrop of the company witnessing its lowest gas production in the December quarter to 1.53 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) from its KG D6 block.

Average gas production from the D1D3 field for the quarter stood at 1.53 mmscmd from three wells as the field is in a late-life stage with challenges associated with sand and water ingress.

RIL’s domestic oil and gas production is likely to drop further as the company has handed over the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields back to the government in December 2019 after operating them for 25 years.

These fields produced 3.9 mmscmd of gas and 10 barrels of oil per day (bopd) during the quarter.

RIL is taking significant steps along with its partner BP to reverse the production decline in domestic upstream with the development of R cluster series in the KG D6 block. “There is a lot of visibility on the gas production and we are targeting the first gas mid 2020,” said V. Srikanth, joint CFO, RIL told The Hindu.

Initially, RIL is expected to produce five million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas from the R-Cluster field, while the satellite cluster is expected to produce gas from mid-2021. Theproject will start production from mid-2022.

50,2020/01/23,"Unlike its peers, Tata Motors to continue with diesel cars","Tata Motors Ltd. (TML) will continue to produce diesel cars, unlike its peers who have decided to discontinue these vehicles in favour of petrol variants, said a top official.

“We will continue to produce diesel variants of our popular models as long as our customers want them,” said Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicles business unit, Tata Motors Ltd.

“Let the customers decide whether they want diesel variants or not,” he said.

Announcing the launch of petrol and diesel variants of Tata Altroz here, he said: “We will give our customers a choice. Other car manufacturers are doing away with diesel variants without giving a choice to the customers. This is the only car in the premium hatchback segment to come with a diesel variant.” Asked about the status of BS-IV cars, he said as on December 31, 2019 the company had cleared the entire lot. Currently, all the vehicles produced and rolled out by TML adhered to BS-VI norms. TML had 7,300 BS-IV units, equivalent to one week’s stock, with dealers and they too would be cleared soon. Going forward, the company would strive to maintain at least two weeks’ stock of BS-VI vehicles with dealers.

Mr. Pareek said Altroz was the second vehicle from TML’s portfolio to have bagged a five-star safety rating in the adult occupation protection category at the Global New Car Assessment Programme (GNCAP) crash tests.

“None of the Indian auto majors have given their cars for GNCAP tests. They are not doing anything of this. We have done it and bagged the award. I request all the global auto manufacturers to make their vehicle safe for others,” he said.

He also said Tata Motors had decided to follow the ‘one India-one price’ for its vehicles.

51,2020/01/23,RBI reopens scheme for FPI investments in debt,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to reopen allotment of the investment limit under the revised Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) for debt investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from January 24.

The investment limit under VRR has been increased to ₹1,50,000 crore from the ₹75,000 crore of the earlier scheme, with a minimum retention period of three years.

“FPIs that have been allotted investment limits under VRR may, at their discretion, transfer their investments made under the General Investment Limit to VRR,” the RBI said on Thursday. In March 2019, the RBI introduced a separate channel, the ‘Voluntary Retention Route’ , to enable FPIs to invest in debt markets in India. Investments through VRR are free of the macro-prudential and other regulatory prescriptions applicable to FPI investments in debt markets, provided FPIs voluntarily commit to retain a required minimum percentage of their investments in India for a particular period.The RBI said ₹54,300 crore had already been invested under the previous scheme. “Based on the feedback received, and in consultation with the government, the bank has made certain amendments in the scheme to increase its operational flexibility,” it said. Investment limits will be available on tap and allotted on a first-come, first-served basis, the RBI said. Separately, the central bank has raised investment limit for FPIs in government and corporate bonds, in a move to attract more foreign funds into the country.

Prior to the announcement, short-term investments by an FPI could not exceed 20% of the total investment of that FPI in either central government securities (including treasury bills) or State development loans. The same was applicable on investments in corporate bonds. This limit has now been raised from 20% to 30% in both the cases.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-reopens-scheme-for-fpi-investments-in-debt/article30636729.ece

53,2020/01/23,"SEBI to tap artificial intelligence, big data analytics to curb market manipulations","SEBI is acquiring capabilities to monitor and analyse social media posts to keep a tab on possible market manipulations, its Chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Thursday.

He said the capabilities will involve use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics and natural language processing tools to spot market manipulation.

The new plan involves creating a “data lake” project to augment analytical capabilities, he said while speaking at the Speaking at the National Institute of Securities Markets at Patalganga near here.

In efforts to curb possible manipulations in the securities market, SEBI has been keeping a watch on social media and there have been cases where social media posts have helped in acting against manipulative activities.

“Catching malpractices in the market using the standard tools that analyse only structured data of price and volume is increasingly getting difficult,” Mr. Tyagi said.

“We want to acquire technology and unstructure data analysis because the structured data analysis is not helping much, manipulators use all sort of things,” he noted.

A tender has also been floated for acquiring the technology.

Even in the absence of such a focused tool, Mr. Tyagi said SEBI already has capabilities, wherein it screens social media posts after corporate announcements and the changes in price and volumes of a scrip.

The SEBI chief said application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) tools has the potential to bring a paradigm shift in the securities market landscape, adding that blockchain can be used in clearing and settlement activities.

AI/ML tools are being increasingly deployed in fund management, trading, supervision and surveillance functions in the capital markets, he added.

Further, Mr. Tyagi said there is a need for the technologists to invest time in research in these tools for applications in the capital markets.

Systemic risks are becoming important objectives for financial regulators, Mr. Tyagi said, explaining that this requires identification and monitoring of important financial institutions, leverage, inter-connectedness, risk concentrations and market sentiment.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g3k9ri/article30577966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-to-tap-artificial-intelligence-big-data-analytics-to-curb-market-manipulations/article30633040.ece
54,2020/01/23,"Withdrawal limits based on PMC Bank’s ability to repay, says RBI","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has informed the Delhi High Court that restrictions were imposed on cash withdrawals from Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank after its liquidity position and ability to repay were reviewed.

The RBI has imposed the restrictions after an alleged fraud involving ₹4,355 crore came to light. The preliminary inquiry has revealed that the bank had lent over 70% of its loans to Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL).

The RBI filed the affidavit in response to a petition filed by social activist Bejon Kumar Misra for protection of the depositors.

The RBI said that after reviewing the bank’s liquidity position and ability to repay its depositors and to mitigate the hardship of the depositors, it had progressively enhanced the limit for withdrawals from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000, then to ₹25,000 and ₹40,000. Now, the limit is ₹50,000 with effect from November 5, 2019. “With the latest relaxation, 78% of the depositors will be able to withdraw their entire account balance,” the RBI said.

It said the withdrawal ceiling was being monitored vis-à-vis the bank’s evolving depositor and liquidity profiles, and further action might be taken in the best interest of depositors.

In his petition, Mr. Misra sought a direction to the government and the RBI to constitute a committee to look into the working of co-operative banks. He also sought guidelines to safeguard the money of the people deposited in co-operative banks. Mr. Misra also wanted a full insurance cover for the money deposited in co-operative banks, including nationalised banks.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/withdrawal-limits-based-on-pmc-banks-ability-to-repay-says-rbi/article30620002.ece
55,2020/01/23,Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar finds ‘loopholes’ in PM assassination plot case,"A letter found on Delhi-based activist Rona Wilson documenting an alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be a “spoof” that was obtained from suspicious sources, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is believed to have told the Pune police during a review of the chargesheet filed in the “urban naxal” cases.

The particular e-mail exchange between Maoists and the alleged “urban naxals” had only a single time stamp and not two — from both the receiver and the sender — thereby raising doubts over its authenticity.

In 15 days

The source of this e-mail and other evidence documented in the 5,000-page chargesheet framing 10 activists under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) must be substantiated in 15 days time, or the Maha Vikas Aghadi government will then appoint a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to re-look these cases against “urban naxals”, Mr. Pawar is believed to have told a police team from Pune.

A team of the Pune police, comprising Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Ravindra Kadam, who was the then Joint Commissioner of Pune Police, and the Chief Investigating Officer, Assistant Commissioner of Police Shivaji Pawar, made a presentation to the government on Thursday.

‘Certain loopholes’

“We have seen the presentation from the two officers and believe there could be certain loopholes in the investigation as is being claimed by representations we have received. If some of the evidence made part of the charge-sheet are not substantiated, we are willing to re-open the investigation. A decision will be taken in the next 15 days,” Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Desmukh said.

Sources in the Maharashtra Home Department said the review also took cognisance of the two letters written by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on January 10 demanding a SIT on the “cooked up” charges framed against a dozen activists following the Elgar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon violence of 2017.

Following the violence, several activists connected to the Parishad were arrested in August 2018, including Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao — accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). The Pune Police charge-sheet also alleged that a letter recovered from one of the accused had revealed an “assassination conspiracy” against PM Narendra Modi.

Scope of investigation

The review meeting was attended by Maharashtra Director General Subodh Jaiswal and State Intelligence Commissioner Rashmi Shukla. The review also discussed the scope of investigation into the alleged tapping of phones of the arrested activists, and if this was done using illegally procured a malware from Israel, officials said.

“We have also ordered a probe into allegations that spyware Pegasus was used to snoop on officials and activists in the State during the previous government’s rule.

Earlier in the day, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs V Muraleedharan said an Indian nurse working at Al-Hayat hospital in Saudi Arabia was tested positive for coronavirus.

In a tweet, he said, “Update from @CGIJeddah: About 100 Indian nurses mostly from Kerala working at Al-Hayat hospital have been tested and none except one nurse was found infected by Corona virus. Affected nurse is being treated at Aseer National Hospital and is recovering well.”

The Minister said he spoke to the Indian Consulate in Jeddah after the Indian nurses were quarantined at the hospital due to the coronavirus threat.

Responding to his tweet, the Indian Consulate in Jeddah clarified that the nurse found positive for coronavirus was suffering for MERS-CoV and not 2019-NCoV (Wuhan).

Wearing a pheran, a long traditional robe worn in winters, and a karakul, traditional cap, Mr. Prasad said he felt happy after meeting people in Baramulla, where three militants were killed in two separate encounters since August 5. He toured, otherwise considered sensitive part of the town by the security agencies, and sipped tea at the Lovely Restaurant in Baramulla and met 18 delegations of locals.

Talented students

“I was happy to see a smile on the faces of children. Students in Baramulla have talent enough to compete at the national level,” Mr. Prasad said, inaugurating an indoor sports stadium at a cost of ₹7 crore.

To connect with local students and women, the Minister distributed six laptops among those girl students who recently topped Class 10 and 12 examinations from the district. Cheques worth ₹40,000 each were presented to beneficiaries under the Marriage Assistance Scheme (MAS) and baby kits among the mothers under the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme.

Locals’ demand

During meetings with delegations, locals demanded establishment of a software technology park, introduction of law studies, establishment of mobile mini towers in border areas, construction of additional bunkers, creation of WiFi zones at tourist and educational centres.

58,2020/01/23,Supreme Court employee who complained against former CJI reinstated,"A former woman employee of the Supreme Court who lodged a sexual harassment complaint against then sitting Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi has been reinstated.

Senior lawyer Vrinda Grover, who had legally aided the complainant, reacted to the development in a written statement that “the Supreme Court staffer stands vindicated.”

“Her reinstatement with full back wages is an acknowledgement of the truth of her affidavit complaining of sexual harassment and the systematic victimisation suffered by her and her family,” Ms. Grover stated.

The lawyer added that “the unfinished business of justice and accountability however remains. At an institutional level, this incident has once again highlighted the absence of an independent and effective mechanism to address a complaint of sexual harassment against a judge of the Supreme Court.”

In May 2019, an in-house committee led by the present Chief Justice of India, Justice Sharad A. Bobde, had found “no substance” in the sexual harassment allegations levelled by the woman against Justice Gogoi.

The committee report however continues to remain confidential. The Supreme Court had said that the report, as part of the in-house procedure, would not be placed in the public domain.

The inquiry was by nature purely preliminary, ad hoc and only for the purpose of getting information. The report was “wholly confidential” and existed “only for the purpose of satisfaction that such a report has been made.”

At the time, the complainant had reacted to the committee’s conclusion in a statement, saying “today, my worst fears have come true, and all hope of justice and redress from the highest court of the land have been shattered.”

The roller-coaster hearings of the committee had even seen the woman “walk out” of the hearings after she was refused a lawyer of her choice. The committee had then chosen to carry on ex-parte without her and went on to examine Chief Justice Gogoi, which was a first in the country’s history.

The crisis had tested the Supreme Court after several online websites published the excerpts from the woman’s complaint made out in affidavit form and sent out to 22 judges of the Supreme Court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/151r6z/article29889959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vrinda,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-employee-who-complained-against-former-cji-reinstated/article30636638.ece

The government urged the court to not entertain any “separatist” arguments during the hearing of petitions challenging the order and the subsequent bifurcation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories.

The five-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana reserved orders on the preliminary plea that the issue should be referred to a larger Bench.

The government opposed the plea for reference of the case to a larger Bench. Certain petitioners had sought a reference, claiming that two judgments of the apex court - Prem Nath Kaul versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1959 and Sampat Prakash versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1970 -- which considered Article 370 were in conflict with each other.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal submitted that the August 5 notification and the reorganisation of the State of J&K need to be accepted.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan countered that the court should indeed enquire into the 'Hand of God' that took away the “custodianship” of J&K on August 5. He also objected to referring the case to a larger Bench.

In the day-long hearing, the government side strongly argued that the accession of J&K was irrevocable. J&K was part of history of integration of States. Its sovereignty was only temporary. “We are a Union of States,”Mr. Venugopal submitted.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said political arguments should not be made in court by petitioners.

Mr. Dhavan, however, contended that August 5 saw a State dismembered. A State was devoured by the power of the Union. If the procedure for abrogation was not followed, the action of the Union government was susceptible to judicial review.

While the BJP alleged the government’s negligence had caused the death and it was followed by the police’s complacency, the Congress claimed the BJP was spreading lies.

“We are awaiting the post-mortem report to ascertain the cause of death. After sustaining burn injuries, he was having breathing issues here itself,” Amit Sanghi, Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu.

Dhanprasad Ahirwar, 24, of the Motinagar area in Sagar, suffered 70% burn injuries and underwent treatment locally for three days until January 17, when he was shifted to Bhopal, and later airlifted to New Delhi. He died on Thursday morning.

‘Petty dispute’

“It was a petty dispute between neighbours, and both the parties filed police complaints on January 12,” said Mr. Sanghi. “There is no Hindu-Muslim or caste conflict angle to the case.”

Three accused were arrested on January 15, and the remaining two accused were arrested a day later. A case was registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 325 of the the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The victim’s family had received a compensation of ₹1 lakh and will receive another ₹8.25 lakh soon.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath tweeted: “I offer my condolences to the family. In this moment of sadness, the government stands by them.”

Alleging inaction by the police, former chief minister and BJP vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “The government was silent when the goons thrashed his [the deceased’s] brother’s wife some days earlier. If the police had taken necessary steps then, probably a citizen wouldn’t have had to lose his life. The Congress is protecting the accused.”

Moreover, he claimed, although there were 30-40 goons, as told by the neighbours, the police had registered a case against only five persons. “At the behest of the government, has the police gone deaf and is giving silent support to the accused?” he asked.

The CJI said it was not for a judge to forgive a crime. The cardinal duty of a judge was to see if the punishment was proportionate to the crime. The law applied whether the criminal was a first-timer or a hardened one.

“Courts punish crime. If you go by the innocence of a human being, the worst criminal would have an innocent heart. There is nobody who is a criminal at the depth of their heart… It is not the judge but the law that deals with a criminal. A judge, being a human being, cannot forgive a murderer. The law and the judge act for society. Imagine a situation when a judge tells a murderer 'yes, I forgive you!'. Imagine the impact!” Chief Justice Bobde observed.

The CJI asked Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta whether a condemned person, who reforms after the award of the death sentence by a court, should be spared the noose.

Mr. Mehta replied, “If that is accepted, there will be no death penalty. You can't kill your parents and then claim mercy saying you are an orphan”.

The oral remarks came a day after the Centre filed an application, in the background of the Nirbhaya case, to modify a 2014 judgment of the Supreme Court in the Shatrughan Chauhan case. The 2014 verdict had issued guidelines, which primarily held that an unexplained delay in carrying out an execution would lead to commutation of the death penalty to life imprisonment.

In its application, the government asked the Supreme Court to set short deadlines for death row convicts to seek legal remedies. It wanted the court to limit the time for filing curative petitions. A mercy plea should be filed within a week of issuance of death warrant. If a mercy plea had been rejected, death warrant should be issued within the next seven days and execution carried out a week thereafter. The pendency of review or curative petitions of his co-convicts would be of no consequence for a man whose mercy plea had been rejected.

This application was filed after the four Nirbhaya convicts separately and repeatedly approached courts for one relief or the other. Their execution dates have already been extended from January 22 to February 1.

Mr. Mehta blamed the Chauhan judgment for being “convict-centric”. The 2014 guidelines should be tweaked to make them victim and society-centric, he argued.

The remarks and discussion on Thursday were part of a hearing of the review petitions filed by Shabnam and her partner, Salim, both of whom have been condemned to death for the murder of seven members of her family, including an infant.

Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, for the couple, said they were both first-time criminals. She argued that crimes, however heinous, should be seen separately from the criminals who committed them. There were many facets to a criminal. Ms. Arora argued that the couple have reformed in their years spent in prison after the death sentence. The court reserved the review petitions for judgment.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/o3w6eq/article30635925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bobde-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-condemned-man-cannot-fight-death-penalty-endlessly-cji/article30635920.ece
65,2020/01/23,A platform for dialogic and analytical engagement with critical issues finds wide appeal,"Experiments in crowdfunded journalism are not rare, but a project to build a body of long format interviews with global public intellectuals is finding wide appeal for its uniqueness. Jipson John and Jitheesh P.M., both in their twenties, already have hit it heavy with exhaustive interviews with 20 doyens including Noam Chomsky, M.S. Swaminathan, David Harvey and Akeel Bilgrami over the last 18 months. These interviews have appeared in publications including The Frontline and the American magazine Monthly Review, and the duo has now launched a crowdfunding initiative on ourdemocracy.in, endorsed by several of these intellectuals.

“I have read several of the interviews in the series and have been much impressed with their contents and insights. It is plainly a most valuable project,” Mr. Chomsky said in an endorsement. “The asking of questions and the debating of issues that impinge on our lives is absolutely critical,” said historian Romila Thapar in her endorsement.

“We are trying to develop a platform for dialogic and analytical engagement with the most critical issues of our time, through conversations ranging from 3,000 to 35,000 words. The focus is on two critical issues of our time: one, the alarming growth of right-wing religious forces and two, the devastating effects of market fundamentalism that brings unprecedented income and wealth inequality,” said Mr. John. “The campaign would run for the next few weeks. It is not that any specific amount matters as such, but it is the amount of support we could generate that will help us sustain our efforts. We hope that society will stand with us in supporting this campaign and project,” said Mr. Jitheesh.

The personalities covered in the series so far are from six countries including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Greece, Senegal and India. These pieces have been translated into 10 languages including French, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. Their project was selected for an international fellowship by Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research in 2018.

The money raised through crowdfunding will finance over the next one year interviews with not less than 30 more people from 12 countries including U.S. Democratic Party leader Bernie Sanders, French economist Thomas Piketty, Canadian journalist Naomi Klein and distinguished Nobel laureates, who have expressed interest in participating. “A project of this magnitude requires intense research, extensive travel and other post production work. So we need to have independent financial sources in order to be able to continue this project,” said Mr. John.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/v9efde/article30636044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-crowdfunding-pixabay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-platform-for-dialogic-and-analytical-engagement-with-critical-issues-finds-wide-appeal/article30635817.ece

67,2020/01/23,Coronavirus: Kerala CM writes to External Affairs Minister over infected nurse in Saudi Arabia,"Amid reports that a Keralite nurse working in Saudi Arabia has tested positive for the new Coronavirus, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on January 23 urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to take up the matter with the Gulf nation and ensure expert treatment.

Mr. Vijayan made the request in a letter to Mr. Jaishankar in this regard, a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said in Thiruvananthapuram.

The government should get in touch with its counterpart in Saudi Arabia and take urgent steps including ensuring expert treatment and protection to those affected from the virus.

The matter should be viewed seriously, Mr. Vijayan said in the letter.

Media reports on January 23 claimed that a nurse from Ettumannur in Kottayam district, working at the Al Hayat hospital in Saudi Arabia, had tested positive for the virus which has killed 17 people in China.

According to the reports, at least 30 nurses from the State had also been kept under isolation at the hospital and they had taken care of a Filipino nurse who had tested positive for the virus.

However, Health department sources in Thiruvananthapuram said they have no information about any nurses from the State having been affected.

The department has issued an alert in the wake of the virus outbreak in China.

68,2020/01/23,Congress slams government for erosion of democracy,"The Congress on Thursday targeted the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre for bringing India 10 places down in the global Democracy Index, with the former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram stating that “democracy has eroded and those in power are the real tukde tukde gang”.

In a series of tweets, the former Union minister said the world is alarmed at the direction India is taking and every Indian needs to be alarmed to.

“India has slipped 10 places in the Democracy Index. Anyone who has closely observed the events of the last two years knows that democracy has been eroded and democratic institutions have been debilitated. Those who are in power are the real tukde tukde gang,” Mr Chidambaram said.

“The world is alarmed by the direction India is taking. Every patriotic Indian should be alarmed too,” he added.

Addressing a press conference at the Congress headquarters, senior leader and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Manu Singhvi pointed out that India has come down to 51st rank (from an earlier 41st rank0 for the first time ever since the Democracy Index was started by the research wing of The Economist magazine in 2006.

He said whether it was action against students by the Union government or imposition of Section 144 to prevent any assembly of people or insistence on uniformity of culture and language, everything has diminished democracy.

Mr Singhvi said an atmosphere of fear and distrust now prevails and it has been accentuated with the new Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

“There is a cocktail of suspicion and distrust against the government and this should be avoided. When the atmosphere is of fear, trust deficit is humongous and when you have such rules then fear increases ten times,” he said.

Commenting on Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent statement that the CAA won’t be withdrawn despite the protests, the Congress spokesperson said it shows apathy towards the citizens of this country and said the BJP was now Bharatiya Jiddi (stubborn) Party.

“It is the people who are afraid of this government while the government should have been afraid of the people; when it is called the ‘death of democracy’ it’s not a sudden ambush but its slow extinction due to apathy, indifference and undernourishment,” Mr. Singhvi said.

He also criticised Union Minister Prakash Javadekar for saying certain columns in the NPR were only optional.

“When it is optional, then why is it there. Chances are that if the optional column is not filled, the person can be put in the doubtful [voter] list,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bwq23p/article30635612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIDAMBARAM-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cong-slams-govt-for-erosion-of-democracy/article30635594.ece
69,2020/01/23,Iltija Mufti alleges harrasment by special security group,"PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti on January 23 alleged that she was being “harassed” by her security detail, special security group (SSG), and said the Home Ministry should focus its resources on matters of grave importance rather than “stalking young women like me”.

She also alleged that she was constantly being monitored by the SSG, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in the Valley.

“After being manhandled & illegally detained in Kashmir, I am now being harassed by SSG which reports to MHA. My right to freedom cant be curtailed under [the] guise of ‘security & safety’.

70,2020/01/23,Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s new book narrates a tale of love across barriers,"Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who grabbed headlines this week for being the first minister in the Modi government to visit the Kashmir Valley, including an impromptu walkabout at Lal Chowk in Srinagar, will soon release his Hindi novel Balwa (Diamond Books), a fictional capture of love across the religious divide in the communally contested politics of the 1990s.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr Naqvi, who has screenwriter credits for Madhur Bhandarkar’s films “Corporate” and “Traffic Signal”, said the novel is drawn from his own experiences of how vested interests create communal strife and how common people are reeled in.

“This book has been with me for sometime, I took the time to complete it lately. The main characters in this book include religious leaders Maulana Mushtaq and Sankata Prasad and how a set of youngsters first get embroiled in their political games and then see through it all to strike a blow for love,” he said.

The plot includes descriptions of the administration and police and how they handle communally sensitive situations. Coming from the Minority Affairs Minister, the novel is interesting in the way that it frames communal conflict and the reasons behind it.

Kashmir interaction

Mr Naqvi, just back from Kashmir valley, said that he broke with protocol and his fixed itinerary to do a walkabout at Lal Chowk to the consternation of officials, but was heartened by the response he got from the people.

“I decided to stop my car and just walk around the market, and it took a while for people to realise that I was a Minister in the Government of India. The interaction was warm and I saw a different atmosphere than what people think in Delhi,” he said.

Prime Minister Modi’s brief to all touring ministers (36 in all, with Mr Naqvi being the first to visit the Valley) was to hold dialogue with as many delegations and people as possible, and try and bridge the developmental gaps.

“He told us to listen carefully to the people, especially if they are talking about long standing demands for schools, hospitals or roads etc. Railway connectivity was one of the big asks from the delegations that I met, and also boosting of tourism,” Mr Naqvi said.

When asked if anyone spoke of the lack on Internet connectivity in the Valley, Mr Naqvi said the Internet was available for essential services, but that the local administration had to take its own call keeping the security situation in mind.

Flurry of books

The novel Balwa is only the first of a three novel series that Mr. Naqvi is looking to release this year; the other two are Raj Leela and Cyber Supari.

The first in the series will be an interesting read for those not only interested in novels but also as a peek into the mind of India’s Minister for Minorities in the time of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pdxjqv/article30635448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAQVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ministers-tale-of-love-across-barriers/article30635449.ece

73,2020/01/23,ZSI documents another new snake eel species in Odisha,"A new snake eel species residing in the Bay of Bengal has been discovered and documented this month (January) by the Estuarine Biology Regional Centre (EBRC) of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) at Gopalpur-on-sea in Odisha.

This new marine species has been named Ophichthus kailashchandrai to honour the vast contributions of Dr. Kailash Chandra, Director of ZSI, to Indian animal taxonomy. Ophichthus kailashchandrai is the eighth species of the Ophichthus genus found on the Indian coast. It is the fifth new species discovered by the Gopalpur ZSI in the last two years.

In 2019, two new species of marine eel, Gymnothorax andamanensesis and Gymnothorax smithi were been discovered by this ZSI centre.

Dr. Anil Mohapatra, scientist at Gopalpur ZSI, with support of his associate Swarup Ranjan Mohanty and Dipanjan Ray of the Bajkul Milani Mahavidyalaya, West Bengal, and Subhendu Sekhar Mishra of the marine fish section of ZSI Kolkata, after detailed study, have identified the Ophichthus kailashchandrai as a completely new species. Discovery of this new marine snake eel species has also been acknowledged by Zootaxa, an international scientific journal for zoological taxonomy.

Bay of Bengal

Three specimens of the new species were collected from the Shankarpur fishing harbour in the northern region of the Bay of Bengal on the West Bengal coast in 2015. Detailed study for over four years led to the discovery that they belonged to a newly discovered species living in the Bay of Bengal.

The eel family ‘Ophichthidae’ comprises two sub-families — Myrophinae (69 species) and Ophichthinae (276 species). The sub-family Ophichthinae is identified by its hard tail and other osteological (bone) features, and it has 17 genera and 24 species. Out of them, seven species from the Ophichthus genus were earlier identified in Indian waters. The recent discovery is the eighth species of this genus.

The Ophichthus kailashchandrai lives at a depth of around 50 metres in the sea. According to the studied specimens, individuals of this species are around 420 mm to 462 mm in length. They are light brown in colour, with white fins. They have a well-developed pectoral fin and also have a dorsal fin. Their posterior nostril is a hole covered by a flap on the upper lip opening towards the mouth. There are 180-182 total vertebrae in this new species. Their teeth are moderately elongated, conical and sharp.

Unexplored biodiversity

Ophichthus kailashchandrai feeds on small fish and crabs. The outer surface of their bodies is slimy but they are not poisonous, said Dr. Mohapatra. “The discovery of the new species suggests that the marine biodiversity of the long Indian coastline is still considerably unexplored. More explorations of this biodiversity will help in its conservation and proper utilisation,” said Dr. Mohapatra.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m337s0/article30635221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200122-WA0026,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zsi-documents-another-new-snake-eel-species-in-odisha/article30635222.ece
74,2020/01/23,No word from Nirbhaya convicts on last meeting with parents,"The four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case are yet to inform the Tihar jail authorities about when they want to meet their families for the last time or whom they want to ‘will’ their property, officials said on Thursday, nine days ahead of their execution date set by a Delhi court. The four convicts, Vinay Shrama (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan Gupta (25), who are lodged in separate cells of Jail No.3 where the execution will take place, are scheduled to be hanged at 6 a.m. on February 1.

“After the death warrants were issued, the convicts were asked when they would like to meet their respective families for the last time and if so, who all do they wish to meet. But none of them have responded yet,” a senior jail official, elaborating about the procedure before executing death row convicts, said.

The official said the convicts were also asked if they would want to prepare their ‘will’, but they have not responded yet.

“The family of all the four convicts are allowed to meet them twice a week but the last date of meeting has not been fixed because they still have not responded,” he said.

On Wednesday, in a plea filed by the Centre before the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Home Affairs said heinous crime convicts are taking the “judicial process for a ride”.

They demanded fixing a seven-day deadline for execution of condemned prisoners after issuance of black warrant, amid the delay in the hanging of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape-murder case.

Dummy execution of the four death row convicts was performed in the prison last week.

The officials recorded the weights of the convicts and then prepared the dummies accordingly with sacks filled with debris and stones, a senior jail official said.

The execution will take place in Jail No.3, the official said, adding that the Uttar Pradesh Prison authority has confirmed that Pawan Jallad from Meerut will be sent to hang the four convicts.

The Tihar authorities had written to the Uttar Pradesh prison officials, seeking the services of two hangmen from the State for the execution.

All the four convicts are likely to be hanged simultaneously. The jail authorities were also holding conversations with them on a daily basis to ensure that they were in a good mental state, the official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8u73ol/article30635217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-tihar-jail,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-word-from-nirbhaya-convicts-on-last-meeting-with-parents/article30635218.ece

A major attraction at the parade will be the anti-satellite missile tested under Mission Shakti by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Army will showcase the recently inducted 155-mm Dhanush towed howitzer.

Before the parade starts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the nation in paying homage to the fallen soldiers, laying a wreath at the National War Memorial, the flame of the immortal warrior, at India Gate, a release from the Army said on Thursday.

The National War Memorial is located at the ‘C’ Hexagon near India Gate. It was built in memory of 22,500 Indian soldiers who had laid down their lives for the country after Independence. A new Amar Jawan Jyoti was also established there.

Since its inauguration in February last year, the National War Memorial has been the venue for the guard of honour at all national events. The Amar Jawan Jyoti will be used for regimental events.

76,2020/01/23,"Congress suffering from ‘mental bankruptcy’, says J.P. Nadda","Newly elected BJP national president J.P. Nadda on Thursday slammed the Congress for opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), saying the leadership of the Party was suffering from “mental bankruptcy”.

“The Congress has lost all hopes. Its leadership is suffering from ‘manasik diwaliyapan’ [mental bankruptcy]. The statements issued by the Party in the last eight months will reflect that these are intended to help Pakistan,” he said.

Nadda was addressing a public meeting in Agra in support of the amended law three days after taking over the reins from Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

The 59-year-old leader from Himachal Pradesh was elected as the BJP’s 11th president on January 20 after he emerged as the only nominee in the fray.

In an apparent reference to the leaders of the BSP and the SP, he said, “These days Dalit leaders are opposing the CAA. These Dalit leaders and the Congress hardly know anything about the CAA and are only spreading canards to mislead people.”

Nadda said the political innings of the two Parties was over and they have understood that times have changed and the country is marching rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Seeking to allay apprehensions created by the Congress that minority community members will lose their citizenship under the new law, the BJP chief said, “The CAA is to give citizenship and not to snatch it.

77,2020/01/23,K4 test and new fighter base boost India’s Act East Policy,"India’s decision to test the K4 Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) and to establish a new base of Sukhoi-30 fighter jets not far from the Bay of Bengal coast is adding new teeth to its Act East Policy.

It is also reinforcing lines of contact with China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a giant connectivity project on land and sea.

The 3,500-km range K4 missile, which can be launched from Arihant class nuclear submarines, add a new dimension to India’s second strike capability—the ability to carry out a retaliatory nuclear attack after absorbing an initial strike by an atomic weapon. The newly acquired heft to carry out a crushing nuclear counterattack with an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM), from a concealed underwater platform, steels India’s nuclear deterrent.

Nuclear triad

India has been developing its nuclear triad, enabling launch of atomic weapons from land, air and sea, following the 1998 atomic tests.

The K4’s 3,500 km reach, which can cover the entire Pakistan and the industrial heartland of China, helps in providing assured deterrence in the region, which includes the 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other territories in the West Pacific.

Symbolically, the K4’s launch from the Andhra Pradesh coastline in the Bay of Bengal resonates India’s Act East Policy of raising New Delhi’s diplomatic and military profile in the Indo-Pacific. The ASEAN centered Act East Policy covers the Malacca Straits—the critical link and trade artery between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, as well as areas that lie beyond, including some of the island territories in the Pacific.

In the West Pacific, China has also been beefing up its nuclear deterrent to counter the accumulation of forces under the United States’ Indo-Pacific Command, in Guam, Okinawa in Japan, South Korea and Australia. China’s Jin class nuclear submarines deploy Jl-12 SLBMs, which have a range of 7,400 km.

In tune with its economic rise, China has also been open about enlarging its footprint in the Indian Ocean, with a base in Djibouti. Besides, it is developing the port of Gwadar in Pakistan in the Arabian Sea and Kyaukpyu in Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal, under the BRI flag.

India, on its part, has built the deep water port of Sittwe in Myanmar, while Japan, which also has points of friction with China, is constructing the Matarbari deep water port in Bangladesh, in accordance with Tokyo’s India backed Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy.

Shortly after the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Myanmar last week, the paths of China’s BRI and India’s Act East Policy are intersecting again. Government sources told The Hindu that Chief of the Naval Staff Karambir Singh is heading to Myanmar to finalise transfer of one of India’s Kilo Class submarine.

Sukhois in Thanjavur airbase

The unveiling of the Thanjavur airbase last week, where the Su-30 multi-role fighter jets have been deployed, has also reinforced the military dimension of India’s Act East Policy. Analysts say that with mid-air refuelling, the Sukhoi would bring the Malacca straits within its strike range. Besides, the Su-30 fighters will deploy the deadly BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles-a highly potent joint venture enterprise of India and Russia.

As part of the Act East Policy, Thailand and Philippines are in talks with India to buy BrahMos missiles, the sources said. Philippines had raised a missile unit which, in future, will operate the BrahMos. Thailand is also in talks to join India’s coastal surveillance radar chain.

78,2020/01/23,India slips two places on global corruption perception index,"India’s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI-2019) has slipped from 78 to 80 compared to the previous year, said Transparency International on Thursday, while questioning the “unfair and opaque political financing” in the country. Its score of 41 out of 100 remains the same.

In democracies like India and Australia, unfair and opaque political financing, undue influence in decision-making and lobbying by powerful corporate interest groups, has resulted in stagnation or decline in the control of corruption, observed the report.

The latest CPI report has revealed that a majority of countries are showing little to no improvement in tackling corruption.

‘Serious challenges’

“Our analysis also shows corruption is more pervasive in countries where big money can flow freely into electoral campaigns and where governments listen only to the voices of wealthy or well-connected individuals,” said Transparency International.

The 2019 CPI draws on 13 surveys and expert assessments to measure public sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, giving each a score from zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean).

In the Asia Pacific region, the average score is 45, after many consecutive years of an average score of 44, which “illustrates general stagnation” across the region. China has improved its position from 87 to 80 with a score of 41 out of 100, a two-point jump.

“Despite the presence of high performers like New Zealand (87), Singapore (85), Australia (77), Hong Kong (76) and Japan (73), the Asia Pacific region hasn’t witnessed substantial progress in anti-corruption efforts or results. In addition, low performers like Afghanistan (16), North Korea (17) and Cambodia (20) continue to highlight serious challenges in the region,” the report said.

According to Transparency International, while often seen as an engine of the global economy, in terms of political integrity and governance, the region performs only marginally better than the global average.

‘Avoid scrutiny’

“Many countries see economic openness as a way forward, however, governments across the region, from China to Cambodia to Vietnam, continue to restrict participation in public affairs, silence dissenting voices and keep decision-making out of public scrutiny,” it said.

Given these issues, it comes as no surprise that vibrant economic powers like China (41), Indonesia (40), Vietnam (37), the Philippines (34) and others continue to struggle to tackle corruption, according to the report.

The top ranked countries are New Zealand and Denmark, with scores of 87 each, followed by Finland (86), Singapore (85), Sweden (85) and Switzerland (85). The countries ranked at the bottom of the list are Somalia, South Sudan and Syria with scores of 9, 12 and 13. These countries are closely followed by Yemen (15), Venezuela (16), Sudan (16), Equatorial Guinea (16) and Afghanistan (16).

‘No change’

In the last eight years, only 22 countries significantly improved their CPI scores, including Greece, Guyana and Estonia. In the same period, among the 21 countries that saw a significantly fall in their scores are Canada, Australia and Nicaragua. In the remaining 137 countries, the levels of corruption show little to no change, the report said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/article19728706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Money,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slips-two-places-on-global-corruption-perception-index/article30634389.ece
79,2020/01/23,"Pawan Varma can go to any party he wants, says Nitish","Two days after party leader Pawan Varma sent him a stinging two-page letter asking for his “ideological clarity on the electoral tie-up with the BJP for the coming Delhi elections”, JD(U) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday broke his silence to say, “if he [Mr Varma] wants to go to some other party, he has my wishes”.

Mr Varma later said he would continue to speak what he “believes good of the country and for the party”.

On December 21, Mr. Varma,said in his letter that he was “deeply perplexed” over the development of ties with the BJP beyond Bihar. He ‘reminded’ Mr. Kumar of his confession to him, on more than one occasion, about his “grave apprehensions” of the BJP-RSS combine. He also mentioned about the “private conversations” he had had with Mr. Kumar on ties with the BJP.

“He [Mr Varma] is a learned man for whom I’ve a lot of respect, even if he may not have the same for me. But this is not the way to share such things in public… it is surprising…he says I’ve told him certain things in private…what if I should tell you what he had told me?”, Mr Kumar told journalists. “if he wants to go to some other party which is his decision… he has my wishes”, Mr Kumar said while coming out of a function organised at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary.

However, an hour later, Mr Varma responded to Mr. Kumar’s statement and told journalists that he would decide his next course of action after getting response to his letter from Mr. Kumar. “Awaiting reply of my letter to Nitish Kumar… will decide future course of action after that but I’ll continue to speak what I believe is right, what is good for the country and the party”, he said in Delhi.

Though he was in Patna on Wednesday to participate in a function, Mr. Varma chose not to meet Mr. Kumar.

Mr. Kumar said, “If he has any confusion he should have put it before me or at the party forum but there should not be any confusion in anyone’s mind about how the JD(U) as a party runs”.

Mr. Varma said in his letter, “In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012 you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country… when you were leading the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ you had openly made a call for RSS Mukt Bharat. I remember your confession to me in private how the current leadership in BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’.

Action likely

A JD(U) source told The Hindu that Mr. Kumar may take action against Mr. Varma and Prashant Kishor, who have of late been hammering him with tweets and letters, on January 27, when he would meet party leaders at his official residence, 1 Anne Marg.

80,2020/01/23,Congress to create a ‘National Register of the Unemployed’,"The youth wing of the Congress on Thursday launched a nationwide campaign to prepare a National Register of Unemployed (NRU) to highlight rising unemployment and demand answers from the government about the steps it was taking to address the issue.

The campaign was launched at the Congress headquarters in the national capital by the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chief Srinivas B.V. and the Congress in-charge for IYC, Krishna Allavaru.

“The IYC will reach out to every unemployed person. To prepare the data base, a phone number (8151994411) has been circulated on which one can give a missed call,” Mr. Allavaru said.

With a slogan that said ‘45 saalon main pehli baar, desh main sabse zyada berozgaar’ (A first in past 45 years, the largest number unemployed youth), the IYC also prepared short video clips that would be launched on various social media platforms.

The demand for the NRU is in response to the high rate of unemployment in India, which has reached its highest level in 45 years, the IYC leaders said.

Congress leaders said the NRU is also an attempt to keep the focus on ‘real issues’ and not allow the BJP to change the narrative into a polarizing one.

“We do not want to hear about the CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] or the NRC [National Register of Citizens]. We want to hear from you [the government] on what you are doing to increase employment in the country,” Mr Allavaru said.

The Congress cited the data of the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) to point out that as many as 36 youth committed suicide every day because of unemployment and the problem is at an all-time high in the last 45 years.

He said the root cause of recession in India is “Modi-made” because of wrong policies like demonetisation and poor implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

“The Youth Congress is ready to buy a pair of spectacles from anywhere in the world for the Prime Minister to see the problems of the youth,” Mr Srinivas said, referring to a pair being allegedly bought for ₹2.5 lakh for Mr Modi to watch the solar eclipse.

IYC spokesperson Amrish Ranjan said that as part of the campaign for an NRU, unemployed youth will have to call on the toll free number and the call details would collected and eventually be sent to the government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/stdk12/article30636808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-youth-congress-pti,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/youth-congress-launches-campaign-to-demand-national-register-for-unemployed/article30634268.ece
81,2020/01/23,India again rejects Trump offer on Kashmir,"Ruling out any role for a “third party” in the Kashmir issue, India rejected comments by U.S. President Donald Trump offering to mediate between India and Pakistan.

The U.S. President’s latest offer was made at a joint press appearance with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, repeating a previous offer made in June 2019.

“We have seen President Trump’s remarks. Let me once again reiterate that there is no role for any third party in the matter. If at all there are any bilateral issues between India and Pakistan to be discussed, it should be done bilaterally,” said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, adding that “the onus is on Pakistan to create a conducive atmosphere free from terror and violence”.

The Ministry of External Affairs has not yet confirmed a possible visit by Mr. Trump to India on February 24. However, when asked in Davos about the planned visit, reported by The Hindu last week, Mr. Trump did not deny it, only replying that as he has just met the Pakistan Premier, he would not require to visit Pakistan when he comes to India.

India's reiteration on the Kashmir issue came after Mr. Trump, while addressing the media with Mr. Khan, said the U.S. was watching the developments relating to Kashmir “very closely” and repeated his offer to “help” resolve the dispute.

The offer is the U.S. President’s fourth offer of mediation to help resolve the Kashmir issue since withdrawal of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories in August last by the government, leading to escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan.

“What's going on between Pakistan and India — if we can help, we certainly will be willing to. We have been watching it very closely, Mr. Trump said.

82,2020/01/23,"If I was not a minister today, I would be bidding for Air India: Piyush Goyal","As the government works on divesting debt-laden Air India, Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said if he was not a minister, he would be bidding for the airline.

Air India has been in the red for long and the government is now in the process of finalising the contours for its disinvestment.

Responding to a query about proposed disinvestment of Air India, BPCL and other companies, Mr. Goyal said in the first term, the government had inherited an economy which was in pretty terrible shape.

Steps were taken to put the economy back in shape and if the government had looked at divesting these jewels, it would not have got a great value.

He was talking at a session on ‘Strategic Outlook: India’ at the WEF 2020 here.

“If I wasn’t a minister today, I would be bidding for Air India. It has some of the best bilaterals the world over... a well managed and efficient Air India with lot more good aircraft put in using these bilaterals is nothing short of a gold mine to my mind,” Mr. Goyal said.

Bilaterals refers to an agreement between two countries that allows each other’s airlines to operate services with a specific number of seats.

Mr. Goyal holds the portfolios of Railways as well as Commerce and Industry.

“India today is a land where you have equal opportunity, you can work with integrity...,” the minister said, adding that he thinks a good job has been done in cleaning up the banks and strengthening them.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government have taken various measures to address bad loan woes and other issues at public sector banks.

“I do hope that everybody in the room does not have an impression that public sector banks haven’t done a good job. World over and if I may take the example of the world’s biggest economy, way back in 2008 and 09, it was not government banks that caused the economic collapse, it was all private banks.

“We in India, enough private banks that have not done us great glory. On the contrary, if you ask me, banks which have been run by the government for 30-40 years, they have done some great service to the nation,” Mr. Goyal said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gep795/article30313645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/if-i-was-not-a-minister-today-i-would-be-bidding-for-air-india-piyush-goyal/article30633545.ece

Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 in Meerut on Wednesday with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Mr. Balyan said he would “urge Rajnathji to make a provision for a reservation for students of western Uttar Pradesh in these Delhi universities to fix those raising anti-national slogans”. “Sabka ilaj kar denge, kisi ki zaroorat nahin padne ki” (they will fix everybody, nobody else would be required),” he said.

He pointed out that thousands of students were supporting the CAA in Meerut but only the protests of the students of Jamia and JNU, which have around 8,000 students each, were making the news for raising anti-national slogans.

Earlier, Mr. Singh tried to allay the fears of Muslims about the CAA. “Let me assure my Muslim brothers those who are citizens of India would not be touched under the CAA,” he said, adding even Mahatma Gandhi wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities.

“I hope that through this festival, people in the government will get to know what the country wants. There may be a new beginning... I hope that authors and intellectuals will use this platform for free speech to discuss the burning issues and send across their message,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters after inaugurating the JLF.

Festival co-director and author William Dalrymple told the audience at the JLF venue, Diggi Palace, that the event had now formally become the “largest literary festival” in the world. “About 5 lakh people attended the JLF last year. The huge crowd here is a proof that literature is alive. We have also inspired over 300 festivals to take off,” he said.

‘Narrative of hatred’

JLF producer Sanjoy Roy said the “narrative of hatred” being witnessed in the country could be countered through art and literature. “We cannot afford to be silent any more. We must speak up with one voice for the common cause of humanity,” he said.

The JLF will host over 250 speakers this year, covering a wide range of topics such as environment, history, cinema, music, politics, international relations, women’s rights and artificial intelligence. The speakers in 15 Indian and 35 international languages include authors, actors, scholars, business leaders and sportspersons.

Addressing the gathering in the inaugural session, Mr. Gehlot took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio programme, ‘Mann Ki Baat’, and said the speakers at the festival would engage in ‘Kaam ki Baat’ (useful talk) without any restriction.

‘Dissent is healthy’

Mr. Gehlot said the voice of dissent should not be suppressed in the democracy. “Dissent should be treated as a healthy tradition of democracy. Terming dissent as anti-nationalism is not fair in our democratic set-up,” he said.

Actor and director Nandita Das said while interacting with mediapersons that people should raise their voice against CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)-NRC and challenge the dispensation which was asking them to be identified in the name of religion. “Shaheen Baghs are coming up everywhere following the Delhi trend... Students have started a movement. This is the time for everyone to speak up,” she said.

According to an official order, two other high-level committees, one to be headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, and other to be co-chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, will also be set up for disposal of immovable enemy properties vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India under the Enemy Property Act.

Enemy properties were those left behind by the people who took citizenship of Pakistan and China.

The order said an Inter-Ministerial Group will be constituted for the disposal of enemy properties and it will be co-chaired by the Union Home Secretary and the Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

Representatives of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Expenditure, Department of Public Enterprises, Department of Legal Affairs, and Ministry of Corporate Affairs, among others, will be members of the inter-ministerial group.

90,2020/01/23,SC to consider Swamy’s plea for giving Ram Sethu national heritage status after 3 months,"The Supreme Court on January 23 said it will consider after three months the plea of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy seeking a direction to the Centre for declaring ‘Ram Sethu’ as a national heritage monument.

Ram Sethu is a chain of limestone shoals between coasts of India and Sri Lanka. According to the epic Ramayana, the Ram Sethu bridge was built by the ‘Vanara army’ to rescue Sita, who was kidnapped by Ravana.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde took note of the submissions of Dr. Swamy that his interim application be listed for urgent hearing for declaring the Sethu a national heritage monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.

“You please mention this after three months. We will entertain this then,” the Bench which also comprised Justices S.A. Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna said.

The BJP leader submitted that he has already won the first round of the litigation in which the Centre accepted the existence of Ram Sethu.

He further said the Union Minister concerned had called a meeting in 2017 to consider his demand to declare the Sethu as a national heritage monument but subsequently nothing happened.

The top court referred to pendency of several cases before it and asked Dr. Swamy to mention his plea after three months for an urgent hearing.

The BJP leader had earlier raised the issue of declaring Ram Sethu as a national monument in his PIL against the controversial Sethusamudram Ship Channel project, initiated by the UPA-I government. The matter had reached the apex court, which in 2007 had stayed the work for the project on the Ram Sethu.

The Centre had later said that it considered the “socio-economic disadvantages” of the project and was willing to explore another route to the shipping channel project without damaging the Ram Sethu.

“That the Government of India intends to explore an alternative to the earlier alignment of Sethusamudram Ship Channel project without affecting/damaging the Adam’s Bridge/Ram Sethu in the interest of the nation,” the affidavit filed by the ministry had said.

The court had then asked the government to file a fresh affidavit. The Sethusamudram shipping channel project has been facing protests from some political parties, environmentalists and certain Hindu religious groups.

Under the project, a 83 km-long deep water channel was to be created, linking Mannar with Palk Strait, by extensive dredging and removal of limestone shoals.

The apex court had on November 13 last year granted six weeks to the Centre to clarify its stand on the Ram Sethu. It had also granted liberty to Dr. Swamy to approach the court if the response of the Centre was not filed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/le5bzr/article30631681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22SWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-consider-swamys-plea-for-giving-ram-sethu-national-heritage-status-after-3-months/article30631682.ece
91,2020/01/23,Women politicians trolled more: Amnesty India,"Twitter is a toxic space for Indian women politicians, who face substantially higher abuse on the social media platform than their counterparts in the U.S. and the U.K., according to a recent study. In fact, one out of every seven tweets mentioning them is problematic or abusive, with many women targeted by a relentless flow of threats and sexist, religious, racist and casteist slurs.

While all women are targeted, Muslim women politicians faced 55% more abuse than others, according to the study of 95 politicians carried out by Amnesty India during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

“Being a Muslim woman sometimes becomes a huge burden. I am subjected to so much [more] hate than a Muslim man,” said BJP leader Shazia Ilmi, who was quoted in the report. “Only 25% of what I get is based on the content of my politics, 75-80% is about being a woman and a Muslim woman.” She said many women do not enter politics because the price of constant online harassment and trolling was too high.

Hasiba Amin, social media convener for the Congress, said she faced “traumatising” abuse since she entered politics in 2014. “Rape threats were routine, as were character assassinations, insinuations about my sexual relationships with older men...Now in 2019, I have considerably reduced my activity on Twitter. I ask myself how trollable is that and whether I really need to put up my opinion,” she said, according to the report.

Apart from Muslims, women from marginalised castes, unmarried women, and those from non-BJP parties faced a disproportionate share of abuse.

The Troll Patrol India study trained volunteers to sift through the tweets mentioning these 95 women between March and May 2019. Of the seven million tweets which mentioned them, a sample of 1.14 lakh was analysed. They found that 13.8% of the tweets had problematic or abusive content.

Abusive tweets had content that promote violence against or threaten people based on their race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, religious affiliation, age, disability or other categories. They include death threats and rape threats. Problematic tweets contained hurtful or hostile content, often repeated, which could reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes, although they did not meet the threshold of abuse.

The study found that during the elections, there was a significant decrease of abuse in English, while it remained constant in Hindi. Hypothesising that this anomaly was due to tools and measures adopted by Twitter during the poll dates, Amnesty India urged the social media company to enhance its safety tools and recognise that colloquial slang and abuse in other languages in English script often slips below its radar.

“It is not the role of each woman to individually ensure her safety in public space,” noted Aam Aadmi Party leader Atishi. “For example, if a woman steps out in public transport, it is the government’s role to ensure that they are safe there. Similarly, if there is a women who is accessing social media on Twitter, it is the responsibility of the platform to ensure that it is a safe and secure space for women.”

Responding to the report, a Twitter spokesperson said, ""Abuse, harassment and hateful conduct have no place on Twitter and we have taken strong steps to proactively address the health of the conversation on our service - including around peak moments such as Loksabha 2019. Today more than 50% of abusive content that we take action on is identified proactively using technology, instead of relying on reports from people using Twitter.""",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/gore46/article30097152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27NETTWITTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/women-politicians-trolled-more-amnesty-india/article30631355.ece

93,2020/01/23,Mid-day meal fortification being examined in Rajasthan,"The Congress government in Rajasthan is considering expansion of the food fortification project to cover mid-day meals distributed in schools and Anganwadi centres to provide micronutrients to children in view of the high rate of stunted growth. Against the national average of 37.9% children under five years having stunted growth, the figure in the State is 39.1%.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who discussed the steps for food security and measures to check adulteration with Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) chairperson Rita Teaotia here last week, said the fortification of mid-day meals would help tackle malnutrition among children. Food fortification has been executed through the public distribution system for common citizens, women and children.

The project being implemented in the State has covered wheat flour, soya dal analogue, oil and milk to provide micronutrients to vulnerable sections of population, while new strategies are being formulated to widen its scope and reach out to more people.

Mr. Gehlot said the State Secretariat and other offices and institutions would be converted into “eat right campuses” to achieve better results of the food security drive. Besides, new campaigns will be launched to make the people aware of the effects of food adulteration and ensure the availability of safe food products.

Rajasthan has been described as a model State where the edible oil and dairy industries have achieved distinction in fortification of their products. About 6 crore people in the State are consuming fortified oil produced by over 100 industries.

Ms. Teaotia said she had inspected the State's food security laboratory and found it complying with the international standards. She said the FSSAI would assist the State government in its drive for ensuring food security.

Activists working in the field of food security have laid emphasis on strengthening the regulatory mechanism to ensure the quality and safety of fortified foods and recommended a mandatory fortification of oil and milk with vitamins A and D. As the micronutrient deficiency is prevalent in all age and socio-economic groups, the rights bodies have urged the State government to specifically address the issues of child stunting and wasting.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mid-day-meal-fortification-being-examined-in-rajasthan/article30628913.ece

It was on January 16 that the NDFB(S) — the last of the factions of the outfit that waged an armed struggle for a sovereign homeland for the Bodo tribal people in Assam — signed an agreement with the Centre and the State government for the cessation of operations. A formal surrender ceremony is scheduled on Thursday.

Batha, the deputy military chief of the NDFB(S), wanted for the massacre of 80 Adivasis in December 2014, has eluded capture along with outfit’s military chief G. Bidai, alias Bishnu Goyari. The Assam police expect Bidai, believed to be hiding along the Assam-Bhutan border, to be part of the peace process soon.

On Wednesday, Batha reached Gossaigaon town in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district. His emergence along with some of his cadres was as dramatic as his disappearance a few years ago.

State Home department officials said the members of the NDFB(S), led by their chairman Saoraigwra Basumatary, would be signing a peace pact with the government in Guwahati on Thursday.

96,2020/01/23,"M.P., Chhattisgarh reject plan to link private colleges to govt. hospitals","The Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have junked a plan to link private medical colleges with government district hospitals through public-private partnership.

Pointing to the shortage of qualified doctors, the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think-tank that drafted the scheme, admitted that it was “practically not possible” for the Central and State governments to bridge the gaps in medical education with their limited finances. Hence, the scheme, by combining the strengths of the public and private sectors, would increase medical seats and rationalise the cost of education.

“We reject this scheme in its totality and will not implement it,” Madhya Pradesh Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat told The Hindu. “The intent of the State government is to provide complete healthcare services...”

“If district hospitals are handed over to private players, where will the poor go? Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, all depend on these hospitals. How can we give them to private players,” he asked.

Chhattisgarh Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo had earlier termed the “selling” of public healthcare to private players by the BJP government “unacceptable” and “condemnable”. “This assault on the common man by the BJP to help its few rich friends will not be tolerated. Allowing private players in healthcare means higher expenses for the people.”

Furthermore, he wrote on Twitter, the move also amounted to an attack on cooperative federalism. “By snatching the subject of healthcare from the States, the BJP wants to further its authoritarian agenda. We must oppose this tooth and nail... The BJP should not try to impose its anti-poor, crony capitalist agenda on us.”

Additional expenditure on defence and the burden of economic slowdown have compelled the Centre to see public health services as a source of revenue, according to Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a network of non-profit organisations.

Under the scheme, the concessionaire, a private party, shall design, build, finance, operate and maintain the medical college and upgrade, operate and maintain the associated district hospital with a minimum annual student intake of 150 for the MBBS.

The model agreement will allow the party’s control over the land and assets for 60 years, with a provision for extension. Moreover, the lease agreement for the site of the college would be for 99 years, at a subsidised lease rent of “8% of the circle rate of the land”.

“It is incomprehensible how the proposal to hand over public facilities to private entities for 60 years — that is for a whole generation — is being made,” said Amulya Nidhi, member of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. “This means a whole generation will be at the mercy of this revenue generation model.”

The model distinguishes between ‘free patients’ and others based on their ability to pay. The ‘free patients’ require an authority’s sanction to procure a document for proof. They will be provided free consultation, drugs and diagnostics, but will have to pay ₹10 in registration fee. The others will be charged at “market competitive rates”.

Moreover, all the beds will be categorised as ‘regulated beds’ and ‘market beds’. With at least 750 minimum beds at a hospital, a minimum of 300 plus 20% of the remaining beds would be for the ‘free patients’. Yet, the concessionaire will have the discretion to charge all patients alike for the use of ancillary facilities such as parking lots or cafeteria.

“The ‘regulated beds’ are implicitly for patients who are covered by Ayushman Bharat or other health insurance schemes. So, though it is stated as ‘free’ care, the payment for these patients will mostly come from the government itself,” said an analysis document prepared by the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan.

The ‘free patients’ will get medicines free and the others will pay subsidised rates.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mp-chhattisgarh-reject-plan-to-link-private-colleges-to-govt-hospitals/article30619986.ece
97,2020/01/23,CBI probe into four more cases against Chhota Rajan,"The CBI has taken over probe into four more cases against underworld don Chhota Rajan which were registered by the Mumbai Police from 1995 to 1998. Through a Department of Personnel and Training notification in November 2015, 71 cases against Rajan were transferred to the CBI on a reference from the Maharashtra government.

Death threats

The latest set of cases includes the one initially registered on July 28, 1995, on the complaint of a businessman, Devang Bipin Parikh, who alleged that he had been receiving death threats for ₹20 lakh as protection money. The police had earlier filed a chargesheet against various accused persons.

In another case in June 1996, a builder named Shabbir N. Patel had alleged that he had been receiving extortion threats.

Yet another case was reported on June 12, 1997, by journalist Baljit Shersingh Parmar. He was shot at and seriously injured by two alleged members of the Chhota Rajan gang.

Protection money

The fourth case pertains to the allegation by a businessman, Ghisulal Jain, that Chhota Rajan’s men had demanded ₹25 lakh as protection money. The police filed a chargesheet against several accused persons, while Chhota Rajan was shown as one of the persons wanted in the case.

Chhota Rajan, who had been on the run for about two decades, was detained in Bali by the Indonesian Police on the basis of an Interpol Red Notice and deported to India in October 2015.

99,2020/01/23,"On Valley outreach, Union Ministers promise jobs and education","In Kashmir for a public outreach, four Union Ministers on Wednesday used the occasion to dispel the fears of locals concerning land and jobs, and promised high-end courses for them in Information Technology.

Buoyed by the locals’ response, Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi interacted with traders at the commercial hub of Lal Chowk in Srinagar.

Referring to the fears of locals after the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status on August 5, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said, “The present dispensation is committed to protect the rights and land of the people.”

Large gathering

Addressing a large public gathering at Budgam’s Sheikhpora, Mr. Rai said there would be a special focus on industrialisation in the newly carved Union Territory (UT) to open up new employment generation avenues for local youth, and the improvement of the education sector.

He called secularism “a unique strength of the country”. “All citizens have the responsibility to strengthen it,” he added.

Union Minister for Communications, Electronics and Information Technology and Law and Justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad promised that the government will set-up “every required infrastructure for the development and export of IT products from the J&K UT”.

Inaugurating the incubation facility at the Srinagar Technology Parks of India here, he said: “The incubation facility will provide opportunities to IT entrepreneurs by providing plug-n-play and other digital infrastructure along with regulatory support to develop and export IT products from the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.”

‘Train youth’

He also interacted with young entrepreneurs and IT experts. The Minister asked officials to train and place the Kashmiri youth in different job-oriented courses, including artificial intelligence and block chain technologies.

Another Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy, visited central Kashmir’s Ganderbal. “The agenda of my visit is to meet people, listen to their issues, and come up with a developmental plan in all spheres,” he said.

The Minister distributed pension cards among widows and underprivileged under the Prime Minister’s Pension Yojana. He inaugurated several development projects dedicated to the district.

Mr. Naqvi visited Srinagar’s commercial hub Lal Chowk and interacted with traders. He was accompanied by the Advisor to the Lieutenant-Governor Farooq Khan, and Deputy Commissioner Srinagar Dr. Shahid Iqbal Chowdhary. The traders thanked the Minister for his visit.

‘Outreach a hoax’

Meanwhile, Communist Party of India-Marxist state secretary M.Y. Tarigami said the visit was “nothing but a hoax”.

“The move to parachute 36 Ministers is a propaganda in panic mode, as the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has failed on every count throughout the country. What is the need for the BJP Ministers to visit J&K when the government claims everything is normal? Reality is that they want to sell Kashmir’s ‘normalcy’ and ‘all is well’ story for those in mainland India who are ignorant about Kashmir’s ground realities,” said Mr. Tarigami.

Incarcerated Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti termed the visit as “normalcy acrobatics”. “Kashmir continues to reel under a crippling Internet shutdown and political leaders remain detained. There is massive surveillance and heavy presence of troops, yet curated photo-ops continue,” said Ms. Iltija.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xmipgb/article30628424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDNAQVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-valley-outreach-union-ministers-promise-jobs-and-education/article30628425.ece
100,2020/01/23,CJI concerned about lack of crowd management in Supreme Court,"Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde expressed concern over the the noise and lack of crowd management in the Supreme Court. The CJI’s court was chock-a-block with lawyers and litigants, leaving hardly any space to stand, ahead of the hearing on 144 petitions challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019, on Wednesday.

This comes a day after an intern fainted during a Constitution Bench hearing before a Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana and had to be carried out of a similarly crowded courtroom for urgent medical attention.

Consultation with experts

Chief Justice Bobde said the court was in consultation with experts for a solution to the problems of crowd management and ventilation in the Supreme Court.

Chief Justice Bobde suggested that more room can be made in the middle aisle of the CJI court if lawyers waiting in queue for urgent mentioning of cases can be divided into two rows for entry and exit. The CJI said a lectern could be placed for lawyers in the middle to conveniently mention their cases.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal said the problem of overcrowding was not just seen inside courtrooms but also out in the corridors of the Supreme Court, rendering it almost impossible for lawyers to reach the courts in time when their cases were called for hearing.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan suggested positioning court marshals and security personnel at vantage points to control the crowd.

“But how do we discipline advocates? Security can clear the crowd but if they push there will be trouble,” the CJI reacted.

When senior advocate Indira Jaising said women lawyers suffer being pushed around, the CJI said the situation was inhumane and the problem affected lawyers regardless of their gender.

Finally, the CJI suggested a meeting with senior lawyers to brainstorm likely solutions to the problem.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mt8wrw/article30628323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BOBDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cji-concerned-about-lack-of-crowd-management-in-supreme-court/article30628324.ece
101,2020/01/23,Declare health a fundamental right: Doctors,"Public health and hospitals be brought under concurrent list and health be declared as fundamental right — are among the top recommendations of the High-Level Group (HLG) on Health Sector (2019) submitted to the Fifteenth Finance Commission. The HLG includes top doctors across India — Dr. Randeep Guleria, director All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr. Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayan Health City, Dr. Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta City and Prof. K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.

The other recommendations include —- achieving a public health expenditure of 2.5 %, by 2025 undergraduate should be equal to post graduate seats, cadre of family medicine doctors be restored and the government should work at creating 3,000 to 5,000 small hospitals in next 5 years in tier 2 & tier 3 cities. The group has also suggested that the National Health Authority (NHA) can act as a strategic purchaser and collective negotiator for negotiating rates of medical devices and supplies.

The role and function of the HLG includes optimising the use of existing financial resources and to incentive the state government’s effort on fulfillment of well-defined health parameter and also evaluate the existing regulator framework in the health sector and examine its strength and weakness.

“There is a need for larger allocation of funds for health sector in general to meet the ambitious targets of public health expenditure on health and raise it to 2.5 % of GDP, as envisaged in the National Health Policy 2017,’’ noted the report.

It added that Primary Health Care should be the number one fundamental commitment of each and every state and added that in coming five years 3,000-5,000 small hospitals (200 beds each) may be created close to the community, which necessitates the participation of private sector in achieving the same. Government can work out the various modalities of incentivising the investment by private sector so as to attract the equity required to develop this infrastructure in tier 2 and 3 cities.

It has also noted that NHA may devise a comprehensive health insurance scheme for people having formal employment to overcome the financial challenge faced in availing health services. This, besides highlighting the fact that there is a need for larger role to be played by nursing professionals and the concept of nurse practitioners, physician assistant, nurse anesthetist should be introduced for better utilisation of nursing professionals.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/declare-health-a-fundamental-right-doctors/article30628209.ece
102,2020/01/23,Forum launched to fight for troubled women,"Cutting across party lines, women’s organisations in Prakasam district have launched a joint forum to take up the cause of troubled women.

Briefing media on the deliberations by several women’s organisations on issues confronting them, Mahila Abyudhaya Samiti State president T. Aruna said enactment of laws like the Nirbhaya Act and Disha Act had made little difference in the lives of women as incidents of atrocities against women continued unabated in one part of the State or other. They demanded speedy justice for the victims of sexual assaults and other offences.

A series of crimes had occurred, including burning of a woman and her infant and sexual assault on a woman on the city outskirts, she said and urged District Collector P. Bhaskar to ensure early compensation for the victims.

‘Belt shops growing’

National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) leader K. Aruna said the State government should act sternly to regulate sale of liquor. Though the State government had brought down the number of liquor shops with a view to introducing prohibition in phases, liquor continued to be freely available due to mushrooming of belt shops, she said.

All India Democratic Women’s Association city secretary K. Rama Devi demanded a ban on pornographic websites, which, she opined, were responsible for the spurt in crimes against women.

Explaining the provisions of the Disha Act, YSR Congress Party women’s wing district president G. Sujatha maintained that it was a landmark one enacted by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government providing for stringent punishment for those perpetrating crimes against women, including death penalty and time-bound probe and trial to ensure speedy justice for victims.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said that awareness on RERA norms was mandatory for all builders since they were constructing big projects in places like Pydibhimavaram, Tekkali, Palasa and Itchapuram. The awareness programmes in those places would be completed by end of February. A help desk in Srikakulam CREDAI office has been set up for the benefit of new builders. “The projects taken up in more than 500 square metres of land and structures with more than eight flats come under RERA. Taking prior permission from municipal authorities in accordance with the rules of the Act will ensure transparency in construction industry,” he said. “CREDAI AP Chapter president K. Subba Rao has given a clear direction to all chapters with regard to RERA norms,” he added.

Mr. Raju said that the demand for apartments would improve in semi urban areas on a par with cities as many families wanted to live in secured gated communities. Slashing of home loan interest rates had become a boon for the industry in Srikakulam and surrounding areas. “The bank interest rates were around 9% till a couple of years ago but have now been slashed to around 8%.

The project, meant to impart training to women in car driving, was taken up by Rashtriya Seva Samithi (RASS) here on Thursday as an income generating step to make the women march towards self-sufficiency. It was RASS which extended similar training a couple of years ago to turn the women into auto-rickshaw drivers and also provided them vehicles to help them eke out a living.

Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot formally flagged off the skill building programme, which is supported by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and executed by RASS for thirty trainees. The Minister appreciated RASS president ‘Padma Sri’ G. Muniratnam for coming up with novel ideas to add strength to the marginalised sections of the society. In the same breath, he advised RASS to take up similar initiatives to train women and youth to make them more productive and add value to the society.

Business orientation

Taking part in the Agri clinic and Agri business orientation conducted by RASS, Mr. Gehlot advised the bankers, agricultural universities and technical agencies like Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) and ATMA for combining their individual efforts towards excellence in agriculture and business, thus achieving synergic effect. Referring to the initiatives taken by RASS over the last three decades to ensure better living standards of senior citizens and the differently abled, Mr. Gehlot pointed out that it had become a nationwide model for the social sector.

109,2020/01/23,"With new issues popping up, uncertainty over Capital continues","With the Chairman of the Legislative Council on Wednesday referring the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Bills to a select committee, the Capital dilemma for the State lingers on.

After the Bills were passed in the Assembly on Tuesday, Leader of the Opposition in the Council, Yanamala Ramakrishnudu invoked Rule 71 and moved a motion. After an acrimonious debate, Chairman Mohammed Ahmed Shariff referred them to a select committee.

Now what are the options, what will be the composition of the committee and what will happen if the select committee gives a report with a dissenting note. These are the questions agitating the minds of people and political observers.

The committee will comprise a chairman and members from the Council, where the TDP still has good majority.

“The committee will be constituted based on proportionate strength and if that is so, the TDP and others opposing it will have an edge. That is why the Bills should have been referred to a joint select committee, a committee formed by members from the Assembly and the Council, for a fair report. This will delay things,” said YSR Congress Party leader Dadi Veerabhadra Rao.

Agreeing with Mr. Veerabhadra Rao, former Chairman of the Council A. Chakrapani said the entire process would be delayed. “It may be from three months to six months or even more. It all depends on the fallouts and the course of actions,” he said.

A few senior politicians are of the opinion that the Bill could have been introduced as money Bill, instead of an ordinary one. “The Modi government had utilised this provision to bypass the Upper Houser (Rajya Sabha) in the past when they did not have a majority. Since both the CRDA and Decentralisation Bills have money component, they could have been introduced as money Bill,”said Mr. Veerabhadra Rao.

Taking a call on Council

Can the Council be repealed or abolished? It can be done, as establishment or dissolving it is the prerogative of the State government, but a resolution has to be passed by it and it has to be placed before Parliament, said former Vice-Chancellor of Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University, Y. Satyanarayana.

“Articles 168 and 169 empower Parliament to accept the constitution of the Council or abolishing it, if the Legislative Assembly passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the House,” said Prof. Satyanarayana.

However, though Parliament may not outright veto the resolution, it can reject or accept it, but it has to explain its decision rationally and finally it needs the President’s consent, said president of Forum of Legal Professionals Kuppili Muralidhar.

But right now whether the Council can be abolished or not is a legal issue, as it has recommended the Bills to a select committee, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/with-new-issues-popping-up-uncertainty-over-capital-continues/article30636070.ece
110,2020/01/23,JC: legal action only recourse to retain capital in Amaravati,"Legal action alone will ensure that the State capital is retained in Amaravati, former MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy has said.

“Except for the YSRCP, no political party is in favour of shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam. Even people in general are against the move,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy told The Hindu on Thursday.

In his own inimitable style, Mr. Diwakar Reddy, likening the Secretariat to the human brain, said, “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is trying to keep the hands, the legs and the heart in Amaravati and shift the brain to Visakhapatnam.”

Referring to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s insider trading charge, the TDP leader said that even if it were to be true, people in general were not in any way affected by it. “At the most, 200 persons may have benefited to the tune of ₹10,000 crore,” he observed.

Had Visakhapatnam been named the capital in 2014 itself, none would have had any problem, he said. But people would not welcome the shift at this stage, he added.

Need of the hour

“One of the best legal luminaries will fight against the unwelcome move,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy said, and stressed the need for decentralisation of economic activity, and not decentralisation of administration, or seat of power.

“When the TDP government brought KIA Motors to Anantapur, the areas in a radius of 45-km witnessed development. Every district, therefore, has to get such companies, which generate revenue and spur economic activity locally,” he observed.

“Many YSRCP MLAs too are against the move to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam. But they are unable to speak their mind because of the party’s stand,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy claimed.

Asked if he still batted for Greater Rayalaseema, Mr. Diwakar Reddy said that time had not yet come to take the issue forward.

“The State government may have the right to decide the location of the capital, but the Centre will not cooperate,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy said, and added that the going would be tough if Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy insisted on shifting the capital.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jc-legal-action-only-recourse-to-retain-capital-in-amaravati/article30635756.ece
111,2020/01/23,Three burnt alive as man sets house afire,"Three persons, including a five-year-old girl, were burnt alive when a person reportedly set ablaze a house at Dulla village in Kadiam mandal of East Godavari district in the wee hours of Wednesday.

The deceased were identified as K. Ramu (18), K. Vijaya Lakshmi (5) and Satyavathi (45). The girl’s mother, K. Durga Bhavani, and her two children were battling for life in the Rajamahendravaram Government Hospital.

The suspect, M. Srinivas, is absconding. The reason for the act was not known immediately, said Rajamahendravaram South Zone Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) M. Venkateswarlu.

Satyavathi and Appa Rao were staying with their son, Ramu (who died in the incident), at the village. Durga Bhavani came to her parent’s house for Sankranti festival.

“Srinivas, who too is a native of Dulla village, is the relative of Satyavathi. As per the CCTV footages, the suspect procured petrol in a nearby bunk around 1.30 a.m. and filled it in a bottle. He might have removed the tiles from the roof, poured petrol and set fire,” the DSP told The Hindu.

Special teams

Rajamahendravaram Urban district Superintendent of Police Semushi Bajpai constituted special teams to nab the suspect in the case.

“Six persons were sleeping in the house when the incident occurred. According to the villagers, Srinivas has done ‘recce’ before committing the offence.

114,2020/01/23,"‘Irrigation, industrial, needs of Seema too have to be met’","Acknowledging the Sribagh pact, the government has taken steps to ensure that Rayalaseema gets a High Court. However, there are several other aspects that also need to be addressed in order to fully implement the promises made to the region under the agreement.

Speaking to The Hindu, Rayalaseema Saaguneeti Sadhana Samithi president B. Dasaradha Rami Reddy said that provision of irrigation water was one of the important aspects highlighted in the Sribagh pact.

“As per the agreement, the Rayalaseema districts and Nellore must be accorded priority in the utilisation of water from the Krishna,” Mr. Reddy said.

Referring to the Tungabhadra waters, Mr. Reddy said that the allocations made in 1953 were not being met because of lack of field canals.

“The Krishna delta is using more water than what has been allocated to it. As the Rayalaseema region is unable to tap the waters, the Krishna delta has been given temporary permission,” he claimed.

“There is a need for construction of canals and proper water storage facilities,” he said, and demanded that projects such as Gundrevula, Tungabhadra flood canal, and Siddeswaram weir be taken up immediately.

Delimitation exercise

“There is also a need to increase the number of Assembly constituencies in the region, irrespective of its population, during the delimitation exercise. The population criterion puts the region at a disadvantage. Because of lack of proper representation, the region witnesses large-scale migration on a permanent basis. Adequate representation in the Assembly will reverse the trend,” Mr. Reddy opined.

“The government must ensure establishment of educational institutions in the region,” said K. Venkatesh, chairman of the Rayalaseema University Joint Action Committee. “As per the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 12 educational institutions must be set up in the region. Only two of them have been set up so far,” he said.

Besides, he saw a need for increased budgetary allocations to the universities, as they remained severely underdeveloped.

The number of courses being offered in RU should also be increased, and courses in law should figure among them, he said. Tax incentives should be given to encourage setting up of industries.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qmu0ta/article30631221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-BOJJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/irrigation-industrial-needs-of-seema-too-have-to-be-met/article30631222.ece

118,2020/01/23,Market yards on track to meeting revenue targets,"Market yards across the district have recorded profits this year thanks to copious rain and increased production.

The market yards have already met the targets for the current financial year, with some even exceeding them.

Speaking to The Hindu, Koilakuntla market yard secretary Govind Reddy said that the market has made ₹2.15 crore as of now as against the target of ₹1.65 crore. “This is a record for us,” he said.

Explaining the increased revenue, Mr. Reddy claimed that farmers who previously took loans for Bengal Gram have brought out their stock out of the warehouses. “A lot of stock was sold this year,” he added.

The Banaganpalle market yard has also reached its target. The secretary of the market yard, G. Srinivasulu, said, “This year, we had a target of ₹67 lakh. We have met the target by late January, with two months left to spare.”

Like the smaller market yards, the larger ones too are on track to reach their targets. Kurnool Market Yard secretary Jaya Lakshmi said that they have met half of their target. “We expect to meet the target by end of February,” she said.

Ms. Lakshmi explained that smaller market yards would reach their targets just by the release of goods from warehouses. “However, for bigger market yards, produce needs to be plenty to meet the targets,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/market-yards-on-track-to-meeting-revenue-targets/article30628649.ece
119,2020/01/23,Centre did not approve three capitals proposal: Pawan Kalyan,"Within a week of forging an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jana Sena Party (JSP) chief Pawan Kalyan has asserted that there was no approval for developing three capitals as being planned by the State government.

He was addressing a press conference along with BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana in New Delhi soon after meeting Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Disclosing the details of the meeting, he said that they discussed key issues relating to the State, including the Capital, and matters related to the financial and political situation in Andhra Pradesh.

“We assure the five crore people of the State and farmers that Amaravati will be Capital of the State. The BJP-JSP combine will announce a strong action plan on Capital Amaravati,” he said.

‘Centre not informed’

Stating that the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) was claiming that the Centre was informed about the shifting of the Capital, Mr. Kalyan said neither they spoke to the Central government nor was there any approval for their plans.

It was a mere State government’s decision. The State government was requested to focus on administration and to mend its functioning style, he said, adding that the conduct of YSRCP was ruining the image of the Centre.

“We discussed the course of events in State since the bifurcation. The Centre has tried to support both the governments (TDP and YSRCP), but the opinion here is that though the governments have changed, the State government’s performance has remained the same. The Centre is extending the same cooperation to the State as it did during the TDP rule. The YSRCP government is following the footsteps of the previous government. It is not submitting the utilisation certificates to the Centre for the funds released to the State,” the JSP chief said.

Both the TDP and YSRCP governments had failed to act responsibly. This issue also came up for the discussion, he said.

Coordination meeting

Mr. Lakshminarayana said the BJP-JSP would work together in all activities. The BJP-JSP coordination committee meeting would be held in Vijayawada on January 28. The allies had decided to stand by Amaravati farmers.

JSP leader Nadendla Manohar said that a long march would be organised by both parties from Tadepalli to Vijayawada on February 2.

120,2020/01/23,TDP MLAs stage walkout after marshals enter the scene,"Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLAs staged a walkout from the Assembly after Speaker Thammineni Seetharam called marshals to prevent them from reaching the podium and raising slogans, on the third day of the Assembly session on Wednesday.

The marshals physically lifted Nimmakayala Chinarajappa (TDP) and some other members of his party as they continued to stage protest close to the Speaker’s podium. A couple of TDP members entered into an argument with the marshals and refused to budge. Later, the TDP members staged a walkout in protest against the “Speaker’s decision.”

The Opposition members, who were raising slogans in support of Amaravati until Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy entered the House, started raising the slogan “need to attend court every Friday,” which enraged the YSRCP MLAs who were already in the well of the House. Pandemonium prevailed as ruling party members objected to the TDP members’ “objectionable behaviour.”

Both Opposition and ruling members then entered into a wordy duel. The Speaker’s repeated requests to return to their seats went in vain.

CM slams Opposition

Reacting to this, Mr. Jagan slammed the TDP members, saying they were making a mockery of democracy. Though they were a handful, the ruling party was showing restraint.

Mr. Jagan alleged that they are acting worse than rowdies and urged the Speaker to call marshals and send the TDP MLAs out.

“Ask the marshals to form a ring around the podium and see that no MLA crosses the line, he said, adding, “if necessary, please take action against them.”

Following which, Mr. Seetharam suggested the agitating members to take their seats. “Else, I will have to take all possible actions,” he cautioned but in vain. He then called the marshals into the House.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-mlas-stage-walkout-after-marshals-enter-the-scene/article30628403.ece
121,2020/01/23,Speaker refers TDP members’ ‘behaviour’ to ethics panel,"Following the “agitating mood of the House,” Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam on Wednesday referred the TDP members’ “unruly behaviour” to the ethics committee.

They also made derogatory remarks against the Chair and as the first step, the matter was being referred to the ethics committee, Mr. Seetharam said. The Opposition MLAs were not present when Speaker announced his decision.

In a rather stern voice, he said: “I may hail from backward classes, but I am not weak. Even the Opposition leader knows it,” he said, adding, “I wanted to utilise all available options before taking action. We need to follow rules and conventions of the House.”

The Speaker said it is was evident that the TDP members had come to the House with a “preoccupied mind” to disrupt the proceedings. They straight away rushed towards the podium. They gave an adjournment motion even before the Chair took a decision. In the process, they wasted two hours’ time.

On top of it, they cast aspersions on the Chair saying they were walking out against “the Speaker’s attitude.” A TDP member sought to know whether there was a resolution to call marshals. A resolution was required to suspend members. “But, let them show if there were any conventions or rules to call the marshals. They should understand that the marshals were called only to send them back to their respective seats,” he said.

‘Let people decide’

The Speaker said everyone was asking him why he was tolerating the misconduct of the TDP MLAs, but he exercised restraint as they were also members.

There was an elected government which wanted to develop three capitals or go for decentralisation of governance. The Opposition MLAs have every right to express their views and opinions but not stall the proceedings even after the Bill was adopted. People would judge the government’s actions, he said.

The YSRCP led government has already initiated a probe into alleged insider trading and Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said in the Assembly that the government has evidence that leaders of the TDP and their supporters had purchased land to the extent of 4,000 acres during June-December 2014, before the government declared Amaravati the State Capital.

Additional Director General of Police (CID) P.V. Sunil Kumar wrote to Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, on Wednesday seeking the necessary inquiry against those involved in benami transactions. The CID also submitted a list of suspicious transactions with full details.

“We have also come across some benami transactions, some of them do not have even PAN card and some belong to the BPL category. It is surprising that their names are entered in sale deeds of huge transactions. We have asked both the I-T Department and the ED to look look into these transactions and also into specific cases of money laundering,’’ said Mr. Sunil Kumar.

The CID has identified that 797 white ration card holders, including 268 PAN card holders, were involved in land transactions in 761.34 acres in Amaravathi, Pedakakani, Tadikonda, Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli mandals, whose market value is above ₹200 crore. The market values have been certified by mandal revenue officers.

Erring personnel face action

The CID has also asked the I-T Department if the PAN card holders had submitted I-T returns during the years 2014-15. In case the land was purchased by white ration card holders, the Revenue Department would be asked to cancel the cards. The CID is also probing if the sales tax deduction of 2 % had been done in the case of transactions above ₹50 lakh.

A separate CID team is probing high-value land transactions carried out by political leaders while another team is inquiring into the purchase of assigned land. Action would be initiated against Revenue and Registration department personnel involved in removing the land from the list of prohibited land under Section 22 (A) of the Stamps and Registration Department.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7u0we1/article30628361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23vj-land-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cid-asks-i-t-dept-ed-to-probe-land-deals-in-capital-region/article30628362.ece

Revenue Minister R. Ashok told presspersons here on Thursday that beneficiaries under 94CC are low-income families who have been living on government land across cities in the State. The highest number of beneficiaries under the scheme were in Dakshina Kannada, followed by Bengaluru Urban and Ballari.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is scheduled to distribute land record rights to around 10,000 beneficiaries of Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts on January 28, at an event organised at National College Grounds. Beneficiaries have been identified under 94C of the Act for rural areas.

The Minister said that the final list of beneficiaries was announced after their applications were scrutinised over the last five years. Beneficiaries under the scheme had to pay a nominal fee for regularisation of the sites.

126,2020/01/23,Politicians’ morale hit by untoward incidents: Sriramulu,"Minister for Health B. Sriramulu on Thursday said untoward incidents in the State where some MLAs have suffered have shattered the morale of legislators and the government would ensure proper security to all of them. The forces resorting to harming the people who are in public life should be dealt with an iron hand, he told reporters here.

In reply to questions on recent incidents involving Congress MLA Tanveer Sait in Mysuru and N.A. Haris, Shantinagar Congress MLA, in Bengaluru, he said those responsible in the cases will be punished as per the law and some organisations had been under scanner over these attacks.

“We had earlier sought ban on PFI and SDPI when Rajnath Singh was the Union Minister. As politicians, we go around and meet people. The politicians’ morale has been hit with the attacks by the disgruntled forces,” he said.

The Minister said Karnataka is a peace-loving State but some elements were trying to create fear and disturb the harmony.

On former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy’s reported remarks on the case pertaining to the planting of a bomb at the Mangaluru airport and the subsequent investigation, Mr. Sriramulu said Mr. Kumaraswamy should learn to speak responsibly on issues like this. “He should know what he speaks on serious matters.

He was speaking after performing the ‘guddali puja’ for the construction of new women’s hostel blocks for UG and PG students of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) on KRS Road and Vinoba Road respectively. The two projects had been taken up at a cost of ₹14.5 crore.

The UG hostel block will have 107 rooms and accommodate 214 students but the construction had been restricted to 38 rooms with the current funding of ₹5.50 crore. The four-storey hostel building for PG students will consist of 68 rooms and accommodate 137 students.

The trauma care centre was inaugurated long ago but the patients’ wait for services had been getting longer in the absence of equipment.

Mr. Narayan said the government has plans to establish four more medical colleges in the State to overcome the shortage of medical professionals.

L. Nagendra, MLA, urged the Deputy Chief Minister to approve the expansion of the KR Hospital and Cheluvamba Hospital and added that the heritage structures would not be harmed. He sought a new OPD block for the 1,002-bed K.R. Hospital.

128,2020/01/23,Mysuru gets District Hospital,"After waiting for many years, Mysuru finally got its district hospital, which is a 300-bed facility established in spacious surrounding at on the premises of ED Hospital at Metagalli on the busy KRS Road.

This public healthcare facility was needed urgently to ease the load on the K.R. Hospital, a teaching hospital attached to the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI).

The four-storeyd hospital building with a carpet area of 20,969 square metres has been built at a cost of ₹75 crore.

However, patients have to wait for some more months for services as the facility is in need of medical devices and staff. The hospital was formally inaugurated by Minister for Health B. Sriramulu on Thursday and the remaining works were expected to start soon to make it fully operational.

The hospital’s basement can accommodate 100 cars and 500 two-wheelers and its surrounding have ample space to provide adequate ventilation. The entire building has been well equipped to handle fire emergencies with entire systems in place from the basement till the last floor.

The Department of Health and Family Welfare has submitted proposals to the government seeking 330 hospital staff, including 60 doctors and 207 paramedical staff. The hospital has 34 facilities, including departments for handling patients and services.

MLA L. Nagendra and DHO Venkatesh said the hospital will start its services in about two months as the government has agreed to provide all assistance to provide equipment and manpower.

The hospital will be equipped with six major operation theatres, and four minor OTs besides one ICU, five VIP wards, six special wards, 18 semi-special wards, one dialysis ward, eight labs, and 202 toilets, and two wards for prisoners.

The hospital will now be handed over to the department for carrying out remaining works - installation of equipment, opening of operation theatres and other facilities.

129,2020/01/23,How many more will join the Cabinet from Belagavi?,"With two BJP leaders from Belagavi district already in the Council of Ministers, the moot point now is how many more will make it to the Cabinet in the next inevitable expansion by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

While Shashikala Jolle who won her second term from Nippani has taken charge of the Women and Child Welfare Ministry, Laxman Savadi who lost the Assembly polls has been made the Deputy Chief Minister. He is also holding Transport and other portfolios.

In the 2019 bypolls, Ramesh Jarkiholi won the polls from Gokak after defecting to the BJP. His follower Mahesh Kumthalli won from Athani and Srimanth Patil defeated Raju Kage of the Congress from Kagwad. It was earlier expected that these three people would join the Cabinet.

“The former Minister and eight-time MLA Umesh Katti was considered another strong contender. But then, this would push up the number of Ministers from Belagavi to six and that would have been perceived as disproportionately high. That needed to be addressed at the level of the party and at the level of the general public,” said a former Minister and BJP leader.

Now, the general impression in the district is that Ramesh Jarkiholi will join the Cabinet while Mr. Kumthalli and Mr. Patil will have to be content with chairmanships of State-level boards or corporations. “Mr. Jarkiholi will be a Minister and will most likely head Water Resources. The others may not make it,” say sources in the BJP. “Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has spoken to Mr. Patil and Mr. Kumthalli about this already. They will stay silent as long as Ramesh Jarkiholi is accommodated,” said a BJP executive committee member.

“Senior RSS functionaries in Belagavi district have also held a meeting with some BJP leaders from Athani and Kagwad where this issue was discussed,’’ the leader said.

BJP leaders admit that Mr. Katti’s claim cannot be dismissed easily. “He was not inducted the first time due to some of his utterances perceived as irresponsible statements. He was later instructed not to make controversial statements. He has also been meeting senior leaders of the party seeking inclusion. Now-a-days he is among the leaders who are most often seen with the Chief Minister. He is a senior Lingayat Banajiga leader and he cannot be neglected,” said another party leader.

Mr. Katti, however, said that he had stopped worrying about his non-inclusion. “Mr. Yediyurappa is an old friend and I accompany him during his tours. That is not to bring pressure on him to make me a Minister,” he said.

But such moves seem to have irked other senior MLAs. For instance, Abhay Patil who has won three terms is the lone MLA belonging to the Jain community whose members are seen as strong supporters of the BJP. He was known as a loyalist of the former Union Minister late Ananth Kumar. His non-inclusion is said to have disappointed him. But he says he will not seek Ministership. “I have grown up as a RSS volunteer. The background that I come from does not allow me to demand that I be made a Minister or that I try to lobby using my community leaders or religious heads. I am only of the opinion that my work in my constituency should be rewarded with a Ministry. If made a Minister, I will do well and bring a good name to the district and the party,’’ he told The Hindu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/how-many-more-will-join-the-cabinet-from-belagavi/article30636774.ece
130,2020/01/23,‘CAA isanti-poor’,"The former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan has said that the main opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was that it was discriminatory in nature and was based on religion, which should not be allowed in a country like India.

Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, Mr. Gopinathan said it was evident from CAA that it was aimed at targeting a particular community that too on a cooked-up rationale.

Mr. Gopinathan questioned the rationale behind including just Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh only, while leaving out religiously persecuted people from Myanmar and Sri Lanka.

“They have selected only six communities in these countries but there are other minority communities there. Also, they say these countries were selected because of Partition. Afghanistan was never a part of India during Partition. Whatever cooked-up rationale they are narrating is based on hatred and I don’t think we should allow a law based on hatred in this country,” he said.

“NRC is a document-based exercise to prove who is a citizen and who is not. It is not Hindu or Muslim. It is going to affect everyone. And, it is going to affect all who don’t have documents. It is the poor, Dalits, adivasis, women and all landless labour who will be affected. We have the example of Assam. It went on for six years. As many as 52,000 employees worked for it and a lot of money was spent. And, ultimately 19 lakh people were left out from the list and a majority of them were Hindus. Muslims were fewer in number. The common factor was that most of them were poor. Among them even genuine people were left out, including President’s medal winners who fought for the country in Kargil,” he said.

Referring to the government’s defence that CAA would not affect any Indian Muslim, Mr. Gopinathan said that when the issue of giving citizenship arose, it would be based on NRC and NRC was a document-based exercise. “Once the exercise begins, there will be two categories. One who is with documents and is an Indian and the other who is not having documents, a non-Indian. If you are Hindu, then you can come through CAA, and your citizenship issue will be considered. But if you are a Muslim, then, CAA will block your citizenship,” he said.

On why only Muslims were being seen in large numbers during the anti-CAA protest, he said that it was because they know that they were being targeted. But, apart from them, people from all walks of life were protesting against CAA, he said.

Mr. Gopinathan said that the CAA and NRC exercise was an unthoughtful one, like demonetisation, which had pushed the country backwards, and CAA was anti-poor.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iy9ls3/article30636557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24HBHUBBALLIKANNANGOPINATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caa-isanti-poor/article30636558.ece

134,2020/01/23,Mangaluru airport case | ‘Aditya acted alone after sourcing information from Internet’,"The police have so far not got any evidence to prove the involvement of any other person apart from Aditya Rao (37), who is in custody after surrendering, in placing an explosive at the Mangaluru International Airport on January 20.

The city police produced the accused in the 6th Judicial Magistrate First Class Court on Thursday and secured his custody for 10 days. Aditya has been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the Explosive Substances Act. Another case under Section 506 and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code has been registered for making a hoax call to the Mangaluru International Airport terminal manager on the same day.

Mangaluru Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha told presspersons on Thursday that it appeared like the handiwork of Aditya alone. The accused has told the police that he did it because he “wanted to achieve something bigger than merely making hoax calls”, the Commissioner said, and added that he learnt the “art of making improvised explosive” device from the Internet.

He had acted on his own while making hoax calls to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna railway station in Bengaluru in 2018, for which he was convicted and sentenced. “Soon after his release in the second half of 2019, he thought of doing something bigger than merely making hoax calls and moved to Mangaluru where he engaged himself in making improvised explosive device,” the Commissioner said.

Technical knowledge

A mechanical engineering and MBA (Marketing and Operations) degree holder, he made use of his technical knowledge and collected information on making of improvised explosive device from the Internet. Instead of directly purchasing the materials for preparing it, he got them from e-commerce platforms.

After making the explosive device using a timer, explosive substance, and detonator on January 19 in a room of King’s Court Hotel in Karkala, where he worked for some days, Aditya discreetly brought it to Mangaluru International Airport the next day and placed it near a flight ticket counter, said Dr. Harsha. The way Aditya could operate, Dr. Harsha said, is a matter of concern for the internal security of the country. “We are going deep into it. We will get finer details of his operations and file the charge sheet,” he said.

FSL, NSG to analyse material used

Apart from the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Mangaluru police are using the expertise of the Central agency — the National Security Guard (NSG) — to analyse the explosive device planted by Aditya, said Dr. Harsha. Dr. Harsha told reporters that the police cannot speculate whether Aditya placed the device to create a threat or cause explosion. “He has used technology in a major way to assemble a sound improvised explosive device with a timer and detonator,” he said. Remnants of the explosive device, after it was defused by controlled explosion, had been sent to the FSL, he said.

The decision to go for controlled explosion of the IED on January 20, Dr. Harsha said, was taken by the Western Range-level Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad of the State police. “Our duty was to cordon off the area. The BDDS team assessed the device and decided the course of action,” he said.

‘He had recced the airport 4 times’

Aditya had recced Mangaluru airport four times before planting the improvised explosive device on January 20, according to Dr. Harsha.

Dr. Harsha said that following some preliminary tests, Aditya completed assembling the explosive device by sitting in a room of a hotel in Karkala on January 19. He had moved to the hotel after having worked for nearly a month in a bar and restaurant in Mangaluru.

On January 20, he reached the airport from Karkala by taking two buses and then an autorickshaw and placed the bag with the device near a ticket counter.

Dr. Harsha said Aditya then proceeded to Sirsi and then to Shivamogga where he spent some time. “He got apprehensive about his arrest and took a KSRTC bus to Bengaluru where he surrendered at the office of the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police on Wednesday morning,” the Police Commissioner said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/op4f7c/article30637815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGADITYARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aditya-acted-alone-police-commissioner/article30633715.ece

136,2020/01/23,Christians urge govt. to install Jesus Christ statue at Kapala Betta,"A fact finding committee of the Christian community has decided to submit a report to the BJP government urging it to install a 114-ft. statue of Jesus Christ at Kapala Betta in Kanakapura taluk of Ramanagaram district.

A couple of days ago, members of the committee visited the place to find out facts related to the land and issues related to the statue.

Speaking to presspersons here on Thursday, Congress MLC Ivan D’souza said the committee would submit the report to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Revenue Minster R. Ashok and urge the government to construct the statue at the earliest.

The RSS and other BJP outfits have strongly opposed the installation, following which the government ordered suspension of the work. A few days ago, Kalladka Prabhakar, RSS ideologue, took out a rally in Kanakapura opposing the installation.

The previous H.D. Kumaraswamy government allocated 10 acres for the installation of the statue. The foundation stone for the project was laid in the presence of Congress MLA and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar on December 25, 2019.

Mr. D’souza said there was nothing wrong in allocation of gomala (revenue) land for installation of the statue. Previous governments had allocated gomala land for religious purposes of different communities. However, the present BJP government was using the statue issue for gaining political mileage, he claimed.

Earlier this month, a delegation of Christian religious leaders, including Archbishop of Bengaluru, Peter Machado, met Mr. Yediyurappa and submitted petition seeking permission to install the statue.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/christians-urge-govt-to-install-jesus-christ-statue-at-kapala-betta/article30632953.ece
137,2020/01/23,Mysuru Bar Association suspends activist Baburaj,"Child rights activist P.P. Baburaj, who is among the advocates seeking to represent Nalini Balakumar in the sedition case, has been suspended by the Mysuru Advocates’ Association.

Though the association’s decision was put up on its notice board in the Mysuru court complex, Mr. Baburaj, a former member of the Juvenile Justice Board, claimed he had not been informed the reason for it.

Mr. Baburaj had been summoned by the association’s office-bearers and questioned over video recording proceedings of the association’s general body meeting on Monday when it was discussing a demand for review of the resolution against appearing for persons accused in the sedition case.

‘Mobile phone checked’

“Though more than 165 advocates signed the Vakalathnama to appear for Ms. Balakumar, I was the only one summoned and grilled by three office-bearers in the presence of more than 30 other advocates,” he said. Mr. Baburaj said his mobile phone was also checked for video or audio recording of the proceedings.

Mr. Baburaj had not only signed the ‘Vakalathnama’ along with the others to appear for Ms. Balakumar, but was also one of the several signatories to the representation made to the association to review its resolution against appearing for persons accused of sedition.

“When I was summoned for questioning by the office-bearers of the association, I was threatened by several other advocates, who were not office-bearers, of dire circumstances for my ideology,” he said.

Mr. Baburaj’s suspension will not curtail his professional practice, but will deprive him of the facilities extended by the association.

Mr. Baburaj told The Hindu that he would contest the association’s decision before the State Bar council.

Meanwhile, the association had also set 5 p.m. on Wednesday as the deadline for the advocates, who had defied the resolution and signed the ‘Vakalathnama’ for Ms. Balakumar, to withdraw from the case.

Referring to claims that these advocates had been misled, Mr. Baburaj said the paper used for collecting signatures to press for review of the association’s resolution was white in colour while the ‘Vakalathnama’ was signed on a light green paper.

Meanwhile, Raghunath, who is counsel for Maridevaiah, president of University of Mysore’s Research Scholars’ Association, booked as an accused by the city police in the sedition case, said he would appear for his client when the case came up for hearing on January 24.

On the association’s deadline, Mr. Raghunath said advocates, if they wished to retire, could do so only when it came up for hearing in the court.

Bid to assault me: Manjula

Former chairperson of Karnataka State Women’s Commission Manjula Manasa has lodged a complaint before the Mysuru Advocates’ Association against an alleged attempt to assault her.

Ms. Manjula Manasa, also an advocate, said she was targeted by some advocates over the issue of representing Ms. Balakumar, an accused in the sedition case.

“The advocates not only used filthy language against me, but also tried to assault me,” she said.

“If I do not receive justice, I will lodge a police complaint,” she said, adding that she had given the association time till Thursday for taking action.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-bar-association-suspends-activist-baburaj/article30629492.ece
138,2020/01/23,NIMHANS study stresses on need for a national suicide prevention strategy,"For every death by suicide in India, there are more than 200 people with ‘suicidality’ and more than 15 suicide attempts.

Suicidality (thoughts, plans, attempts and acts inflicted by oneself with an intent to end life) is more prevalent at 5.1% than death by suicide at 0.024% among adults aged 18 years and above, thereby emerging as another public health problem that is unrecognised, states a study on prevalence and risk factors of suicidality in India by doctors from National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS).

Based on NMHS

The study titled ‘A population-based analysis of suicidality and its correlates: Findings from the National Mental Health Survey of India 2015–16’ has been published in The Lancet Psychiatry early this month. Covering 34,748 participants, it is based on analysis of suicidality data from the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of India 2015-2016.

Extrapolated to a larger population, the findings reveal that at any time point in 2015, over 30 million Indians aged 18 years and above had thought about ending their own life. An estimated 2.6 million had attempted suicide, a number higher than the population of few countries in the world.

About 1% of adults aged 18 years and older were reported to have a severe form of suicidality that requires urgent intervention. The occurrence of suicidality (in any form) was highest in those aged 40–49 years among women and in those aged 60 years or older among men; posing additional challenges in recognition and care delivery for older people, said G. Gururaj, Dean of Neuro Sciences and Senior Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at NIMHANS.

Dr. Gururaj, the corresponding author of the study, told The Hindu that the findings emphasise the need for a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. This is essential to efficiently address the social, demographic and psychiatric risk factors for reducing suicidality and suicide deaths in India.

Among areas of residence, a higher occurrence of suicidality was observed in urban-metropolitan residents (≥1,000,000 population), followed by rural residents and urban non-metropolitan (<1,000,000 population) for any form of suicidality. Noticeably, the occurrence of severe form of suicidality in urban metropolitan residents was more than twice that of rural residents and more than three times that of urban non-metropolitan residents. There were wide variations in the occurrence as well as the deaths that are expected to result from suicidality across the surveyed states; highlighting the role of state-specific factors and need for state specific action plans to address the burden of suicidality.

Demographic factors

The analysis showed that the occurrence of suicidality in women (6%) was higher than in men (4.1%) across all the surveyed States. It was found to be more common among individuals with poor income (belonging to lowest income quintile) as compared with the individuals belonging to other income quintiles. Moreover, the occurrence was found to decrease with increase in income (from low to high income quintile) indicating the major role of socio-economic factors in suicide prevention, Dr. Gururaj explained.

“The risk of severe form of suicidality among those with depressive disorders was 28 times as high as the risk among those without depressive disorders. Also, the risk of severe form of suicidality among those with alcohol use disorders was 7 times the risk of severe form of suicidality among those without alcohol use disorders,” he said.

To reduce morbidity and mortality from suicidality and death by suicide in India, the available data on suicide at the national level in combination with findings from this study can be used to develop the framework for the national suicide prevention strategy, he added.

Diﬀerence between suicide and suicidality Suicide is the act of deliberately ending one’s own life (fatal outcome), whereas suicidality refers to all thoughts, plans and acts of suicide without a fatal outcome and thus excludes those acts of suicide that resulted in death. Even though suicidality excludes death by the above deﬁnition, the morbidity associated with suicidality can be more than many other health problems including mental health problems. Moreover, the co-occurrence of suicidality with mental health and other chronic problems, and even in adverse social situations is a matter of serious concern, said Dr. Gururaj.

139,2020/01/23,Government withdraws order allowing recovery of farm loans,"Following sharp criticism from the Opposition over removing the bar on recovery of farm loans disbursed for the 2016-2017 monsoon season, the Cooperation Department on Wednesday withdrew the advisory given to the Karnataka State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development (KSCARD) Bank to recover such loans.

In a clarification given to the MD of KSCARD Bank on Wednesday, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) has said that the letter dated December 27, 2019, that had allowed recovery of farm loans has been withdrawn till further orders. In fact, it was the RCS, based on the Finance Department’s opinion, that had lifted the ban on recovery of such loans.

Further, the letter said that the withdrawal order has come from the Cooperation Minister. It said that the Minister had on Wednesday directed for the withdrawal of the December 27, 2019, letter. The RCS letter has also asked the KSCARD Bank MD to inform the decision to all officials and branches and submit a report in this connection.

Considering the serious drought situation that prevailed in the State during 2016-17, the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had directed the cooperative sector officials not to recover loans that pertained to the Monsoon season of 2016-17. However, the Finance Department had recently said that the department had not given any concurrence as the decision was taken by the CM, and that the decision of KSCARD Bank not to initiate recovery was not a valid justification.

Soon after media reports emerged, Mr. Siddaramaiah slammed the government and termed the decision ‘anti-farmer’. In a series of tweets late on Tuesday, he warned of agitation if the decision was not revoked.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7wyf6d/article30629476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGDROUGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-withdraws-order-allowing-recovery-of-farm-loans/article30629477.ece
140,2020/01/23,‘Law does not insist on online application for disability certificate’,"The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the State government to ensure that authorities are properly instructed to issue certificate of disability by processing the physical forms received and not to insist on submission of applications online as the online facility was merely an additional way to receive applications as per the law.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued directions on a PIL petition, filed by Chandrashekhar Puttappa and two others from Bengaluru, seeking direction for effective enforcement the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

Though the State government, following a direction issued by the court, framed and notified the Karnataka State Right of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2019, it was pointed out by petitioners’ counsel that the certifying authorities are insisting on submitting applications online though Rule 14 enables submissions in physical form.

After analysing the Rules, the Bench directed the government to issue necessary instruction to issue certificates within a month as prescribed, acting on the applications filed in physical form and verifying disability as per the law.

Mental Health Care Act

The Bench, hearing another PIL petition filed by N. Sanjay and another person from Bengaluru, that had complained about the failure of the State government to implement the Mental Health Care (MHC) Act, 2017, has set a deadline of one month for the fovernment to constitute the State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) and appoint a CEO to the authority as per the law.

Observing that the government had breached the mandate of the MHC Act as the deadline to constitute the SMHA was January 6, 2018, the Bench said the SMHA, within two months of its constitution, should set up Mental Health Review Boards as prescribed in the Act.

It also directed the Centre to take necessary steps within two months for approving the draft State Rules framed by the State government under the MHC Act.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vometv/article30629474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/law-does-not-insist-on-online-application-for-disability-certificate/article30629475.ece
141,2020/01/23,‘Protected cultivation’ tech. to be showcased,"This year’s edition of the country’s biggest specialised horticulture fair being organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) will be held on the institute’s Hessarghatta campus on the outskirts of Bengaluru from February 5 to 8. “The National Horticulture Fair-2020 is a national event in true sense as it will have farmer visitors from all the States in the country,” Dhananjaya M.V., principal scientist and organising secretary of the fair, told The Hindu.

“Farmers from every State in the country will have something relevant for them in the fair either in terms of crops or technologies as the IIHR has a diverse portfolio of researches and technologies to suit different agro-climatic regions of the country,” he said. The institute has released 289 varieties in 55 crops so far besides developing 145 technologies related to horticulture. The IIHR is expecting about 50,000 farmers to visit the fair. The theme of this year’s fair is ‘Horticulture: Making farming an enterprise’.

‘Protected cultivation’

As part of efforts to turn farming into an enterprise, the IIHR is trying to popularise the hi-tech concept of “protected cultivation” involving production under polyhouses and shade nets. The fair will showcase the methods as well as technologies related to cultivation of crops under polyhouses and shade nets.

Principal scientist T.S. Aghora, who is also in charge of Prioritisation, Monitoring and Evaluation Cell of the IIHR, said protected cultivation comprising polyhouses and shade nets had become a necessity now not only to increase production, but also to ensure quality of produce that have demand in niche markets.

The IIHR had standardised the production technologies for protected cultivation by developing protocols for various prominent crops to help farmers, he said.

The main intention was to reach the hi-tech farming method of protected cultivation to all classes of farmers depending upon their requirement, he said. The IIHR had taken up trial-based researches to promote cultivation of crops such as capsicum under shade net, whose establishment cost would be less than half of that of setting up polyhouses, he said.

About 50 such trials taken up by IIHR scientists in the fields of farmers in different areas had shown significant increase in yield levels when capsicum was cultivated under shade net, he said.

Organic farming

The institute has also developed standardised package of practices for organic farming with respect to 12 crops, including tomato, okra, French beans, and several leafy vegetables, he said. The organic farming practices will be on display during the fair.

In addition to this, technologies related to soil-less cultivation, floriculture, integrated horticultural farming, and various fruit crops will be on display at the fair.

The institute, which is also striving to encourage educated youth to set up horticultural enterprises, is roping in some of the successful entrepreneurs, who have obtained licences for commercialisation of its products, to showcase their work at the fair.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/protected-cultivation-tech-to-be-showcased/article30629473.ece

143,2020/01/23,"BJP to hoist tricolour in 58,000 booths in support of CAA","The BJP State unit would hold flag-hoisting ceremonies in all the 58,000 booths in the State to express solidarity with the CAA on January 26, BJP State general secretary N. Ravikumar has said.

Mr. Ravikumar told presspersons here on Wednesday that this programme is aimed at countering the misunderstanding being spread by the Opposition parties, especially the Congress, about CAA.

The Congress has resorted to a propaganda against the CAA targeting the Muslim community. Therefore, the onus would be on the BJP to remove such wrong understanding among them and inform about how their life would not get affected by the new Act, he said.

Working on this direction, the party has already directly contacted over 75 lakh people in the State through various means. The party workers have visited over 27 lakh households, collected signature of over 6.7 lakh people. And, around 1.6 lakh people have directly written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi supporting the CAA, he said and added that the party has set a target to reach out to at least one crore people by January 26.

The BJP has asked all booth presidents to hoist the national flag on Republic Day in their areas and collect the signatures of people attending such functions. Elected representatives from the respective booths would also attend, he said and added that if Ministers in the Union Cabinet and also the State Cabinet were available, they too would take part.

Booth-level presidents would speak on the CAA and hold discussions with the public on the plight of refugees who have fled to India due to religious persecution in the three Islamic countries. The attendants would also be requested to give a miss call to Ph: 8866288662 in support of CCA, he said.

BJP State general secretary Mahesh Tenginkai, who was present at the press conference, lashed out at the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and termed his reported comment on the Mangaluru explosives case as “lousy”. Being a former Chief Minister, he should not speak lightly about the police force.

144,2020/01/23,A school without a regular teacher,"A government lower primary school at Idakani near Kalasa in Mudigere taluk has not had a regular teacher for the last two months. This has left the parents and school development monitoring committee worried about the future of the 16 students enrolled in the school.

The only assistant teacher appointed to the school was transferred two months ago. Since then, there have been none.

The Education Department made a temporary arrangement by appointing a local graduate as guest faculty. However, the guest faculty has no formal training in teaching.

Prashanth Shetty, a resident of the village told The Hindu, “It is okay if the department appoints a guest faculty in addition to regular teachers.

But, allowing a guest faculty to run a school is not a good idea. Our school needs a regular teacher.” The teacher has to teach all the subjects from class 1 to 5, which is a herculean task. Besides teaching, they have other responsibilities like overseeing midday meal staff. Moreover, guest faculty do not get honorarium regularly.

The midday meal staff are also finding it difficult to manage as there is no regular teachers to maintain records of expenditure and procure vegetables required. At present, they are managing with the help of SDMC members.

Villagers and SDMC members have appealed to senior officers of the department to depute a regular teacher to the school. A resident has also written to Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar about the school. They are expecting a reply from him.

When The Hindu contacted K.N. Jayanna, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, he said a guest faculty had been appointed to the school as of now.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wcu81w/article30628536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGCHIKKAMAGALURUSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-school-without-a-regular-teacher/article30628537.ece
145,2020/01/23,Mysuru farmers welcome move to halt loan recovery,"The State Sugarcane Growers’ Association, Mysuru, has welcomed the State government’s move to suspend recovery of loans taken from Primary, Cooperative, Agriculture and Rural Development (PCARD) banks with immediate effect.

Farmers had staged protests across the State, including Mysuru, over the loan recovery, which also included seizure of tractors for defaults and alleged collection of blank cheques from farmers.

Association President Kurubur Shanthkumar, who had staged the protest with hundreds of farmers here on Wednesday morning against what he called “forcible recovery” of tractor loans, told The Hindu that the government has responded positively to farmers’ concerns.

Registrar of Cooperative Societies N.S. Prasanna Kumar, in a letter to the Managing Director, Karnataka State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (KASCARD), on Wednesday, a copy of which is with The Hindu, asked for withholding the loan recovery until further instructions.

The MD had also been asked to direct district branches and PCARD banks to comply with the order.

Earlier, Mr. Shanthkumar, while addressing the protesters, had said that farmers who had taken loans for purchasing tractors from PCARD banks had been put to difficulty because of the previous government’s reported announcement.

“The JD(S)-Congress government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy had promised to waive tractor loans after the waiver of crop loans. Therefore, the farmers did not pay their instalments towards their tractor loan. But the banks resorted to recovery, collecting blank cheques from farmers. The banks had also seized tractors,” he said.

He said the farmers were in a state of distress over floods and drought and were not getting suitable price for their produce such as sugarcane and paddy and had therefore demanded suspension of loan recovery and return of the blank cheques and tractors.

Mr. Shanthkumar also sought action against the bank staff for their “unrestrained behaviour” in recovering loan amounts.

Association Secretary Attahalli Devaraju, District President B. Somashekar and others were present during the protest.

As a precautionary measure, police personnel had been deployed at the protest site.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5l6hzl/article30628508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGKURUBUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-farmers-welcome-move-to-halt-loan-recovery/article30628509.ece
146,2020/01/23,"NRC will divide India into two countries, says Dwarakanath","Strongly opposing the National Register of Citizens (NRC), C.S. Dwarakanath, advocate and former chairman of Karnataka State Backward Classes’ Commission, said that if implemented, it would divide India into two countries: one with minorities who prove their citizenship by furnishing the required documents, and the other with a majority of indigenous people who cannot prove their citizenship in NRC thanks to the absence of required documents.

“There are over 100 nomadic tribes in Karnataka alone. The population of some tribes is just 15. Their total population is around 150 million as per the 2011 census. These nomads don’t have any permanent residents. There are 80 million people belonging to other tribes. They don’t own any property. There are 17 million people who don’t have houses. How can all these people prove their citizenship in the NRC process? It is simply impossible,” Mr. Dwarakanath, who made an in-depth study on nomadic tribes in the State, said here on Wednesday.

Terming the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) unconstitutional, he said that the Act violated the basic principles of the Constitution.

“As per Article 14 of the Constitution, all are equal before the law. The State cannot discriminate against its people based on any cultural identity including the religion. The Act in question, however, offers citizenship based on religion and is, thus, unconstitutional. Never in the history of independent India that the citizenship was offered on the basis of religion,” he said.

Pointing to the “illogical explanation” to select six religious minorities — Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains, Christians, and Buddhists — from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to offer citizenship under the CAA, Mr. Dwarakanath said that the government did not explain why other religious minorities from other countries were left out.

“Many people think that it is anti-Muslim and anti-lingual as well. Many Tamils have migrated from Sri Lanka during the civil war. They are not included in the Act. The government should consider the cultural identities or the geographical regions in offering citizenship. Doing so goes diagonally opposite to our tradition,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/eufx4r/article30628499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGKALABURAGINRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nrc-will-divide-india-into-two-countries-says-dwarakanath/article30628500.ece

Mr. Akshath Rao stays with his father in an apartment in Mangaluru. Mr. Akshath Rao, who works in a public sector bank, said he and his family members did not know anything about Aditya’s activities. “We do not have any contact with him. We are not responsible for what he has done. My father and I have kept away from him. I am earning my livelihood. My father tried to correct him, but failed. We have not supported him in any way; not even in getting out on bail [following his arrest by the Bengaluru police in 2018],” he said.

Aditya, a bachelor, had done B.E. and MBA and details of his academic records had been given to the police, Mr. Akshath Rao said.

In Manipal, neighbours hardly knew about Aditya whose family used to live in a house at the HUDCO Colony opposite the picturesque Mannu Palla lake. According to them the family shifted to Mangaluru about eight months ago. The house was deserted, with only a motorcycle parked outside.

Poornima Bhojaraju, former secretary of the HUDCO Colony Society, told The Hindu that Aditya’s father, B. Krishna Murthy Rao, was an ex-bank officer. Mr. Krishna Murthy Rao and his wife lived in Manipal for about 20 years and shifted to Mangaluru after the latter expired. “They were a nice couple. Mr. Krishna Murthy Rao’s wife was not keeping well. She was into gardening and had planted medicinal plants around Mannu Palla lake,” Ms. Bhojaraju said.

151,2020/01/23,Tourists escape unhurt as houseboat catches fire in Kerala,"Sixteen people, including 13 tourists and three crew, had a miraculous escape on Thursday after a houseboat they were cruising caught fire near Pathiramanal Island in Vembanad Lake around 1.15 p.m.

The Muhamma police said the passengers and the crew escaped unhurt. Six women, two babies, a four-year-old boy, and four men from Kannur set off from Kumarakom in a double-decker houseboat named Oceana around 11.30 a.m. When the boat reached Pathiramanal, a blaze started in the kitchen and soon spread to other parts of the boat.

Sandbars to the rescue

Officials said the boat caught fire in an area with sandbars. “The passengers and the crew jumped onto a sandbar where water level was 5 ft. This helped them save their lives,” said an official.

The crew of S-54, a passenger boat of the State Water Transport Department that was conducting service from Muhamma to Kumarakom, were the first to reach the spot.

The crew helped to shift some of the passengers, including the infants. Though a speed boat also reached the spot, it sank in the lake.

Later, another boat was sent and the stranded passengers were transported to the Muhamma boat jetty and then to the Alappuzha guest house.

Sources said the houseboat had been operating without mandatory licences.

Meanwhile, the Ports Department, the licensing authority, has launched a probe into the incident.

“We have launched a probe. We are yet to ascertain the cause of the incident. The blaze may have been caused by LPG leak or short circuit,” Alappuzha port officer Capt. Hari Achutha Warrier told The Hindu.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4lbty2/article30637235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tval6-houseboat,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourists-escape-unhurt-as-houseboat-catches-fire/article30637233.ece

Mohanan has said they are still members of the organisation.

This apparently goes against the views of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and party State committee member P. Jayarajan who had claimed that the youths were indeed Left-wing extremists. They were recently handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for questioning.

Internal inquiry

Mr. Mohanan told the media here on Thursday that the party’s internal inquiry was yet to be completed as they were in judicial custody. “We could not get their version as yet,” he said.

Asked about the media reports that the two had been suspended from the party, Mr. Mohanan sais the media would be informed about such a development as and when it happened. He feigned ignorance about Mr. Jayarajan’s statement and said the Chief Minister must have spoken based on police reports.

‘Will try to correct them’

Mr. Mohanan said the party would try to correct them if they were found to have been influenced by Left-wing extremism. “They are too young. They may have come under certain ideological illusion as a result of their friendship with some people.”

“Their parents have apparently complained that party activists are not meeting them or inquiring about them. We are taking their concerns at face value,” Mr. Mohanan said.

“Our party is against slapping the UAPA... We hope that they will prove their innocence and come back... The prosecution will happen only after it is cleared by the judicial commission that reviews such cases,” he said.

153,2020/01/23,UN praise for Thrissur tourism,"Kerala Tourism’s Barrier-free Tourism project has received global recognition with the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) making special mention of the State as an ‘Emerging Global Destination’ in the Accessible Destination Awards 2019.

At a ceremony in the Spanish capital of Madrid as part of the FITUR Trade Fair on Wednesday, Kerala Tourism Director P. Bala Kiran received the conferment from UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili. The recognition was for the implementation of the project in Thrissur, which thus became the country’s only destination to win the honour instituted by WTO and ONCE Foundation that works for people with disabilities.

Kerala Tourism launched the barrier-free project in March 2019 with the view of making 120 destinations differently abled-friendly. Thrissur is one of the first in the State to create necessary infrastructure in all major destinations. This project was conceptualised using funds under ‘Barrier-free Tourism’ and the ‘Green Carpet’ scheme.

Of the differently abled-friendly projects in 80 travel destinations across the State, eight are in Thrissur district. Kerala has been the first State to work as per the UNWTO guidelines on making tourist destinations more accessible to the differently abled. The facilities include ramps, accessible toilets, lactation rooms, Braille pamphlets, signage, touch-screen kiosks, audio and sign aids, wheelchairs and walking aids.

Tactile paths for the visually challenged were created for the first time in Kerala at Azhikkode and Snehatheeram, while a wheelchair-accessible sunset viewpoint is the highlight of Vilangankunnu. There is ramp access for boating area in Poomala. As part of the project, the Thumboormoozhi hanging bridge and viewpoints will soon be made accessible to the differently abled.

The Thrissur District Promotion Council has already received the coveted status as a listed supplier of PANTOU (Promoting Accessible Tourism around the World) network based in Europe in 2018.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/un-praise-for-thrissur-tourism/article30637124.ece
154,2020/01/23,KPCC labours with recast,"A certain amount of variability appears to vex the final announcement of the reconstituted Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC).

The ‘ambivalence’ about the list submitted by the KPCC to the party’s high command in New Delhi centres around the size of the panel of nominated office-bearers. By some accounts, the central leadership of the party feels the list is disproportionately heavy at the top.

The KPCC proposes a marked increase in the number of working presidents, vice presidents, general secretaries and secretaries in an attempt to accommodate various factional, regional and communal interests in the run-up to the local body elections this year. The KPCC leadership also factors in the reluctance of some senior leaders to give up their party positions.

However, an indication that some leaders loath a top-heavy KPCC emerged in the public domain when V.D. Satheeshan, MLA, currently one of the three working presidents, has opted out of the race.

‘The butt of jokes’

In a Facebook post, Mr. Satheeshan says an outsize party committee would make the KPCC the butt of jokes in public. He reveals that he has requested the All India Congress Committee (AICC) not to consider him for any party post in Kerala.

Some quarters say Mr. Satheeshan’s position is consistent with that of the Congress high command which has dropped strong hints that it prefers its MPs and MLAs to voluntarily stay away from key party positions to focus more on their constituencies.

In contrast, Kodikunnil Suresh, MP and another KPCC working president, says he would stick to his post. The AICC, which appointed him, would decide whether he should relinquish his position as part of the re-organisation or continue.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy have been in New Delhi at the behest of the high command these days to discuss the reconstitution of the party in Kerala.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kpcc-labours-with-recast/article30637115.ece
155,2020/01/23,Land acquisition cells for SHSR,"The government has decided to set up land acquisition cells in 10 districts for acquiring land for the 531.45-km semi-high-speed railway line (SHSR) from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod.

A high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday also decided to issue notification for acquiring land for the 10 SHSR stations — Kochuveli, Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Tirur, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod — for the third and fourth railway lines that will traverse through 11 districts, except Alappuzha, Idukki and Wayanad.

Only 1,226.45 hectares will have to be acquired for the ₹56,443-crore SHSR corridor that will be away from the existing railway line in the 300-km Kochuveli-Shoranur section and parallel to the existing line from Thirunavaya to Kasaragod with railway bypasses at Vadakara and Thalassery.

Railways to give land

Railways have agreed to make available unused land of 200 acres in its possession in the corridors where the SHSR runs parallel to the existing line. This will further bring down the land needed for the project.

The move to commence land acquisition comes in the wake of the in-principle approval given by the Union government to the SHSR, named Silver Line, to be executed by a joint venture of the Kerala government and the Ministry of Railways on cost-sharing basis.

Securing funds

The State government and Kerala Railway Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL), the special purpose vehicle set up to execute viable projects, have already initiated steps to secure funds from international funding agencies.

The meeting was informed by Managing Director, KRDCL, V. Ajith Kumar, that the detailed project report (DPR) would be ready by March 2020. The government is planning to kick off work this year and complete the project by 2024.

The project is estimated to cost ₹66,079 crore by the time of its completion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/khflbk/article30637101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tv-semi-high-speed-railDCcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-acquisition-cells-for-shsr/article30637102.ece

158,2020/01/23,Drive to make key roads garbage-free,"Aimed at making major roads in the districts garbage-free, the Kottayam district administration will take up a massive clean-up drive on January 25.

According to officials the drive is being initiated in association with various departments and local bodies in the district. Members of the Haritha Karma Sena, National Service Scheme and other voluntary organisations will take part in the mission.

Waste collection

The biodegradable waste to be collected during the drive will be disposed of at select locations and plastic wastes will be handed over for recycling after segregation by the local bodies concerned.

Stern action, including imposition of fines, will be initiated against those found dumping waste on road and in waterbodies.

The district administration has engaged three agencies — Clean Kerala Company, Scrap Merchants Association and Ex-service Men Environmental Services — to clear the nondegradable waste to be collected from the streets.

An action plan designating separate areas of operation for each of these agencies has been formulated.

159,2020/01/23,Municipal chief’s resignation sought,"The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) has launched a protest demanding the resignation of Alappuzha municipal chairman Illikkal Kunjumon over graft charges.

On Thursday, LDF councillors in the municipal council staged a dharna in front of the municipal office raising the demand.

Inaugurating the dharna, LDF council party leader D. Lakshmanan said the United Democratic Front (UDF) rule in the municipality was enmeshed in corruption.

Allegation

On Wednesday, a private firm owned by a young couple alleged that the municipal chairman had demanded bribe from them for granting permission for conducting an underwater tunnel expo near the Alappuzha beach. Archa Unni, managing director of Niel Entertainment, alleged that Mr. Kunjumon had demanded ₹10 lakh.

Audio clips containing the purported conversation between Mr. Kunjumon and their representatives have been released.

The firm has filed complaints with the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) and the District Police Chief. Officials of the VACB said they had not yet launched an inquiry into the complaint. “To launch a preliminary inquiry, we need to get nod from the VACB headquarters. We have already informed the top brass about the complaint and are awaiting a response,” said an official of the VACB Alappuzha unit. The owners of the firm said that they had not paid any bribe to the municipal officials. According to Niel Entertainment, it approached the municipality for permission last year. As the civic body delayed its nod, the firm moved the High Court. The court then issued an order in favour of the firm. Subsequently, both the municipality and the Ports Department granted permission to conduct the expo in November 2019. While, the Ports Department allowed them to use the land till February 23, 2020, the municipality granted permission for the firm to conduct the expo till January 23, 2020.

The municipal chairman, who is a member of the Congress, termed the corruption charges against him baseless.

163,2020/01/23,"8,102 title deeds to be distributed today","Nearly 40,000 applications for title deeds are pending before the Revenue Department, as the district gears up for ‘pattaya mela’ on Friday.

The number of title deeds to be distributed at the mela is 8,102, selected from nearly 19,000 applications found eligible.

According to Revenue Department officials, of the 40,000 applications received, many were found ineligible in the preliminary verification itself. They were without proper documents or claims on land.

Various categories

The title deeds are given under various categories depending on the area. In addition to the title deeds under the forest rights rules, deeds are given to land in tribal settlements outside forests, and in Wagamon under the Peerumade taluk where a land tribunal verification was held to ascertain claims.

The title deeds are made ready after survey, land verification, and examining official documents.

The rest of the applications will be considered and steps taken to allot title deeds to deserving applications, according to officials.

After the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government came to power in the State, 20,419 title deeds were given away. Under the United Democratic Front (UDF) government, 20,419 title deeds were distributed in the district.

The government had allotted title deeds for five cents each to the landless people at Kuttyarvalley, near Munnar, recently. The intention is to allot them houses under the LIFE Mission scheme.

They are eligible for houses under the scheme if an agreement is signed with the grama panchayat before January 31.

The Revenue Department would be able to issue 4,000 title deeds in the district once the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change gave the mandatory clearance for the same.

165,2020/01/23,Kerala Governor sticks to his stand on CAA,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has reiterated his stand that the State Assembly’s move against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is against the rules and regulations.

Addressing newspersons here on Thursday, Mr. Khan said he would do what was expected of him by the Constitution. Even when maintaining that he had not changed his stand on the government’s move against the CAA, the Governor said there was no confrontation with the government.

He said the administrative system had its own means to sort out issues, and that he was ready for discussions with anyone, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Mr. Khan said he was yet to see the draft of the government’s policy that he would be reading while addressing the Assembly soon. Mr. Khan refused to comment about Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan finding fault with the Governor for not informing him about the dissent over the government’s decision to approach the Supreme Court against the CAA.

He said the comment made by former Governor P. Sathasivam that the government was free to approach the Supreme Court, was a personal one.

166,2020/01/23,Muslim organisations unhappy with SC decision,"The Supreme Court's refusal to stay the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) appears to have not gone down well with most Muslim organisations in the State with some even stating the apex court has failed to address the concerns of the community about the controversial law.

The apex court not only declined to take note of the protests at the national-level but also put aside the pleas for postponing the process of the National Population Register (NPR). Incidentally, the Supreme Court had on January 9 dismissed a plea that sought the CAA be declared constitutional.

In December 2019, the BJP-led government legislated the CAA that fast-tracks naturalisation for illegal immigrants from six non-Muslim minority religious groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), one of the petitioners in the case and first off the block among Opposition parties to challenge the CAA, said the party would continue to fight the issue legally and democratically. “There is no compromise on the issue. The party will continue with agitations,” K.P.A. Majeed, State secretary of the party, said.

IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty had objected to the Bill when Union Home Minister Amit Shah tabled it in the Lok Sabha on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. Besides, the party in the apex court had sought the government to clarify whether the NRC would be implemented throughout the country.

Unhappy with the Supreme Court decision, Popular Front of India (PFI) vice chairman O.M. Salam and general secretary M. Mohammedali Jinnah said the apex court stuck to its technicalities instead of allaying the fears of the people about the discriminatory law.

Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar expressing disappointment over the postponement of the petitions, felt that peaceful protests should continue. About 75% of the citizens were against the CAA, he said.

Jamaat Islamic Kerala Amir M.I. Abdul Azeez felt that the Supreme Court could have put on hold the execution of the CAA in view of the volatile situation in the country. The court had an obligation to protect the rights of the citizens and uphold constitutional values in a democratic country. If the court took a similar stand on important issues, it would adversely affect the faith of the people in judiciary, he said in a statement.

Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen State president T.P. Abdulla Koya Madani and general secretary Muhammed Madani said the Supreme Court was the last resort of the secular democratic forces. However, protests should continue till the CAA was revoked, they said.

The Students Islamic Organisation said the Supreme Court had considered the petitions without respecting the sentiments and protests going on in the country.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/muslim-organisations-unhappy-with-sc-decision/article30635773.ece
167,2020/01/23,CPI(M) bid to steer clear of UAPA row,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is making an earnest bid to steer clear of the row over the police slamming the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on two party workers by distancing itself from the government stance and adhering to the stated position against wantonly invoking its provisions.

A section of senior leaders, including general secretary Sitaram Yechury, had reiterated that the party had an unflinching stance on imposing UAPA and would not alter it at any cost. The decision to invoke the Act against the two party workers, Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal, on charges of Maoist links and the decision to impose UAPA had put the party in a tight spot.

For, the youths as well as their families with strong CPI(M) moorings had publicly expressed their confidence in the party and the local leadership had risen up to their expectations too. But the government stance, largely based on the information shared by the police had led to a confusion and it reached a flashpoint with Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader M.K. Muneer calling on the families offering legal assistance if the CPI(M) leadership was found to be wanting.

Such tactical moves alerted the CPI(M) leadership to swing into action and declare solidarity with the family and extend organisational support to the youths to mend their ways, if they had gone wayward. This intervention of the Kozhikode CPI(M) leadership is expected to give a reprieve to the youths under NIA custody, a much needed moral support for their families and stave off the United Democratic Front (UDF) bid to reap political mileage by placing the onus on the party for the plight of the youths.

Any decision to religiously implement Central laws such as the UAPA may be misread at a time when the party and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) have taken a vociferous position against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and is spearheading the agitations to protect the rights of minorities.

This may also give a leeway for the UDF, which is still on the backfoot in organising CAA agitations, and in anticipation, the party has veered round to a position to pursue its own course on UAPA unmindful of the government stance on the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-bid-to-steer-clear-of-uapa-row/article30635302.ece
168,2020/01/23,PCB chief calls it quits,"State Pollution Control Board (PCB) Chairman Ajit Haridas resigned on Wednesday night, days after the board members unanimously passed a no-confidence motion against him and the State government sought an explanation from him based on the board’s recommendations.

Dr. Haridas had been at loggerheads with the rest of the board members on PCB’s issuance of a show-cause notice to the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation charging an environmental compensation fine of ₹14 crore for its alleged failure in complying with solid waste management rules. The members alleged that this and similar decisions against other local bodies were taken by the Chairman unilaterally.

The show-cause notice, which came before the Vattiyurkavu Assembly byelection in which the then Mayor V.K. Prasanth was a candidate, had kicked up a political storm with the Opposition making it one of the campaign issues. The Corporation had maintained that the notice was issued without considering all the efforts made in developing a model of waste treatment at source. Mayor K. Sreekumar had alleged that the action was being taken against the Corporation because it rejected a proposal for a waste-to-energy plant submitted by the PCB Chairman, before he took charge.

High Court stay

Early in December, the Kerala High Court stayed further proceedings on the board’s show-cause notice issued in September against the Corporation. The board members passed the unanimous resolution against him at a special meeting held on December 27.

Dr. Haridas confirmed that he had conveyed his decision to step down to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He told The Hindu that he was yet to receive a communication that the government had accepted his resignation.

“There is no provision for the board members to move a no-confidence motion against the Chairman and, as such, the resolution is illegal.” Asked about the show-cause notice issued to the Corporation, he said he had gone strictly by the rules as he was expected to do in his capacity as PCB Chairman.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xbhux/article30635086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ajith-Haridas,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pcb-chief-calls-it-quits/article30635087.ece
169,2020/01/23,SSI murder: police recover handgun from Kochi,"The Tamil Nadu Police investigating the “Islamic terrorism-linked” fatal shooting of special sub-inspector Wilson on Thursday recovered a .32 calibre semi-automatic pistol from a highly polluted urban refuse clogged gutter abutting an inter-State bus terminal in Kochi.

State officials who aided the Tamil Nadu team said the “radicalised youth” who “assassinated” Wilson at the Kaliyikkavila border checkpost on the night of January 8 had used a weapon of the same calibre. The officer had sustained three fatal bullet wounds. The police recovered three empty shells and two live .32 pistol ammunition from the scene of the crime. The ammunition appeared factory-made. However, the police initially inferred from grainy surveillance camera images that the assailants had used a country-made handgun.

The provenance of the weapon and bullets seized from the scene of the crime is a subject of interest for the Kerala Police. An officer said illegal gunsmiths at Munger in Bihar, a region known for its skilled lathe and metal workers, were known to forge similar pistols and replicas of sophisticated weapons. Only a detailed ballistic examination would reveal the make of the handgun.

Quoting Tamil Nadu officials, the police said the Q-branch had retraced the movements of the accused after they fled the scene of crime. The suspects had entered a mosque on the Kerala side of the border. They later presumably stayed in two localities in Thiruvananthapuram, including a night in a dormitory at a mosque in Neyyattinkara. (Officials said the mosque authorities had no complicity in the crime.)

Accused held

They later travelled to Karnataka via Kochi. The Kerala police suspect that the accused abandoned the firearm in the gutter, on their way to Udupi, from where the Q-branch arrested them last week.

The accused are Abdul Sameem of Thiruvithancodu in Thukalay and Thoufiq of Ilangkadai in Nagercoil. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the case. The State police had slapped the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on the youth.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i58b8a/article30639972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pistoljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tn-police-recover-handgun-from-a-gutter-in-kochi/article30635004.ece
170,2020/01/23,Arogya Sanjeevani a boon to AYUSH treatments,"Arogya Sanjeevani, the standard health insurance policy announced recently by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI), seems to have done away with the earlier provision that National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH) approval is a must for getting health insurance benefits from hospitals in the ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha, sowa rigpa and homoeopathy (AYUSH) sectors.

According to the new guidelines issued by the IRDAI on January 1, an AYUSH hospital is “a health-care facility wherein medical, surgical, or para-surgical treatment procedures and interventions are carried out by AYUSH medical practitioners”.

Standalone hospitals

The categories of facilities include Central or State government AYUSH hospitals or teaching hospitals attached to AYUSH colleges recognised by the Central government, Central Council of Indian Medicine or Central Council of Homeopathy. They can be standalone hospitals or those co-located with inpatient facilities of any recognised system of medicine registered with the local authorities.

Criteria

To get the health insurance benefits, the AYUSH hospital should have at least five inpatient beds. It should be supervised round the clock by an AYUSH medical practitioner. The hospital should have dedicated therapy sections under medical rules and a well-equipped operation theatre.

The hospital should keep a daily record of patients and make them accessible to the insurance company’s representatives, the guidelines said.

Guidelines issued

The IRDAI had on November 26 issued guidelines saying that reimbursement facility at the AYUSH hospitals was subject to the certification by the NABH.

These hospitals were asked to obtain either a pre-entry-level certificate or a higher-entry-level certificate issued by the NABH or a State-level certificate or a higher-level certificate under the National Quality Assurance Standards issued by the National Health Systems Resources Centre.

Those running small private hospitals in the ayurveda sector in the State were not happy with these provisions as only over a dozen of the total 1,000 such institutions are NABH certified now.

Only around 70 private ayurveda hospitals had been certified by the NABH across the country, they had said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/arogya-sanjeevani-a-boon-to-ayush-treatments/article30634416.ece
171,2020/01/23,Mortal remains of 8 Indian tourists being flown back home from Nepal,"The mortal remains of eight Indian tourists, including four minors who died of possible asphyxiation in their room at a mountainous resort in Nepal, are being flown back home on Thursday, officials said.

All formalities have been completed and the bodies are being flown from Kathmandu to New Delhi, according to sources at the Indian Embassy here.

The mortal remains of Praveen Krishnan Nair, his wife Saranya Sasi and their three children will be taken to Thiruvananthapuram, and of Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, his wife Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and their son to Kozhikode.

They were among a group of 15 tourists from Kerala who had checked into a resort in Daman, a popular tourist spot in Makawanpur district, some 70 km south of Kathmandu.

The group, after travelling to Pokhara, a popular mountainous tourist destination, was on its way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman on Monday night.

According to the manager at the resort, Shiva K.C., the families arrived in a reserved vehicle and were supposed to stay in the resort for only one night.

Although they had booked a total of four rooms, eight of them stayed in a room and turned on a gas heater for warmth, the manager said, adding that all the windows and the door of the room were bolted from inside.

All of them were found unconscious the next day. Doctors declared them brought dead when they were rushed to a hospital in Kathmandu.

Their postmortem was conducted at TU Teaching Hospital on Wednesday.

The tragedy occurred as the two-decade old resort does not have air conditioners, Labsher Bista, the mayor of Thaha Municipality in the district, said.

Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali has condoled the death and said he was deeply shocked to learn about the incident. He offered heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, government and people of India.

Meanwhile, Nepal’s Department of Tourism has formed a five-member committee to investigate whether there were any lapses in the safety of tourists by the resort administration. The committee is required to submit the report within 15 days.

An official said that out of the seven who survived, two stayed back to accompany the bodies while others left.

Nair and Ranjit, both IT professionals, were engineering college classmates and the tour was arranged after a get-together with old friends in Delhi, a family member said.

Nair, who hailed from Chempazhanthi in Thiruvananthapuram, was an engineer in Dubai, while his wife, Saranya, was staying in Kochi along with 3 children and was a nursing student.

Ranjit was working in an IT firm at Thiruvananthapuram, while his wife, Indu, was an accountant in a cooperative bank at Kozhikode, a family member said.

172,2020/01/23,Over 1.75 lakh people fed under ‘Numma Oonu’,"When the novel Numma Oonu, a free meal programme, was launched two years ago, it had the lofty ideal of turning the city hunger-free.

With just over two months left for the project to be wound up, figures suggest it had more or less lived up to its objective as over 1.75 lakh people have benefited from it.

The project, a collaborative initiative of the district administration, Petronet LNG Foundation, and the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA), is set to expire on March 31.

“We will definitely continue the project beyond March and have taken up the matter with stakeholders,” said District Collector S. Suhas. The extension of the project is also under the active consideration of Petronet LNG, which has been funding it under its corporate social responsibility initiative.

The project, a brainchild of then District Collector K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla, was introduced on Republic Day in 2018 with the larger goal that none in the city should go hungry no matter who they were. Under the programme, food coupons are issued from distribution centres against which select hotels registered with KHRA and located within the one- or two-kilometre radius of the centres serve free meals.

At present, there are distribution centres comprising Government offices and railway and bus stations at 20 locations across the district, while 39 hotels have signed up for the programme. “We now distribute around 500 food coupons daily out of which around 350 to 400 coupons have takers,” said T.N. Neelakantan, plant head, Petronet LNG.

The promoters are planning to further fine-tune the programme as and when the second phase is launched. The number of distribution centres for food coupons will remain the same at 20, but the locations will be judiciously selected based on demand.

Centres reporting low intake of coupons will be relocated, while the number of coupons may be increased in more responsive centres.

An impact study of the programme conducted by the School of Communication and Management Studies towards the end of last year pointed towards an overwhelming response.

Literally anyone irrespective of their financial backgrounds can get food coupons from the centres between 11.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. round the week except on Sundays. Student volunteers support the project by distributing and collecting coupons from distribution centres and hotels, besides providing feedback.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8fn1u/article30650103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23KI-NUMMAOONU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/over-175-lakh-people-fed-under-numma-oonu/article30629190.ece
173,2020/01/23,"Tales that delve into silver, silence, and trauma","“We consider the theatre a two-edged sword, which can be used to make ruling class realise the realities,” said Verônica Gentilin, the playwright of Silver Epidemic, a play by Companhia Mungunzá de Teatro, Brazil.

She was interacting with the audience at ITFoK (International Theatre Festival of Kerala) here on Wednesday at a Meet the Artist programme.

The crew of three plays Silver Epidemic, Told by the Wind, and Eidgah Ki Jinnat attended the programme.

Silver Epidemic, the play which tells about Crackland in Brazil, a notorious square in the centre of Sao Paulo, where drugs are sold and used openly. “When we staged the play at Brazil, many homeless people and drug addicts came to see the performance and said, “At least somebody sees our plight.” Directed by Georgette Fadel, the play in Portuguese was staged twice to a packed audience at the ITFoK.

“Silver Epidemic is a small theatrical tour. The boy responds - when asked why his body is painted silver to ask for alms - that silver gives more silver. He means that being silver, being metal, and all the readings resulting from it, is of more value and deserves more care than being flesh and blood,” says the director. The play has been staged more than 150 times at various counties.

“Told By the Wind is not a play but a co-created art work,” said Phillip Zarrilli, the director. It is a collaboration of work by Phillip Zarrilli (performer/co-creator); Kaite O’Reilly (dramaturg, co-creator) and Jo Shapland (performer/co-creator).

Told By the Wind is inspired by the notion of word – quiet, which creates an opportunity for the audience to imaginatively enter into what is happening on the stage. “Though no words are told by the actors, the light and wind let them communicate. They communicate with the audience through silence.”

Eidgah Ki Jinnath, by Abhishek Majumdar, tells about the turmoil in Kashmir and how the children have been affected by the violence. The number of patients coming for treatment at the mental health centres in Kashmir is the proof for the extent of mental trauma there, said Ashwith, who played the role of psychiatrist in the play. “It is my dream to perform the play in Kashmir,” said the director.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/idrqix/article30628581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/photostudio1579694199021,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tales-that-delve-into-silver-silence-and-trauma/article30628582.ece
174,2020/01/23,"Kin, friends struggle to take in shocking news","A day after the deaths of eight Keralites in Nepal, grieving relatives and friends gathered at Rohini Bhavan, the home of Praveen Krishnan Nair at Ayyankoyikal, Chenkottukonam, on Wednesday, awaiting further news from Kathmandu.

The shock of losing five members of a family all at once was tangible. Praveen’s aged parents Krishnan Nair and Prasanna Kumari and sister Praseeda, who reside at Chenkottukonam, had been given a hint of the tragedy only late Tuesday evening.

The bodies of Praveen, 39, his wife Saranya, 34, and their children Sreebhadra, 9, Aarcha, 8, and Abhinav, 7, will be flown to New Delhi from Kathmandu on Thursday morning. From there, they will be flown to the city on a 6.30 p.m. flight. “The flight is expected here by 10 p.m.,” Collector K. Gopalakrishnan said. Praveen’s friends, who had left for Kathmandu on Tuesday, reached the Nepal capital on Wednesday morning, Praveen’s brother-in-law Rajesh R. said.

Sending shock waves across the State on Tuesday, eight members of two families had died presumably due to asphyxiation caused by a heater gas leak in a hotel room in Daman, a tourist draw some 80 kilometres from the Nepal capital. Praveen’s friend Renjith Kumar, 39, his wife Indu, 34, and son Vaishnav, 2, also lost their lives in the tragedy.

To Kozhikode tomorrow

Renjith’s elder son Madhav survived as he was sharing another room with two families who were part of the group. The bodies of Renjith and his family will be transferred to Kozhikode in a Friday morning flight.

The tourist group from Kerala was made up of four families - the men being former classmates at the Sri Chitra Thirunal Engineering College, Pappanamcode.

Praveen had been employed as operations manager at Kalandoor Group of Companies, Dubai. Saranya had returned to Kochi a few years ago to complete her MPharm. “You were an extraordinary gift to us and your legacy will live on forever,” Praveen’s colleagues posted on the company website after the news broke.

Praveen’s father Krishnan Nair had been employed in the United Arab Emirates. On his retirement, Mr. Krishnan Nair had settled in Chenkottukonam. Praveen, who had completed his high school education in the UAE, had joined the SCT College of Engineering, Pappanamcode, for higher studies. Praveen had visited his parents in Chenkottukonam with his family in December 2019, family members said.

177,2020/01/23,"Malayalam filmmaker Prasobh Vijayan on his new movie ‘Anveshanam’, a medical thriller","Mollywood has delivered some hits in the genre of medical thrillers, such as Nirnayam and Apothecary. Director Prasobh Vijayan says, he has attempted to capture the “general anxiety and fear” one associates a hospital with, in Anveshanam as well. “One may encounter a sense of unease at a hospital. After all, isn’t it one place we would try to avoid if possible? The thought ‘what may happen next’ presents itself, irrespective of how rich or poor you are,” he says.

Prasobh describes his Jayasurya-starrer Anveshanam, set to hit the screens on January 31, as a family thriller set against a medical backdrop that serves as a stage for an “investigation of truth.”

Truth is stranger than fiction

“Imagine there’s an earth-shattering incident that happens in a family that otherwise seemingly leads a normal, happy life. What if someone wants to conceal the causes for unexplained reasons? Imagine we can’t ascertain who’s telling the truth and who’s lying and we find the characters’ version of events inconsistent. That’s when outsiders (other characters) start conjecturing and coming up with their own theories about the chain of events. This leads to a chain reaction of untruths and assumptions, creating further complications. Anveshanam moves forward depending on who tells the truth and who lies,” says Prasobh, not wanting to divulge more about the plot. Perhaps, it’s no surprise that the film takes the tagline ‘Truth is always bizarre.’

Jayasurya plays Aravind, a media professional, and Shruti Ramachandran dons the role of his partner. The couple have two kids. “One day, when Aravind is at work, he is informed of something unexpected that happens to his family and has to reach the hospital immediately. But what awaits him comes as a shock,” says Prasobh, adding that Anveshanam is a “performance-oriented” flick. As Aravind’s investigation into “what happened” starts, he is soon sucked into a miasma of questions that he fights to find the answers for.”

“Apart from the question of whodunit and whydunit, he has to find who are involved in it and why they are all in this. We realise it’s when we lie that often things spin out of hand. The characters can’t but solve the conundrum at hand before they leave the scene, ratcheting up the tension,” says Prasobh, a native of Pravachambalam on the outskirts of the city.

Anveshanam is Prasobh’s second directorial venture, after the 2018 revenge thriller Lilli that had Samyuktha Menon playing the titular character as a pregnant mother.

Others in the cast include baby Jess, master Ashutosh, Vijay Babu, Lena, Lal, Nandu, Leona Lishoy, Shaju Sreedhar among others. The film is scripted by Shruti’s husband, Francis Thomas, who makes his debut as a scenarist. About the movie’s development, Prasobh says: “The script is actually a birthday gift Francis gave Shruti (who had worked with Jayasurya in Pretham previously). When the screenplay reached me, I found it interesting.”

Prasobh says “95%” of the movie was shot in Palakkad where a private hospital served as the central setting, while other portions were filmed in Kochi. Sujith Vaassudev cranked the camera, while editing was by Appu Bhattathiri. The filmmaker says he’s endeavoured to make the narrative “crisp” and has steered clear of songs, apart from the title track, ‘Ilam poove’, crooned by Sooraj Santhosh. Joe Paul’s lyrics were set to tune by Jakes Bejoy, who also composed the film’s background score.

Claustrophobic feel

Prasobh says the challenges he faced while shooting Anveshanam were quite similar to those of Lilli owing to the “limited locations” in both the films. “Almost the entirety of Anveshanam unravels in a hospital and I have tried to capture a claustrophobic mood throughout. I wanted the characters to know that ‘you are in this and you are not going to get out... without telling the truth’.”

The filmmaker says he likes movies set against a medical background and cites Hollywood films Awake and Fractured as on top of his list, while calling Nirnayam as perhaps “the benchmark” in Malayalam. His other favourites are Joseph, Virus and Ayalum Njanum Thammil and popular American medical drama series House.

For now, the investigation begins...",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/btixxf/article30632838.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvmAnweshanamstill1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/malayalam-filmmaker-prasobh-vijayan-on-his-new-movie-anveshanam-a-medical-thriller/article30632842.ece
178,2020/01/23,Kabir Khan: ‘Netaji Subhash Bose would have come out and done something for India if he was alive’,"On Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s 123rd birth anniversary on Thursday, filmmaker Kabir Khan opened up on the hero who, he feels, has been ‘forgotten’ despite playing a major role in India’s struggle for Independence.

Khan’s new web series The Forgotten Army: Azaadi Ke Liye narrates the story of Bose’s Azad Hind Fauj or Indian National Army (INA).

“INA is a big subject and, if you talk about Netaji, it is an even bigger subject. Our story is focused on the events that happened between 1942 and 1945, and what happened with the army that was formed. It is the story of Azad Hind Fauj through the eyes of the soldiers,” said Khan.

“There are accounts looking at Azad Hind Fauj and the entire movement through the eyes of Netaji, but I think this is the first time we will see it through the eyes of the soldiers. Who were these 55,000 men and women who went into battle, what is their story and motivation? This is what forms the canvas of the series,” the filmmaker added.

Khan also explained why, despite immense contribution to India’s freedom struggle, Netaji’s INA remains a forgotten chapter in our history.

“All these stories are never told in India. The British had put a censorship on anything to do with Azad Hind Fauj because they knew what Netaji was planning to do. Netaji knew that 55,000 people are not enough to take on the entire British empire. His plan was to try and garner support as his army moved towards mainland India. He hoped to fire the imagination of people so that there might be a revolution. Unfortunately that never happened. But the British blacklisted INA and that’s a reason why it’s called the Forgotten Army,” the filmmaker explained.

Mystery lingers on over how Bose might have died. There have been speculations that he spent his last days in disguise, as Gumnami Baba. A lot of debate and discussions have happened over the years whether Netaji and Gumnami Baba were the same person.

Khan is sceptical on this count: “I feel there is not enough evidence to really believe this. What happens is that in situations of history where there is less information — which is the case of Azad Hind Fauj — mythology comes into play. I’m not a great expert on Netaji. I’m just a normal person who has read books on him. But I feel a person like him would never remain gumnam. A person like him would always come out and do something for the country if he was alive and around.”

The filmmaker, who made a documentary titled The Forgotten Army in 1999, is sad that today’s youth hardly know about INA or its contributions.

“This is a story the youth needs to know. Today’s youth hardly know about INA. They know Netaji but they don’t what he did, and as far as Azad Hind Fauj goes, they have no idea about it,” he expressed.

The Forgotten Army: Azaadi Ke Liye stars Sunny Kaushal, TJ Bhanu, Rohit Chaudhary and debutant actress Sharvari in key roles. The web series will stream on Amazon Prime January 24 onwards.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/t19wiu/article30634179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Forgotten-Army-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kabir-khan-netaji-subhash-bose-would-have-come-out-and-done-something-for-india-if-he-was-alive/article30634180.ece
179,2020/01/23,'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo' and 'Sarileru Neekevvaru': Big-budget planning masterclass,"For fans, a festival is when their favourite hero’s film is released. With footfall to theatres receding fast, producers bankrolling big-budget projects scour calendars to schedule the release of their films during festivals, that ensure at least four holidays including a weekend. It’s no longer about how many weeks a film runs. It’s about how much a film can collect in a few days banking on the fanatical following. In fact, the most common excuse these days with families who’re not die-hard fans is, ""Wait for a couple of weeks and we can watch it at home.""

Producers of prospective blockbusters are in a precarious, perilous state these days because if the film flops only they lose unless they’ve sold the film outright. So planning is crucial. Two favourite times of the year in the South are Pongal/ Sankranthi and Deepavali. When the release of a Rajinikanth-starrer is announced, producers in all the South Indian industries are wary. Such is the box-office power the man still exudes.

This January apparently it was decided that ‘Ala Vaikuntapuramlo’ starring Allu Arjun and ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’ boasting Mahesh Babu would release on the same day as ‘Darbar’ and may the best man win, because with stars... it’s always about them. Rajini’s film was released two days prior to the other two, meaning more shows in more halls.

Trivikram Srinivas whose ‘Ala Vaikuntapuramlo’ was released a couple of days later, is known to deliver when he works with superstars since he doesn’t seem to be overawed by their presence and knows what will excite their fans. He’s had a chequered career, but stars have enough faith in him and he’s bounced back after disasters. He selects interesting titles too. Trivikram goes back to cradle swapping for his latest with Allu Arjun. The film stutters in the first half but settles down to serious business in the second with the hero realising he’s in the wrong place. Heroes in Telugu films living in a stranger’s house and repairing troubled situations and broken hearts while vanquishing villains is a proven formula in itself. That’s what happens here too. The difference is that the heroine lives elsewhere. It’s an Allu Arjun film, so the heroine has little to do. When Trivikram is stuck with the proceedings he makes Allu Arjun dance to various hit songs in a boardroom. Of course, there are his uncle Chiranjeevi’s numbers and the proud nephew doesn’t forget to mention Chiru is a dancer non pariel. Allu Arjun carries the film on his shoulders with his effortless dancing, dialogue delivery and attitude which more than compensates his average physical presence.

Mahesh Babu, I think, changed the Telugu hero’s attire from flashy costumes to casual, comfortable wear with sober colours. The title ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’ has a double meaning. It’s supposed to be about the armed forces but for fans it describes their hero perfectly. Telugu directors have an uncanny ability to tick all the boxes that’ll satiate fans, have families sniffling into their kerchiefs and the icing is that the director whips up the right amounts of nationalistic fervor. Again we have the hero going to stay with a friend’s family and helping them with all their problems which includes beating the scum of the earth to pulp, even one hundred at a time. Only in our films does the hero react in slow motion when summoned to look into a dire situation like diffusing a bomb! Also, the heroine falls all over the leading man begging him to marry her while continuously praising his physique, especially fair skin.

The main advantage of nepotism in the film industry, is that star sons earn while they learn. While Allu Arjun has groomed himself appearance-wise, and honed his acting skills, Mahesh Babu is no longer stiff. He’s let his guard down, loosened his limbs and there is modulation in his dialogue delivery. I rate this his best performance especially in a film that’s good only in patches. Prakash Raj is menacing, but his transformation is unconvincing and ends up looking clownish. Pray, where is the gifted Brahmanandam?

Star sons still invoke their father’s names in films in an effort to evoke applause from their fans. If Allu Arjun refers to his uncle Chiranjeevi’s dancing skills, director Anil goes a step further and likens Mahesh Babu’s character to his father Krishna’s in ‘Alluri Seetharama Raju’,which is a 36-year-old film! Anyway, fans are fighting a bitter battle on various platforms about which film is better and has collected more, which is more entertaining and interesting.

180,2020/01/23,"There’s a Jaya in every household, says filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari on ‘Panga’","“Being a mother of two, I’ve always been asked this question: ‘Who takes care of the household?’. They send you on a guilt trip, as if the onus is on you,” shrugs Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari. This could perhaps be the reason why she decided to make Panga, wherein Jaya (Kangana Ranaut), a former Kabaddi player who sacrifices her dreams for her family and makes a comeback at 32, is bombarded with similar questions. Panga, perhaps, is Ashwiny’s most personal movie yet. Excerpts from an interview:

Panga’s framework appears to be both slice-of-life and sports drama...

It’s a story that is relevant today. In any household, it’s the mother/wife who takes care of the family. Most women give up their career to take up a permanent job: motherhood. These are rules laid by patriarchal society. There seems to be a perception that women can’t perform physically post pregnancy. However, Serena Williams and Sania Mirza returned to sports and emerged victorious. That’s what we are discussing in Panga.

Does the ‘rise of the underdog’ template pose a threat for you?

Not at all. Our stories change according to the mood of the nation. There’s an underdog story in every movie. In today’s scenario, middle class is the new India. That’s why most of us are going back to our roots. That’s why mainstream filmmakers are telling stories from the heartland of India.

Was there a particular reason why you chose kabaddi?

It came from the studio. Also, it’s because kabaddi is taken less seriously in India, and football seems to be the new craze among millennials. However, kabaddi is gaining prominence because of Pro-Kabaddi League. It’s not an individualistic game — it’s as if the entire team is rooting for that one person to win. What I realised when writing Panga, was that kabaddi follows the same mechanism as a jungle, where the lioness goes for hunting.

That is an interesting take. Was this the brief you gave Kangana Ranaut?

No, it keeps evolving. When you brief talented actors like Kangana, you have to get into the protagonist’s head. And then comes the premise. At the same time, I shouldn’t be feeding too much of information as well. I need to ensure that we’re on the same page, in terms of thought process.

Your movies are strongly rooted in language and culture. In fact, there is a heart-warming scene involving Neena Gupta in Panga’s trailer. How do you bring in these nuances into your characters?

Most often, our movies try to ape the West. Take any movie coming from China or Japan [Shoplifters], it is rooted in their culture. They don’t shy away from talking about their ethos and issues. Our country doesn’t live in the metros. We have shot in five cities for Panga. I make it a point to imbibe every little detail from each city.

Jasdeep Singh Gill is an interesting choice of cast...

Yes. He is a familiar name in Punjab and I wanted him for this movie. In a way, I like to challenge myself. In the sense that, Nil Battey Sannata had Pankaj Tripathi playing a light-hearted role. Which was again the case with Bareilly Ki Barfi. I like to bring in actors who are less talked about. Later, if they do well in movies, it gives a satisfying feeling as if I achieved something.

What were some of the stereotypes you faced as a director?

People always had doubts about my craft, despite having worked in the advertisement industry for 16 years and having directed over 300 commercials. It has always been the question of whether I would be able to pull off such a feat. This, I think, arises because I am a woman.

181,2020/01/23,Brie Larson’s ‘Captain Marvel 2’ in the works,"A follow-up to Captain Marvel, featuring Oscar winner Brie Larson in the title role, is finally taking shape at Disney.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio is in final negotiations with Megan McDonnell, a staff-writer on its Disney Plus series WandaVision on the project.

Sources said Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who co-wrote and directed the 2019 hit, will not return to helm the sequel. However, they are in talks to remain in the Marvel Universe and direct a possible Disney Plus series.

Marvel is hoping to find a female filmmaker for Captain Marvel 2 and is eyeing a potential 2022 release.

Plot details are under wraps but the new story will move the setting from the 1990s of the original film to the present day.

Captain Marvel, which was Marvel’s first female-centric movie, followed Larson as US Airforce pilot Carol Danvers, who becomes one of the universe’s most powerful heroes.

Also starring Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn and Gemma Chan, the film grossed USD 1.13 billion worldwide.

182,2020/01/23,"Watch | Kangana Ranaut slams Indira Jaising, says she should be kept in jail with Nirbhaya’s murderers","Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, who is busy shooting for the Jayalalithaa biopic Thalaivi, is currently promoting her film Panga, that is releasing tomorrow.

At a recent press conference to promote the movie, the actor was asked about the ongoing Nirbhaya case and what she feels about the incident.

Kangana immediately responded that the convicts need to be hanged publicly. “Someone who is capable of committing such a heinous crime shouldn’t be considered a minor, he needs to be hanged publicly as an example. Nirbhaya’s parents have been fighting this battle for a long time. If the criminal is killed quietly, it’s of no use.”

Lawyer Indira Jaising had earlier stated that Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi should forgive Nirbhaya’s murderers like Sonia Gandhi forgave her husband’s killer. Posting on Twitter, she wrote, “While I fully identify with the pain of Asha Devi, I urge her to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn’t not want the death penalty for her. We are with you but against the death penalty.”

Reacting to the statement, Kangana replied, “That woman should also be locked in a jail with them for four days. How can women actually pity these murderers? These women who feel sympathy and love for such monsters, are the ones who give birth to them!”

This Akira Kurosawa classic deals with the idea of perception. Stories are never fully told; they are born with each re-telling, because every one tells them differently. Four people who witnessed the same incident give four versions of the crime before a court.

184,2020/01/23,"‘The Kung Fu Master’ is a musical action drama set in the Himalayas, says Abrid Shine","After 16 years as a photographer, Abrid Shine made his foray into movies as a filmmaker with 1983 (2014). He won the Kerala State Film award for the best debut director for the movie, which narrated the story of a cricket fan’s love for the game even when he himself could not make it big as a cricketer. Action Hero Biju (2016) and Poomaram (2018) followed. He is now ready with The Kung Fu Master, a martial arts drama that releases today. If Abrid’s earlier movies were inspired by real life, The Kung Fu Master has been inspired by the movies he has watched over the years. Edited excerpts from an interview:

How did The Kung Fu Master happen?

We were planning to add Taekwondo fight scenes in Action Hero Biju but it did not materialise. When I heard about Wing Chun, a Chinese Kung Fu martial art style that values speed, I was fascinated. Wing Chun was conceptualised by a woman called Ng Mui and it was practised by legends such as Bruce Lee. Neeta Pillai (who played the female lead in Poomaram) was enthused about training in Wing Chun. She started off by practising Wushu, a rhythmic martial art form.

Abrid Shine | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

What is The Kung Fu Master about?

It is a musical action drama set in the Himalayas. Neeta and Jiji Scaria play siblings Ritu and Rishi respectively. Jiji is a qualified Wing Chun practitioner. They are pitted against a criminal gang, also trained in martial arts.

Conventional action movies in Malayalam are essentially about the tussle between the hero and the villain. How different is The Kung Fu Master?

(Laughs) It is on the same lines, except in this film, the female and the male lead take on the villain together. The Kung Fu Master is a mix of action sequences, sound effects and music, which should make it an interesting theatrical experience. Besides Wing Chun, there are other martial art forms such as karate, kalaripayattu and taekwondo.

Malayalis are generally particular about a credible storyline...

Even while working on my earlier films, I was warned that the movies did not follow conventional narrative patterns. Nevertheless, it was well received by viewers. As a filmmaker, my attempt has always been to offer something new for the audience.

The Kung Fu Master has an interesting storyline. However, I have intentionally given a gist of the story in the title.

When the trend is in favour of realistic tales, what made you come up with an action drama?

Although I have never deliberately set out to make realistic movies, my previous movies were in that genre. The Kung Fu Master had to be treated differently. It had to be a pure martial arts film.

What was the shooting of the film like?

The process was difficult yet interesting. The fight sequences had to look convincing, especially when the heroine was up against trained men. The action choreography went on for almost 10 months. Shooting the stunts in the snow-filled terrain was not easy. Our idea was to present a film with a different visual experience, good music and a story that connected emotionally.

Are viewers willing to accept movies without big stars if the content is interesting?

I feel such films have always been there in Malayalam, right from Manjil Virinja Pookkal in the 1980s to Angamaly Diaries in recent times.

As a filmmaker, you seem to mix offbeat themes with commercial elements. Is that your concept of filmmaking?

I don’t have a definite explanation for this. The climax of 1983 and Poomaram were almost poetic, unlike formulaic endings. I would say several influences, including my stint as a photographer, have shaped my thoughts.

Both 1983 and Poomaram didn’t celebrate heroism...

I actually love heroism. One of my all-time favourite movies is Sphadikam, which is all about the ‘hero’. Though 1983 was inspired by my fascination for cricket, the agony the lead character goes through because of his not reaching anywhere in life despite his skills as a cricketer, was created to make the storyline more hard-hitting.

As a filmmaker, you are known to be a stickler for perfection.

I aim to give my best in each of my films. I am aware that those who come to watch my movies have seen more movies than I have. That thought always make me try to better myself.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dh4mro/article30622701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvfKungFu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/abrid-shine-on-his-upcoming-release-kung-fu-master-and-his-craft/article30622703.ece
185,2020/01/23,Kannada director Naveen Reddy B's long wait pays off with 'Khaki' release,"After 16 long years of working in the Kannada film industry as an assistant and an associate director, Naveen Reddy B emerges from the shadows as an independent film director. His début directorial venture titled Khaki releases on January 24 across the State in 200 theatres.

The film is making news even before its release, thanks to the production house, cast and crew. The film is produced by Tharun Shivappa, and has Chiranjeevi Sarja with Tanya Hope in the lead.

Naveen says Sarja plays a cable operator in the film and not a cop. Then why is the film called Khaki? “The story, written by Vidhyadhar, talks about how a group comes together to act like a parallel police force to sort out issues that are normally ignored including garbage disposal and land mafia. The many issues we face today, are presented in a typical commercial manner.

“The film, is about land, which has good value, but is converted into a dump yard. The land value goes down and the Mafia buys it for a song to build commercial buildings.”

Though the film will not have subtitles, talks are on to release the film dubbed into Tamil later. “As of now the Malayalam version is ready and will release two weeks after the Kannada release.”

About the lead pair, Naveen says, he was sure that Sarja would be in the lead the moment he was asked to direct the film. “But when it came to Tanya, we thought a bit as the role is that of a middle class girl, which is quite the opposite direction of where Tanya comes from. We are happy with the result however, as this is a new look for Tanya; she has not been seen like this in any of her earlier films,” Naveen says with a smile.

Why did it take him 16 long years to don the director’s hat? “Sadly, this should have happened in 2008. It is not that I did not get offers, but I became choosy. Either I did not like a story, or the production team backed out and then I had people approach me with money and demand that they be the hero of the film. That was the most trying time for me. I almost wanted to quit the industry, but what kept me going was the other offers I got to work as an associate director. I told myself, I had to wait for the right time.”

His experience in the industry has been a boon. “I came here when I was 17, now I am 34. And when I sat in the director’s chair, I discovered that nothing hampered my peace on the set as I had been there and handled that.”

Naveen, who hails from Andhra, says that he is the only one from his family to venture into films. “My father and brother are in the defence, I studied in the Army School here and grew up watching Kannada films. Though my family was keen I too take up a career in the Army. When I watched Upendra’s Om I knew this was the path I would tread.”

Life for Naveen also seems to have a full circle, as in it was Upendra who launched the teaser of Naveen’s Khaki. Naveen has words of praise for Bala, the cinematographer of his film. “He has worked with Rajamouli in almost all his films. We have been close friends for years and Bala offered to be the cinematographer for my film without even talking about the payment. He has been the backbone of the film and my journey while making Khaki.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vmt0pt/article30631839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23bgmkhakhi2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nkannada-director-naveen-reddy-bs-long-wait-pays-off-with-khaki-release/article30631845.ece

187,2020/01/23,"Day after bull’s death, three arrested for holding illegal race","The police have arrested three persons for organising a bull race at Kothakottai village where a bull died after it fell into a farm well. The bull ran amok during the race and fell into a 60-ft. deep farm well, the police sources said.

Police took into custody R. Palani, M. Sankar and M. Boopalan, who reportedly organised the bull race. Efforts are on to trace C. Annasami and S. Chinnathambi (both organisers) and owner of the bull R. Raman. The bull race was reportedly held without adhering to the conditions laid down by the district administration. The police concluded that because of the negligence on the part of the owner and organisers, a bull died and several vehicles were damaged during the race.

Vaniyambadi taluk police registered a case under sections of 289 (Negligent conduct with respect to animal), 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle), 337 (Causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 188 ( Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 (not providing safety of animals) and 11 (amounting to cruelty of animals) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) (Tamil Nadu Amendment ) Act , 2017 against organisers and the owner of the bull for not taking adequate precautionary measures during the time of race, which not only caused the death of the bull and causing damage to the public property.

Meanwhile, on hearing about the police action against the organisers, villagers staged demonstration on Alangayam-Vaniyambadi Road for sometime on Thursday. They threw stones on the road and squatted on the road seeking withdrawal of cases filed against the organisers. Additional police forces were rushed to the spot. The police pacified the protesters and asked them to disperse.

190,2020/01/23,Applicants for the post of assistant professors confused over TRB’s request for more details,"Candidates who have applied for the posts of assistant professors in government arts, science and education colleges are confused by the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) asking for additional, irrelevant details.

A number of applicants have complained that details not applicable to them have to be filled up as mandatory information in the online application form on TRB’s website.

The notification for filling more than 2,000 assistant professor posts was issued first in August 2019 and a revised one was issued subsequently in the first week of October 2019. The last date for application and uploading of all the certificates was on November 15, 2019.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the TRB said that those who have applied for arts and science colleges (and not education colleges) must upload additional details like conduct certificates and the serial numbers on all their certificates by Tuesday.

However, the candidates have complained that the form demands details on completion of Bachelor of Education (B. Ed) and Master of Education (M. Ed) courses, which are not applicable to those who applied for arts and science colleges.

“When we created our online account for submitting applications itself, the first question asked was whether we are applying for arts and science colleges or education colleges. Based on that, we were taken to different forms for submission of details. In that case, why are they asking B. Ed and M. Ed details now,” asked one of the candidates.

Another candidate said that the two fields were mandatory and the options available did not even include ‘Not Applicable.’ “There are only two options on whether we completed the course during the end of calendar year or academic year,” she said.

A candidate from Erode, who is working as a guest lecturer, questioned the logic of asking these details at this juncture. “They already have copies of our certificates on which the serial numbers are available. Moreover, conduct certificates are usually not considered as important and we are expected to carry it only during interviews,” he said.

Stating that they could have asked these details earlier, he expressed concern over whether the move was a tactic to postpone the recruitment process.

Denying the allegation that there was an attempt to delay the process, a senior official from the TRB said that the issue of candidates being asked about B.Ed and M. Ed qualifications will be immediately looked into. “If there is a problem, we will correct it immediately,” the official said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/oh1ri8/article30632351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHNETTRB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/applicants-for-the-post-of-assistant-professors-confused-over-trbs-request-for-more-details/article30632352.ece
191,2020/01/23,770 Olive Ridley turtle eggs collected along Cuddalore coast,"The season’s first sighting of Olive Ridley turtles nesting has begun on a positive note with conservationists in association with the Forest department recording nesting sites of the endangered turtles at various hamlets on the Cuddalore coastline.

Volunteers from Puducherry-based Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF) with the assistance of the Forest department have collected around 770 eggs from nesting sites in Devanampattinam, Thazhanguda, Gori and Sonankuppam over the last three days.

Led by Cuddalore Forest Ranger Abdul Hamid, a team of forest guards and sea turtle watchers from IBF found the first nest during a ‘turtle walk’ at Sonankuppam in the early hours of Tuesday. The team collected 246 eggs from the nest and shifted them to a temporary hatchery at Devanampattinam.

Classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Olive Ridley turtles visit the coast from January to March for laying eggs.

“The conservation programme was started a few years ago to protect and release the turtles into the sea after the breeding season. The team collected 4,500 eggs from 30 nests across the coastline last year,” said K. Raman, founder of IBF.

The team – K. Raman, V. Chella, founder of Cuddalore Help Today and three of their colleagues have been on the job for the past few years. They go for a stroll looking for the distinct ‘turtle track’ left behind by the reptiles while making their way towards the shore.

The Forest watchers and volunteers also reach out to the fishing community in Sonankuppam, Devanamapttinam, Gori and Thazhanguda to create awareness among people about collecting and protecting the turtle eggs till they are hatched. Over the years, several volunteers from the fishing community have joined the drive to collect the eggs and protect them.

According to a Forest department official, the turtles listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 visited the shore from 2.00 a.m. and 5.00 a.m. during the nesting season. Predation of nests by feral dogs and people and incidental killing after, while being entangled in fishing nets or being hit by the propeller of a fishing boat, are the main reasons for death in recent years.

The Forest department has been trying to sensitise fishermen to extend their cooperation for conservation of the endangered species, the official said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/u8mnxp/article30632170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHNETOLIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/770-olive-ridley-turtle-eggs-collected-along-cuddalore-coast/article30632171.ece

Canara Bank has sponsored the cost of installation of one-fourth of total garbage bins proposed to be installed. It procured 25 garbage bins, with a capacity to hold one tonne each, at a cost of ₹ 9 lakhs and handed them over to the civic body recently.

The corporation has mobilised over 50 plastic water tanks for installing them at important locations to provide protected drinking water to visitors. Teams consisting of officials and social activists have been formed to create awareness of the need to maintain cleanliness in the town. As part of the initiative, pamphlets were distributed to devotees and to those found near the temple requesting them not to litter public places with garbage.

It has been proposed to set up temporary health posts at various spots in the town to monitor and provide immediate medical assistance to those in need.

It suffered severe injuries after hitting the stone stairs and died instantly. The Fire and Rescue Services personnel from Ambur and the Ambur Taluk police personnel fished out the carcass of the animal as the crowd watched the operation.

Villagers said that this was not the first time a bull died in this manner. Despite many such tragedies in the past, they alleged that the district administration had not taken any precautionary measure for conducting this annual event.

They said that last year a bull ‘Vayuputhran’ owned by former MLA Kovi Sampath, fell into a ground-level open well, as it was unable to slow down after the run. However, the Fire and Rescue Services personnel aided by the locals struggled for an hour and pulled the bull out of the well. Once rescued, it was taken to the former MLA’s native village for treatment. However, the animal failed to respond to the treatment and died. It may be recalled that last year, a bull named ‘Villain’ which collided head on with another bull in a bull run at Munjurpattu village near Vellore succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital.

197,2020/01/23,Vellore Museum emerges a major attraction for residents,"A rich collection of artefacts, placement of objects, the descriptions with each of the objects and other particulars in the room, including natural flow of light and interiors, contribute to the rise in footfall at the Government Museum, located inside the Vellore Fort.

According to estimates, over 1.21 lakh visitors have visited the museum in 2019 and 50% of them are children. The administrators, including Curator K. Saravanan, have arranged the artefacts in a presentable manner for the visitors.

The Vellore museum was launched in 1985 near the Old Bus stand and was shifted to the present location in 1999.

The museum is exclusively dedicated for showcasing objects related to ancient art, archaeology, weapons, sculptures, bronzes, wood carvings, handicrafts, numismatics, philately, botany, geology and zoology.

The facility consists of eight galleries in which over 3,000 exhibits are on display. The number of visitors has increased in the last two years due to rising interest among students in history and archaeology of the country, said officials from the Department of Museums.

A fiberglass model of 16-ft lifesize Trynnosaurus displayed at the entrance is the cynosure of all eyes. Two 18th century cannons unearthed from Vellore Fort are also kept at the entrance. The Museum has a sculpture garden in which stone sculptures, hero stones, inscriptions from different places and gunpowder flasks, cannon balls are on show.

Mr. Saravanan said that plans are afoot to promote information on heritage and monuments. Attractive signboards, descriptive labels are to be added to the facility. Efforts are on to organise lectures by renowned professors and scholars on history of India, archaeology and heritage, Mr. Saravanan said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vellore-museum-emerges-a-major-attraction-for-residents/article30629342.ece
198,2020/01/23,Tamil Nadu Special Sub-Inspector Wilson murder case handed to NIA,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take over the probe into the shooting of Special Sub-Inspector Wilson in Kanniyakumari district on January 8, official sources confirmed on Wednesday.

Abdul Shameem and Thoufiq from Thiruvithamcode, suspected to be part of a terror module, were arrested, along with a few others, on the basis of CCTV camera footage, and accused of shooting SSI Wilson at the Padanthaalumoodu checkpost, where he was carrying out routine vehicle checks. The duo was arrested in Udupi, Karnataka.

As part of investigations, the police also arrested three persons in Bengaluru for handing over SIM cards to Abdul and Thoufiq.

In connection with the shooting, two separate cases were booked — one for murder and another for supply of SIM cards to assailants.

The men had reportedly produced fake addresses and identity papers to procure the SIM cards.

The police arrested the buyer, seller and a person who developed software for the two accused.

It is speculated that 200 SIM cards were sold using fake papers.

Both cases were booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

“As per provisions of the NIA Act, we have to notify the agency. On notifying them, one of the cases — relating to SIM cards — has been taken up by NIA. The other case is also likely to be taken up soon since it has interstate and international ramifications,” a source said.

Meanwhile, a team of the Q Branch police arrested three men suspected of having links with the SSI Wilson murder case, when they were holding a secret meeting in Devipatnam.

The police identified the accused as Mohammed Ghani, 45, of Kilakarai; Mohammed Ali alias Manikandan, 28, of Kondoor in Cuddalore district; and Amir alias Arunkumar, 31, of Manmedu in Villupuram district.

Based on a tip-off, the police rounded them up and investigations revealed that they were accomplices of Sheik Dawood and Mohammed Riyaz of Devipatnam, who have already been booked by the NIA.

The police said that Sheik Dawood, who was supposed to reach the spot, escaped. Investigations also revealed that the men were involved in financial transactions with Abdul Sameem, a prime suspect in the SSI’s murder.

The police recovered a cell phone from them and found incriminating video and audio clips. “We have secured evidence pointing to their possible links with terror outfits such as IS. They have been involved in recruiting youngsters for terror outfits and terror funding,” said Superintendent of Police V. Varunkumar.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9t1mhz/article30629106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THWILSON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-special-sub-inspector-wilson-murder-case-handed-to-nia/article30629107.ece
199,2020/01/23,Tirumurai to be recited at Big Temple consecration,"Apart from Sanskrit invocations, Tirumurai, a Tamil compendium of hymns in praise of Lord Shiva, will be recited on the day of consecration (kumbabishekam) of the Brihadeeswarar temple in Thanjavur on February 5.

“This is as per the temple’s custom and usage. It happened in June 1997 as well. This year too, the recital will be done both at the yagasalai and during the mahabhishekam on the day of consecration,” said a senior official of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department.

On Tuesday, the State government, in response to a petition, told the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that recital of Tamil mantras alone was not possible. There had been demands in certain quarters that the Big Temple’s consecration be performed in Tamil. Last week, DMK president M.K. Stalin called for performing the event in accordance with Tamil customs and traditions.

Meanwhile, the government had formed a 21-member committee of senior officials to oversee and monitor arrangements for the consecration and ensure that the event was conducted “peacefully and successfully”.

Headed by Chief Secretary (K. Shanmugam), the panel includes 12 secretaries of various departments such as Finance, Home, Revenue, Municipal Administration and Water Supply apart from the Director-General of Police, the Director of Fire and Rescue Services, the General Manager of the Southern Railway and the Superintending Archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

In the last 40 years, this will be the third time that the temple is having the consecration. On April 3, 1980, the event took place after 177 years. In 1997, it was originally planned for June 8 but was held the next day (June 9) as a fire broke out at the yagasalai on the evening of June 7, leading to stampede and the death of 40 persons.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pf9tci/article30629084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THBIGTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tirumurai-to-be-recited-at-big-temple-consecration/article30629085.ece
200,2020/01/23,T.N. govt. should stay NPR exercise: Owaisi,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen president and Lok Sabha member Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday appealed to the Tamil Nadu government to stay the National Population Register (NPR) exercise.

Addressing a massive protest against NPR, Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) here, he said the NPR and NRC were two sides of the same coin. NPR would lead to NRC.

He described CAA as unconstitutional because it was the first time that a piece of legislation was brought in on the basis of religion.

He said the CAA was also anti-Dravidian. “Where is the Dravidian pride of AIADMK as the CAA has not included Sri Lankan Tamils.” If the AIADMK sided with the BJP on the issue, the people would reject the party, he warned.

“We are protesting against the NPR as it seeks details such as the birth place of parents, their date of birth, Aadhaar and passport. The National Family Health survey conducted in 2015 has revealed that 28% of the people do not have birth certificates in the country. Among them, 40% are Muslims and 44% are Adivasis,” he said.

The citizenship of anyone would be taken away if they were not able to produce any of the documents sought during NPR survey.

“Similarly, even if someone objects to your details in NPR, even without any proof, then you will have to prove your citizenship at the Foreigner’s Tribunal.”

He expressed apprehension that using this provision of objection, Muslims would be targeted. Most of the people in the audience put their hands up when Mr. Owaisi asked those without a birth certificate to raise their hands. “In all probability, you will be put in detention centres,” he said.

Stating that Muslims of India chose to remain in the country during Partition, he asked why the patriotism of the community was always suspect.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, instead of being bothered about the minorities of Pakistan and Bangladesh, should be concerned about the minorities of India.

He charged the Prime Minister with being unconcerned about the alarming rate of suicide among the unemployed youth and the downfall of Indian economy.

In Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States, Muslims who were protesting against CAA, were targeted. In Uttar Pradesh, 25 Muslims were shot dead.

Appealing to the people of India to stand up against the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said if they failed to protest against it, they could face the fate of lakhs of Jews who were killed in Hitler’s Germany in 1938 following a similar Citizenship Act.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5q2isj/article30628953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA23-OWAISI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-govt-should-stay-npr-exercise-owaisi/article30628954.ece

“If there is any action plan prepared by the government in this regard, what is the stage of its implementation? Submit factual and action taken report to ascertain the success in preventing pollution of the river Tamirabarani and make it pollution-free and potable source of drinking water for the general public,” the Bench said.

203,2020/01/23,"How much money is required for proper upkeep of Mamallapuram, asks HC","The Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know from the State government as well as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) the amount of funds that would be required for the proper upkeep and maintenance of Mamallapuram and its surroundings.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar directed the Municipal Administration Secretary, Finance Secretary, Tourism Secretary and the Director General of ASI to convene a meeting within three weeks to fix the quantum of money required for better maintenance and submit a report in the court by February 25.

The judges said that they would, thereafter, issue appropriate directions for release of funds from various sources.

The interim order was passed on a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up on the basis of a letter written by Justice N. Kirubakaran to Justice Kothari who was the Acting Chief Justice last year. Then, the Bench had also directed ASI to state whether it would be able to share a part of the revenue earned by it through sale of entry tickets, with the Mamallapuram Town Panchayat for improving civic amenities.

In reply, Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan filed a memo on behalf of the ASI on Wednesday.

The memo stated that ASI had collected ₹5.98 crore in 2016-17, ₹6.65 crore in 2017-18, ₹8.14 crore in 2018-19 and ₹ 6.87 crore till December 2019 through entry fee to the archaeological site from domestic as well as foreign visitors.

204,2020/01/23,Deadlock over rates hits distribution of voter ID cards,"CHENNAI The distribution of Elector’s Photo Identity Card (EPIC) for new electors and those who have applied for making corrections/modifications across Tamil Nadu has been hit.

The demand of Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV (TACTV) Corporation Ltd. and the State government for higher rates is yet to be accepted by the Election Commission and therefore distribution of voter identity cards had been pending, officials said.

EPIC is distributed through e-Seva centres manned by TACTV operating from State government premises. The EC pays an amount per card to the TACTV for its service and the State government for providing physical infrastructure.

Since the EC is yet to accept the new proposal, hundreds of applicants visiting e-seva centres across the State are being turned away every day. According to informed sources, EPIC has not been issued to applicants since last March although at least 35 to 40 applicants visit e-seva Centres in Chennai every day on an average.

Left in the lurch

Bhagavathi Sampath, a college student planning for his higher education in other States, is still waiting for his new EPIC. “Many Central universities want EPIC as one of the documents, despite an aadhaar. Unless EPIC is distributed immediately, it will be a challenge for students applying for educational institutions in other States,” he said.

Shameel Ahmed from Ambur applied for EPIC several months ago but is yet to get his card. “The verification process too was completed long ago but I have not received my card yet,” he said. His friend Zambruth Nawab Hussain too applied earlier this month and is yet to get the card. Fabiola Jacob from Chennai said her EPIC had a man’s picture, though the card mentioned “female” in the details. She said: “It is embarrassing whenever I go to cast my vote. I had applied thrice for correction, twice through the EPIC camp and once online too. But no response.”

The Hindu too visited the e-seva Centre on Dr. Ambedkar Salai in Kodambakkam on Wednesday and was told by Assistant Tahsildar (Elections) that EPIC had not been issued for many months now. She refused to give the necessary Form 001 (also called 1C form) saying: “When we are not giving cards, why should I unnecessarily give the form and sign?”

A senior official in the Public (Elections) Department said that the glitch was due to an administrative reason. “The government and TACTV are demanding more cut for a card. The commission has accepted and the issue will be sorted out soon,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hhxjp3/article30628889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THESEVACENTRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/deadlock-over-rates-hits-distribution-of-voter-id-cards/article30628890.ece
205,2020/01/23,HC rejects election petition challenging victory of Minister,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed an election petition filed by former Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly V.P. Duraisamy of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) challenging the victory of Social Welfare Minister V. Saroja from Rasipuram Assembly constituency in May 2016.

Justice V. Bharathidasan rejected the plea on the ground that neither the allegation regarding inclusion of as many as 20,271 bogus voters in the final electoral list of the constituency nor the allegation of the Minister having indulged in corrupt practices had been proved conclusively through oral and documentary evidence.

The judge said: “The proof for commission of corrupt practices must be clear, cogent, specific and reliable as the charge of a corrupt practice is almost like a criminal charge and the onus is on the person who brings forth that charge to prove it by leading reliable, trustworthy and satisfactory evidence.

“In the instant case, the evidence is hopelessly wanting. The petitioner has come up with vague pleadings and there is absolutely no substantial evidence to prove the allegation of corrupt practices. With the available evidence on record, it is not possible to connect the first respondent (Minister) with any of the alleged corrupt practices.”

Insofar as the allegation of inclusion of bogus voters was concerned, the judge said, it was only a bald allegation made without any particular such as names of the bogus voters, names of the wards or villages where their names had been included in the electoral list and how they came to be included in the list.

“That apart, there is no allegation that it is the first respondent (Minister) who had included all these alleged bogus voters and that all of them had voted for the first respondent. Even assuming that bogus voters had been included in the electoral list, the first respondent cannot be blamed for the same in the absence of any specific pleading and evidence to establish it,” he added.

The judge also said that any discrepancy in the electoral rolls could be challenged only in accordance with procedures contemplated under the Representation of the People Act and not by way of an election petition. On the allegation of the Minister having spent ₹7 lakh to transport 5,000 voters from Rasipuram to a public meeting held at Salem on April 20, 2016, when the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa introduced 47 candidates of her party to the voters, the judge said, there were no credible materials to substantiate the allegation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rnlapn/article30628883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24SAROJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-rejects-election-petition-challenging-victory-of-minister/article30628884.ece

208,2020/01/23,Here birth of girls is celebrated,"Wednesday was a day of celebration for three families in this village in Kondapur mandal.

About 15 km from the district headquarters, Haridaspur is in the news, for good reason. It has become an example for cleanliness and Haritha Haram programme. Instead of mentioning Ibrahimpur of Siddipet district, and Malkapur of Medak district, officials are now citing Haridaspur as a model to emulate.

Breaking stereotypes

As if that was not enough, it has taken another unique initiative. In a bid to encourage gender equality, the village panchayat has decided to encourage parents who give birth to a girl child, and how. Between December 2019 and January 2020, three girls were born in the village. Uppari Vennela gave birth to a baby girl on December 12, 2019. This was followed by birth of two girls – one to Banothu Sangeeta, and other to Aloori Satyavati – on New Year day, January 1, 2020.

In a transformation mode, the village panchayat has decided to celebrate the arrival of the newborns. They decorated the panchayat building by illuminating it with colourful lights. Parents of the newborn babies were invited to attend a function. As birthday gifts, they were handed over cheques issued on their names. The programme was taken up in view of the low child sex ratio in the village with 880 females against 1,000 males, according to the 2011 census. “To empower and provide self-respect to our girls, our village celebrates the birth of a girl as a good omen. Also, to financially help the family of the girl child in her education and marriage, the panchayat provides ₹ 1,000 in five instalments to motivate parents to enrol the girl in Haridaspur village, Kondapur mandal, , village panchayat, girl child, gift chque, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, a Central government scheme offering a high interest rate,” said Rohit Kulkarni, panchayat secretary.

211,2020/01/23,NTPC Ramagundam launches Miyawaki project,"This is the first time that NTPC has come forward to develop a dense native forest in an urban area with Miyawaki technique.

The NTPC-Ramagundam launched the Miyawaki project on Thursday at its oxidation pond area, covering over 1,400 square metres having around 2,900 trees of 53 varieties.

Collector A. Sridevasena and chief conservator of forests, Warangal, M.J. Akbar inaugurated the project by planting saplings.

Speaking on the occasion, the Collector lauded the NTPC’s efforts in enriching the environment through innovative techniques and hoped that this pilot project would encourage others to come forward. Echoing a similar view, Mr. Akbar highlighted the significance of Miyawaki technique and the process involved in plantation.

Hundreds of schoolchildren from four NTPC township schools; CGM (projects) Prem Prakash, CGM (O&M) Mathew Vargehese, GM (FGD) Avinash Saraswat, CMO Sashmita Dash, GM (Technical Services) P.K. Laad; GM (Operation) B.C. Polai; GM (Maint) Soumendra Das; DFO M. Ravi Prasad; RMC commissioner B. Srinivas and senior officials from NTPC, Singreni Colliery, RFCL, Telangana Forest department and TSFDCL were present.

Developed in association with Peddapalli district administration and the Forest department and executed by the Telangana State Forest Development Corporation Limited (TSFDCL), the project involves a scientific way of planting.

After selecting a location based on soil quality, water availability and secured boundary wall, an area is dug up to 0.60 metres depth and followed by filling with various layers of rice husk, farmyard manure, cocopeat and ‘Jeeva Mutram’. Subsequently, planting points are marked at a grid of 0.75M x 0.75M and then species of high canopy (16 varieties), medium canopy (19 varieties) and low canopy (18 varieties) are planted.

The progress of plantation will be closely monitored and documented so that it can be replicated in other areas in a large scale.

Zero usage of chemicals and fertilizers inspired the authorities to go for the Miyawaki technique. This ensures a cent per cent native, organic and natural plantation within a short time. After two years of plantation, it becomes self-sufficient.

215,2020/01/23,Special prayers herald Samakka Sarakka jatara,"Sprucing up of the Samakka temple in Medaram village marked the beginning of the jatara rituals on Thursday. The tribal priests offered special prayers called “Mendamalige panduga” on the occasion.

The Sarakka temple at Kannepalli, six kilometres from Medaram, was also decked up for the jatara. The Samakka Sarakka jatara is scheduled to be held from February 5 to 8.

Chief tribal priest Kokkera Krishnaiah led the festivities and said that they would be conducting a special puja again on January 29.

Tribal women from the priests’ families cleaned up the temple and drew special patterns with turmeric, vermilion and rice flour while the male members offered special prayers.

The temples were adorned with garlands of mango leaves and incense sticks were lighted up, thus setting a festive atmosphere in the villages.

Earlier in the day, a procession was organised with a group of men blowing horns and beating drums heralding the beginning of Sammakka Sarakka jatara festivities.

The historic Sammakka Sarakka jatara is believed to have started eight centuries after the tribal women, Sammakka and Sarakka, went down fighting the imperial Kakatiya army who demanded royalty from the little tribal hamlet.

It all began when the tribals expressed their inability to pay royalty to the Kakatiya army due to continuous drought. As a result, the army waged a war and started torturing the tribals. Then, tribal chieftain Medaraju and his wife and daughter put up a relentless fight protecting their people but in vain. However, since then, tribals started celebrating their valour, considered them as their goddesses and thus began the Samakka Sarakka jatara.

Over the decades, the jatara acquired a mass appeal and even non-tribals came to believe in the powers of the tribal deities.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/special-prayers-herald-samakka-sarakka-jatara/article30635349.ece

All the streets in various localities reverberated with slogans from loudspeakers mounted on autorickshaws appealing voters to elect the respective parties’ candidates from various municipal divisions and distributing polling slips. As a last-minute effort, all the contesting candidates have taken to streets with their supporters seeking votes.

TRS is leaving no stone unturned to woo voters promising the continuation of developmental works. Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar alone had single-handedly campaigned in all the municipal divisions.

The BJP had also intensified its electioneering. BJP MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar had campaigned vigorously for the party candidates in majority of the divisions.

219,2020/01/23,‘Mental walls are more dangerous than physical ones’,"Walk into Arzan Khambatta’s Sewri studio and you are surrounded by the artist and sculptor’s work – some complete and some works in progress. Khambatta tells us that he has a rule: he needs to see everything that he has ever created or is in the process of making, no object is unwanted and nothing gets bubble-wrapped and stored in the loft. It’s several such saved components that are now a part of his ongoing show, Walls. “It’s a beautiful feeling when a component that has been hung on a wall for 10 years and wasn’t useful to me till now as it fits perfectly inside the wall. It’s a very natural sort of a way of working.”

Architecture is a constant muse for the sculptor and Khambatta has created 11 walls for this exhibition. Khambatta explains that right from pre-historic cave paintings or be it our modern homes, walls are something we have always used to express ourselves and hide behind. We also often build inner walls to separate the outside world from our thoughts and beliefs. Khambatta, who often works with figurines chose to go abstract this time deliberately wanting to do something different. “I wanted to create a singular experience throughout the gallery. The spectator comes in and walks to one sculpture and not multiple sculptures,” he says.

The idea emanated from Khambatta’s fascination with walls. He then wanted the viewer to experience being within a space, with a play on the lighting. What piqued Khambatta’s interest was a fundraising project which he executed for the Jai Vakeel Foundation last year. As part of the project, Khambatta had created 101 sculptures, which were painted by different artists and were then auctioned for the foundation. “One word that they hammered into all of us was inclusiveness. They are constantly working to create a society which is an inclusive space for intellectually disabled children, where you can take them freely to parks, theatres, in public without being ridiculed. To me, it was such a big wall that is meant to be broken, it’s a mental wall by people who don’t accept another kind of people within them or near them. The mental walls are more dangerous than the physical ones,” he shares.

Art and process

Khambatta used an interesting method this time with the aim of presenting separate pieces as one for the viewer. He started by creating large frameworks which were placed horizontally in his studio, and then worked simultaneously on all of them together. “There’s a purpose behind each piece in each wall, a visual connotation that aesthetically binds all of them,” he says. The show reminds us of Khambatta’s 2011 outing, Micropolis, where he explored the reaction of man to his surroundings and how living in a city like Mumbai shapes our thoughts, opinions and even way of living. “I have a very strong architectural background which acts as a catalyst for my pieces. I usually include several figurines in my shows. For Walls, I wanted the spectator to be the human element in the sculpture.”

In the pipeline

Khambatta is known for conducting workshops for children at schools and his Sewri studio. He plans to take this a step further this year by dedicating space within his studio for teaching. He also has plans to conduct workshops for corporate clients and any adult who is interested in exploring metal art and sculpture as a stress buster.

Khambatta has also been working on a series of black and white abstract sketches which he plans to exhibit someday. What you will get to see soon is a 15-feet bronze cast bull for a traffic island in Worli, which has been commissioned by a leading bank.

220,2020/01/23,These shutters are like small shrines for me: Atul Dodiya,"Over the years, artist Atul Dodiya has moved effortlessly beyond a narrative style of depiction to explore the social milieu he inhabits, with subtle humour and even satirical slants. Through his paintings and assemblages, Dodiya engages with both political and art history as he entwines global /public memory and local/personal experience.

The upcoming solo show “Stammer in the shade” at New Delhi’s Vadehra Art Gallery has two parts – paintings in his fragmented abstract style and his shutter series. Known for creating an amalgamation of visual imagery upon the metallic surface of shutter doors taken from Delhi shop fronts, his earliest shutter works were commissioned by the Tate Modern for its Century City exhibition 2000. At that time, his shutter paintings were his response to the city-wide curfews prompted by riots in the 1990s in Mumbai.

In 2007, he reflected on his works in an interview with this writer. “Creativity earlier meant that I was a link in a long chain of art makers from the ancient to the postmodern,” stated Dodiya. “The inclinations and the obsessions have moved. Almost dramatically the earth has moved beneath my feet. As my notions of security and beauty have changed, a deluge of images has hit me.

Living in a nation seeped in poverty, maybe it’s unavoidable. Death, decay, corruption, compromise, struggle are not distant metaphors for the fall of man. These are real right here, lived with me ...”

Fast forward to 2020, Dodiya’s new suite of works professes an increasing attention to a more active viewer involvement in his works. It creates an impetus for the viewer to explore deeper interpretations. “The act of looking at a work of art is complex,” states Dodiya and gives us a peek into his oeuvre.

Atul Dodiya’s “Rising” from his “Shutter series”

Talk about the title ‘Stammer in the shade’... this was a 2005 work. Are you going back in time with one eye on the series you made in the past?

That’s right. I did a series of works titled “Stammer in the Shade”, 2005 which was part of Venice Biennale’s collateral event.

I am using the title “Stammer in the Shade” for this recent show because I like the title, it’s poetic and in a strange way it relates to 2005 series.

In that series, there was a painting hidden behind a large canvas standing on crutches. The detail of the painting i.e title, etc was on the front and the real painting was behind in the shade of a bigger canvas. Now, in this series, there are masterpieces (of Picasso, Van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Courbet, etc) in the form of photographs placed on the small shutters.

A little part of these great paintings is seen in the photographs, mostly the bottom part of the paintings. But the main motif is the frame which is empathetically seen in the centre of the photograph. The shadow of these heavy frames was my main subject.

I have learnt so much from these great artists and their art that whatever I attempt and do is just a stammering. This is the statement I want to make in this show.

This suite is a combination of dulcet still life and landscapes with the human figure in a minimalist mode. There is a passion for art and the grammar of painting. Would you like to expand on the compositional control and imagery in your works?

There are landscapes, there are abstract forms, also Saints/Monks and some mythological figures. From the great art of the past, I get a sense of freedom and feel I am allowed to do diverse things simultaneously. This has been my approach throughout my career.

How do you invite active participation from the viewer in the interpretation of your art?

Viewers see only that which they want to see, not everything which is seen. The way my freedom is important to me, the same way, I give total freedom to my viewer for interpretation, perception and also argue. There is no control over a fellow person/viewer.

The shutter series is another flashback in time. You seem to have given them a new avatar with the framed photograph added to the top almost like a mantelpiece effect in the scheme of scenography.

These shutters are like small shrines for me. They can be many things, in many ways. They can be different according to functions in times-daily grind, during a curfew they come down suddenly and forcefully. Lots of incidents and events all come into being along with the history and memory.

In terms of fragments you seem to have a Braqian echo in the manner in which you fragment your details so as to create movement in space. It’s almost as if you have gone back in time to cubist journeys of European Masters.

True, as I said, I am allowed. As an artist, I can go back in time. For an artist, I believe, there is no past, present, and future. It’s more like a river, just a flow and one is part of it. I can go back in the past, the past can come into future or present. Everything merges into each other and come up with a new experience.

222,2020/01/23,Learn to work with clay at a workshop,"As the clarion call towards phasing out plastic gets more strident, many are opting towards a green alternatives. But how about fashioning your own kitchenware, that too eco-friendly ones, which bears a mark of your craft? A one-day clay modelling and pottery workshop organised by city-based arts and craft collective Craftacy this Saturday (January 25) offers know-how on crafting your own utensils for “self-sustenance”.

“The workshop aims at promoting use of clay ware and products and spread awareness against the use of plastic, thereby moving towards a more eco-friendly lifestyle. We focus on fashioning one’s own environment-friendly earthenware and various types of handy pots such as kooja (water pot) and other decorative curios and containers like flower vase from clay,” says Mini Satheesh, founder of Craftacy, which grew out of WhatsApp group Craft Castle, a collective bringing together artists from across the State.

Mini says she decided to organise the tutorial after “seeing a lot of interest and enquiries” about the use of clay as a welcome alternative to plastic. She will be assisted by two traditional potters and artistes from Craftacy. “A lot of creative work can be done using clay modelling, even by beginners. In fact, some of the simple clay figurines one finds in the market can be easily made by us with a bit of practice,” she says.

Apart from demonstrations, participants will be given instructions on applying finishing touches to make their products more attractive.

“We will also explore the benefits of using clay, something that’s considered integral to Nature,” says Mini. Clay to be used for the workshop is sourced from local suppliers from various places in and around Parassala and Kaliyikkavila on the outskirts of the city for its “better quality and optimum malleability.”

Open to all, fees for the session has been tentatively kept at ₹1,000, says Mini, adding that the charges will depend on the number of participants.

223,2020/01/23,Shaji Appukuttan curates a show that goes back to the brush,"Prajaktha Palav’s untitled painting of potted plants on the tin roof of a Mumbai shanty and Devi Seetharaman’s works showing mundu-clad men align perfectly with what Shaji Appukuttan had in mind when he conceived his curatorial debut ‘Rustic Footmarks’ — that art should engage with the regional/personal.

He says, “Both speak of what is immediate. Prajaktha lives in Thane, Mumbai, and she painted the life she saw. Similarly Australia-based Devi’s works are perhaps, from the memories she carries within her of Kerala.”

All the works on show at Durbar Hall Art Gallery are paintings, “Only paintings, because I want to show that painting as an art form is alive. It is important and it can be used to express provincial concerns, which can speak to a larger audience. For example when Van Gogh painted ‘A Pair of Shoes’, he was speaking of the human condition, which resonated with people, the epoch and the milieu,” Shaji says.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale, for example, turned the spotlight off painting, and instead focussed on installations, essentially informed by a Western aesthetic, he feels. A need to be international or global, led to an embracing of a Western or European aesthetic which pushed the Indian sensibility to the background. “Nandalal Bose was known for his ‘Indian style’ of painting, which was frowned upon by those who felt Indian art needed to look toward Europe.” That said he has included abstracts in the show.

India has a rich heritage, and history, of paintings which, in Shaji’s opinion, is limited by labels such as ‘traditional’ and/or ‘folk’ art. Warli, Madhubani, or murals, for example, are forms of expression that are socio-cultural and even political. “Madhubani is painted by women — mothers, daughters, wives — who engage with every day life, every day activities. Art is inextricably intertwined with life in our context,” he says.

“Yes, the paintings are political; an artist has an important role and cannot work exclusive of society nor can they forget society. Even geography is political — for instance Anil Janardhan’s painting of Munnar. Doesn’t geography then become political even if it is just a landscape? I am a social being too and I set the works within certain socio-political contexts. This is an art exhibition which is also a art movement.”

A product of the Government College of Fine Arts, Shaji is a recipient of Kerala Lalitakala Akademi’s State Award in 1992. He went to Shantiniketan for his masters, but left it because it wasn’t his idea of an education. The idea of curating a show came to him just as he was contemplating a solo show. The thought led him to wonder about an exhibition as a space for all artists to show, rather than limit it to himself. The 29 participating artists are friends and acquaintances, who came on board when they saw his concept note, Shaji is also exhibiting.

224,2020/01/23,Theatreperson Phillip Zarrilli on adopting and adapting intercultural techniques in his teachings and works,"Phillip Zarrilli, renowned actor, director, acting coach and pedagogue, was in Kerala recently to stage his play, Told by the Wind at the 12th International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) in Thrissur. Despite a hectic schedule, Phillip managed to take time out to discuss his work and interculturality.

Excerpts from an interview...

Interculturality has been central to your work and training process. So, what does ‘intercultural’ mean to you?

To me, life is a process of encounters and negotiations. You encounter something, you respond and negotiate. It’s so unless you’re somebody with a closed mindset, where you wrap yourself within a specific way of thinking, putting yourself in a box, whether about ideas, people, other religions or other cultures. I think it’s much more interesting when we encounter and try to negotiate. So, interculturalism is not just about ‘between cultures’.

It is a way of seeing the world. The question is whether someone is open to a real, face-to-face encounter with others. I think, unfortunately, the world we live in is much more a world of separation than what it was when I was younger.

Do you think interculturality has relevance in the contemporary world?

Sure. Because it’s about encounter and understanding, and wanting to embrace difference. And not just, you know, be in a box, so as to speak. Unfortunately, I think, a lot of politicians are creating boxes, and pitting one box against another.

In the acting studio, the problem with the term interculturalism is that when it was used for the first time, it was limited to the early works that Peter Brook and the other kind of directors were doing when they brought together people from different cultures. I’d call that surface interculturalism.

But, it’s a different kind of situation for those who work in the acting studio, doing it for years on end. There’s a give and take that takes place in a studio. When I first came to Kerala and studied Kathakali in 1976, my teacher MP Sankaran Namboothiri (MPS) was generous with his time.

Both MPS and Killimangalam Vasudevan Namboothirippad, the then superintendent of Kerala Kalamandalam, were people who liked to think. Likewise, my Kalaripayattu teacher Govindankutty Nair was also generous with his time.

The encounters that took place between all of us, in and outside the studio, the discussions, the exchanges of ideas about body, thought and reflection, that willingness to open up, were intercultural.

I have brought together Kalarippayattu and Tai Chi into my practice. For me, this process of negotiation is taking place within my body and through the body-minds of those who were training in the studio with me. Contemporary theatre in Kerala, or in India itself, came about via an encounter with the West. So, it is intercultural on one hand, and still growing with its own rootedness in India.

You recently co-edited a book, Intercultural Acting and Performer Training, with T Sasitharan, Director, Intercultural Theatre Institute, Singapore, and Anuradha Kapur, former Director, National School of Drama. Was that book an attempt to define ‘interculturalism ?’

Rather than ‘defining,’ it was an attempt to open up. My book, Psycho Physical Acting: An Intercultural Approach After Stanislavski, published in 2009, is about my training process. But the purpose of this present book, Intercultural Acting and Performer Training, was to give space to other voices.

There are 14 chapters written by different people, about different dimensions of interculturalism as it exists today. We, the three editors, did not even write a joint introduction. The book has a three-part introduction.

Is there interculturalism, however subtle, in your directorial works?

Told by the Wind is an intercultural performance, inspired by the Japanese art form, Noh. However, it looks nothing like Noh. Only the dramaturgy and our performance are inspired by principles of Noh. I’d call it a subtle form of interculturalism. However, when we performed it in Japan, the Japanese audience who knew Butoh and Noh appreciated it. They could see the subtle elements, the influences.

The 2015 production Playing the Maids, which we did with Korean, Irish and Singaporean Chinese collaborators, was another subtle form of interculturalism. The text was primarily in English, but it had Mandarin, Korean and Irish Gaelic. The Singaporean performer had worked with Wayang Wong, the Javanese classical dance theatre, and her movements were subtly infused with the form.

You have worked with differently-abled actors in some of your works.

I’ve done two plays with differently- actors. One was The 8 Fridas, which Kaite O’Reilly had written. She has been working with differently-abled artistes. Richard III Redux or Sara Beer (Is/Not) Richard III, co-created by me and Kaite, was written for Sara Beer, a Welsh actress who had scoliosis. It was written as a response to the vilification of Richard III, as the epitome of evil because he had a disability.

225,2020/01/23,Meet the artists behind the paintings at the Cholamandal Artists’ Village,"In the 1960s, abstract painter Vishwanathan walked into a famous Paris gallery with an artwork rolled under his arm, and caught the attention of the gallerist, who invited him to show. There is nothing more uplifting than direct contact with a work of art, and likewise, a real encounter with an artist.

Open Studios is back at Cholamandal Artists’ Village this Republic Day weekend, celebrating art and life. More than 20 artists will throw their doors open to the public, inviting warm informal exchanges. Families, art aficionados and fans can find out what it is like to be an artist and journey into their art.

The life of an artist is often a mystery to others. ‘Paris’ Vishwanathan, who turned 80 this January, recalls, “In Madras, 50 years back, if you said — ‘I am an artist’, the next question would be, ‘Oh! Then what do you do?’”

Vishwanathan, who spends time in Cholamandal every year with Nadine Tarbouriech, shares how the idea for Open Studios was born. “We live in Paris, where it is a ritual for artists to open up studios,” he says. The first 2018 Open Studios at Cholamandal was a dream come true for both artists and the public, especially those who were reluctant to walk into a gallery or museum.

“Most of the artists were really delighted and surprised that so many people came!” says Nadine. The interactions led to many questions and interesting exchanges about their paintings. Enthused by the huge response, the duo along with abstract artist Bhagwan Chawan planned this event, in 2020.

What, how and why

Open Studios is education through an intimate exposure to an artist’s space; to glean information about how artists live and work, what materials and techniques they use, and how each one gets inspiration.

Nadine’s association with Vishwanathan led her to use casein in her paper works. A protein of milk, this natural medium preserves the quality of any pigment mixed into it. “It is a very old technique, and it retains colors in a vivid and real way, without altering them.”

Creative foundations A self-reliant artists’ community, Cholamandal Artists’ Village was set up by KCS Panikker in 1966. Back in the Fifties, this spot was part of an uninhabited stretch of sand, with casaurina plantations spread over 10 acres. At that time, most of the artists who lived and worked here were students of the Government School of Arts and Crafts, Madras. Towards the end of the Fifties, many painters and sculptors joined hands with Paniker leading up to a new way of life in contemporary art. In 2009, Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art was opened, with a museum and two galleries.

“I don’t wait for inspiration to come to me. I keep working every day,” says SG Vasudev, 79. “Many people think art can be understood easily, but just like how basic science is easy and advanced concepts take time, art too is complex in its depths.”

Appreciating art is like cultivating a taste for music, says the popular veteran artist. Aside of his collection of artworks, Vasudev will have a range of his gift merchandise on sale, like mugs, magnets, T-shirts and coasters, all developed from his art.

Vishwanathan’s high-ceiling studio space was specially built to accommodate paintings of all sizes. This time, an old piece of wood finished and polished, a part of a casuarina tree will be on exhibit. Can a tree be considered art?

Nadine explains, “It carries the memory of the village; the casuarina that was everywhere — now a relic, a testimony to all these years.”

Of, by and for artists

Can painting be performance? When Pravin Kannanur was invited to show, he decided he had to do it in the true spirit of Open Studios.

“It is more about the process than the end product,” says Kannanur, whose artistic experiments with composer Maarten Visser involve making graphic scores, an exploration of color, music and improvisations.

A theatre personality, Kannanur’s ‘score’ paintings are hugely collaborative involving musicians and dancers in his choreographed works of art. This weekend in Vishwanathan’s courtyard, his performative artwork will unfold on a massive canvas, seven feet by 11 feet, spread flat on the ground, with special Kalighat pigments from Calcutta.

And right across in the ‘Yellow Cottage’, A Brush with Color — a group that works with children with special needs — will show 40 works with paper and poster colors. Mala Chinnappa is proud of what the therapeutic power of art has done for these children who have autism, Asperger’s and dyslexia. “Stress melts away as they play with clay or spray dip with paint. As Vishwanathan likes to say — “This is not freedom of expression; the work is the expression of their freedom.”

“We have to remember Cholamandal started with the idea — of the artists, for the artists and by the artists,” he says.

Open Studios 2020, will be held from 11 am to 7 pm on January 25 and 26, Cholamandal Artists’ Village, Injambakkam",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/tqkboa/article30632033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MPOPENSTUDIOS1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/meet-the-artists-behind-the-paintings-at-the-cholamandal-artists-village/article30632036.ece
226,2020/01/23,In the service of Kathakali,"Kottakkal Gopi Nair has played many roles in his life — as a Kathakali artiste, guru, mentor, troupe manager, businessman, social worker and philanthropist. The nonagenarian is also a raconteur with a superb memory for names and dates. Stories of tact and diplomacy, of lessons learnt, of friendship and camaraderie, funny incidents all cascade, with no malice or regrets.

He recalls a lighter moment from the 1940s. In the emotionally charged scene of Hanuman meeting Sita in Lavanasuravadham, the audience were so moved that they came on to the stage and dropped coins in his hands with no thought to the action on stage. The coins added up to more than their fee for the day, Gopi remembers with a chuckle.

Born in 1926 as the twelfth and youngest son in a well-to-do agriculturist family, Gopi was initiated into the art form by his cousin, a Kathakali artiste.

Though it was unusual for a boy from an affluent background to take up Kathakali those days, Gopi showed his mettle by sticking to the rigorous training schedule. He took up Kathakali after his fifth standard and had his début at the age of 12 in 1938. Gopi’s family supported his interest and budding career, employing a guru and accompanying artistes who stayed in the family home.

After a few years of initial training, the search for a guru took him to Kottakkal in 1945. He officially joined the PSV Natya Sangham in 1946 and was trained by Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon and then by Kavalappara Narayanan Nair. Later, Gopi received intensive training from the late Vazhenkada Kunju Nair for six years. After he completed his training, Gopi was appointed as an artiste and guru in PSV Natyasangham. He performed mainly female and minukku roles such as Brahmana, Kuchela and Narada.

In 1961, his career took another turn as he was given the additional responsibility of managing the Kathakali troupe. It was in this sphere that Gopi left his stamp.

In an era when PSV Natya Sangham was growing into a force to reckon with with numerous programmes in and out of Kerala, it was Gopi who fronted that effort. His emphasis was on the programme’s quality. As he took up handling management, his stage career became secondary, though he continued to be a guru and mentor to a generation of artistes.

Although Gopi retired from Natyasangham in 1986, he was persuaded to stay for another 10 years. After he called it a day in 1996, Gopi gave up his acting career too, except for a few rare events.

All for art and society

Today, 23 years after leaving Kottakkal, he remains busy in the service of art and society. He is the recipient of the 2019 Kunju Nair Samsthuthi Samman, which carries a purse of ₹1 lakh.

227,2020/01/23,Names of Bru voters to be deleted from Mizoram electoral roll,"Names of more than 11,000 Bru community people living in relief camps in Tripura will be deleted from voters’ list of their homeland Mizoram, following an agreement that allows the tribals to permanently settle in Tripura, a senior official said on Thursday.

Thousands of Bru community people have been living in relief camps in Tripura since 1997. They had fled Mizoram to reach the neighbouring State because of ethnic clashes. By now, the total number of these internally displaced people has risen to around 34,000.

The process of deletion of Bru voters from the State voters’ list is likely to be undertaken once the relief camps are closed down, Mizoram Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ahish Kundra told the PTI.

“The action regarding deletion of names of the Bru voters will be taken probably during the next roll revision following provisions of the Representation of the People Act and taking approval from the Election Commission,” he said.

There were a total of 12,081 Bru voters in six relief camps in Tripura in the Lok Sabha polls in April last year.

Only 33.54% of those voters exercised their franchise at 15 polling booths set up exclusively for them at a village on the Mizoram-Tripura border.

Mr. Kundra said the exact number of Bru voters could not be determined now as a section of them have returned to Mizoram during the final and ninth round repatriation in October after the last roll revision.

He expressed hope that the Bru voters, who did not return to Mizoram before the quadripartite agreement signed on January 16, would be included in Tripura’s electoral role.

The pact signed by representatives of the Brus, the Central, Tripura and Mizoram governments in New Delhi allows these tribal people to permanently settle in Tripura.

The agreement was signed one-and-a-half months after the latest initiative to send the Bru refugees back to Mizoram failed. Of the targeted 4,447 families, Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb last week said only 350 families could be repatriated.

Mr. Deb said it will take at least six months to resettle the 34,000 odd members of the community who are living in Tripura for 23 years.

The Brus are staying in six camps at Kanchanpur and Panisagar sub-divisions of North Tripura district. They get free ration and a cash dole from the Centre.

The vexed Bru issue started from September, 1997, following demands of a separate autonomous district council by carving out areas of western Mizoram adjoining Bangladesh and Tripura.

The situation was aggravated by the murder of a forest guard in the Dampa Tiger Reserve in western Mizoram by Bru National Liberation Front insurgents on October 21 that year.

The first attempt to repatriate the Brus from Tripura was made in November 2009.

The Centre, along with the governments of Tripura and Mizoram, had been trying to repatriate them to their home State over the past one decade, with little success.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qw81rd/article30635036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-bru-refugees,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bru-voters-to-be-deleted-from-mizoram-electoral-roll/article30635040.ece
228,2020/01/23,All-party meet passes resolution on Punjab’s water crisis,"Concerned over the Punjab’s critical water situation, an all-party meeting was held here on Thursday, which demanded reassessment of the State’s water availability and unanimously resolved that the Centre should ensure river water is not in any way transferred from the basin to the non-basin areas of the State’s three rivers.

The parties demanded suitable amendments to the proposed Inter State River Water Disputes Act to set up a new tribunal, to ensure that Punjab gets adequate water “in a just and equitable manner in keeping with its total demand and securing the livelihood of future generations”.

The key parties that participated in the meeting included Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party and Trinamool Congress.

‘No surplus’

A resolution passed in the meeting, which was chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh read: “Punjab does not have surplus water and is facing a threat of desertification with declining availability of its river water and fast depleting groundwater. State’s groundwater that meets 73% of its irrigation requirements, has declined to alarming levels, threatening the livelihood of farmers and other poor people. In such a situation, it is unanimously resolved that the Government of India should ensure that Punjab river water is not in any way transferred from basin to non-basin areas of three rivers, namely Ravi, Sutlej and Beas as per internationally accepted riparian principle.”

“Further, alternatives should be ascertained, including amendments to the proposed Inter State River Water Disputes Act to set up a new tribunal for a complete de novo assessment of availability of river waters before final decision, to harness, develop and provide adequate water to Punjab in a just and equitable manner in keeping with its total demand and securing livelihood of the future generations,” it added.

230,2020/01/23,Opposition slams UP CM Yogi Adityanath for warning to anti-CAA protesters,"The opposition parties on Thursday slammed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for warning anti-CAA protesters that “azadi” slogans raised by them will treated as sedition.

While the Samajwadi Party drew an analogy with the British rule, the Congress termed it “a language of dictators”.

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister in a rally in Kanpur on Wednesday had said,”If azadi slogans are raised here like they used to be raised in Kashmir, then it will come in the category of sedition and stringent action will be taken by the government.”

Reacting to it, Senior SP leader Ram Govind Chaudhary said the British too “had described freedom fighters as terrorists”.

“Now their successors or those who had sided with them are terming those raising azadi slogans traitors,” he said.

He said there was no need to to get “perturbed” by such warnings. “Their countdown has started and that is why they are ranting,” Mr. Chaudhary said.

The SP leader alleged that the Chief Minister was threatening women against those hell bent on dividing the country.

“Azadi is the birthright of all countrymen and those denying it will have to depart in the same manner as Hitler,” the SP leader said.

SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary too said the dissent against the CAA is being dubbed as treason by the chief minister, which is against the very essence of a democracy.

“The Chief Minister is threatening women who are demanding their rights,” Mr. Chaudhary asserted.

When asked about the chief minister’s allegation that the SP was funding anti-CAA protests, Chaudhary said, “This amounts to making a mockery of people’s emotions.”

“Protests are on in all the states, including north-eastern region. Are we distributing money in all states,” Mr. Chaudhary wondered.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the CM is speaking “a language of dictators”.

“If raising voice against the government’s oppression and politics of hatred is treason, the government should first arrest me,” Mr. Lallu said, adding that since the protests have rattled the government, it is accusing the Congress of sponsoring them.

“If people are on agitation path over this issue, why is the government not addressing it,” Lallu said.

At a public meeting in Kanpur, the chief minister had said, “...I would like to say from the soil of India, and especially the soil of Uttar Pradesh, that in the name of protests, if azadi slogans are raised here like they used to be raised in Kashmir, then it will come in the category of sedition, and stringent action will be taken by the government.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/oec19c/article30634364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/opposition-slams-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-for-warning-to-anti-caa-protesters/article30634365.ece

232,2020/01/23,One-way traffic resumes on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway after two days,"One-way traffic resumed on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway on Thursday after remaining suspended for the past two days due to snowfall and multiple landslides in Ramban sector, a traffic department official said. The traffic on the highway was allowed from Srinagar to Jammu this morning after the road was cleared of snow and landslide debris, he said.

The highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with rest of the country, was closed for traffic on Tuesday following fresh snowfall and incessant rains, leaving thousands of commuters stranded.

“All the stranded vehicles were cleared last evening, paving the way for the resumption of one-way traffic,” he said, adding Jammu-bound security convoys were given priority after the resumption of traffic.

Jawahar Tunnel, the gateway to Kashmir, experienced nearly one feet of fresh snow on Tuesday, while incessant rains had triggered multiple landslides and shooting stones from the hillocks overlooking the highway between Panthiyal and Ramsu, forcing closure of the arterial road.

A youth was killed on Wednesday when his vehicle came under a landslide at Panthiyal.

233,2020/01/23,"Pawan Varma can join any other party if he wants to, says Nitish Kumar","Bihar Chief Minister and president of Janata Dal (United) Nitish Kumar on Thursday broke his silence over party leader Pawan Varma’s attack on him and said “if he wants to go to some other party, he has my wishes”.

Mr. Varma recently wrote a two-page letter to Mr. Kumar asking him how the JD(U) could strike an electoral alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar. Adding that he was “deeply perplexed” over the development, Mr. Varma had also mentioned about “private conversations” he had with Mr. Kumar on ties with the BJP.

“This is not the way to express your displeasure…it is surprising…he (Mr. Varma) says I’ve told him certain things…should I tell you what he had told me?”, Mr. Kumar told journalists, while adding, “If he (Mr. Varma) wants to go to some other party, which is his decision…he has my wishes”. Mr. Kumar was emerging out of a function organised at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’ anniversary.

Earlier on January 21, while shooting off the letter to Mr. Kumar, Mr. Varma had sought “ideological clarity” on the JD(U)’s electoral alliance with BJP, “especially at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda”.

He also had reminded Mr. Kumar of his confession to him on more than one occasion about his “grave apprehensions” over the BJP-RSS combine.

""BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’”

“In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012 you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country… when you were leading the Mahagathbandhan you had openly made a call for RSS Mukt Bharat…these views articulated for a sustained period, are a matter of public record”, wrote Mr. Varma, who recently also wrote to Mr. Kumar urging him not to support the CAA, NRC and NPR in the State.

“I remember your confession to me in private how the current leadership in BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’”, Mr. Varma further said in his letter to Mr. Kumar, while adding, “the BJP is destroying institutions and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official”.

Recently, the JD(U) struck an electoral alliance with the BJP to contest the Delhi Assembly poll, scheduled on February 8, from two seats – Burari and Sangam Vihar.

Action likely

Meanwhile, party source told The Hindu that Mr. Kumar may take action against Mr. Varma and Prashant Kishor, who have of late been hammering him with tweets and letters, on January 27, when he would meet party leaders at his official residence, 1 Anne Marg.

234,2020/01/23,644 extremists surrender in Assam,"Altogether 644 extremists, belonging to eight banned outfits, surrendered at an official ceremony in Guwahati on Thursday. Almost half of them were from a little-known Bengali group.

The event, attended by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, was in a series of “mainstreaming” of extremist groups since 1992. But the State’s Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta said it was one of the biggest in scale.

Most (301) of the surrendered extremists belonged to the National Liberation Front of Bengali (NLFB), followed by 178 of the Adivasi Dragon Fighter and 87 of the National Santhal Liberation Army.

Eight members of an unspecified faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland took part in the surrender ceremony, as did 50 of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), 13 of the Rava National Liberation Front, six of the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation and one of the Communist Party of India-Maoist.

The extremists deposited 177 firearms, 71 bombs and 52 grenades. The NLFB, formed by one Amar Paul with the aim of stopping “harassment of Bengalis in Assam”, deposited 75 of these firearms, besides 1.93 kg explosives, the only outfit to do so.

“This is an important day for the State as well as Assam Police with such a large number of the militants joining the mainstream,” Mr. Mahanta said.

Mr. Sonowal praised the extremists and appealed to them to dedicate their lives to the interests of the nation.“There cannot be development without peace. We all have to work together for peace and prosperity... Each one of you has strength. You may not be aware of it. I urge you to use it to build the nation and society,” he said. He also advised them to take advantage of various Central schemes.

Rehabilitation programme

Assam has a rehabilitation programme for surrendered militants in place. They get financial assistance from the government and can also avail of a bank loan to start a business or invest the money in farming or entrepreneurship, according to officials.

A screening committee comprising the civil administration, the police, the Army and other security agencies decide the eligibility for rehabilitation package. There have been reports of non-extremists becoming beneficiaries in order to show a certain number of “surrendered militants”.

Soon after the programme, ULFA-I military chief Paresh Baruah described the surrender ceremony as a “drama”. In a statement, he called for the boycott of Republic Day. Militants had surrendered last year, he said.

“This is nothing but a drama. Militants who surrendered have been made to surrender again. The government is trying to weaken us with such shows but they will never succeed. On the contrary, the ULFA will get strengthened,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fuha7x/article30634561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ASSAM-MILITANTS-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/644-militants-surrender-in-assam/article30631593.ece

At a public meeting calling for action against Collector Nidhi Nivedita and Sub Divisional Magistrate Priya Verma in Biaora of the district, Mr. Yadav said, “She feeds Congress workers milk with a lot of love, sits them in her lap and feeds milk, but canes and slaps BJP workers.”

Accompanied by police personnel, the two officials came down on BJP workers for taking out the rally allegedly in violation of prohibitory orders. In two videos doing the rounds on the social media, the officials can be seen slapping workers and dragging them. One of the workers even pulls Ms. Verma’s ponytail. The police have registered a case against two persons for allegedly molesting her, and another against 125 persons for breaking the law.

At the same meeting on Wednesday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said with the Collector, an alumna of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), “the JNU virus has come to Rajgarh”.

Moreover, Leader of the Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Gopal Bhargava said the Constitution did not give the officials the right to slap anyone. “If not for the Constitution, you’d be cooking at home.”

Meanwhile, the Madhya Pradesh IAS Officers’ Association condemned the “derogatory” remarks and issued a statement saying, “They not only demoralise the administrative machinery but also demean the dignity of women officials who are proud members of the service and contribute immensely in serving the State and its people.”

237,2020/01/23,"Case against Azharuddin, 2 others for ‘cheating’ travel agent","A case has been registered against former Indian cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin and two others here in Maharashtra after a travel agent lodged a police complaint alleging that they cheated him to the tune of Rs 20.96 lakh, an official said on Thursday.

Mr. Azharuddin, however, dismissed the allegation as “baseless”, and said he will take legal action against the complainant, Mohammed Shahab.

Mr. Shahab, owner of Danish Tours and Travels agency in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad city, alleged in his complaint that he booked various international flight tickets worth Rs 20.96 lakh for Azharuddin and some others in November last year on the request of the former India captain’s personal assistant Mujib Khan, the police official said.

Mr. Shahab alleged he was repeatedly promised payment online, but he did not receive any money.

In his complaint, Mr. Shahab said when he asked for the payment, Khan’s associate Sudesh Awakkal sent an e-mail saying he has transferred Rs 10.6 lakh to him, but it was not received, the official said.

On November 24, Mr. Awakkal sent Mr. Shahab a picture on WhatsApp of a cheque issued by him and Mr. Khan also did the same on November 29, but the complainant alleged that he did not receive any of the cheques, he said.

Mr. Shahab on Wednesday lodged a complaint at City Chowk police station here against Mr. Azharuddin, Mr. Khan and Mr. Awakkal under Indian Penal Code Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 34 (common intention).

Meanwhile, Mr. Azharuddin said the allegations against him were baseless.

In a video posted on Twitter, the former cricketer said, “There is no truth in this complaint and is made just to be in limelight. The allegations made in the complaint are baseless. I will seek legal advice and file defamation case worth Rs 100 crore against the complainant.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i4ytd9/article30112084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29HCA-AZHARAGMP6PCSA74jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/case-against-azharuddin-2-others-for-cheating-travel-agent/article30631330.ece
238,2020/01/23,Maharashtra govt holds review meeting on Koregaon Bhima case,"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh met senior police officials in Mumbai on Thursday to review the case of violence at Koregaon Bhima in Pune on January 1, 2018.

The meeting is currently underway at the state secretariat in Mumbai, an official said.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar last month demand that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) be set up under a retired judge to probe the action taken by Pune Police in the Koregaon Bhima case.

NCP leader Deshmukh, after taking charge as Home minister, said earlier this month that he would seek a status report on the case and then take a decision.

The term “urban Naxal” was used by the Pune Police probing the alleged links between the Elgar Parishad conclave of December 31, 2017 and the caste clashes around Koregaon Bhima in Pune district the next day. While some rights activists were arrested in the case by the Pune city police, their rural counterparts had booked Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide for allegedly inciting violence. Ekbote was granted bail by the Supreme Court, while Bhide was never arrested.

The Pune Police have claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The parishad, they alleged, instigated violence near the Koregaon Bhima war memorial on January 1, 2018.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/owbchw/article30220256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07AJITPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-govt-holds-review-meeting-on-koregaon-bhima-case/article30631275.ece
239,2020/01/23,Mining scam: Congress for CBI probe into Manohar Parrikar’s role,"The Congress on Wednesday said it would approach the CBI for a probe into late Manohar Parrikar’s alleged role as then chief minister in the “illegal” renewal of iron ore mining leases in 2014, which were later quashed by the supreme court in February 2018.

Hitting back, a senior state BJP functionary said the Congress is speaking without any application of mind.

The Congress’ demand came two days after the Goa Lokayukta recommended a CBI inquiry against Parrikar’s successor and BJP leader Laxmikant Parsekar into the matter.

The Goa Lokayukta also recommended a CBI inquiry against then mines secretary Pawan Kumar Sain and then director of Mines and Geology Prasanna Acharya.

“The Congress had filed a complaint with then governor and then director general of police in October 2018 on the issue, but no action was initiated,” State Congress president Girish Chodankar told reporters in Margao.

He said the Congress had specifically named then CM Parrikar, who had succeeded Mr. Parsekar in March 2017 in another term, in the “mining lease scam”.

“But within a fortnight of filing the complaint, then superintendent of police (crime branch) Karthik Kashyap had reverted saying no substance was found in the allegations,” Mr. Chodankar claimed.

The Congress stand is vindicated, he said referring to the Lokayukta’s order.

“In the affidavit filed before the Lokayukta, Mr. Parsekar himself had said that the process to renew leases was started by Parrikar and he just continued it, as the government is a continuous process,” Mr. Chodankar said.

In the next seven days, the Congress will file a formal complaint with the CBI, seeking investigation into the renewal of leases, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mining-scam-congress-for-cbi-probe-into-manohar-parrikars-role/article30631005.ece
240,2020/01/23,"Amid tussle, Khattar takes charge of CID","Amid a controversy between the Haryana Chief Minister's Office and Home Minister Anil Vij over who controls the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has been given charge of it.

In a late Wednesday night development, the government issued orders allocating the CID, among other departments, to the Chief Minister. Mr. Vij will now cease to hold the CID portfolio.

Reacting to the decision, Mr. Vij said on Thursday that he had always maintained that the Chief Minister is supreme and he can take away or divide any department.

An official statement said the Governor, on the advice of the Chief Minister, allocated some new portfolios to the Chief Minister and to two Ministers.

“As per a notification issued by the Chief Secretary, the portfolios of the CID, and the departments of Personnel and Training and of Raj Bhawan Affairs have been allocated to the Chief Minister, in addition to his existing portfolios, with immediate effect,” said the statement.

The Elections portfolio has been allocated to Transport Minister Mool Chand Sharma, while Art and Cultural Affairs, hitherto with Mr. Sharma, has now been given to Education Minister Kanwar Pal, in addition to their existing portfolios.

Mr. Vij had pointed fingers at the functioning of the CID and sought an explanation from a senior officer for not responding to his queries.

Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar said in light of the ruling, the Assembly Speaker should decide on the party’s petition, seeking disqualification of the 10 MLAs, without any further delay.

In a path-breaking ruling on Tuesday, the SC said Parliament should “rethink” whether the Speaker of a House should continue to have powers to disqualify lawmakers as such a functionary “belongs to a particular political party“.

242,2020/01/23,"Goa CM proposes private sector hiring via govt. body, faces flak","Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said his government is looking at the possibility of recruitments in private sector through the State-run Human Resource Development Corporation.

However, the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) and the opposition Congress have reacted sharply to it, saying they are against any such plan.

Addressing a gathering in his Assembly segment Sankhalim recently, Mr. Sawant said, “In the next Budget, we want to provide job security to our State’s youth. We are contemplating whether recruitments in private sector could be done through the Goa Human Resource Development Corporation.”

“If we can recruit them through the corporation, we will be able to create 10,000 more employment opportunities (in private sector) for youth,” the BJP leader said.

Mr. Sawant also said it is not possible for all unemployed youth to get jobs in the government sector, due to which the State government is looking at private industries.

The government’s plan has, however, not gone down well with key industry players in the coastal State.

“If there is any such move, we would oppose it. We are, in principle, not for any such decision,” GCCI president Manoj Caculo said.

Some industry players feel they should have a free environment for the growth of the economy.

“Political interference in recruitments in the industry would be detrimental to growth,” a Goa-based industrialist said on condition of anonymity.

‘No political interference’

Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar also criticised the government’s plan, saying there should be no political interference in private sector recruitments as it involves the sentiments of investors.

He said the “competency and quality” of workforce selected by the State-run body could also be questionable.

“In several government jobs, political interference has overpowered talent. A similar situation should not be there in the private sector also,” Mr. Chodankar said.

“The youth will be frustrated (with this plan). The government can (rather) implement the plan to reserve 80% jobs in private industries for locals based on merit, so that youth do not get frustrated and brain drain is stopped,” the Congress leader said.

He claimed the industrial estates in Goa were still struggling to have a decent infrastructure in place.

“Issues like power and water supply are plaguing the industrial estates. With this move, I am sure the industries will not even have proper manpower,” Mr. Chodankar said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3b2frx/article30631002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMPRAMODSAWANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/goa-cm-proposes-private-sector-hiring-via-govt-body-faces-flak/article30631003.ece

Addressing the meeting, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik urged the airline operators to improve connectivity with Odisha by citing the growth story of the State. The meeting was also attended by senior officials of the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Mr. Patnaik said that Odisha has witnessed rapid growth over the years and made its foothold strong in many areas, including mining, manufacturing, tourism, culture, sports, education and IT.

In last few years, the aviation traffic in Odisha has seen immense growth. Though the domestic flight connectivity has seen a noticeable improvement, there is greater scope for international connectivity, Mr. Patnaik added.

Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation P.S. Kharola said aviation is the new engine of economic growth. While there was 17% growth in aviation nationally, Bhubaneswar had seen 29% cumulative growth, he said.

Joint Secretary of Civil Aviation Usha Padhee made a presentation on UDAN scheme and said Bhubaneswar will be provided viability gap funding under the scheme. She also highlighted the efforts to improve different airstrips of Odisha.

244,2020/01/23,Over 900 booked for anti-CAA protests in U.P.’s Etawah,"A case was lodged against more than 900 persons, including 150-200 women, in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah district for protesting on the road against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, police said on Wednesday.

A case for violating Section 144, which prohibits assembly of more than four persons, was lodged against 12 named persons,

150-200 unidentified women and 600-700 unidentified men, the district police said.

The FIR was lodged even as videos of the incident showed police personnel chasing and pushing the women into narrow lanes and using the cane on them. The police action created much outrage on social media as users shared the videos of the lathicharge.

The protestors apparently wanted to emulate the protests held in other places like Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and Lucknow's Hussainabad Clocktower, where women are staging a sit-in against the CAA.

Etawah police said on January 21, around 150-200 women and children holding the national flag and other posters were raising slogans against the NRC and the CAA on the route to Pachraha near the Red Cross Society office.

Police and administration then reached the spot and tried to convince the protestors to vacate the road citing Section 144.

""Then, a crowd of 600-700 youths and middle aged men gathered and tried to block the road due to which vehicles including an ambulance were stuck in jam,"" police said.

After this the SP (City) and the City Magistrate reached the spot to convince the protestors, but ""someone from the crowd pelted two-three stones"" at the police and administration team, the police alleged in a statement.

Despite several warnings to the protestors they didn't move from the spot, following which ""light force"" was used to disperse the protestors from the spot, police said.

Nobody was injured in the police action, Etawah police said, adding that the women sitting on the road were sent to their homes by the women police personnel.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/over-900-booked-for-anti-caa-protests-in-ups-etawah/article30628780.ece
245,2020/01/23,Amarinder sends Sukhbir copy of ‘Mein Kampf’,"Amid their ongoing verbal spat over the CAA, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh (in picture) on Wednesday sent the Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal a copy of Mein Kampf, advising him to read Adolf Hitler’s autobiography to understand the dangerous implications of the Act. Capt. Amarinder said it was important for the SAD leaders to read the book before coming out with irrational reactions on CAA.

“The recent statements of various Akali leaders, including Mr. Sukhbir, clearly exposed their ignorance on this sensitive issue with grave repercussions for the nation,” said Capt. Amarinder.

“Supporting the Bill in both houses of Parliament and in the Vidhan Sabha and opposing it on other platforms is unbecoming of a political leader,” the Chief Minister said in a letter sent to Mr. Sukhbir along with the book.

In the letter, Capt. Amarinder recalled that, during the last Vidhan Sabha session, he had promised to send the SAD copies of Mein Kampf, which in English translates as My Struggles.

“These were his (Hitler’s) beliefs which he sold to the German people in his rise to power, which later became his government’s policy, when his Nazi party assumed office,” wrote the Chief Minister. “Apart from destroying Germany in World War 2, to fulfil his territorial ambition, from the time he assumed office in 1933 to the end of the war in 1945, his purification of the German race by his ethnic cleansing, led initially to the removal of his main opposition, the communist parties, followed by persecution of the intellectuals, and finally to the extermination of the Jews.”

“Read the book, as one always learns from history. The world has changed and our television and other media are powerful, and certainly different to that of Germany in the thirties under Joseph Goebbels. Nevertheless, the talk of camps and a national register to eliminate the Muslim and Jewish communities is ominous,” Capt. Amarinder further wrote, adding that while some of the political parties, including the Congress, were protesting everyday along with universities across the country, “it is time now that others, too, join this movement.”

Hitting out at the SAD president in a statement, Capt. Amarinder said Mr. Sukhbir should clarify his and his party’s stand on the CAA, considering their outrageously contradictory statements on the issue over the past several days. “First they support the CAA wholeheartedly in Parliament, then some of them (Akali leaders) say they want Muslims in the CAA (why they did not say so in Parliament is beyond comprehension), then one of their leaders says they won’t fight Delhi polls because they are not ready to review their stand on CAA. But nobody knows what their stand on the CAA really is,” quipped the Chief Minister.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stulp/article30628681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22KRAAMARINDERSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-sends-sukhbir-copy-of-mein-kampf/article30628682.ece
246,2020/01/23,"Don’t scrap free power facility for farmers, Akali Dal cautions govt.","Ahead of the all-party meeting slated for January 23 to evolve a comprehensive strategy to tackle the critical water situation in Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday cautioned the State government against any move to discontinue the free power facility and impose electricity bills on the farmers under the pretext of falling water levels.

The Akali Dal’s core committee at its meeting under the chairmanship of president Sukhbir Badal said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should not do anything which violates the nationally and internationally accepted riparian principle and dilutes Punjab’s claim as the exclusive beneficiary of the entire water of the river flowing through the State.

“Punjab cannot accept anything that violates this principle according to which no State through which the rivers do not flow has any right on their water,” said a resolution passed at the meeting.

The party said in a statement the Akali Dal would participate in the meeting convened by the Chief Minister.

The SAD also urged the Chief Minister to convene a special session of the Assembly to declare that Punjab will accept no decision that violates the riparian principle.

The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded an extension in date of demand notices issued to the beneficiary farmers for tubewell connections.

247,2020/01/23,"No pay cut if govt. workers protest after duty hours, says Assam Finance Minister Himanta","Teachers and all other government employees who take part in protests against government policies after duty hours will not lose their pay, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said.

He said this at a meeting with the principals and heads of colleges across Assam in Guwahati on Wednesday.

“We cannot prevent anyone from protesting or expressing his or her concerns in a democracy. But that does not mean school, college teachers and all other government officers and employees can take to the streets during duty hours. They should not even meet Ministers during the time they have to give to work,” said Mr. Sarma, who is also the Education Minister.

“The pay cut will apply to all — from the clerk to the doctor if duty hours are used for other activities,” he added.

‘Easing burden’

Mr. Sarma also announced a scheme under which approximately 20,000 students living in hostels would be given ₹7,000 annually toward “easing the fiscal burden” on their parents.

“We estimated that a hostel boarder spends about ₹1,400 per month for 10 months, excluding two months of holidays. We want to bear 50% of this expenditure and hope to raise the amount to finally foot the entire bill,” he said.

He added that the money would be deposited in the bank account of each student and the college principals were called for the meeting to work out with the Finance Department how to disburse the same. “We intend to deposit the amount before February 10,” he said.

The Sarbananda Sonowal-led government has been on a sop-giving spree after the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that left six people dead in Assam from December 12-14 last year.

249,2020/01/23,Maharashtra likely to set up SIT to probe ‘urban naxal’ cases,"Based on a letter from Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, the Maharashtra government will soon appoint a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to relook into cases against ‘urban naxals’ for an alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Sources in the Maharashtra Home Department said the NCP supremo drafted a two-page letter along with a dossier on January 10, detailing the possibility of “cooked up” charges against nine activists arrested by the Pune Police in connection with the violence in Bhima Koregaon. He also termed the police action as “wrong and vengeful”. The letter was received by the Home Department on January 10.

In the letter, Mr. Pawar has requested that the SIT be headed by a retired judge and must have in its scope review of testimonies, electronic evidence and other ‘fabricated’ facts levelled against the activists, who were, as per the Pune Police charge sheet, found in possession of a letter detailing an “assassination conspiracy” against Mr. Modi.

The reliability of the ‘conspiracy’ letter be also verified, while looking into the role of senior police officer in charge of the investigations, Mr. Pawar wrote. “This is as detailed a dossier as one could draft, and gives a feeling it has been prepared with the help of several experts. We have a letter from him [Sharad Pawar] received on January 10, demanding the government set up an SIT,” said a Home Ministry official.

Home Department sources said a review of the investigations into the Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima violence, will be held on Wednesday. An in principle approval to form an SIT will also be taken during the meet, senior officials said. “Tomorrow we are reviewing the investigations by the Pune Police. Not only will we find out where the investigation stands, We will also try and also find out what is going on in these cases. We have several representations in this regard,” Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said.

Violence between Dalits and Marathas broke out at Bhima Koregaon village near Pune on January 1, 2018, following an event called Elgar Parishad that was organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 between the East India Company and the Peshwa faction of the Maratha Confederacy.

Following the violence several activists connected to Parishad were arrested in August 2018, including Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao – accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). The Pune Police charge sheet also alleged that a letter recovered from one of those accused had revealed an “assassination conspiracy” against PM Narendra Modi.

The BJP has already said it will oppose any attempts to review cases against ‘supporters of the naxals’ in urban areas.

BJP leader and Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Dr. Mahendranath Pandey had recently hit out at Maharashtra government for attempting to withdraw cases related to the Bhima Koregaon violence and ‘urban naxals’ responsible for allegedly plotting against the Prime Minister.

“The BJP will oppose any polluted view while reviewing or withdrawing cases. The Narendra Modi government has worked on the naxal menace in the rural areas and reduced its to few districts from an earlier spree of over 300 districts,” Dr. Pandey had said adding even some persons in the urban areas with a ‘naxal mentality’ were controlled. “It is this control these naxalites in urban areas are opposed to since their livelihood is dependent on the urban naxal ecosystem.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-likely-to-set-up-sit-to-probe-urban-naxal-cases/article30629035.ece
250,2020/01/23,Top NDFB (S) leader joins peace process,"M. Batha alias Binod Mushahary, one of the two top leaders of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (Saoraigwra), came overground on Wednesday to join the peace process.

The NDFB (S), last of the factions of the outfit that waged an armed struggle for a sovereign homeland for the Bodo tribal people in Assam, had on January 16 signed an agreement with the Centre and the State governments for the cessation of operations. A formal surrender ceremony is scheduled on Thursday.

Batha, the deputy military chief of NDFB (S) wanted for the massacre of 80 Adivasis in December 2104, had eluded capture along with the outfit’s military chief G. Bidai alias Bishnu Goyari.

The Assam police expect Bidai, believed to be hiding along the Assam-Bhutan border, to be a part of the peace process soon.

On Wednesday, Batha reached Gossaigaon town in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district. His emergence along with some of his cadres was as dramatic as his disappearance a few years ago.

251,2020/01/23,Finance Minister being kept out of Budget loop: Prithviraj Chavan,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and not Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has scripted this year’s Union Budget, senior Congressman and former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said on Wednesday. Mr. Chavan said a series of pre-Budget meetings have been held in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and Ms. Sitharaman was not kept in the loop regarding these.

“There is a lot of politics going on over the forthcoming Budget. There were 13 pre-Budget meetings held in the PMO and it is surprising that the Finance Minister was not invited to these meetings,” said Mr. Chavan. It was strange, he said, that Ms. Sitharaman was not present at a meeting of top industrialists with the PM, and Home Minister Amit Shah. “Does it indicate a lack of confidence in her [Ms. Sitharaman] on the Prime Minister’s part? If so, she should be asked to demit office. If the PM is not happy with her performance, she ought to be replaced… This manoeuvring is bound to demoralise the Finance Ministry,” said Mr. Chavan.

Mr. Chavan also said while traditionally, the entire budgetary process took place in the Finance Ministry under the guidance of the Finance Minister, this time round, the Prime Minister had taken control. “This is unprecedented in the country’s history. This time, the Finance Minister will merely be reading out the Budget speech, but the actual Budget will be conceived by the PM… Looking at the dismal economic condition, there is not much to expect from the Budget,” he said.

Given that the country’s gross domestic product growth had slumped to 4.5%, Mr. Chavan said Mr. Modi’s projection of a $5 trillion economy by 2024 was “a pipe dream”. “It is impossible to achieve that at the country’s present and dismal growth rate. Unless we grow at 8% or 10% each year, it is pointless to talk about it,” he said.

Hitting out at the Modi government’s hollow electoral promises of fighting the scourge of black money, he said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government had not taken any action on this count.

“Even Pakistan has investigated the Panama Papers scam, which resulted in former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s resignation… the case also resulted in the premier of Iceland [Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson] stepping down, but there have been no such investigations on the part of the Modi government to retrieve black money or bring economic offenders to book,” Mr. Chavan said.

252,2020/01/23,Uddhav Thackeray to visit Ayodhya,"While the Bharatiya Janata Party is stepping up its attack on Shiv Sena for forgetting it’s Hindutva ideology, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ayodhya on completion of 100 days in power in March. This announcement was made by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Twitter.

Since forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Congress and NCP, Shiv Sena has faced criticism from its opponents who have accused the party of forgetting Hindutva ideology. The MVA’s Common Minimum Program also made no mention of contentious issues such as Ayodhya or Sena’s demand to give Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar. The criticism reached its peak when Sena voted in favour of Citizenship Amendment Act in Lok Sabha but later abstained in Rajya Sabha.

On Wednesday, Mr. Raut tweeted, “Chalo Ayodhya. CM Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ayodhya on the completion of 100 days in power… The government has started work with full force, it will definitely complete five years by blessings of Lord Ram. With Lord Ram’s blessings, Uddhavji will decide on future direction of work.”

Mr. Raut also told news agency ANI, “We want that our alliance leaders should also come along. Rahul Gandhi also visits several temples.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uddhav-thackeray-to-visit-ayodhya/article30628874.ece
253,2020/01/23,'Tanhaji' declared tax-free in Maharashtra,"The Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to make Ajay Devgn-starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior tax-free.

“The proposal for exempting the film from entertainment tax was approved in the Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said an official.

The decision was cleared, however, after intense discussion at the meeting. “The decision will not be implemented with retrospective effect, but from the time the government decision is published. The state GST on the film’s ticket will not be charged from the audience but the theatre will pay that amount which will be reimbursed to it from the day of announcement of the decision till April 30, 2020,” said a minister.

Congress party has in the past raised a demand to make Tanhaji and the Deepika Padukone-starer Chhapak tax-free in Maharashtra. According to sources, Congress minister Aslam Shaikh raised the issue at Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting also. “However it was not strongly pushed forward. No decision on this has been taken,” said the minister.

Tanhaji ïs based on Chhatrapati Shivaji’s trusted lieutenant Tanaji Malusare, who played a pivotal role in capturing the Kondana fort, now known as Sinhagad Fort located near Pune. It is said to have crossed the ₹150 crore mark in earnings since it its release on January 10.

Reacting to the Cabinet decision, Ajay Devgn tweeted, “Thank you Uddhav Thackeray ji for declaring “TanhajiTheUnsungWarrior tax-free in the state of Maharashtra. @OfficeofUT @CMOMaharashtra”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1v1wb4/article30628775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMCMTANHAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tanhaji-declared-tax-free-in-maharashtra/article30628776.ece
254,2020/01/23,The enchanting web of Astad Deboo,"At a time when most of the dance community is silent on the growing intolerance in society, Astad Deboo unequivocally chooses right from wrong. “I have never been an artist of the government,” he says. Recently, at MICA (Mudra Institute of Communications), Ahmedabad, Deboo dedicated his evening to the students and faculty of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Everybody was surprised that I would make a statement like that. I am a Parsi but I was born and brought up in India. I am very much a part of it, as is anyone else. A friend once asked me, what is it to you, how does it matter to you? I said that I am a Hindustani first,” says Deboo. “Unfortunately, dancers have never been vocal. In my own way, I try to speak,” he adds.

Tribute to the Mahatma

Deboo is never circumspect. Even with his choreographies, it is his decision whether to make you feel unsettled, provoke or make you laugh for that matter. His recent performance in Delhi, “Unbroken Unbowed”, organised by Rasaja Foundation, rendered a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.

One of Gandhiji’s quotes read, “I have been very disappointed with educated people”. “It stands so true to the times we live in,” says Deboo. The work took on four quotes by Mahatma Gandhi, and interpolated them with music. “It also is a statement on my own life. I was not accepted as a dancer in the beginning, but I think my resolution to not break and bow has gotten me where I am today,” he avers. Deboo went back to his favourite Dhrupad with singer Amelia Cuni’s work. Further, he used compositions by Italian composer Alio Die, Koto player Satsuki Odamura, and the Fado (a music genre of Portugal) singer Amina Alaoui. A special piece was also composed for the production by Dom Bufford.

Deboo was accompanied by six other dancers for the 68-minute-long performance. An integral part of his dancing journey has been Deboo’s iconic costumes. What began with a unitard soon gave way to flared dhotis and long, layered angrakhas.

For “Unbroken Unbowed”, renowned designer Sandhya Raman designed the costumes for Deboo. Says Sandhya, “Astad himself was the inspiration for me. He brings out the calmness in anybody. For this production, I used khadi. It was very important to me. It has to look minimal and yet powerful. I also did a silhouette, to make it look different followed by a layering. Khadi is the fabric of the soul, and using it for performing arts is a statement.” Deboo’s dance displayed his signature stillness, interspersed with his subtle bhava and hand gestures. With Deboo in the centre, the dancers, Shamsul, Rohit Varma, Narayan Sharma, Govind Godiyal, Pradeep Kumar, and Vicky Yadav rendered neatly synchronised performances; often moving like a unit yet never sabotaging their individuality.

Making of the master

Sometime in the early 1950s, the six-year-old Deboo was sent to learn Kathak. At 20 something, after watching the Murray Louis Dance Company, he decided to board a cargo ship with a backpack to explore dance. He sat on a dock, next to goats and sheep, and set sail to study, know and understand this decision. Today, at 72, he sits gracefully across the table to talk about the dance he has defined. There is a remarkable consciousness with which Deboo has carried himself out through decades of dancing and his artistic recognition is only one kind of testimony to it.

Through the scrupulous use of the techniques he learnt in Kathak, Kathakali, and contemporary dance, Deboo’s choreographies have seamlessly displayed his creativity. He says that whenever he takes from another culture, it has to complement his work.

In “Asylum”, which first premiered in 1983, he depicted a madman who fell in love with the edge of his foot. “That part of the foot is his child, his lover,” says Deboo. He further evolved an entire sequence with the toe. The edge of the foot plays a crucial role in Kathakali. In “Insomnia” (1984), he worked with his dear friend and theatre artiste Sunil Shanbag. “Sunil was there with me since the beginning of my journey, when he was a young protégé of Satyadev Dubey,” says Deboo.

“Insomia” traced the character’s flashbacks, his steps towards success, evil and eventual downfall. One of his remarkable choreographies is “Mangalore Street” where Deboo deployed speech for the very first time in his work. “In 1981, Pina (Bausch) had invited me to Wuppertal. After having spent a year, when I came back, the East West Dance Encounter was being organised by Max Muller Bhavan. Pina’s work also juxtaposed dance and theatre. I thought, being a contemporary dancer, one has the freedom of expressing oneself. Sunil wrote the dialogues for the piece.”

In “Mangalore Street”, Deboo skilfully depicted a street in Mumbai through the life of his character Joglekar. As he reminisces “Mangalore Street”, Deboo gives us samples of the voice modulations of Joglekar, Alyque Padamsee, a chaiwala, and a sex worker – all characters of “Mangalore Street”. He even breaks into singing “Main hoon Don”. “It was a part of the sequence too. Whenever I repeated it, I have used whatever film was the current hit. At that time it was ‘Don’,” chuckles Deboo.

He says each choreography meant a different challenge and the people always remember him for the unexpected. “Even though ‘Chewing Gum’ was a three-minute piece, it has stayed with many because it was unique, and often funny,” he says.

At the Clarke School for the Deaf, Deboo worked with eight girls who were trained in Bharatanatyam, creating a choreography of 60 minutes on Navarasas, rendering 75 performances including the opening of the Deaflympics in Melbourne. “Since they were trained in Bharatanatyam, I could get them to count in fours, sevens and nines. For the others I used the count of eight,” he adds.

Often, Deboo has taken to some of the most unconventional spaces for his work, like the museum, the street, even the Great Wall of China. To withdraw dance from the proscenium and take it to these locations means changing the conversation between the dancer and the viewer. “Dance has always been seen in an auditorium. When you take the dance outside of it, space speaks. The space comes alive. The space itself becomes a part of the performance,” says Deboo.

Apart from his training in Kathak, the twirls have an anecdotal story in the discotheques of Mexico. “Oh! I was a great disco person,” laughs Deboo. “It was while spinning and twirling at the disco, one night, that I realised how much I could.”

At the crux, the constantly evolving spins, twirls, and bends of his body have rendered the space and the dance itself timeless. For the viewer, it often becomes about viewing these conversations Deboo has with his body, space and time, often entering a continuum. He says, “My work is minimal. I am like the spider that catches you into his web.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/cboqao/article30635042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7X3A5067,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-enchanting-web-of-astad-deboo/article30635043.ece
255,2020/01/23,Jonathan Hollander: ‘India is our favourite port of call’,"St. Andrews Auditorium, Bandra, was near full on a working week day with art enthusiasts travelling from distant suburbs to watch the performance of Jonathan Hollander’s Battery Dance Company, New York. Evam was hosted by Rasabodhi Art Foundation, spearheaded by young dance practitioner Keerthana Ravi.

‘Observatory’ by South African choreographer Theo Ndindwa was the opening sequence, which was a seamless spectacle of solo skills, synchronised duet and and pulsating group formations. The artistes moved fluidly, in linear and circular patterns, carrying or climbing on another partner, doing somersaults, gliding, flying, rolling on the stage, punctuated with silent pauses. Each was nimble and athletic, the supple body lending itself challenging movements and stretches.

The Mallari in Bharatanatyam mode — music by Rakesh from Mysore, choreographed and presented solo by Unnath Hassan Rathnaraju — was based on episodes from the Vishnupurana. ‘Gajendra Moksham’ was graphically delineated. The light effect made a great impact, especially in the Govardhan episode. Recorded sounds of lashing rain and cries of frightened birds seeking shelter heightened the effect.

Unnath’s stage presence, his silhouettes set against the white backdrop and lucid expressions enhanced the presentation. He did not wear the anklets and the sporadic bell sounds in the pre-recorded music did not match at times. Having engaged in a creative residency with Battery Dance Company, Unnath, as expressed by Hollander, helped “find the ineffable space between two art forms.”

“Watch and find your own story,” announced Hollander before the India premier of ‘The Red Line,’ choreographed by Tadej Brdnik. The haunting score by Syrian-American composer Kinan Azmeh provided the “spell-binding intrigue” that permeates this dramatic work by the next-generation of Battery Dance choreographers. The seamless steps of the dancers, gliding and pacing with the long red fabric flowing, trailing and folding, underscored that art indeed knows no boundaries. The spacious stage became a creative canvas with the dancers using their bodies to paint fascinating and appealing configurations.

‘Shakti: A Return to the Source’ with women taking the lead, was a fitting finale to the seven-city India tour of the Company. Sculptural duets formed the central piece of the work. Sonorous music by Rajan and Sajan Mishra in Raag Durga lifted the performance. Hollander conceived this music in 1992, when he was a lecturer at M.S. University in Vadodara. For the 40th Anniversary of Battery Dance Company, Hollander choreographed the piece deploying sophisticated rhythms. Unnath, featured as a guest artiste in Shakti, during the genesis of the choreography, has toured with the company ever since.

“We are a globe-trotting dance company that has electrified audiences in 70 countries to date. India is our favourite port of call with appearances in 17 cities, demonstrating that East and West can come together through dynamic, thought-provoking and visually arresting dance,” said Hollander. “Besides performances, screening the film ‘Moving Stories’ in Mumbai was a great joy,” he added.

As a teenager, he lived in Mumbai in 1968 with the family of Siddharth and Nirupama Mehta, studied painting and music with Dinesh Shah at the New Era School. His first encounter with classical Indian dance was when he witnessed the exquisite Manipuri dance by the Jhaveri Sisters andgGuru Parvati Kumar training Sucheta Bhide Chapekar. At the end of the show Hollander had the privilege of embracing the legendary Darshana Jhaveri, a regular at Mumbai dance events.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/81eost/article30634314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24frEvam1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/jonathan-hollander-india-is-our-favourite-port-of-call/article30634318.ece
256,2020/01/23,Refined dance-theatre experience,"‘...Sleep shall evade me for the last time tonight, for tomorrow I go to the battlefield to slay Bhishma!’

Thus went the introduction of Shikhandi in ‘Samavesha’, an exploration of third gender personalities from the Mahabharata, Amba- Shikhandi and Brihannala by N. Srikanth and Aswathy. ‘Samavesha’ was not all rhetoric, just the introductions. It was a two-part solo dance drama, where drama dominated, and going away from convention, the dancers used easily understood mukhaja and angika abhinaya, facial expressions and body language, rather than the traditional mudras or the gestural language. As the dancers are talented dramatists, ‘Samavesha,’ came across as a non-indulgent, accessible and refined dance-theatre experience. This venture was a departure from the usual and the artists need to be appreciated for exploring possibilities.

Aswathy’s Amba-Shikhandi was a combination of Mohiniyattom and theatre. The long story was intelligently presented. She did not waste time with the details of the story; she relied on symbolic references to the incidents, using her clear and sharp expressions to tell the tale.

Mohiniyattom lent itself easily to abhinaya; there was one instance where a swara segment with slow steps was used during Amba’s sorrowful reaction to King Salva’s rejection. The dancer’s ready tears added intensity to the mood.

The concept of the third gender came to the fore when Amba is reborn as Shikhandini. She is brought up as a boy, and not realising her identity gets married to a woman. When they discover her gender, she is shamed and runs away. Her despair as regards her identity brought the issue to the fore, but it was for a brief moment. As a portrayal of Amba-Shikhandi, Aswathy’s delineation was commendable, but as a theme-based production, it was not enough.

Intelligently, Aswathy used only one raga, Sarasangi (Bijeesh Krishna), but it was cleverly adapted to different moods — from the sad moments when Salva rejects Amba, to the shame of Shikhandini, and to the revenge and anger within Shikhandi. Padams from the Kathakali attakatha ‘Amba’ by Malayalam poet Olappamanna were used; additional lyrics were by Vyloppilly Narayanankutty. Aswathy’s costume and hair, in grey and white and an unusual top knot with side-swept hair, was an interesting attempt at being diferent.

Srikanth’s Brhannala with Sanskrit verses from Vyasa’s Mahabharatha, Malayalam lyrics from Irayiamman Thambi’s Kathakali play ‘Utharaswayamwaram’ and music by Hariprasad Kaniyal, was all about the protagonist’s state of mind. Arjuna had been cursed to live the life of a eunuch for a year by the celestial dancer Urvashi for having rejected her advances; he spends the year as Brhannala teaching dance to Princess Uthara in King Virata’s palace.

It maybe interesting to note that ‘eunuch’ referred to in the West is somewhat different to the third gender, more specifically ‘hijra’ connotation, in South Asia. Arjuna endured the travails of a male hiding within a female body, and this is what Srikanth explored. There was hardly any narrative to fall back on, but Srikanth, as an experienced hereditary artiste in the Melattur Bhagavatamela dance drama tradition, was able to portray the role with ease. He was dressed as a female dancer, accessorised from head to toe; his entry was dramatic — with his back turned to the audience he started dancing with one-handed mudras, before turning around dramatically, to loud applause. Dancing gracefully in a swara segment in Nagaswaravali, talamalika, Srikanth embodied a female dancing body, with occasional strong stamps the only give-away. The student session overlaps into a jathi and he emulates a lady dance teacher in an interestingly visualised scene.

His role was comparable to tight-rope walking. Externally he had to emulate a woman, but while speaking of internal feelings, he had to revert to being a man. Though stree-vesham is his speciality, this switching could not have been easy.

He collapses crying at his predicament in a beautiful Mukhari ‘Deivame aha..’, breaking down and falling as a woman, but speaking as Arjuna when he talks about the uselessness of the Gandiva bow. He is tortured by thoughts of what others will think of him when they find out and this was handled most sensitively, as was the romantic scene with Draupadi in the famous Kathakali padam, ‘Tharithen mozhi’ (Bhairavi). As the year was to end, Arjuna takes on a manly countenance and prepares to be a charioteer for Prince Uttara Kumara, when suddenly someone walks in and he reverts to the coy woman in a split second, ending the dramatization on that high note.

His presentation did explore the pain of an identity crisis, though his natural grace as a dancer seemed to blur the lines of male or female on occasion. It was a brave effort to come to the sabhas with stree-vesham, something Srikanth has kept separate from his Bharatanatyam career all along.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/9foxps/article30633943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FRSAMAVESH5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/refined-dance-theatre-experience/article30633944.ece
257,2020/01/23,Janaki Rangarajan’s portrayals needed depth,"Dancer Janaki Rangarajan sitting under a spotlight, beautifully portrayed the intimacy between Radha and Krishna, capturing the mood of the Ashtapadi ‘Kuru Yadu Nandana’ in raga Behag for her performance at the Music Academy dance festival.

Janaki began the evening performance with a saptatala, ragamalika jathiswaram composed by Ponniah Pillai. The elaborate composition was danced with vigorous nritta patterns that showcased her fine footwork.

The varnam chosen, ‘Saamike naatho intha jalamedhara’, also a composition of Ponniah had some interesting visualisation of Lord Brihadeeshwara, along with sancharis of birds and moonlight torturing the nayika .

The twists and turns in her body movements during the nritta segments have become an integral part of her style, but she needs to use them more judiciously. The depiction of Kamadeva’s bow at the end of each jathi was done imaginatively.

‘Samvaad-Hala Halam’ was a humorous take on a story of Siva. When the constant fight among Ganesha’s mooshika, Kartikeya's peacock, Siva’s snake and bull and Parvati's tiger intensifies and becomes unbearable, Siva drinks poison. With her experience, Janaki slipped easily into the various characters, but the presentation of the drama and tension, the focal point of this composition, lacked impact.

The concluding piece, Rabindranath Tagore’s verses, was not very impressive. The usual problem during Margazhi of voices getting affected due to the weather and hectic schedule was evident in Nandini Anand’s rendition. A gifted singer for dance, her voice was not in its best form.

258,2020/01/23,Ways of seeing beauty,"There is no shortfall in the varieties of Bharatantyam costume today. There are a plethora of designs and are available in various colours, material and type. Although costumes can broadly be categorised into three types -- ‘skirt costume’ that resembles the half sari, ‘sari costume’ that looks like kachche sari and the widely-used ‘pyjama costume’ with intricate and permanently pressed frills -- under each category there is so much scope for minor variations. As a result, there is immense ingenuity in costume designing now than ever before.

Over the last 100 years, Bharatantyam costume has come a long way. Traditionally, silk sari was either tied in a regular fashion or as a kachche. “The idea of the stitched costume came during the early 20th century when Rukimini Devi Arundale wanted to bring the temple art on to the proscenium,” informs senior Bharatantyam dancer and actor, Sridhar. It was also the time when Bharatantyam dancers were making their entries into films and “this demanded dance costumes to be easily manageable and at the same time attractive,” mentions Bharatanatyam artiste, Shubha Dhananjay.

“Earlier, there were just two or three colour combinations, such as, white-red and yellow-green. One could not experiment with more colours as it had to work in contrast to the dark blue backdrop of the stage. But with advancement in lighting and stage design in the last two decades, costumes of all colours are being tried out,” observes Shubha. In her opinion, there is immense awareness about costume designing among dancers today and everybody has developed their own style. But as far as the material is concerned dancers resort to pure silks -- either Kanchivaram or Mysore silk. “There are a few rules of aesthetics when it comes to each classical dance and these can never change with time,” she says, adding, although synthetic material is being used in costumes that can be hired.

The costume of male dancers resembled female dancers in the early stages of their entry into dance. “This is because historically men were not performers, but only nattuvanars. So the first generation wore whatever women donned at that time. I remember my seniors wearing the pyjama costume with the same jewellery as that of women,” recalls Sridhar. But later, because of a series of discussions on the subject in Kalakshetra to which school Sridhar belongs, a consensus was reached. He informs, it was decided that male dancers rather than going for a stitched costume, should try out tying sari as a kachche. “It was also to keep male costume simpler than that of the female, as the regular attire of men in the society had also turned unembellished by then,” he adds. When compared to wearing a stitched costume, tying the dhoti not only feels comfortable but also provides greater scope for creativity, he says.

How has costuming impacted art when so much of focus, preparation and deliberations has gone into it? “Aharya, the abhinaya through costume, jewellery and make-up, enhances look and mood for the performance,” feels Apurvi, a disciple of Shubharani Bolar.

“If aharya helps in creating good impression in the minds of the audience in the beginning itself, why shouldn’t it be taken advantage of? It should not be perceived as something negative,” responds Shubha Dhananjay. “It’s all fine as long as it it doesn’t overshadow the performance. The danger is dancers overdo and tend to go by the trend. But what they should check before putting on something is whether it suits their body-type, complexion, height, facial feature and age,” advises Bharatanatyam guru B. Bhanumathi.

Most of the students for their arangetrams stitch at least two costumes nowadays. Apurvi had also stitched two costumes for her arangetram recently, one for the first-half and the other, in blue and green, for the second part. “This practice is followed in the case of arangetrams because the dancers sweat profusely by the first-half and are not used to handling the same costume for long durations. Also, as there would be guest honouring ceremony in between, we don’t mind having a costume change. However, this should not become the norm in all recitals,” cautions Sridhar, adding, senior dancers including himself and his dancer-wife Anuradha never change costumes in between items.

On changing costumes during the performance, dance historian, Ashish Mohan Khokar remarks: “Devadasis and ranis in those days also used to have two to three costume changes but this used to happen in a totally different context.” They changed their costume according to the time of the puja, rituals of the temple, or if the royalty gifted them some ornaments or textile. “Also, please remember, these were not two-hour performances but long drawn affairs,” explains Khokar, distinguishing them from today’s urge to change costumes for the sake of immediate attention.

What is prompting dancers to go overboard with their aharya? In dancer and scholar Padmaja Suresh’s opinion, the art is increasingly getting diluted by the influence of virtual media. “In the virtual world only visibility and noise seem to matter. True devotion and hard work for excellence naturally are taking back seat,” she observes. For budding danseuse, Suhasini Koulagi, it’s the larger consumerism which is making dancers go grand.

B. Bhanumathi too says it’s to please the masses. “Audience who are not connoisseurs get excited with the grandiose and acrobatics. If dance is just that, then what is the difference between dance and circus?” she asks with a pinch of sarcasm.

For Sridhar, all kinds of dancers exist today. “There are always those for whom their art comes before everything else, there are also those for whom glamour is all that is. It all depends on the individual. Dance reflects one’s inner self,” he adds.

“The problem with dancers is they think ‘they’ are dancing on stage. They must forget themselves once they are on stage. It is the art that audience take back with them,” Bhanumathi stresses. In the words of researcher Jayachandran Surendran, “costume has to be forgotten by the audience in order to experience true art.”

What happens if dance is dominated by aharya? “The audience clap and forget it then and there. It becomes like any other entertainment we have today. But the purpose of art is to create experience of the rasa and in turn, long lasting memory. Therefore, satvika forms the crux of any classical dance,” explains Bhanumati.

For Ashish Khokar, one cannot change the public taste. “The culture should emanate from the guru. If parents are rich and the guru is greedy, arangetrams become mini weddings. Unfortunately, today we have teachers not gurus,” he complains.

On the brighter side, Sridhar comments: “At the same time, we are witnessing practice saris and dhotis not only in lecture demonstrations but also in performances. Cotton has its own aesthetic appeal. From these developments we can infer that this generation is beginning to realise that it is sadhana alone that makes them better dancers, not appearance, privilege or influence.” Sridhar feels, developments in dance -- which includes costumes -- are always a reflection of the transformation in societal consciousness.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/xlzlr9/article30632944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGFLAKSHMIPARTHASARATHYBHARATHANATYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/ways-of-seeing-beauty/article30632948.ece
259,2020/01/23,"Art out of wood, cotton and banana fibre","Multi-chambered teak jewel box with secret locks, neem wood water bottles and jars, and baskets and purses woven out of banana fibre steal the show at Poompuhar.

The retail arm of Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation, Poompuhar, has organised a handicraft expo at its outlet on Big Bazaar Street till February 8.

As many as 15 artisans, almost all of them from Tamil Nadu, have displayed their products. The exhibits include cotton sarees and garments, metal works, wooden toys, wooden bowls, spoons and trays, and marble figurines. Apart from these are two sets of products that stand out: jewel boxes, tumblers, jars, water bottles, and the traditional padi made out of teak or need wood, and purses, bags, baskets and cushions made out of banana fibre.

For 26-year-old S. Sathish Kumar from Chennai, working with wood is not new as he is from a family of carpenters. Following an accident, he wanted to be self-reliant but did not want to get into the regular carpentry work. Hence, two years ago, he started working on different kinds of products, basically out of neem wood and teak. Today he has a range priced between ₹200 and ₹10,000. “I want the common man to use wooden products. If the right kind of wood is selected and processed properly, it has healing properties and the products can be used to store food items,” he says. Mr. Kumar has worked on some of the jewel boxes for nearly two months, designing multiple chambers and secret locks so that the boxes occupy a place of pride at home.

The other set of products made out of banana fibre are woven by artisans trained at Melakal, Madurai. The first set completed the training, conducted by the Handicrafts Development Corporation, just before Pongal. They have made hand bags, purses, hats, cushions, fruit and flower baskets - all out of banana fibre. “The plan is to display the products that these artisans make after the training at all the Poompuhar outlets,” says R. Narendra Bose, manager of the Poompuhar showroom here. These are all utility products, he points out.

Mr. Bose is hopeful of a total of ₹10 lakh sale during the 16-day expo here.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/w19jj4/article30637229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB24-WOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/art-out-of-wood-cotton-and-banana-fibre/article30637231.ece

266,2020/01/23,Exempt NCLP students from public examinations: NGO,"With board examinations becoming mandatory for students of Classes V and VIII, a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) that runs Special Training Centres (STC) under the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) has sought exemption for the students as it fears that it will result in dropouts.

To rehabilitate rescued child workers in the age group of 9 to 14 years, 15 centres, run by four NGOs, were functioning with 308 students at Bargur, Anthiyur, Gundri, Talavadi, Hasanur and Sathyamangalam.

Monitored by District Project Societies, the students are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal and after two-years of training, they are main-streamed into the formal education system. The Child Labour Division of the Ministry of Labour and Employment provides ₹ 400 as stipend to the children every month by way of depositing it in the child’s bank account.

To get books, uniforms and other freebies provided by the State Government, they are admitted in the nearby schools, but continue to study at the centres run by the NGOs.

A recent order asking the NGOs to prepare the students in such centres for the board examinations to ensure 100% result has shocked them. They say that the students, who are not used to the school atmosphere, should be exempted from the exams.

S.C. Natraj, director of Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR), an NGO that runs seven NCLP schools in the hills, says that due to family circumstances, the children turn up as workers. After rescuing them, they are provided with vocational training. Their names just figure in the attendance registrar in schools, but they will not attend classes there.

“The centres provide bridge education after which they are admitted to various classes based on their age,” he said. He wanted them exempted from the board exams.

“Most of the centres function in remote hill areas that has poor roads and the students need to travel to the nearby schools to write exams. It will be very difficult for them. Forcing them to write the exams may result in them dropping out,” he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/5dyu44/article30637011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA24NCLP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/exempt-nclp-students-from-public-examinations-ngo/article30637012.ece

275,2020/01/23,Corporation draws up Rs. 175 cr. plan for UGD service to excluded areas,"Coimbatore Corporation is drawing a plan for around ₹ 175 crore to provide underground drainage (UGD) service to areas that it had excluded while executing UGD project more than nine years ago under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme.

With Central Government fund the Corporation started the UGD project in 2009 at ₹ 373 crore with the objective of laying nearly 600 km pipeline, constructing three sewage treatment plants and providing the service to over 1.80 lakh houses and other establishments.

During the execution, the Corporation had excluded a few areas in and around Avinashi Road like Pappanaickenpalayam, parts of Ganapathy, and Ganapathy Housing Unit.The Corporation officials said one of the reasons for the exclusion was that the areas were unapproved layouts. The other was that the areas had fewer houses.

Now, 10 years after it prepared the detailed project report for the UGD project, it was time to revisit the project as the areas were either regularised or the number of houses had increased. Therefore, to extend the UGD service to those areas the Corporation had undertaken a survey.

Its initial guess was that it would have to lay pipelines for around 100 km, provide house service connections and then connect the pipelines to existing sewer lines to convey the sewage to one of the three sewage treatment plants.

Only after the survey was over, the Corporation could prepare the detailed project report and thereafter discuss ways to mobilise funds for the project.

At present, the Corporation was focussed on completing the Nanjundapuram sewage treatment plant, lay the main sewer line on Trichy Road to convey sewage to the Ondipudur plant and provide house service connections in areas that the two treatment plants serviced, the officials added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/a1v1vz/article30628257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB23UGD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-draws-up-rs-175-cr-plan-for-ugd-service-to-excluded-areas/article30628258.ece
276,2020/01/23,"Mill roads before re-laying, consumer body urges municipal department","Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC) has urged the Municipal Administration and Water Supply, Rural Development and Highways departments to compulsorily mill and then relay roads to prevent increase in height.

In a notice to the Municipal administration, the consumer body's Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said the road laying agencies not resorting to milling the surface to relay roads that resulted in the increase in height of road surface by a foot or two.

As a result, buildings, mostly residential, went from being above to on a level with and then below road surface.

As a consequence, occupants of the buildings had to face a plethora of problems, the consumer body said and pointed out inundation of such buildings even after a drizzle to underscore its point.

Elaborating further, it said the run off water from road surface entered such buildings due to the difference in height.

To prevent the flooding, the occupants were forced to construct the ramps in such a way that the run off water did not flow in.

Another problem that cropped up with the construction of such ramps was that driving out cars over the ramps using heavy acceleration often led to accidents as the road users were often caught unaware of vehicles suddenly entering roads and at great speed.

The officials in the road laying agencies, however, seemed to be oblivious to such difficulties the occupants faced, it said and quipped that they seemed to be more interested in completing the project to move on to the next.

Lack of awareness among the officials on the ground was one of the reasons for such apathy as they seemed to be unaware of the Madras High Court’s observation in writ petition 4913 of 2018 and WMP 6059 of 2018: “The indiscriminate repair and relaying of roads without scrapping the existing roads has led to considerable increase in height of the roads, which, in turn, causes accumulation of water in nearby houses, with plinth level lower than the surface of the road. This causes inconvenience to house owners, who cannot be expected to raise the height of the plinth of their houses every time the roads are relaid.”

The departments would therefore do well to instruct all officials to mill and then relay roads.

And, if they failed to do so, it would be forced to knock the doors of the Court, it added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/itz4f0/article30628236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB23RELAYINGROADS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mill-roads-before-re-laying-consumer-body-urges-municipal-department/article30628237.ece

For all category contractors, the Government is demanding a capability certificate to be issued by a bank, which is mandatory to renew licences. The contractors have to pay ₹20,000 to ₹50,000 for the certificate, he said.

Mr. Abdulla said the Government used to give a bonus of 1% to contractors for completing the work on time. The Government stopped the bonus and instead started charging fine for non-completion of projects, despite the fact that most of the works during the last two years had been delayed due to the floods.

279,2020/01/23,Six students injured in accident in Delhi,"Six students were injured after a cluster bus collided with a school bus in west Delhi’s Naraina area on Thursday morning.

According to Delhi Fire Services (DFS), a call was received at 7.10 a.m. regarding a road accident. A team rushed to the spot but the injured were rescued and shifted to a hospital by locals.

“There were 27 children and a teacher of Salwan Public School of Rajinder Nagar in the bus when the incident happened. The school bus was taking a U-turn when the cluster bus coming from the other side rammed into it,” said a police officer.

In the accident, six children were injured but are safe now. They were taken to Kapoor Nursing Home in Naraina and four students had been discharged. The other two will also be discharged soon, said the officer.

AUD cited the model code of conduct for Delhi elections for denial of permission, said Left-backed SFI, which had organised the event.

Mr. Karat ended up addressing the students while standing outside the university gate surrounded by police.

The Students’ Federation Of India had sought permission for the talk but the AUD denied it.

“AUD denied permission for a meeting on CAA on the pretext that there is a model code of conduct in place. The MCC is related to elections and campaign and nothing to do with a seminar inside a university.

281,2020/01/23,"5,000 more Shaheen Baghs in next 10 days: Azad","In the next 10 days, there will be 5,000 more protest sites like Shaheen Bagh across the country, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said on Wednesday evening as he reached the iconic demonstration spot in south Delhi to extend his support to the women protesting against the citizenship law and the NRC.

Addressing a massive gathering, the Dalit leader said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a “black law” that is dividing people along religious lines.

“I congratulate those who have participated in this protest. This is not just a political agitation. We have to save the Constitution and unity of the nation,” he told the women who have been staging a sit-in against the CAA for more than a month now.

Mr. Azad said even the record-breaking cold has not been able to break the will power of the women. “Till now, we had heard of Jallianwala Bagh. Now, the entire world has heard of Shaheen Bagh,” he added.

The protesters, singing Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Urdu poem Hum Dekhenge before Mr. Azad’s arrival, got charged as he reached the venue.

Holding the Constitution, he said: “I promise you that in the next few days there will be at least 5,000 Shaheen Baghs across the country”.

His visit to the protest site comes a day after a Delhi court modified the conditions imposed on him while granting him bail. He was arrested last month for giving “inflammatory speeches” during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid.

Earlier in the day, BJP MP Vijay Goel had termed the ongoing protests against the Act a “security threat” and those who were a part of it as being “misled”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ndpryc/article30629174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23AZADNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5000-more-shaheen-baghs-in-next-10-days-azad/article30629177.ece
282,2020/01/23,"Submit action-taken report on Jamia violence, court tells police","A Delhi court on Wednesday ordered the city police to submit an action-taken report on Jamia Millia Islamia’s (JMI) plea seeking registration of FIR against alleged police attack on students on the campus during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last month.

Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal sought the report from the Station House Officer of Jamia Nagar police station by March 16, the next date of hearing.

The police has to submit whether it has taken any action on the complaint by the varsity administration to lodge an FIR or not.

The petition filed by the Registrar of JMI claimed that despite repeated complaints to the police by the university administration to lodge an FIR against the alleged police attack, no action has been taken till date.

It claimed that policemen had “illegally” entered the campus on December 15, 2019, when the students were protesting “peacefully” against the newly amended law and attacked students with tear gas shells besides lathi-charging and open firing at them.

It has also sought registration of FIR under various IPC sections and relevant provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

“Police officials have committed serious offences... and State should be held accountable for such illegal and unlawful acts and excessive/unnecessary force used by the police officials against the innocent protesting students,” the plea said.

“Complainant [Registrar] is constrained to approach this court against Delhi Police officials for illegally breaking into the campus of the university without seeking any permission from the competent authorities and unlawfully attacking innocent students of the university with tear gas shells, lathi-charging and open firing and also for vandalising government property belonging to the university,” it said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7ehrdi/article30629136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23JAMIA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/submit-action-taken-report-on-jamia-violence-court-tells-police/article30629137.ece
283,2020/01/23,Students allege state suppression in U.P.,"Students from up to 30 universities who undertook “fact finding” missions in 15 cities in Uttar Pradesh, from where incidents of police crackdown on anti-CAA protesters were reported, alleged that a pattern of “communalised “state suppression” had emerged, leaving many, including victims, afraid to speak out.

Videos collected by students, who visited cities such as Kanpur, Firozabad, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Lucknow, Varanasi, Bijnor, Aligarh and others showed victims alleging atrocities committed by the police, including theft from houses, unrestrained lathi charges and several cases of bullet injuries. While the police had admitted to some instances of firing, the students alleged at a press conference here on Wednesday that firing had taken place at multiple spots.

In Meerut, for instance, Tiriti Raza, a student of Delhi School of Social Work, said interviews with the victims and their families revealed that people who were not part of any protests were targeted and the police allegedly fired bullets above the waist level, marks of which could be seen on walls in Meerut.

In Muzaffarnagar, Ananya, a DU student, alleged that the police, along with local BJP leaders, had incited violence among peaceful protesters. Videos played by the team showed persons in plain clothes along with police personnel throwing stones at protesters in alleyways. Following the crackdown, Ms. Ananya said, several people were being intimidated with FIRs allegedly filed against thousands of unnamed persons. Injured people were scared to go to the hospital to get treatment fearing they will be targeted by the police, she said.

Students also reported multiple cases of juveniles being targeted and thrashed. In Muzzafarnagar, Ms. Ananya said, a 13-year-old boy was reportedly arrested and taken to jail, where he, along with others of his age, were made to chant “Jai Shree Ram”. Similarly in Badhaun, Deepak Singh, a student of BHU, said that at least 18 cases had been registered against a 12-year-old boy. Mr. Singh, who also visited Gorakpur and Mau, said that targeted raids were undertaken in these areas, with police allegedly barging into people’s homes without female police officers and beating up women. In Mau, he alleged that a prominent member of the Muslim community, who had been brought to pacify the protesters, was later targeted and made a prime suspect.

Students relayed similar stories of alleged police atrocities in Bijnor, Firozabad where authorities allegedly entered Muslim colonies without provocation and indiscriminately beat up people. In Bijnor Jail, Azhar, a student of IIMC, said that individuals were stripped and beaten up and “Islamaphobic” slurs were hurled at them.

Students slammed the State administration for carrying out “targeted” violence on specific communities that were “underprivileged” through the police and with the help of local media. They said that a narrative had been set by the police and the government and was being supported by local, especially Hindi media, to paint those injured as “rioters”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ebzr1h/article30629061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23LATHIUP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-allege-state-suppression-in-up/article30629062.ece

The seizure happened around 9 p.m. when a police team along with the vigilance staff of the Election Commission intercepted a vehicle bearing U.P. registration number near Ajmeri Gate.

Upon inspection, the police found a bag containing ₹1 crore in cash in denominations of ₹2,000 and ₹500.

“The driver of the vehicle, Azad Singh, as well as the cash and the car were brought to the Kamla Market police station,” the officer said, adding that the owner of the vehicle, Aditya Aggarwal, a resident of Agra, was informed about the seizure and also reached the police station.

The police said that Mr. Aggarwal owns a business in Agra and the money was going from Chandni Chowk to Agra.

285,2020/01/23,NGT seeks DDA reply on setting up authority on Yamuna cleaning,"The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday sought a report from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) regarding constitution of a Work Front Management Authority, under the aegis of the urban planning body, to curb pollution on the Yamuna floodplains.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel sought a response from the DDA on a suggestion by the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) for setting up an authority to curb pollution of the floodplains.

A technical advisory group had earlier emphasised the need for riverfront development and suggested that the riverbed be developed as a biodiversity park with three zones. “Current status of the functioning of the Yamuna River Development Authority is not known. The YMC has suggested that a new mechanism may be developed under the aegis of the DDA to deal with all relevant issues relating to the riverfront,” the Bench noted.

Sewage problem

Additionally, based on suggestions put forth by the monitoring committee, the green panel also sought a response from the Delhi Chief Secretary, the civic bodies, the PWD and other agencies on whether management of all drains in the Capital can be handed over to a single agency.

In its report, the YMC stated: “With overlapping responsibility, unwillingness to confront sewage in stormwater drains or to recognise that it spreads unsanitary conditions and poses public health hazards... in effect the three civic bodies ignore the problem and the Delhi Jal Board says it has little role to play in the matter. The ownership and responsibility for sewage in stormwater drains has to be owned if projects for containment of sewage, done through external agencies, are to succeed.”

The green panel also directed Haryana to take remedial action to curb direct discharge of untreated sewage into the river.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ujdgb2/article30528482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-NGT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngt-seeks-dda-reply-on-setting-up-authority-on-yamuna-cleaning/article30628931.ece

287,2020/01/23,"Kejriwal, most AAP Ministers report hike in assets","Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s moveable assets have increased from ₹2.26 lakh in 2015 to ₹9.95 lakh as reported in his affidavit filed on Tuesday.

A comparison of 2015 and 2020 affidavits of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Ministers show that most of them have recorded an increase in value of assets and a few have had criminal cases registered against them in the past five years.

Mr. Kejriwal’s immovable assets have increased from ₹92 lakh to ₹1.77 crore. His wife, Sunita Kejriwal’s moveable assets have increased from ₹15.28 lakh to ₹57 lakh. An AAP spokesperson said the increase was due to the ₹32 lakh she received from the Indian Revenue Service on account of early retirement.

The number of cases against Mr. Kejriwal have increased from seven to 13, which include eight cases of defamation, two cases in connection with the 2014 poll campaign, and one case each of assault, criminal intimidation and violation of the model code of conduct.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s movable assets remained roughly the same, the reported approximate value of his immovable assets increased from ₹12 lakh to ₹21 lakh. His wife, Seema Sisodia, had reported in 2015 immovable assets worth ₹20 lakh in the form of a property in Panday Nagar purchased in 2008. In the 2020 affidavit, she reportedly has a property in Mayur Vihar Phase-2 worth ₹65 lakh, purchased in 2018.

In 2015, Mr. Sisodia reported he had six cases pending against him. In the latest affidavit, he has three pending cases against him, which include two cases of criminal defamation and one case of allegedly assaulting a civil servant.

Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan has reported an increase in value of moveable assets from ₹1.7 lakh to ₹3.7 lakh. In 2015, he had reported a disputed property with a market value of ₹65,000 per square yard; in the 2020 affidavit he has declared immovable assets worth ₹2.7 crore. Mr. Khan has also reported at least nine pending cases against him, which include three cases of alleged physical assault and threatening, one case of attempted culpable homicide, one case of alleged land grabbing, one case of alleged financial irregularities and illegal recruitment in the Waqf Board, one case of assault and use of criminal force to deter a civil servant, one case of “threatening to withdraw a case” and one case of merciless beating and snatching of printed material.

Health Minister Satyendra Jain’s moveable assets decreased from ₹62.3 lakh to ₹26.5 lakh. His wife, Poonam Jain, saw an increase in moveable assets from ₹86.3 lakh to ₹1.49 crore. Mr. Jain also reported tax dues worth ₹13 crore, which are disputed. He has two cases filed against him: one for disproportionate assets, which has been registered by the CBI; and an allegation pertaining to criminal misconduct.

Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot has declared movable assets worth ₹8.09 crore, as opposed to ₹61.3 lakh declared in 2015. His immovable assets have increased from ₹17.38 crore to ₹25 crore. Assets worth over ₹10 crore have been declared by his wife Moushumi Gahlot. Apart from other family vehicles, Mr. Gahlot, who pursued LLM from Delhi University’s Faculty of Law, owns a Fortuner and a Mercedes.

Development Minister Gopal Rai has declared movable assets worth ₹23.86 lakh this time; in 2015, it was ₹2.17 lakh. Value of his immovable assets increased from ₹45 lakh to ₹58 lakh. Mr. Rai, who is contesting from Babarpur, has a criminal case pending against him.

Minister of Social Welfare Rajendra Pal Gautam has declared immovable assets worth ₹66 lakh; it was zero in 2015. His wife has declared immovable assets worth ₹76 lakh, up from ₹25 lakh in 2015.

288,2020/01/23,Minimal political interference in protests most beneficial: Durgesh Pathak,"Minimal political interference in public protests is usually the best course of action, said Durgesh Pathak — the youngest member of the Aam Aadmi Party’s Political Affairs Committee, the party’s highest decision-making body — during an interview with The Hindu.

Mr. Pathak, who is fighting the upcoming Assembly elections from Karawal Nagar, when asked why AAP is not protesting on the ground against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or the violence in Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: “Many times, in public protests, it is beneficial if there is not too much political interference... In the Anna Hazare movement also, we did not allow any political party on stage. If that had happened, then the gravity of the matter would have been lost... We are supporting [the protests] and our leaders are also going there and we will be there whenever needed.”

Mr. Pathak, who was in-charge of AAP’s campaign in 35 of the 70 constituencies in the 2015 elections, also talked about the people who had left the party, and how AAP had evolved over the past seven years.

“People move out for different reasons... for ambition.. or they feel something is theirs and when they do not get it they feel angry. People who left AAP for the second reason did not keep country and society first, but kept the individual first,” he said.

On allegations by those who had left the party that there was no internal democracy in AAP, he said: “When they kept getting things from the party, there was internal democracy, and when they stopped getting it, there was no internal democracy. This cannot be the definition of internal democracy.”

Mr. Pathak added that in the last seven years, the party had become more patient and mature. “Earlier, we used to react to everything. Now, we do things with more thought and discussion. Since we are in power, we know that we can do a lot of things. Not just ending corruption, but we can also make a good State,” he said.

Eye on other States

The AAP leader added that the party will be open to the idea of contesting elections in other States after the Delhi elections. No top leader of the party had gone to campaign in the Assembly election in Haryana.

He said that former AAP MLA from Karawal Nagar, Kapil Mishra, who turned a rebel after the first two years, had affected the constituency in a “big way”.

Mr. Mishra was disqualified from the Delhi Assembly in August 2019. He was suspended from the party in May 2017 and since then has been openly critical of the party, though he remained an MLA till he was disqualified.

“This constituency was with the BJP for about 15 years when the Congress was ruling Delhi, even when we came to power, Mr. Mishra was with us for only 18 months. Because of this, the area is very backward. You will not find a big hospital, park or school here. The roads and sewer lines are broken,” he said, adding that he has been working for the development of the area for the last eight months and coordinating with the government to get basic projects started.

“Water was an issue... so, one underground water reservoir will be opened this month. My focus was on basic things such as roads and water. Now, I will focus on setting up an industrial area and developing the Yamuna front near Signature Bridge,” he said. Mr. Pathak also attacked the BJP and said that the party’s candidate “works only for a particular religion or caste... whereas I am all inclusive”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jh9dk5/article30628661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DEPATHAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/little-political-interference-in-protests-most-beneficial-pathak/article30628662.ece
289,2020/01/23,‘Local boy’ Raghav Chadha lays out plans for constituency,"In the run-up to the Delhi Assembly polls, AAP candidate from Rajinder Nagar, Raghav Chadha, kicked off his campaign with a public meeting in the constituency on Wednesday.

Reminding the people that he is a “local candidate”, Mr. Chadha made multiple references on how he had grown up in the area and “played cricket” in the same park where he was addressing the residents and sought votes as their bhai aur beta.

When asked about how the strategy for the upcoming polls will differ, Mr. Chadha, who had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from the South Delhi constituency, said the voting pattern differs for each poll.

“There is a huge difference between the two elections as the voting pattern is different. For Lok Sabha, people were asking “Modi versus who?” However, for this election, the question is “Kejriwal versus who?” People can make the distinction very easily,” Mr. Chadha told The Hindu.

While adding that he will come out with a manifesto for his constituency, Mr. Chadha said: “I have divided the constituency into seven pockets as each pocket has different problems. While Old Rajinder Nagar has parking issues, Pandav Nagar on the other hand has issues pertaining to sewage lines. The manifesto will help addressing it all.”

Several party volunteers and residents had gathered around the Sindhi Park for the public meeting which also saw senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia addressing the crowd.

Residents’ voices

Amarjeet Kaur Ahluwalia, a resident of the area for over 30 years said: “The Kejriwal government has ensured that we get free bus rides, mohalla clinics, toilets, electricity and so on. For all these years we tried out both the Congress and the BJP, but were not satisfied with their work. Now that we have Mr. Chadha as the candidate, we can only hope that he continues the good work as he is educated.”

Thirty five-year-old Sarita Devi, a domestic help who works in the area said: “It is Kejriwal who will be back. For people like us, who have limited means and large families to sustain, whatever bit we save is a huge amount.”

In his address to the crowd, Mr. Chadha also said that if the Kejriwal-government is voted back to power, each family “will save up to ₹8,000 per month” due to the several policies rolled out by the AAP government.

However, I.M. Bhatia, a retired person living in the vicinity for close to seven decades, was not convinced by the “idea of freebies.”

“They have done work in the education and health sectors but this indiscriminate distribution of freebies is not good. We ourselves were refugees but we paid for every penny. Also, one should stop the appeasement policies for particular sections,” Mr. Bhatia said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/f4nwf9/article30628647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL23-RAGHAVCHADHAAE2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/local-boy-chaddha-lays-out-plans-for-constituency/article30628648.ece

Mr. Chopra alleged that Delhiites would not forgive Mr. Kejriwal for remaining a mute witness to the police assaults on students of Jamia Millia Islamia and attacks on students of JNU. “Students are the future of the country and if Mr. Kejriwal could not ensure their safety and security, then he has failed in his duty as the Chief Minister of Delhi,” Mr. Chopra said.

The Delhi Congress chief said that AAP has been claiming that it had improved security for women but Mr. Kejriwal was silent when women students were being beaten up. “Students, girls and women feel unsafe in Delhi as the Kejriwal government has woefully failed to protect them and such a government should not be in power,” Mr. Chopra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/74-candidates-against-cm-shows-his-failure-chopra/article30628576.ece

Of the total number of candidates, 842 are male and 187 are female. A total of 1.47 crore voters, including 81 lakh male voters, are registered to exercise their franchise on February 8.

Speaking about the postal ballot services to PwD voters and senior citizens, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ranbir Singh said that about 3,000-4,000 such applications had been received.

Such voters will not have to cast their vote at polling booths and instead a mobile polling team will help them cast their ballot.

To facilitate PwD voters, who have not registered for the postal ballot facility, the CEO said that pick-up and drop-off arrangements are being made.

Among other measures, the CEO said PwD staff will man at least one polling booth in each of the 11 districts. Other measures to facilitate voting include issuing of digital voter slips in the form of QR codes that can be scanned at 11 polling booths.

Vulnerable booths

In terms of ensuring law and order, the CEO said that up to 17 vulnerable booths have been identified and preventive action taken against 13 people in this regard.

Commenting on the ongoing sit-in protests at Shaheen Bagh, Special Commissioner of Police (Election) Praveen Ranjan said that they have conducted inspections to ascertain the threat level in the area, but found nothing.

292,2020/01/23,‘Only 30% of agricultural produce bought at MSP’,"Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy has assured that since the Centre was purchasing only 30% of agricultural produce at minimum support price (MSP) from farmers, the State government will procure the balance stocks at MSP even though it will have to bear an additional burden of ₹ 1,000 crore per annum.

Middlemen purchased the stocks at cheaper rates in neighbouring States where MSP was not assured and sold the same at MSP in Telangana illegally, Mr. Reddy said and appealed to agricultural market committee employees to check the practice in a bid to see that the revenue of treasury was not dented.

The Minister was speaking after releasing the New Year diary and calender of the agricultural market committee employees union affiliated to Telangana Non-Gazetted Officers Association. He said it was likely that the government will launch integrated agricultural markets across the State on the lines of the existing ones at Siddipet and Gajwel.

The government considers farmer central to its governance. Keeping this in view, it took several pro-farmer steps, he said. Crop, crop production, marketing, processing and cooperation activities were brought under a single umbrella. If the experiment works well, Telangana will become a role model in agriculture in the country

Mr. Reddy recalled that the agricultural market yards presented a deserted look without stocks prior to formation of Telangana. Now, markets had sprung up even on highways to purchase material.

TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy in a statement here alleged that the BJP government is trying to privatise the public sector banks through FSDR Bill so as to benefit a few corporates by granting them access to the hard earned money of common depositors.

He said of the nearly ₹ 130 lakh crore deposits, about ₹ 81 lakh crore are with public sector banks and approximately 68% of deposits belong to senior citizens.

“With the introduction of FSDR Bill and constitution of a new Resolution Corporation (RC) to monitor the health of financial firms like banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will lose its regulatory powers on banks,” he said. He claimed that the Resolution Corporation might terminate the contract depositors sign with a bank and they might lose their deposits fully or partially. “It will also have powers to write off debts of select few powerful corporates,” he said.

Originally, the BJP government had introduced Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017, which was later dropped due to a controversial ‘bail-in’ clause. However, now the same bill is being introduced with some modifications which are more dangerous than the original FRDI Bill, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/exljxn/article30637402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24REDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/new-fsdr-bill-will-hit-small-depositors-in-banks-congress/article30637170.ece
294,2020/01/23,Coal extraction at SCCL Saini block soon,"A team of officials of Singareni Collieries Company Limited, which visited Saini coal block in Angul district of Odisha, which was allotted to the company by the Coal Ministry, was informed that extraction at the block would start shortly and that production would commence by end of 2021.

This was told by the general manager of the block C.H. Vijaya Rao to SCCL Director (Projects and Planning) B. Bhaskar Rao, Director (Finance) N. Balaram and other senior officials of the company from finance, IT, environment and estates wings during their visit to coal blocks on Wednesday and Thursday.

About 100 lakh tonnes of coal would be produced at Saini block if optimum production is achieved. The survey and drilling works were completed, he said.

Patrapada coal block

The directors also visited New Patrapada coal block nearby where 1,040 million tonnes of coal reserves were estimated.

They spoke to the residents and assured that the company will develop basic amenities for them. They inspected the welfare activities of the company in nearby villages.

Mr. Bhaskar Rao and Mr. Balaram said SCCL chairman and managing director N. Sridhar was instrumental in achieving New Patrapada block for the company with help from the State government. The block will provide a golden future for the company.

All permissions for New Patrpada block would be completed by the time production starts in Saini block.

Plans were made for production of 200 lakh tonnes of coal from New Patrapada in three years, the SCCL stated in a press release.

PowerPoint presentation

Earlier, the Singareni team took part in a meeting with a Rajya Sabha committee on environment protection initiatives by industry at Bhubaneswar.

295,2020/01/23,High Court to decide on permission to rally,"Justice T. Vinod Kumar of Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the government to confirm on Friday if permission was granted to a rally and demonstration being organised at Charminar on Saturday midnight.

The judge was hearing a writ petition filed by a businessman seeking a direction to police not to permit the demonstration at Charminar protesting Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) by United Muslim Action Committee (UMAC) and the Majlis-e-Ithehadul Muslimeen (MIM). The government counsel told the court that no permission was granted yet to the proposed meeting but he would inform the court after verifying with the authorities. The petitioner’s counsel recalled that the organisers violated rules during a similar rally taken out on January 10 in the city. The government counsel said the police department was geared up to tackle any situation.

Land issue

In another case, some plot owners of Bhagyanagar Housing Society brought to the notice of the HC that the state government was acting against the stand taken by its own top officials. The counsel of the plot owners told a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy that the State’s Special Chief Secretary (Revenue) earlier filed an affidavit stating that the society land cannot be registered in favour of third parties.

Now, the government was contending that the said land be registered in favour of third parties, the counsel said. The petition was related to a dispute between two parties over a land of 119 acres situated between Kukatpally and Hitec City area and valued at ₹6,000 crore.

296,2020/01/23,Cross-border ganja racket busted,"The Mahabubnagar district police busted a cross-border ganja smuggling racket and apprehended four persons accused of being involved in transporting the narcotic from Sileru in Andhra Pradesh to Sri Lanka.

Usually, they transported ganja from Sileru to Visakhapatnam and from there to Madurai where it was loaded for Sri Lanka. This time, however, they chose the Telanga route to smuggle the narcotic.

The accused were identified as P Sathish (36), a resident of Madurai, K Kalyan (33), a resident of Dastagir Nagar, M Ajith (23), a resident of Theni in Tamil Nadu, and G Surendran (19), a resident of Chandrayanagutta. Four other accused are absconding.

According to the police, Sathish, Kalyan, Sivaneswaran, an accused who is absconding, and Ajith loaded 180 kg of the contraband worth ₹21 lakh in 98 packets into a car. However, on their way, Surendran who was driving the car, crashed it into a truck.

The driver fled the spot, and Ajith allegedly tried to move the contraband. Then, the truck driver noticed the ganja and informed the police who apprehended the accused.

After questioning, it was revealed that Sathish and Kalyan used to transport ganja after procuring it from co-accused Ramu and Murthy at Sileru.

They would then sell it at a higher price to Jayachandran in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cross-border-ganja-racket-busted/article30637086.ece
297,2020/01/23,52 rescued from illegal old-age home,"The police rescued as many as 52 inmates of an old-age home which was being run illegally. The inmates, some of them undergoing psychiatric treatment, were leading a pathetic life as they were crammed into a two-bedroom house, police said.

The Keesara police said there were teenagers among the inmates of the Mamatha Old Age Home being run in the Nagaram area. The old age home did not have the required permissions, Keesara inspector J Narender Goud said.

He said proper care was not being given to inmates and those in need of psychiatric treatment were being taken to the Institute of Mental Health, Erragadda, once in a fortnight.

“They were keeping psychiatric patients with senior citizens and those addicted to alcohol. Some of the inmates were tied with chains. They were also being beaten. There is only one bathroom for 52 persons. We are in the process of moving the inmates out,” Mr Goud said.

The police booked a case under Sections 406, 420,324 and 342 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 24 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, against the organisers of the home and family members of inmates.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/52-rescued-from-illegal-old-age-home/article30637070.ece
298,2020/01/23,Hyderabad property show from Jan. 31,"The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI) announced, on Thursday, the ninth edition of “Hyderabad Property Show”, to be held from January 31 to February 2 at Hitex in Madhapur. Over 15,000 types of residential and commercial properties would be displayed in about 80 stalls during the show.

Municipal Administration & Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao will inaugurate the three-day event and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar will be participating in the valedictory function, where he is expected to explain about the latest initiatives in the implementation of the TS Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA), said president P. Rama Krishna Rao, general secretary V. Rajasekhar Reddy and treasurer Aditya Gowra, at a press conference.

“We are holding the event for the ninth successive year and it will have developers, building material manufacturers and financial institutions from across the city, all under one roof to present the latest advances in the real estate sector. We will be showcasing the best properties in integrated townships, apartment complexes, gated communities, villas, green buildings, retail and commercial complexes,” they said.

What makes the show different from other property exhibitions is it comes with the CREDAI credibility mark as only its member developers are permitted to participate. There are going to be panel discussions in relevant topics on all the three days, they explained.

“Hyderabad has been showing consistent growth over the last five years and the government has been proactive in transformation of making it the most attractive investment destination. We are expecting more reforms like speedier building clearances similar to TS i-Pass for industries. Environment clearances have become faster and the Government is also expected to announce sops to attract developers towards the east side of the city,” said Mr. Rao.

Mr. Reddy claimed that the countrywide slowdown has not affected Hyderabad as demand has been steady and indications are that it is likely to remain so for both office and residential spaces. “We have very low unsold inventory of just about one per cent of our overall production and we expect only rental price correction in the future,” he said. Upcoming growth areas are Patancheru, Kollur, Bachupally and Chandanagar even though the west side continues to be the preferred location for investments, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uu8ba9/article30637931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-SHOW-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-property-show-from-jan-31/article30637014.ece
299,2020/01/23,‘Firms opting instant online solution’,"Organisations are moving away from traditional services to new-age services as people look for instant online solution. This is where growth is happening in organisations to enable their customers access instant services, says Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and CEO of Greyhound Research.

Mr. Gogia, who delivered a keynote address at the HYSEA Biz Summit 2020 here on Thursday, said that the new growth in IT services was in new verticals like Fintech, payment wallets, new services and new regions, due to expansion of broadband and mobile phones every where.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Gogia said that the concept of ‘Distributed Future not just Digital’ was gaining traction because different societies, regions and cities have different types of assets and challenges.

“We cannot have one vision of future for all cities to achieve different solutions. So the world is moving towards distributed future wherein there are multiple visions of future for different problems of different cities,” he said.

The ‘distributed future’ concept has huge stakes for India because of the scale, complexity of regions and languages. The biggest software in the world is first tested in India for the scale and complexity it offers. So it is test market for some of the world’s biggest problems, he said.

Elaborating he says Hyderabad has highways built towards Hitech City but the moment one reached Cyberabad, it gets congested. It is a unique problem for Hyderabad city requiring technology to manage speed and reduce accidents while it is not the problem for city like Mumbai which does not have such highways.

The market is brimming with opportunities with distributed computing, distributed ecosystems, distributed data and distributed experiences, he emphasises. Those leading the race of Distributed Environment are investing in Cloud, Open Source, Data, Application Programming Interface (APIs) and Artificial Intelligence, IoTs. People are moving from centralised cloud environment to decentralised cloud environment for faster service, he says.

Security and compliance is another huge problem and opportunity for growth. Globally, organisations and governments are now struggling to regulate the industries in a big way because of increasing frauds, money laundering, online theft and hacking of bank accounts.

Adopting to new age technologies by organisations with growing digitisation is a journey but it will not happen overnight. Yet there are clear signs that organisations are for investing money in the right places to modernise technology and offer new services to people.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/firms-opting-instant-online-solution/article30636260.ece

301,2020/01/23,Here’s what went down at ‘Born On Instagram’ in Hyderabad,"A midweek afternoon at Taj Krishna rarely sees hordes of influencers flooding into the fancy interiors, but in the case of Wednesday afternoon, a pilgrimage of popped collars, ball gowns, skinny jeans and blown-out hair made its way into the Emerald Hall for Hyderabad’s Born On Instagram initiative, a set of offline meet-ups for social media creators featuring reps from Facebook and Instagram under one roof. There are 15 cities in total planned for this initiative with Chandigarh being the inaugural site.

It seems appropriate that 2020 is the year Born On Instagram kicks off in the city, seeing as the platform was born 10 years ago.

By 1 pm, the room was packed with over 300 creators, some having travelled from Vijayawada and Bengaluru as they were not entirely sure when the event for their city would even be happening. Thank goodness, there were not a flood of ‘foodies’ but a range of artists, musicians, social activists and more — a direct reflection of Hyderabad’s creative community.

A public life

Before all of this, though, the morning session for the media saw a chat between Jahnavi Dasetty — Mahathalli, for many of you readers — and Manish Chopra, Facebook’s head of partnerships. She steered away from glamorising the platform and gave a realistic portrayal Social media, she admits, has changed almost all aspects of her life. “My mother does not call to ask me about my day as much as she used to,” she laughs at one point, “she just has to see my story!”

Does the actor feel the need for validation? “Yes!” she responds, explaining she is just as vulnerable to the pressures of social media... but she tacks on, “However, when that gets to me, I just put my phone aside.”

Ask her about the need to engage with her large following about responsible creation and online justice and she says, “Following [the sexual assault and murder which happened in Hyderabad], I felt, as a female creator, that I needed to say something. For a time after that happened, I was scared to walk my dogs at night for even a few minutes. So in these cases, where I feel I know enough to talk about a certain topic, I will say something, and that’s great on social media.”

Later that day, a panel with travel blogger Shagun Segan, pencil micro-artist Dheeraj Kolla and India’s Zumba ambassador Sucheta Pal delved into the journeys of creators and how they found their voices in an online crowd. While this panel won many applauses and notes of understanding, many creators in the audience could be overheard saying that there could have been more unconventional yet popular creators as well.

Karthik Abhiram, who runs Daily Movie Sketch on the platform, was very happy with the event, “For an old-timer on Instagram like me, it was great to hear tips directly from Instagram on how to leverage all the different modes of interaction on the platform and I would definitely apply these going forward. I loved the fact that Instagram got so many creators from different genres (photography, art, etc) for the event. For a creator, it’s such an awesome feeling when the platform itself acknowledges and recognises you.” The artist and techie adds that he particularly enjoyed the session on Instagram held by Roxanne Chinoy, creator partnerships at Facebook and Instagram, but he points out it would have been better rounded-off with a more in-depth approach or even a detailed Q&A session.

Head of HydInstaMeet Sugandh Rakha says it was a productive day of learning for not just the creators but for Facebook too.

Known for his daily chai posts, Zuvamart was one of the more quiet creators there, often observing and taking information in, rather than going all-out social. In a previous interview with MetroPlus, the photographer admitted he is on the reserved side, but at the event, he was more than happy to meet the faces behind the names on his social media timeline.

According to Ankit Rihal, who works in entertainment partnerships at Facebook, Born On Instagram is not just a one-off event, but there will be considerable work with the creators after the event, to help them make the most out of the platform and eventually monetise.

The most common request made of Instagram at the event is that Born On Instagram includes creators from Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns and villages, where TikTok is more popular. The presence of these creators would not just serve the tag of ‘inclusivity’ but also show Facebook and Instagram the truly diverse creation community in each region, though they claim to know about it.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/c4wlck/article30633831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy24-karthik-group,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/born-on-instagam-hyderabad-facebook-2020-manish-chopra-jahnavi-dasetty/article30633835.ece

303,2020/01/23,"Chased by GHMC squad, dog bit 30 people","A chase by the GHMC squad might have inadvertently resulted in more people being attacked by the dog, which had gone on a biting spree in the Central Zone of the city on Tuesday.

The dog injured at least 30 persons between Begumpet and Ameerpet before being beaten to death by locals.

As per the sequence of events by the GHMC’s veterinary section, several complaints were received by the Khairatabad zonal office about dog bite incidents at B.S. Makta around 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, upon which, a dog catcher squad was dispatched to the area.

Chased by the squad, the dog fled to Ameerpet, biting about 30 persons on the way, before being killed, officials informed.

The dog’s carcass has been recovered and sent to Veterinary Biological Research Institute for post-mortem and confirmation of rabies.

On Wednesday, a team headed by chief veterinary officer, GHMC, Venkateshwar Reddy, visited the area and the hospital where the dog bite victims are undergoing treatment.

The patients have been administered Anti-Rabies Vaccination (ARV) and TT injection, and advised to take follow-up vaccination on third, seventh, 14th and 28th day, besides booster dose on 90th day.

Sufficient quantities of ARV and rabies immunoglobulin injections are available at the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, and all the urban primary health centres.

Mr. Venkateshwar Reddy further informed that a special drive for Animal Birth Control and Anti-Rabies programme was being taken up in B.S. Makta area, from where most dog bite incidents were reported.

Under the programme, street dogs are caught from the GHMC limits and brought to animal care centres at Autonagar, Chudi Bazaar, Patel Nagar, KPHB Colony and Jeedimetla, where they are sterilised and given ARV. The dogs are then released in the same area from where they have been caught.

The veterinary section of GHMC has conducted 39,346 sterilisations and administered 62,139 ARVs this year.

Claiming that the dog bite cases reported at the IPM have come down, and no human Rabies deaths have been reported from GHMC limits in many years, the statement attributed the decrease to the ABC/AR programme’s success.

Further, the GHMC has also facilitated adoption of 2,998 street dogs under ‘Maa Inti Nestam’ initiative, the statement said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chased-by-ghmc-squad-dog-bit-30-people/article30628393.ece

I had lodged a complaint through GHMC portal about dumping of garbage and other waste at the open plot no. 90 adjacent to Daffodils Apartment located at plot no.89 on Road No. 2, Nethaji Nagar, more than once. I also highlighted the problem through this column, but no action was taken. Now all of a sudden, the municipal authorities have placed a garbage bin at the open plot bang in the middle of our apartment and another house.

Escalator, please

Travelling by metro rail is convenient with escalators provided at almost all the stations in convenient places. However, I wish to highlight an exception. The escalator at Parade Grounds station is not convenient to most passengers. To use it, one has to cross the heavy traffic bound road at Judges Quarters/ YMCA junction. It is difficult for senior citizens like me as well as for women and children to climb so many steps of the nearby staircase, so an escalator here will be of great help.

Red Cross Society has been supplying blood regularly to all government, military and railway hospitals in the State, she said.

Over one hundred IT officials who attended the meeting appreciated the Governor’s call and assured that they would definitely take up the issue with all interested employees considering it as corporate social responsibility.

307,2020/01/23,SCR ferries over 1 crore passengers in 10 days,"More than a crore passengers and revenue touching close to ₹130 crore in 10 days! This Sankranti/Pongal season, when scores of passengers clambered onto the trains to reach their respective destinations, South Central Railway (SCR) rewrote its own record books.

Between January 11 and 20, long distance trains carried as many as 91.3 lakh unreserved passengers, which is 2.4 lakh more compared to the same time last year, and the reserved passengers are likely to be about 16 lakh considering the carrying capacity of the 25 special trains which were run every day. Of those, 19 had reserved compartments, said senior officials.

Reservations can be made up to 120 days in advance for which around 14.5 lakh booked during this period. All this meant a record fare collection too —close to ₹130 crore of which the reserved category is likely to have contributed to the tune of ₹85 crore and unreserved category a little more than ₹45 crore.

SCR had announced 456 special trains between January 5 and 25 and within the above mentioned 10-day period, it operated 255 special trains out of which 65 Jansadharan specials were run between Secunderabad, Vijayawada, Kakinada, Rajahmundry, Nizamabad, Kurnool, Nanded, Aurangabad, Khammam, Vizianagaram to cater to the unreserved segment travelling at the eleventh hour, they explained.

To handle the heavy rush at the stations and inside trains, a vast majority of the 70,000 field personnel of the 1.05 lakh staff, including officers, were pressed into service, irrespective of the holidays and leave unless extremely necessary, to handle varied operations like ticketing, sanitation, engineering, electrical, mechanical, loco-pilots, gang men, security, etc.

“We had senior officials of different wings like commercial, security and operations at both the headquarters and divisions to look into managing the crowd to ensure a smooth and safe journey, that too on time,” said SCR Chief PRO Ch. Rakesh.

308,2020/01/23,Plan to insulate Arts College structures from protesters,"A stone ornamental candelabrum on the first landing of the steps at the Osmania University Arts College building broke into pieces during the recent spate of protests and meetings in the university.

“At 2 a.m. on January 1, our security guard discovered that the candelabrum had fallen to its right and the upper portion of the object was shattered. We left it like that for a few days and repaired it a week ago,” says college principal Dandeboina Ravinder.

The Arts College building which has become emblematic of Telangana has been turned into a site for hosting protests, meetings and anniversaries. “This is not the first time the candelabrum has been damaged. Two years earlier, a banner was strung to the candelabrum and it got knocked down but the damage was limited. But this time, there has been extensive damage,” says Linga Reddy, who oversees the upkeep of the building. Plastered and finished with cement, the sandstone candelabrum looks like painful dental work.

Ironically, two CCTV cameras mounted on either side of the entrance stopped functioning between 7 p.m. on December 31 and 7 p.m. on January 1. “We wanted to file a police complaint about the damage using the CCTV footage ad evidence, but the camera malfunctioned at the key time. We filed a complaint without that evidence,” says the principal.

Based on a design by Belgian architect Ernest Jasper, construction of the Arts College began on July 5, 1934, and was completed in 1939. “The geometrical proportions and scale of the lamps show the influence of Art Deco movement on the architects of that time. While the whole building is Moorish and Indo-Saracenic style, the lamps outside show the effect of the architectural movement which was a rage in the world between 1920s and 1950s,” says architect Srinivas Murthy, who has studied the building’s design and style.

Maintenance staff

“For a building that is nearly 90 years old, it is well maintained. It is clean and none the worse for wear, which is a rarity,” says Mr. Murthy. Incidentally, maintenance staff has shrunk from 23 in 2015 to eight now, affecting the upkeep. Inside the building, cement plaster has been used to fix seepage and damage to the stone structure, including the inner arches.

“We have an issue with seepage.

309,2020/01/23,Those boss nova vibes,"Growing up in a small town in Rio Grande, Brazil, Jim Porto was surrounded by music. His family couldn’t afford a piano, and he decided to learn on his own at a neighbour’s place. Bossa nova, meaning new wave, was the latest fad, blending traditional Brazilian samba sounds with American jazz.

Porto’s passion for bossa nova multiplied when he moved to Rio de Janeiro. He recalls, “The place breathed bossa nova. I decided that this would be my future.” He later moved to Rome, 40 years ago he got a month-long opportunity to play at the club Il Manuia. “That was a life-altering experience and my vision of music changed. I decided to settle there though I keep returning to Brazil to meet my family,” he says.

Desi connections

Now Mumbai is all set to get a taste of Porto’s sound when he performs in the city this weekend. While he will sing and play piano, his band will feature keyboards, trumpet, cello, drumkit and percussion. Porto has been visiting India often over the past two years. In 2018, he performed at the NCPA International Jazz Festival. He says, “On my first visit, I went to Goa. I was surprised by the way people there knew about and loved Brazilian music. Ditto with New Delhi.” Porto says that at his earlier show in Mumbai, he was happy to see the audience humming and clapping along. He adds, “Music is universal. Mumbai is very far from Brazil, but I feel the same vibe here. I had a similar experience when I first visited Rome. I sing in Portuguese but the Italians loved it.”

True to roots

His music, of course, stuck to the Brazilian style. His biggest influences included composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, and singers Joao Gilberto and Elis Regina. Later, he admired singer-guitarist Gilberto Gil, besides American jazz artistes Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, who used bossa nova flavours.

In the 1960s, the Tropicalia artistic movement was huge in Brazil, and that shaped several of Porto’s ideas and work. One of his career highlights was his collaboration with American jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. He recalls, “Chet was attending my gig in Rome. He offered to return the next day and he came with his trumpet and joined me.” The two later collaborated on the 1984 album Rio. Porto says, “Chet became a good friend and stayed with me for two months in Rome. I learnt a lot from him, in terms of composition and stage presentation.”

On this visit, Porto is keen to meet some Indian musicians. “If Rome was a new chapter for me in the late 1970s, India could be a new one now. My roots will remain Brazilian of course,” he asserts.

310,2020/01/23,Soumik Datta: Musical stopovers,"From popular classical musicians such as TM Krishna, Shujaat Khan, Bickram Ghosh and Jayanthi Kumaresh to Bollywood stalwarts like Kavita Krishnamurthy and Javed Akhtar; from traditional festivals and folk musicians to hip-hop producers, the upcoming travelogue, ‘Rhythms of India’ on BBC World News, traverses the diverse landscape of Indian music. The new television series, hosted by London-based musician, composer, and sarod player, Soumik Datta, is slated for its India première on January 25.

“It’s been an experience of a lifetime,” shares Datta after the nine-week shooting schedule. “I realised the unifying power of music when meeting folk musicians in rural Kerala or hip-hop artistes in the bristling-with-energy Mumbai.”

For Datta, the show is a journey that brought him back to his roots in India. “While on the move, I came across so many different kinds of musical genres. We keep talking about our country’s rich heritage; it’s truly overwehelming when you get to see it. I remembered being mesmerised by the singing of hymns by girls in an old church in Kerala.”

Honest account

The big challenge for the makers of the show was showcasing Indian music traditions with sensitivity and depth. Datta emphasises, “Quite early on in the series, the directorial team had discussed this and we decided not to turn this into a very rose-tinted vision of India. It should be an honest travelogue filled with contradictions, impartial to what we like and don’t like, and without any orientalism, in the way we show it.”

The first episode begins with an exploration of varied influences on Indian classical music, tracing its historical development. The eclectic influences on Indian music are brought out through the voices and ideas of musicians across genres. This premise frames the overall search for musical idioms within the series. “What does it mean —Indian music? The answer is as complex as the country itself. I want to dig into that and understand the country through its music with a sense of acceptance.”

Datta’s own foray into Indian music happened during his teenage years. The Kolkata-born musician had not trained in classical music during his childhood in India. It was only after moving to London with his family that his curiosity in the genre peaked. As a child, he was more attracted to rap and Bollywood. Facing a cultural shift in London, the youngster pined for a sound that would tie together his nostalgia and search for identity. “Away from India in a boarding school there, I began to miss my culture, friends and was searching for something to hold on to. The sound of the sarod became that anchor for me. When I plucked its strings, they seem to speak to me. It brought back memories and experiences of my childhood in India.”

Datta became a disciple of the legendary Pt Buddhadev Das Gupta, and would train with him during his vacations in India. He attempted to absorb as much as possible, returning and practising for the rest of the year. “ He taught with an incredible sense of passion but also the old-school discipline of a guru.”

Teaching process

He recalls the Sunday morning classes where the living room would be filled with students. “My guru would call out one person, who had to play in the centre of the room. There was a sense of competition, but also of community. We all learnt from what he was teaching others.” Datta fondly reminisces the long drives with his guru, where they would pick up the fish for dinner and stop for a bhutta (corn) on the street while revising a rhythmic pattern. “He was like a grandfather to me, I called him Dadu. He inspired me to make music a way of life.”

Crossover gigs

Back in London, Datta performed many crossover gigs with the likes of Beyonce and Jay-Z and also plugged into the British-Asian music community with icons like Nitin Sawhney, Talvin Singh, Akram Khan and Anoushka Shankar. In his recent EP, ‘Jangal’, he took up the theme of climate change, following an epiphany in a concert. “ I actually paused during a performance to think about this serious issue. The sarod that I had in my hand is a piece of wood carved out of some tree and I began wondering if the tree was cut for the purpose. So what is the sarod’s carbon footprint? What is my carbon footprint as a musician?”

Datta feels it is important to raise critical questions as an artiste. In the upcoming travelogue series, he seeks to investigate ideas of culture, music, and Indianness.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/holen4/article30635161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Soumik-Datta-presents-Rhythm-of-India,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/soumik-datta-musical-stopovers/article30635162.ece
311,2020/01/23,Tales of musical akharas!,"Rohilkhand covers an area of nearly 25,000 sq. kms. in the northwestern part of Uttar Pradesh and lies in the east and northeast of Delhi and Agra respectively. It came to be known as Rohilkhand as the Afghan Rohilla tribes settled there in large numbers in the early 18th century and established their kingdoms in Bareilly, Rampur and Najibabad besides a few other places. Amroha, Moradabad, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur are some of the other important towns of this region which has been a witness to not only epoch-changing political developments but also the rise of several gharanas of Hindustani classical music and top musicians. Besides the high-brow art music, the region is also rich in folk musical traditions.

The famous Raza Library of Rampur has brought out two books that give detailed accounts of the region’s music and its history. “Uttar Pradesh ke Rohilkhand Kshetra ki Sangeet Parampara” (Tradition of music of the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh) is based on the Ph.D. thesis of Sandhya Rani while “Rampur Darbar ka Sangeet evam Nawabi Rasmein” (Music of the Rampur court and Nawabi practices) has been written by Nafis Siddiqi.

It is a well known fact that after the annexation of Awadh, deposition of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and revolt of 1857 that resulted in the exile of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar to Rangoon, most musicians and dancers shifted to other kingdoms like Rampur, Baroda, Hyderabad, Mysore and Gwalior, besides many other small principalities. It was in the post-1857 era that Rampur emerged as an important centre of Hindustani classical music and dance. That it had rulers like Kalbe Ali Khan and Hamid Ali Khan also weighed in heavily to attract high quality artistes.

Sandhya Rani’s book offers detailed information about Rohilkhand’s folk music and divides it into three streams—folk songs, folklore and chaharbait. While folk songs and folklore mostly deal with seasons and various occasions like child birth, marriage and festivals, chaharbait is a special form that is more prevalent in Rampur and its surrounding areas.

Folk tales are also called Kissa and Raag and folk singers narrate stories that include Alha, Pandain, Dhola, Triyacharit, Gopichander, Bharthari, Jaharpeer, Shravan Kumar and Mordhwaj.

Pathani raag

Chaharbait, also known as Chaarbait, has its origins in Pashto and is part of the popular folk music of Afghanistan. It is also called Pathani raag. It has four stanzas and the first three stanzas rhyme similarly while the fourth rhymes differently. Mustaqeem Khan is believed to be its creator in India and his son Abdul Karim Khan was an accomplished artiste of this form.

After settling in this region, the Afghan Rohillas soon shed Pashto and adopted the local language—a mix of indigenous, Persian and Arabic words that we today know as Urdu. Therefore, chaharbait too was composed in the mixed language and was sung by a group of singers using musical instrument dhaf to keep beat. The group was called akhara. Competitive events among these chaharbait akharas were also organised by wealthy patrons.

The Rampur nawabs, especially Kalbe Ali Khan, were keen enthusiasts of this form of folk music. This book also offers valuable information about the musical instruments such as dhol, khanjari, khartaal, naubat, chameli, chang, naal, nagar and ekatara, and played by folk artistes in this region.

The region gave birth to many gharanas of Hindustani classical music including Rampur gharana, Sahaswan gharana and Bhendi Bazar gharana. Bahadur Husain Khan, Inayat Khan, Fida Husain Khan, Nisar Husain Khan, Chhajju Khan, Nazir Khan, Khadim Husain Khan, Anajani Bai Malpekar and Aman Ali Khan were some of the top artistes of these gharanas.

Shahjahanpur had a vibrant sarod gharana represented by Kaukab Khan and Sakhawat Husain Khan. As Wazir Khan, chief musician at the Rampur court and guru of Nawab Hamid Ali Khan, was also the guru of both Allauddin Khan and Hafiz Ali Khan, their gharanas too could be linked with the Rampur tradition.

Great artistes like tabla wizard Ahmed Jan Thirakwa and khayal exponent Mushtaq Husain Khan too were associated with the Rampur court for a long time.

One finds rare information in Nafis Siddiqi’s book about women singers associated with some rulers of Rampur. One learns that many women courtesan singers were employed by Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan (1794-1840). Their names were Kallo Khanam, Nattho Khanam, Madhumati, Mittho Khanam, Padmani, Guchhiya Domni and Jumaniya. There were four other women singers and none was paid a monthly salary of less than fifty rupees.

While Raza Library deserves appreciation for bringing out such books, one must say that the editing leaves much to be desired. Moreover, they have been written in an academic straitjacket that leaves very little room for modern approach of critical enquiry.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/466hx1/article30634575.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200121-WA0014,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tales-of-musical-akharas/article30634576.ece
312,2020/01/23,Architect Aditi ‘Ditty’ Veena brings ideas of sustainability to her music,"“Building is a destructive activity,” says Aditi Veena, better known as Ditty. Ironic, considering she is an architect.

“Conservation architect,” she corrects. She continues listing the negatives. “Building with cement especially is destructive. It comes from mountains and rivers. It is gypsum, lime and sand. We are constantly excavating these evolutionary resources. But with them we are creating something that is dead,” she says dramatically banging a wall, and adding, “The life of this wall will end in 30 years and will be thrown in a landfill and another one will come up.”

Ditty’s mind is filled with questions such as ‘where does our water come from?’, ‘how are we designing our cities?’, ‘are they conducive to community living?... A lot of them are the result of the “incredible education” she received in college: School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi. She likes going behind every problem, deconstructing it and designing a solution. A lot of these ideas often find their way into her music.

That is right. Ditty is also a singer, poet, musician and released her first EP in 2014. Titled Mumblings, it has four tracks. Her début album came out last June and comprises eight tracks. It is called Poetry Ceylon and was created during her stay in Sri Lanka where she worked as a conservation architect.

Ditty’s style of music is indie/alternative and her songs she says are “honest and about what she is thinking, feeling and about the world we are creating.” The 30-year-old started writing poems six years back after her father passed on. It was cathartic. Now, she has a repository of nearly 600 songs. In the last two years, she has performed at the Ziro Festival, NH7 in Pune, Ranthambore Music and Wildlife Festival, Spoken Fest, Magnetic Fields and Where Have All The Flowers Gone in Manipur.

The architect, who was in Chennai to perform at the launch of Arture’s new line, has her own practice in Goa — landscape conservation, ecosystem repair and permaculture systems. She is working on converting degraded landscapes into a food forest or something that can harvest water and provide us with ecosystem services. “In Goa, I am doing a community-run food forest and a farm-to-table restaurant. And I am also doing a small school for a slum in Delhi.”

Need of the hour Arture, the city-based sustainable accessories brand, recently introduced its new line of accessories, After Life. This is their recycling project. “Sustainability is not just about sustainable materials, it is also about what happens at the end of the life of the product,” says Shivani Patel, founder of the brand. Any one who has shopped from Arture can send back their products and get 20% off on the next order, says Shivani.

These products are then broken down and an entirely new accessory is made out of it. The first line will launch in six months time. “After Life products will have a slightly worn out, distressed look. They will be made using linings, zips, sponge, organic cotton lining and corks, magnets and buttons. There will be coin pouches, earphone holders, bag charms and so on.

In between, she also writes new songs. A new record is under way. Taking music to the streets is part of the plan too. “I want to talk to them about the earth, and how people are disconnected from it, ourselves and reality. Some call it climate change, some call it war.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uh2j55/article30634387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRRAGHUNATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/architect-aditi-ditty-veena-brings-idea-of-sustainability-to-her-music/article30634388.ece
313,2020/01/23,In a dark backdrop,"India’s winter of discontent deepens, and citizens cutting across the social spectrum continue to throng the streets, determined to reiterate before the government their allegiance to the Constitution and an inclusive democracy. We have seen poets and popular singers, actors and comedians in the crowds. At these planned and peaceful protests powered by students, women and other regular citizens against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, the proposed National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, one high profile group seems conspicuous by its thin attendance. The country’s classical artists, normally placed at the top of India’s cultural pyramid, are noticeably few and far between.

Most of those singing and performing at protests sites are either hobbyists or young professionals with spunk and commitment. But where are the public figures, the thought leaders of the classical arts community? It’s not as if they are all recluses. Large numbers of India’s leading classical artists use social media to publicise their awards, achievements and new work. But looking at the blithe social media posts of many artists highlighting their Margazhi season performances, one would have thought this annual cultural blitz in Chennai was in a different universe from the CAA-NRC-NPR storm. Ironically, the performance season has been running parallel to the series of protests that erupted across cities after police stormed Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia campus.

In the January 2020 edition of her widely accessed narthaki.com newsletter, Anita Ratnam touched on the issue: “Amidst the chaos of daily protests and arrests across India due to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB),” wrote the performer and choreographer in her editorial, “a month of singing and dancing seemed at odds with the reality of our daily lives. But then the Chennai Margazhi season chugs on...” (Ellipsis in the original.) This one sentence effectively sums up the extent to which the work of classical artists is sealed off from the general condition of the society in which it is created. For those who don’t want these arts to atrophy and die, this is cause for concern.

Admittedly, performances, whether politically aware or otherwise, don’t spring up in a day. But as public figures, sometimes artists take other approaches, like Bharatanatyam dancer Nrithya Pillai, who read out the preamble of the Constitution from a Chennai stage recently, ending with “Jai Bhim”. Otherwise, for the larger part, it was business as usual for the classical performers. Stones and bullets rent the air even as dancing Krishna flicked a pebble cracking a harried milkmaid’s clay pot. Marauders broke the bones and hearts of innocents, but in the auditoriums, Ram slew Ravan, and Shiva’s tandava was applauded.

It is another question how to weave an overtly political theme into a composition of raga music or a form like Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam or Odissi. This is an aesthetic challenge, relating to form and structure, says eminent classical vocalist T.M. Krishna. “That is something we have to keep trying. We may fail, we may succeed.”

Political and aesthetic

But to say unconventional themes are not part of the classical ethos would be to assume the ethos is monolithically unchangeable and perfect, a premise blatantly false, he notes. His project of a few years, “Poromboke Paadal” that aims to raise environmental awareness and reclaim the term ‘poromboke’ (which originally referred to resources for shared use but gradually has taken on pejorative connotations) was an example of something “so political that also worked in an aesthetic way.”

Krishna was in the Capital on January 1 to perform for the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust’s annual event in memory of assassinated theatre director Safdar Hashmi by political goons in 1989. The anti-CAA stirs were in high gear, and he sang, among other pieces, the parts of “Jana gana mana” that are not included in the national anthem. With lines appropriate for the prevailing mood of the country, this portion includes the words “India that was asleep is now waking.” As part of his response to the current political scenario, Krishna says nowadays he includes this song in his concerts and also has started talking to his audiences, which wasn’t his practice earlier.

Krishna says one of the hurdles preventing artists from being outspoken is the need for recognition and acceptability. “They may believe in something but they’re also scared.” India is “a feudal world” where artists believe they are “serving, in some fashion,” entities like zamindar, bureaucrat, politician, corporate house, event manager, audience. “So you don’t want to disturb the status quo,” says Krishna.

Bharatanatyam and Contemporary dance exponent Navtej Johar, a Sangeet Natak Akademi Award recipient, demolishes the oft-heard plea that the classical arts are an ‘apolitical’ space. “Indian ‘classical’ dance has been nationalistic from the very inception,” says Johar, known for his socially aware works of theatre and dance. “It would be naïve and delusional, even deceitful, to say that classical dance is apolitical.”

Aadya Kaktikar, trained in Odissi under Guru Mayadhar Raut, says, “All arts illustrate a particular political ideology and therefore to claim the classical arts are apolitical is to claim they have no history, no past, no affiliations, no aspirations — nothing! It is as if they are devoid of any human touch! Is the form separate from those who practice it? Can the moving body be separated from the beliefs of the human being who performs? Is it possible for a human being to live within social structures and claim to not be participating in them? By claiming these arts are apolitical we are doing them a great disservice. The power of the classics and the classical lies in its capacity to speak to and relate to the present. And the present is by no means ever apolitical.”

Saddening silence

To present “something that is immediately political and affects many lives,” is the hope of Delhi-based Kuchipudi exponent Abhinaya Nagajothy, daughter and disciple of Gurus Seetha and Nagajothy, but her parents, disciples of late Vempati Chinna Satyam, “don’t seem quite convinced.” Abhinaya perseveres, since she feels, “The silence of the artists in this current political turmoil is saddening,” and wants her mother to choreograph the poem “Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge” by screenwriter, lyricist and stand-up artist Varun Grover.

How to respond may be a personal choice, but being oblivious is not an option, these artists assert. As Johar fumes, “Artists don’t live on Mars,” Aadya asks, “Is there a way to be human without responding to the world around you? As a community can we not find the courage to articulate and engage with the knotty issues that surround us rather than continuing to perform valorous deeds of mythical beings? What stops the classical artist from engaging in the world around them?”

Carnatic vocalist Nadhi Thekkek in “Broken Seeds Still Grow”

Bharatanatyam dancer Nadhi Thekkek, born, raised and trained in the U.S., says, “If artistry is supposed to reflect who we are and if who we are is being challenged, how can we not respond?” Nadhi, with costuming that only dispenses with some of the glitter of classical dance aharya, regularly weaves her ideology into choreographic works that include all the elements of raga music, percussion, nritta and abhinaya.

One’s choices proclaim one’s politics to the rest of the world. As public figures, “all artists should know what their response or lack of response says to their audiences and the communities they live and work in,” adds Nadhi.

Johar states, “Of course, we need to view ourselves, our views, and the positions we take within the current contexts that we inhabit. I’ve been saying for decades now that Indian dance reeks of cultural-chauvinism.”

As India continues to debate the future of its founding principles, a question for the classical arts community, often considered ivory tower-bound, is whether it too is ready to take a dip in the mainstream dialogue or remain in its niche.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/4go9vz/article30634357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Navtej-Johar-in-his-latest-work-TANASHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/in-a-dark-backdrop/article30634362.ece
314,2020/01/23,The abiding spirit,"At any point in time when cultural symbols, architecture, language, songs, poetry, painting are taken into the political territory their context shifts and they become part of intriguing tools in games of power. The recent news of the government replacing the melody ‘Abide with Me’ with ‘Vande Matram’ at the upcoming Beating Retreat Ceremony at the Vijay Chowk is not about right or wrong but a fascinating play of power with cultural-political emotional quotient. The discourse is much more than a hymn which was favourite of Mahatma Gandhi, or a Christian one. That implication and explanation is too restricted. The hymn has bearings in its words that encapsulate the essence of the Constitution.

There can be three ways to see the role of the melodies. First, the context in which the songs were written and the reason they were or are part of the Beating Retreat musical bonanza. Second, the physical geographical setting the melodies are played. And thirdly, the manner they represent the spirit of the people embedded in the Constitution.

The context

The hymn ‘Abide with me’ written by Henry Francis Lyte was recalled by him when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. In one of his writings, Lyte made a courageous statement that he would not want his life to rust. TB a contagious disease not only would have limited Lyte’s movement but by recalling his song he garnered the courage to celebrate his human life in the limited space and time left. ‘Abide with Me’ is thus an ultimate statement of courage, of universal humanism and encapsulates the intention of the Constitution.

Says constitutional historian Madhav Khosla, “Courage- Yes! It is the spirit of the Constitution. Who would have imagined that after centuries of colonial rule that the book defining the spirit of free India would declare, dare and uphold the inclusion of all its citizens as equal, freedom of expression and dialogue between those who govern and those who are governed? That through the Constitution India we as citizens would assert ourselves as the largest, inclusive and diverse democracy in the world!”

The inclusion of Vande Mataram in the Retreat also calls for the context of the song. It was written in 1869 by Bankimchandra Chatterji. There was no political India the way we understand it today. There were either Princely states or British ruled provinces. So the motivation was for an ocean of people fighting for their spirit and ‘the earth’ on which they lived whichever part of the then India. 1869 was the year of the bubonic plague in Mumbai and the famine in Bundelkhand. Some of the inspirational words in the song for the then-struggling people were ‘I bow to thee Mother (earth) richly waters, fruiting… It ends with ‘The Mother giver of boons, giver of bliss.’

The spirit of the geographical context of the song is similar to what is visually represented in the Bharat Mata Mandir (Mother India Temple) built-in 1936 in Varanasi. Instead of a statue of a God or a Goddess, the central iconography in the temple is the physical geographical map of the undivided Indian subcontinent. Evocative, it seeks to inspire millions of people who aligned themselves to the earth of the Indian subcontinent in an equal manner.

Sacred geometric setting

The final ritual in the festival for the Constitution of India is a poignant, poetic audio-visual phenomenon. It is held in a sacred geometric setting of buildings of governance. It lays responsibility on those who govern to honour of the Constitution of India and its citizens.

‘Beating Retreat’ takes place at the Vijay Chowk (a square). It is juxtaposed with the circular Parliament meant to guard the constitution. The arm forces owe their loyalty to their supreme commander (President of India) on top of the Raisina Hill and the constitution. The square where the ritual in the form of the melodies takes place represents a Yantra or a mandala. The square in the Indian thought as a shape of equidistant provides a symbol of an anchor and stability required for a country.

The circular parliament represents the infinity of the spirit of an ongoing democratic civilisation. The roads leading out from the square represent the progress and movement of the country. Interestingly, there was already a reclaiming of the symbolic physical geography by free India when the ‘King’s Way’ came to be called the Rajpath (ruler’s road) and which intersected with the ‘Queen’s Way’ now known as Janpath (people’s road). Thus, they represent the dialogue between the two stakeholders: the government and the citizens.

The towers of the Secretariat represent churning of thought in governance while guarding the Constitution. The melodies and movement of the bands coming down from the Raisina Hill, creating different geometric formations, retreating at sunset only to end at the end in silence – after which all the buildings surrounding the Vijay Chowk Mandala are lighted as if to affirm the lighted spirit of the Constitution.

The hymn ‘Abide with Me’ is choreographed as the last hymn before the bugle call to lower the National Flag. It is hauntingly played in chimes by tubular bells against the setting sun. It is played as an echo between the secretariat towers and the buildings across. The spirit of the Constitution captured in the silent words: ‘Through Cloud and Sunshine, O abide with me….I fear no foe…where grave, thy victory… I still triumph, if you abide with me!”

The word abide acts as a solemn promise by those who govern and the governed that they abide by the Constitution of India in terms of roles and duties. The forthcoming induction of the Vande Mataram, when enacted in the Mandala of the Vijay Chowk will seek to affirm only the land. Both the citizens and the land are important and the two melodies can and should coexist.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/i1tfwq/article30634299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-abiding-spirit-beating-retreat-ceremony/article30634300.ece
315,2020/01/23,Pravin Pundit - complete control over laya,"The saxophone concert of 13-year-old Pravin Pundit, a disciple of T.V. Gopalakrishnan, was an offering of imagination, with complete control over technique. Pravin commenced his two-hour concert with Kanaka Dasa’s popular ‘Nammamma Sharade,’ tuned by TVG in Hamsadhwani and popularised by Vidyabhushana. The song along with kalpanaswaram at Pallavi came like a breath of fresh air. Saxophone demands total dedication and rigorous practice, and that came through in Pravin’s renditions.

The youngster played Tyagaraja’s ‘Entharo Mahanubhavulu (Sri) heralding the Bahula Panchami (Jan. 15). While he played the swara segment, M. Vijay (violin), repeated the Sahitya portion, with Vijay Natesan (mridangam) and Thirupunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) providing alternate rhythm support.

Music runs in his genes as Pravin Pundit’s father Shimoga Kumaraswamy was also a saxophone artiste. The Hamsanandi alapana was a pleasant rendition. M. Vijay too provided a tranquil elucidation. Lalitha Dasar’s ‘Pavana Gurupavanapura’ (Rupakam), popularised by Chembai, had a few symmetrical kalpanaswaras. TVG was present to enjoy the music of his worthy disciple.

The Devagandhari alapana showed the extent to which Pravin has tamed his instrument. On the violin, Vijay too offered a melodic response. ‘Ksheerasagara sayana’ (Tyagaraja) had several glimpses of the Chembai style. The Thodi alapana was rendered imaginatively. Pravin painted every phrase with sensitivity. ‘Thaye Yasoda’ of Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaier, commenced with the anupallavi, and the niraval and swaras were at ‘Kalinil Chilambu Konja.’

The thani by Vijay Natesan and Thiruppunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) was so well-conceived and executed that it sounded like a continuation of the kriti. Vijay Natesan’s mridangam accompaniment was an asset to Pravin, with its subdued richness.

‘Raminchu Varevarura’ (Suposhini, a Harikhambodi Janya) in Rupakam was a neat rendition. ‘Raja Raja Radithe’ (Niroshta-Muththayya Bhagavathar) and ‘Chinnanjiru Kiliye’ (Bharathiyar) elicited applause from the discerning audience.

Pravin wound up the well-attended concert with TVG’s Thilang Thillana and Purandaradasar’s ‘Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma.’ Pleasant stage manners, impeccable sense of laya and appealing manodharma, must push this young musician to the fore.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/g8wwij/article30634192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17frPravinPundit1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pravin-pundit-complete-control-over-laya/article30634193.ece
316,2020/01/23,The veena sings again,"The veena assumes the personality of its player, the idiosyncrasies included, says Anuradha Mahesh. “If you are enthusiastic, your veena would be too, if you are a slacker, your veena would be ditto,” she says.

An artiste and veena instructor, Anuradha has been playing the instrument for over 6 hours a day, for 37 years. She says it is now an extension of herself. “It is a bond that is formed over the years. I’ve seen how its tone and resonance have improved; it responds to me. It’s music is my music too,” she says. Her veena, which her guru brought her from Thanjavur, is 42 years old, a simple beauty made of jackwood, the colour of roasted coffee beans.

Anuradha and her husband S Mahesh Aiyar, a software professional, have been for over a year trying to revive interest in the veena. “The veena is our national instrument and yet it is largely neglected as people believe it is heavy, difficult to master, time-consuming and expensive,” says Mahesh.

Hence the couple launched The Shanmukhapriya Foundation last year, to promote the veena, as well as an understanding of the vedas with a festival, “Vipanchika Mahotsavam.” Celebrating the instrument, and collaborating with artistes, the festival is expected to draw about 200 people together this year, on January 25 and 26.

Held during Vasant Panchami, this yearly event highlights the instrument, and also provides a platform for vainikas. The festival, which is a confluence of professional artists, emerging ones, traditional craftspeople and the general public, aims at demystifying the veena.

The couple has started a factory at Swamimalai in Kumbakonam, which manufactures veenas. Started in April 2019, they have manufactured over 40 instruments.

As part of their research and planning for the first festival, they met traditional craftsmen from Thanjavur, who have been making the veena for generations. They found that the craft was at the risk of dying as the craftsmen earned little profit from it. “We learnt that the middlemen were robbing the craftsmen of what is due to them and the buyer on the other hand was paying more,” says Mahesh. They found a few craftsmen who were willing to work with them and set up base in Swamimalai. “We have six to eight craftsmen, who craft the veenas at the workshop. We ensure that they get the remuneration they deserve.”

At the festival last year, a team of crasftsmen was present, fixing veenas that were in disrepair. “We were amazed to see that people had brought in their old and broken veenas. We received about 100 veenas,” says Anuradha. “This year, however, the craftsmen would not be a part of the festival as they are mourning the loss of their guru, an elderly veena craftsman, who taught the craft to the present generation of craftsmen. He passed away a few days ago in Thajavur.” However, small repair works would be undertaken at the fest by a local craftsman and the veenas that need more work would be sent to the craftsmen by the organisers.

Saraswati veena

The focus would be on the Saraswati veena, the type most popularly used in southern India. Where as in the North, it is the rudra veena that is more popularly used. The Chitraveena is also used in South India.

The Saraswati veena is made from different of wood. In Mysore, the more popular variety is the rosewood veena, which is known to be expensive (starting at ₹45,000 approximately). In Hyderabad, a particular kind of veena known as the Bobbili veena is made of mango wood. The Thanjavur veena, which is the most popular, is usually made of jack wood. The wood used can define the resonance of a veena.

A Saraswati veena can cost anything from ₹30,000 above, depending on the complexity of designs, technique and wood used. “Some like to customise their veenas with ornate carvings; so the price is actually based on the customisation,” says Anuradha.

The Thanjavuri veena consists of a peg box, a fingerboard and a resonator. Sometimes these pieces are separately made and joined. Those carved from a single log of wood are known as the ‘ekanda veena’, which could be more expensive. “We are trying to use a combination of wood and techniques to make the veena more affordable, without compromising on the quality,” says Mahesh.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/anuradha-and-s-mahesh-aiyar-conduct-a-veena-festival-to-revive-interest-in-the-instrument/article30634088.ece
317,2020/01/23,Charumathi demystified the complex tala structure,"While the Music Academy’s morning academic sessions were a huge draw, one well-attended lec-dem was of Charumathi Ramachandran’s on ‘Pallavis in108 talas.’

The senior vocalist was keen to discuss and demonstrate these talas, especially for the younger generation to know about them.

It was an intellectual and aesthetic exercise and one was drawn to the beautiful ragas used and the easy demystification of the intricacies of the lagu, drutam, guru, plutam, kakapadam and so on. These are some of the angas of the 108 talas explained . It was a delight to see quite a lot of hands in the air, moving to the right and left and closed fists moving in circles as audience members followed the demonstration of various parts of a talam.

The basic angas

“Creation of a talam or rhythm is pure maths,” said Charumathi, establishing “the pallavi itself is a free expression of a one-line idea.” The vocalist spoke aboutthe 108 pallavis she had composed in the ancient 108 talas, and presented a few. The 108 talas use only six angas (of the 16 Shodasangas) — anudrutam, drutam, lagu, guru, plutam, and kakapadam.

The first pallavi, ‘Madana Gopala Giridharane Krishna,’ she demonstrated was in Madana tala (comprising two drutams and one plutam), in raga Behag and was followed bykalpanaswara and a korvai. She was ably assisted by Usha Rajagopalan (violin) and Sivakumar (mridangam).

Next came a pallavi in Janaka tala (four laghus, two gurus, then two laghus and one guru): ‘Mithila puri vaazh Janaka raajanin pudalvi Vaidhehi Ayodhi Ramanai nokkinaal’ (Hindolam). The korvai sparkled in Srotovaha Yati.

Charumathi then sang the final pallavi ‘Varalakshmi varuvaai arul nee tharuvaai’ in raga Salaga Bhairavi. This was in Lakshmisa tala (two drutams, two khanda laghus and one plutam). Niraval and ragamalika swaram ended with a korvai.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/charumathi-demystified-the-complex-tala-structure/article30633885.ece
318,2020/01/23,Jayanti carved a pleasing Kiravani alapana,"Veena has perhaps had the longest life span as a musical instrument since the Vedic days. What keeps its primacy even today is commitment of stalwarts like Jayanti Kumaresh. Her concert for the Music Academy had both scholarliness and dignity woven into the various pieces that she presented. Given the strenuous practice regimen for veena, her work is even more laudable.

The concert had a chill start as the Rasali kriti of Tyagaraja (‘Aparadamula Norva’), despite some brisk swarams threatened to knock the wind out of her sails.

Begada raga alapana started the process of reconstruction with Jayanti deploying crisp and beautiful phrases. The kriti, ‘Kadaikkan vaithu’ in a lilting misra chapu was rendered robustly without sacrificing nuances. The second speed swaram, accentuated with dattu phrases like ‘sa pa ma ga ri’ imparted the right momentum for the seminal segment of the programme.

Mukhari (‘Emani ne,’ Subbaraya Sastri) gave Jayanti the opportunity to use gayaki phrases along the natural contours of the raga and the kriti. She poured beauty carefully with an ounce glass without abandon. Speed-shift was ushered in with the Vasantha song (‘Ramachandram bhavayami’, Dikshitar) and rapid-fire swarams. The use of ‘jor’ effect with the ‘pulsy’ plucks was absorbing while one is not sure why there were some guitar-like sounds when in fact, western instruments are trying to ape our way of non-discrete playing.

Veena concerts seem to have significant residual time at any point, due to the absence of any non-percussion support. Jayanti used the generous time to carve out a pleasing alapana of Kiravani with a skilful four speed tanam, distinctive of the instrument. The Pallavi was in relatively simple Adi (2 Kalai) but entertainment was added by the ragamalika niraval and swaram in Malayamarutham, Arabhi and Behag, with the cyclical return to the original Kiravani. Jayanti added further dignity to the concert, keeping the swarams to a sensible length.

A multi-percussion ensemble revels in such a setting with their opportunity for thani coming early. The thani of Jayachandra Rao and Tiruchi Krishnaswamy was enjoyable climaxing nicely without bringing the roof down. There are concerts that promote assurance and there are the ones with a difference. This is the former kind.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/qchwl9/article30633769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24frJayanthiKumarresh-Veenajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jayantis-kiravani-alapana-was-appealing/article30633770.ece
319,2020/01/23,Passion without performance,"Musicians have always reached out to friends for social company, for personal or career advice or furtherance and for well-meaning criticism. The eco-system was completed by many well-to-do families, who acted as the scaffold to the musicians. For over seven decades, our family has sustained a competence — intense involvement with Carnatic music, without going into the ring. The four generations of the family have gone about it as if it was a tryst. A typical week between 1940s and early 21st century (yes, a long span) would consist of some members attending two or three concerts (individually and together), listening to hours of tapes or CDs or radio music (often special selections rather than random music), discussing the concerts, judging ‘state of the music’ now and then, visiting a few musicians’ families, inviting a musician and his or her family for a meal, hours of practice by budding youngsters in the family, chorus effects from others, who only had passive learning, heated debates about A’s music vs B’s music (A and B may be A-listers at the relevant times) and a lot of passive listening. The musical osmosis was so complete that even those not formally trained could sing a couple of minutes of Rishabhapriya or Karnaranjani.

There was however, another undercurrent. Every now and then, the young brigades were banished to mind their studies and quite strangely, advised not to be addicted to Carnatic music (just like you would dissuade people from the cinema craze). There was a lot of love, certainly no hate but pragmatism had the upper hand. Pragmatism stemming from a clear choice when it came to education, career, etc. Music could only be a pastime, even if it was intense.

The members were encouraged to formally or informally learn music but the Lakshman Rekha was clearly drawn — not to go the professional distance. Except for one mridangist with an AIR ‘A’ rating, the family of perhaps over 60 people across generations produced nothing of substance that went beyond homes. Some of us became official critics, (a good second option) — including my late grandfather K. S. Mahadevan, and many others remained unofficial critics retaining their RTC (right to critique, without fear or favour). They had no qualms about trashing briga music or slow music or applause-centric music and calling a spade a spade. This is despite forging intimate friendships with about 20-25 top musicians and their families and an ‘acquaintance’ level association with scores of others. So, both friends and the unacquainted were put on the altar of family scrutiny.

It is not clear if the friendships of musicians brought the family close to music or the other way around. A Bharat Ratna as a close friend for five decades, many Sangitha Kalanidhis as good friends (occasional teachers to the new generation in the family), many Padma Vibhushans and Padma Bhushans performing at family weddings, the crème de la crème dancers or musicians presiding over family events, and many others dropping by for a chat or a meal meant that the social side of music and our family was always on a hyperbole. Many families in Chennai have had this privilege. The only difference I could perhaps glean was that our family did not conform to the typical category of lawyer-patrons or wealthy organisers or upper-income Chennai ‘lutyens’ (who may even have lanes named after them in Mylapore).

The love without marriage relationship with music has been an enigmatic core of our family. No one symbolised this more than my grandmother who would have been 100 this year (The family got up a small event to commemorate this). Chinnani, as she was known, was the classic combo of deep but amateur interest and stoic detachment. An uncle with top knowledge (self-acquired) who drew awe and respect from musicians, just passed on. The umbilical cord to music never went away even across continents and across generations of musicians.

This phenomenon may not be unique as Chennai may have more such stories with some variations. Youngsters in such osmotic environments must be thankful for the subconscious initiation and venous infusion of one of the greatest forms of music.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bxd33n/article30633038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24frChinnanijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/passion-without-performance/article30633039.ece
320,2020/01/23,"Stories, fables and mystical elements find a way into Tamil rock band ‘Othasevuru’","“If I traded wisdom, what do I get in return? I shall sanction fame.

If I traded fame, what do I get in return? I shall sanction loneliness.

If I traded loneliness, what do I get in return? I shall sanction love.

If I traded love, what do I get in return? I shall sanction lust.”

You get the drift, right? These metaphor-loaded exchanges between a man and God finds its way into the dreamy song ‘Iraivan Sandhippu’ written by a two-member Tamil indie band called Othasevuru (single wall), and comprising talents like Pravekha Ravichandran (vocals) and Tharun Sekar (vocals and guitar).

Heavily inspired by Kaber Vasuki and Tenma’s pop-rock band Kurangan, Pravekha says the duo encountered a “mid-life crisis” while still in college, sometime in 2017, which led them to embark on a path of self-discovery and mull over the purpose of life. That is when it hit them as to how “naked and small” they were in front of Mother Nature. Their experience also gave them fresh ideas and became the premise of their first song — aptly titled ‘Madaikulla Verum Mannu’.

“We performed for YouTube channel Terrance Jams, which is a platform to encourage indie bands. That is when people started noticing us,” says Pravekha.

The origin story

Their set consists of an average of six songs with a duration of three minutes each. By design, each song invariably follows the three act structure, and also has “the hero’s journey”, thereby giving the performance an overall narrative arc. “We love storytelling and every song contains a micro story in it. We both narrow in on a common thread for our songs, and then start writing,” he says, adding that both Tharun and him work on the lyrics together.

Othasevuru has an interesting way of functioning. Modelling themselves after Kaber and Tenma, the duo takes to the stage wearing shades. “This might seem like a style statement but that is not the point. We wear shades because it gives us confidence to face the crowd,” laughs Pravekha. They invent a scenario that forms the crux of the performance, setting mood and tone. A question is thrown at the audience, which gets resolved towards the end of the three-minute song, making it seem conversational. “ This way, we are able to gel with the audience. So far, we have only done live performances. Maybe that is why our songs may not be suitable for listening with headphones,” says Tharun.

Mystical musings

Existentialism is the vein of Othasevuru, if you pay attention to lyrics, especially, of songs like ‘Mandai Ennum Maidhanathil’. Unlike other bands, there is no tendency to romanticise existential thoughts, for they deal with everyday aspects of life. Like talking to a tree about human psychology, seeking a crow’s guidance about morality and so on. “Existentialism arises when you have questions about life,” remarks Pravekha, explaining their song structure. “But these are not abstract ideas. We conceptualise our songs based on everyday experiences. The challenge is to convert them into lyrical format.”

Stairway to fame Othasevuru’s first gig at Kurangan’s show was a flop. However, the band was unanimously praised for its performance at Madras Medai 2018, an initiative by director Pa Ranjith.

The band landed an opportunity to traverse the mainstream path, when they were signed for ‘Namma Ooru Hero’, a television show hosted by Vijay Sethupathi. “We faced a lot of criticism and appreciation for the show. Some people said, ‘We couldn’t fathom what you were trying to convey’. But Vijay Sethupathi was very encouraging. He said, ‘I am your fan da’,” adds Pravekha.

One could argue that Othasevuru songs are part-fiction and part-observational, like the peppy ‘Meesakara Maarimuthu’ — a song that was written when Pravekha and Tharun were miles away in their respective hometown. The duo saw two interesting yet dramatically different incidents, and decided to put it together in the form of ‘Meesakara Maarimuthu’.

“We keep writing songs. Sometimes there is purpose, sometimes there isn’t. All our songs are based on personal accounts, and that reflects when we start jamming,” says Tharun. Would these imageries and subtexts hold water in the mainstream space? “You are making us sound like an ‘existential’ band. In reality, we are simple guys who just want to have fun,” concludes Pravekha with a laugh, while Tharun nods in agreement.

321,2020/01/23,Balance of styles,"One half of the face is framed by matted hair, the other half is hemmed by soft curls. The right side of the forehead is smeared by ash, while the left has a neat line of sandalwood paste. One half epitomised roudram (ferocity) and the other half expressed lasyam (grace). As Eloor Biju created the form of Ardhanareeshwara with his music, S Shashikala Nedungadi brought Shiva and Shakti alive, switching between both effortlessly.

Sopana sangeetham and Kathakali may seem like an unusual medley, but the artistes created an audio-visual experience by marrying the two art forms. And the results were astounding. “After each performance, we have had people coming up to us and saying it touched them,” says Shashikala.

S Shashikala Nedungadi | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

A Kathakali performer for over 37 years, Shashikala felt she should collaborate with Biju for an experimental piece. “His music touches the soul; it is full of emotion and bhakti.” She had a discussion with Biju and the Ardhanareeshwara piece was conceptualised. “Choreography was initially a challenge, as unlike Kathakali music, Sopana sangeetham is more fluid,” says Shashikala. “We had to reduce dance sequences and increase the abhinaya component.” While the thalam used in Kathakali are traditionally Champada and Thripuda, the music had to be set to Roopakam, so as to find a common ground between Kathakali and Sopana sangeetham.

It was decided that a Kathakali musician would assist Biju and they would be accompanied by the maddalam. Biju would have his edakka and elathalam, which are used by Sopanam singers, to create the desired effect.

An emotional piece

Painstaking hours of practice went into the creation of the repertoire — a Ganapathy sthuti, in praise of Lord Ganesha; ‘Ardhanareeswara’, a piece that symbolised the perfect balance of male and female energies; and ‘Devaki Vilapam’, where Krishna’s mother Devaki sings him a lullaby in her dream. Waking up, she realises he is not with her and pines for her child. “It is an emotional piece. It touches my heart each time I hear it and perform it. It has left a number of people in the audience with moist eyes, especially women,” says Shashikala.

For an art form that was largely confined to the temples, Biju popularised Sopana sangeetham with his individualistic style. “For me, collaborating for a project such as this was exciting as it was challenging. I had never sung for a Kathakali performance before and I was keen to understand the creative process.”

Creating venues for Sopana sangeetham outside the temple is a way to give more people an opportunity to appreciate it, says Biju. Traditionally sung in temples, where the singer stands beside the steps leading to the sanctum sanctorum, Sopana sangeetham is an ancient art form that is believed to have existed even before Carnatic music made an entry into Kerala. “It is pure bhakti and its role is to connect the devotees with their lord,” Biju says.

A performer for over 10 years, Biju experiments freely with the ragas and tempo, contemporising the style to make it more appealing. However, neither Kathakali nor Sopana sangeetham was diluted for this jugalbandi, says Sashikala. “The pieces were choreographed, retaining their sanctity.” Shashikala and Biju have performed in a few venues in Kochi and the duo plans to add a third element — Mohiniyattam. They are collaborating with Mohiniyattam dancer Athira Shankar to create a piece that would be a rare meeting place for three diverse forms of art.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8fze7x/article30623287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPELOORBIJU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-jugalbandhi-blending-sopanasangeetham-and-kathakali/article30623288.ece
322,2020/01/23,"I learnt sarod as I wanted to carry on the legacy of my father and grandfather, says Manik Khan","California-based young sarod maestro Manik Khan’s first visit to Kerala was made possible by Graeme Vanderstol who has, for over half a century, been an ambassador of Indian art and culture in the US. The legendary Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Manik’s father, was a close friend of Vanderstol’s.

Manik was in Kerala for a concert at Kalamandalam to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kalamandalam’s Kathakali troupe’s trip to the US. In a free-wheeling conversation, Manik talked about his initiation into music, his heritage and vision in life.

Excerpts...

You were born and brought up in an ambience engrossed in Indian music. Was it a conscious decision on your part to learn the sarod?

I started learning to play the tabla at the age of 10 from Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri, my Baba’s (father) favourite percussionist. Earlier, Baba was followed on the tabla by Pandit Chaturlal. After learning the instrument for less than three years, I decided to switch to the sarod. Mine was a conscious decision, as I wanted to carry on the legacy of my father and grandfather, Ustad Allauddin Khan.

What was it like learning to play the sarod from your father?

Apart from rigorous practice at home, I used to accompany Baba during his concert-tours, which were lessons for an upcoming player. The training was two-pronged — vocal and instrumental. I learnt about 400 ragas from Baba. However, I can only play 40 ragas comfortably on stage.

How do you see your father as a sarod player?

My perception of Baba as an artiste kept on changing over the years. As a kid, I was carried away by the emotions he created through his fingers on the sarod. As I grew up, I noticed his creativity and imagination that knew no bounds. For instance, the way he played raag Gaur Sarang was striking in many respects. Even as he stuck to the same phrase, Baba spontaneously added multiple layers to it and made it refreshing every time he played it. The music that emanated from his sarod was so unique in the sense that it directly conversed with our soul.

Samay raag (time-dictated raga) has been a characteristic of Hindustani music. While in Carnatic classical music, this doesn’t have any takers, in Kerala’s indigenous music system, Sopana sangeetham, this is still valued by some.

The relevance and significance of Samayraag is a matter of debate. It is, in one word, faith-related. Baba had immense faith in it. One’s association with a particular raga sung at a particular point of time, and the feeling it gives is intuitive. You can neither intellectualise nor rationalise it. Raag Basanth is embedded in spring. Malhars are evening ragas. Bhairav is a morning raag, while raag Yaman Kalyan is meant for the evening. I remember, Baba once told us students, “If one ever dared to play Yaman Kalyan at any other time except in the evening, I will close down my school here (in California) and return to India.”

Was Ali Akbar Khan orthodox in his beliefs?

While my grandfather Ustad Allavudin Khan did Namaz five times a day, my father had held the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible in high regard. Baba was also drawn to the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Ultimately, music was his religion. He had given us lots of liberty to be sceptical and to ask questions. Insularity was never part of his identity.

How do you reflect upon the music of Pandit Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee, the two great luminaries of the sitar?

Both of them were dear disciples of my grandfather. They had nothing in common in terms of sound, texture and treatment of the instrument. I was deeply moved by the mellifluousness of Nikhilji’s playing, his inimitable taans and improvisations. When he came to study under my grandfather, he was already a prodigy.

Raviji had toured with his illustrious brother and his dance ensemble all over the world. He was, hence, familiar with all the intricacies of tala before he began learning under my grandfather. Raviji’s discourses on the sitar were marvellous in many ways as he had imbibed influences from multiple sources.

Baba and Raviji had played together at some point. They parted ways later. But I have seen Baba sitting amongst the audience and listening when Raviji was playing. Raviji too attended Baba’s concerts once in a while. I fondly remember visiting my aunt, Annapurna Devi, a few years ago in India. As you might know, she was leading the life of a recluse. Like my father, she too bore strong traits of seriousness and wit. They were perfect siblings. I noticed they smiled the same way, half-smirks.

Mastering the sarod is a tough task. Do you think this musical instrument can withstand the test of time?

Sarod, as you know, does not have frets. It is an intonation-based instrument and is not as popular as the sitar. If you look at it closer, you can see that it is a percussion-cum-string instrument. The beats on the tabla and the music of the sarod are a perfect blend. With more and more youngsters learning the sarod in India and abroad, it is sure to have sunny days ahead.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/w1lgy1/article30631922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvmManikKhan3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/in-conversation-with-sarod-exponent-manik-khan-son-of-legendary-ustad-ali-akbar-khan/article30631923.ece

Sohan opposed the company’s plea, contending that a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Government against the High Court judgment was pending before the Supreme Court. He also submitted that the two-month deadline given by the Bench to implement its directive would end only on February 20. There is sufficient time to get the load test done. He also pointed out that the Government could get the load test conducted in a time-bound manner as it had experience in the implosion of Maradu flats within the time frame set by the apex court.

S. Sreekumar, senior counsel for the petitioner, submitted that more than one-and-a-half months had passed since the High Court asked the Government to conduct the load test.

The flyover has remained closed for long. With the Government sleeping over the court directive, the public is bearing the brunt. Therefore, it is essential that the High Court issue a directive to appoint an expert agency to conduct the load test at the cost of the petitioner.

During the hearing, the Bench pointed out that as the Supreme Court had not stayed the High Court verdict, it could issue a directive to engage an expert agency. However, the State Attorney took exception to the suggestion and contended that it had time till February 20 to implement the directive. Therefore, there was no need for issuing an interim directive.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/flyover-load-test-hc-adjourns-hearing-on-plea-to-name-agency/article30628838.ece
326,2020/01/23,Projects worth ₹64-cr. taken up under Operation Breakthrough,"To deal with the city’s persistent waterlogging issues, work worth ₹64 crore is being implemented under the three phases of Operation Breakthrough, a project spearheaded by the district administration.

As part of the first phase, work on 36 projects in 27 wards of the Kochi Corporation has begun. A total of 202 projects will be taken up in the three phases of the project. Though the initial deadline for all projects was March 31, considering the number of projects, the district administration feels that work can be completed before the monsoon sets in, latest by April 30.

District Collector S. Suhas inspected four project sites on Wednesday. To address waterlogging troubles in the Karikamuri area, cleaning and desilting of Vivekananda Canal near South railway station has begun. Work on three stretches of the Karnakodam canal is set to cost ₹1.89 crore.

327,2020/01/23,"Cheriyapally is the light of Kothamangalam, says Samiti","The Matha Maithri Samrakshana Samiti (council for protection of religious amity), with its members drawn from various religions, has emerged at the centre of the continuing standoff between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church over control of parishes.

Samiti members have been on a relay sit-in in front of the historic Marthoman Cheriyapally at Kothamangalam for nearly 50 days now, demanding that the church not be taken over by the State to be handed over to the Orthodox group in keeping with the July 3, 2017 Supreme Court verdict, which handed over total control of all Malankara parishes to the Orthodox faction. The SC had said in its verdict that all parallel services and control of parishes should end as the Orthodox group took control. Parish churches are being taken over by the State and handed over to the Orthodox group amid stiff resistance from the Jacobites.

However, the emergence of the Samiti at the vanguard of resistance has baffled observers though Jacobite leaders, and Samiti members find it the most normal course of action in the face of the SC verdict.

“The Cheriyapally [in the name of St. Thomas the Apostle] is the light of Kothamangalam, and we cannot let the light go out,” said K.A. Naushad, CPI(M) leader of the Opposition in the Kothamangalam municipal council and chairman of the Samiti. “The church is the cause for all good things and the prosperity of Kothamangalam, which is the gateway to the high ranges. People from all religions believe that Bava Eldho Mar Baselios, who was buried at the church, is a saint whose blessings are on the entire town,” he added.

Though the Samiti respects the SC verdict, it has not done justice to people belonging to various religions in the town. They do not want the church to be closed down. If closed down, it will be a bad day for Kothamangalam, Mr. Naushad observed.

However, senior priest Father Thomas Paul Ramban, who is tipped to take over as the vicar once the church is handed over to the Orthodox group, said it was all an artificial alliance and not a spontaneous coming together of people in the town. He said political leaders, who initially supported the Samiti, had withdrawn, and that it was controlled by members of the Jacobite faction. “It is not a spontaneous movement but is being publicly portrayed as such,” said another senior Orthodox priest.

Father Thomas Paul said the Orthodox group was not bothered about the Samiti. The Jacobites cannot claim the church to be theirs because the Malankara church split is recent, while the church is more than 330 years old, and the parish was under the Orthodox faction between 1958 and 1974, he claimed. He also said there was serious rivalry between groups within the Jacobite faction.

Samiti general convenor A.G. George, who is also the municipal vice chairman, justified the formation of the Samiti, claiming that Kothamangalam became a prosperous town because of the Cheriyapally and activities centred on the church.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cheriyapally-is-the-light-of-kothamangalam-says-samiti/article30628789.ece
328,2020/01/23,PCB warns of action against polluting units,"The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has warned all industrial units along the Eloor-Edayar industrial belt against discharging treated or untreated effluents into the Periyar River.

“These managements will face stringent action as per norms under the Environment Act and the Water Act for polluting the river,” said a senior official of the board.

The move comes in the wake of fish kill reported in Muttarpuzha near Manjummel on Saturday. The warning was issued considering the fact that dumping of effluents would severely affect the ecological status of the river, especially after water flow was found decreasing.

PCB officials said fine would be imposed on industrial units found discharging treated or untreated effluents into the river, as part of recovering environment compensation.

It has also cautioned local bodies along the river to complete the remedial steps proposed to check the rampant pollution of the river. “The board is well aware that food and other biodegradable waste from five municipalities, including Aluva and Kalamassery, is being taken to the Kochi Corporation’s dump site at Brahmapuram, which lacked scientific facilities for treatment of biodegradable waste,” the officials said.

The board reminded that cases were under the consideration of the National Green Tribunal as per proceedings on the original application 514/19 on the tribunal’s principal bench, New Delhi, and original application 533-535 of 2018 under the Chennai Bench.

“A case is pending at the NGT Chennai Bench in original application 673/18 [polluted river stretches in the country] for which a specific action plan for the Periyar River was submitted in time by the board. The deadline issued to local bodies along the river for implementing rectification measures has already passed,” said board officials.

On the reduced water flow in the river, the officials said the NGT had issued specific orders to the Irrigation Department to maintain minimum flow. However, no action was found taken to regulate the flow and ensure proper flushing of pollutants, they added.

Irrigation Department officials said the shortage of water at the Bhoothathankettu barrage had affected water supply in areas of Ernakulam fed by the Periyar Valley Irrigation Scheme. Since the canals flow into the Kadambrayar and the Periyar, water shortage could lead to a reverse flow of saline water and a consequent increase in salinity in the two rivers, they added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-warns-of-action-against-polluting-units/article30628777.ece
329,2020/01/23,Municipality comes under SLMC scanner,"The Kalamassery Municipality is yet again under the scanner of the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management (SLMC), constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), for its “failure” to prevent the flow of sewage from the municipal market and the solid waste dump site at North Kalamassery.

The SLMC has warned of slapping additional penalty on the civic body for not taking steps to check the flow of untreated sewage into Muttarpuzha, a tributary of the Periyar. The committee is likely to issue notice to the municipality seeking its reply on why environment compensation should not be collected from it for its failure to comply with norms.

The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) had slapped a penalty of ₹2.47 crore as environment compensation on the local body in December for its failure to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

The follow-up action was necessitated after SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, who had taken stock of the environment degradation of the Periyar during his visit here on December 18, expressed concerns over the increasing flow of untreated sewage into the river. According to PCB officials, Mr. Pillai reiterated that directives would now be issued to municipalities and other local bodies responsible for polluting the river to pay additional penalty.

The SLMC and the PCB had pulled up the municipal authorities on several occasions last year after they were found sitting on various recommendations made in accordance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The inordinate delay in setting up a sewage treatment plant (STP) figured top among the pending projects. The plant has to be set up in accordance with the directives of the NGT that had asked local bodies to introduce scientific measures to treat sewage.

The NGT-appointed committee had remarked in June that the discharge of untreated sewage from Kalamassery township, waste water from Kalamassery market, and leachate from the civic body’s waste dumping yard at North Kalamassery had resulted in fish kill in the Periyar. It had asked the municipality to accord top priority to implementing the interim orders of the Kerala High Court on solid waste management by coming up with a detailed action plan.

Shiny Antony, chairperson of the health standing committee, Kalamassery Municipality, said tender proceedings would be initiated to carry out bio-mining of legacy waste at the dump site at North Kalamassery. “We have also finalised tender for setting up a sewage treatment plant at the market in this Plan period itself,” she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/3lslkg/article30628739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-MUTTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/municipality-comes-under-slmc-scanner/article30628740.ece
330,2020/01/23,"Singapore Daisy could spell doom, warn experts","The move to plant Singapore Daisy, one among the world’s 100 worst invasive alien species, in the operational area of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), has drawn flak from experts.

The plant bearing bright yellow flowers spreads like a green mat and could cause ecological and economic loss, warned experts.

CIAL had earlier this month floated tender for “supplying, planting, maintenance and establishment of Wedelia trilobata [Singapore Daisy] in the operational area” of the airport at ₹1.3 crore.

The plant, according to CIAL officials, will be planted in 60 acres.

It is aimed at breaking the food cycle of animals in the region and to bring down the presence of birds in the airport area. It is from the perspective of passenger safety that the planting has been suggested, a CIAL spokesperson said.

The species is used as an ornamental variety in many international airports. CIAL decided to go for it after consultations with the Kerala Agriculture University. The species will be planted in the enclosed environment of the operational area. Since it is proposed to be planted in the confined area of the airport, it will not escape to other habitats, reasoned the spokesperson.

However, experts in invasive species management refused to buy the argument.

The species, which can pose serious environment and biodiversity threat, has found mention in the list of invasive species prepared by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board and the Handbook of Invasive Species of Kerala. It was also featured in the list of Invasive Alien Plants in the Asia Pacific region, said K. Sankaran, an invasive species consultant to the FAO.

In the Kerala handbook, the species was included in the red category, considering the high risk posed by it. The plant, which might have been inadvertently introduced to the country, will destroy crops and reduce water and soil fertility of the region, said Dr. Sankaran, also a former director of the Kerala Forest Research Institute.

Soni Scaria, associate professor in the department of botany, St. Berchman’s College, Changanassery, said the herb would destroy local habitats, besides chocking waterbodies. It has been found that the plant can escape from gardens and form dense ground cover and prevent the regeneration of other species. It will also hit crop yields, he added.

The plant can spread at an alarming rate. Most swamps in the Asia Pacific region have been covered by the plant. India is a signatory to the Paris accord to prevent the spread of invasive plants and hence the project should be dropped. Several countries have started implementing plans to eradicate it, said Dr. Scaria.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/singapore-daisy-could-spell-doom-warn-experts/article30628705.ece
331,2020/01/23,The cadence of spoken word,"All India Forward Bloc architect Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and his equally illustrious elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose have been the subjects of two successively released books in recent years, namely Sisir Kumar Bose’s Subhas and Sarat: An Intimate Memoir of the Bose Brothers, and Madhuri Bose’s The Bose Brothers and Indian Independence.

While historian Leonard Abraham Gordon’s 1990 account Brothers Against the Raj is widely considered Netaji’s definitive biography, these new books are invaluable insider accounts — Sisir is Sarat’s son, and Madhuri is his granddaughter from his other son Amiya Nath Bose. In fact, her volume draws extensively from letters exchanged between Amiya and his father and uncle, who were indelible formative influences in his life.

Last evening, on Netaji’s 123rd birth anniversary, the Playpen Performing Arts Trust privately staged a rehearsed reading of their new play, The Bose Legacy: Inked Through Letters, directed by Nikhil Katara. A similar public showing will be held today. The play has its provenance in Madhuri’s book, and the reams of research material that she has enterprisingly made available to Playpen, which Katara and co-writer Himali Kothari have structured into a fresh and original telling of events from one of the most tumultuous phases of Indian history, and the nationalist (in the pre-Independence sense of the word) family caught up in its swirl.

Form and format

“While we do use material from the letters verbatim, we’ve also created conversations and other interactions between the principals,” says Kothari on the play’s ostensible reliance on an epistolary format. Speeches, press articles, radio broadcasts, have all contributed to the textual texture of the piece. Central to the storytelling is Amiya’s changing gaze, young and impressionable at first, but later fortified by ideals that are very much his own. “We have very carefully selected extracts that would help us build a compelling story for contemporary audiences,” explains Katara. The play itself covers several decades over five chapters ending with an Independent India, with Amiya’s coming into his own likely becoming a metaphor for a country being painfully birthed. Both writers were struck by the flesh-and-blood Netaji they encountered while trawling through archival material. “I feel that what we are taught about him in our history-books does not accurately capture who he really was,” says Katara. “I discovered a surprisingly poetic and compassionate side to him that I wouldn’t have associated with him.”

Katara has assembled an interesting roster of collaborators. Some have previously worked with him in his prolific ‘Readings in the Shed’ series, that is now a permanent fixture in the city’s cultural calendar, with 20-odd showings in less than two years — each specially curated evening of readings that work its head around a topical theme. This could be the stories of refugees, writings on queer issues, compelling pieces on climate change, or simply exemplary works of literature that lend themselves well to the characteristic cadences of spoken word.

Step by step

The performative reading of The Bose Legacy includes dramatic narrative elements and live interaction between actors. This is just one step in its journey. It is slated to première as a more fully realised piece of theatre in February at the National Centre for the Performing Arts. This is the trajectory that Playpen had followed with Mahesh Dattani’s production of Shanta Gokhale’s Mengoubi - The Fair One, based on Manipuri civil rights activist Irom Sharmila. Rehearsed readings, both with focus groups and for the public, were followed by the diligent collation of audience responses, which likely fed into the making of the play itself. It is a process that makes good use of the esprit de corps that’s part of the city’s experimental theatre ethos but not always visible to the naked eye.

Playing Netaji is Asmit Pathare, an intrepid light designer turned director turned budding actor, while Shaun Williams and Santanu Ghatak — a singer in his own right, so some crooning might be on the cards — play his elder brother and nephew respectively. Providing the live soundscape for the outing is talented actor-cum-musician Keith Sequiera. “The tension in the letters, and their emotional journey has been very effectively dramatised through sound and music by Keith,” adds Katara.

The Bose Legacy will be staged at the St. Andrew's Centre for Philosophy & Performing Arts this evening at 7.30 p.m.; for details see bookmyshow.com",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/tbx6rd/article30636200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bm-pg5-Theatre-Asmit-and-Shantanu-in-The-Bose-Legacy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/the-cadence-of-spoken-word/article30636201.ece
332,2020/01/23,Navigating the concrete jungle,"In Delhi, we have seen most of the plays of playwright Girish Karnad. However, his “Boiled Beans on Toast” was staged for the first time in Delhi by Final Year students of National School of Drama at Abhimanch auditorium recently.

Mythology, history and folk theatre are the main source of Karnad's creative world, as a dramatist. Arguably, in the play under review, he depicted human condition in a metropolitan city for the first time. In terms of structure and tone, it transports us to a concrete jungle, inhabited by people who belong to different social classes with different motives and social consciousness. Most of them suffer from insecurity, nursing the illusion to make it big in a class divided society. Each class has a story to tell about its ambitions, hardships and struggle.

The play, “Uble Daane Toast Par” in Padmavati Rao's Hindi translation, opens in the house of a successful businessman, a self-made man. His wife and her friend Dolly are seen talking about some social issues. Simultaneously, we watch a smart domestic help performing routine domestic chores swiftly, skilfully, enjoying herself while doing her work. She has won the confidence of the lady of the house.

Unconventional character

At another space, Kunaal is engrossed in playing his musical instrument who is hardly bothered about family business. In a brief conversation with his mother, it is suggested that he is a rebel against values and ethics of a business house and conventional sexual norms. Enters Prabhakar, a young man who is in a hurry and desperate to impress his employer. He requests to meet the head of the family, his employer, who has asked him to meet him at his residence for an urgent work.

Having hailed from a rural area, he has got this job only recently and is staying with his wife in the city, dreaming of a bright future. When told that the boss is away from home for business purpose, he is disappointed. Dolly observes this ambitious young man, comes closer to him, praising him for his intelligence and dynamism, promising to provide him with great opportunity he is truly cut for. The mirage Dolly projects before Bhaskar mesmerises him. He leaves his job, sells his land and forces his wife to go back to village as he is going abroad. This misadventure ruins him. In a violent confrontation with Dolly, he demonstrates that he is ruined but not broken.

In the denouement, the focus is on Kunaal interacting with her mother. The mother was once a singer who lost her ability to sing. She meets a young man, and regains her singing ability. Their relationship ends after a few years. The mother remains silent when Kunaal asks some uncomfortable questions about the nature of the relationship between his mother and the young man. However, she replies in a candid manner, ""He left her saying there is no point in staying with a married woman."" The scene is treated in a restraint manner, revealing the disillusioned, lonely, bored and empty life of the rich in a metropolis.

Dramaturgy is by Himanshu Joshi who interpreted the script to the performers in the rehearsals. The play is directed by Robijita Gogoi with sensitivity. The set, designed by Rajesh Singh, reflects ingenuity both in conception and execution. There are multi-focus points which allow more than one scene to be staged at the same time. Though there are several layers, shifting of action from one layer to another is seamless. Upstage, at the height of nearly ten feet, there is a platform. On this space are set scenes where the shady world of urban lumpen elements are enacted. This space is also used to watch the race to create the illusion of fast racing horses in the distance. The mise-en-scene enables the director and her dedicated student cast paint characters, their eccentricities, morbidity and illusions with intensity and dramatic force.

Paalin Kabak as Kunaal creates the portrait of a rebel youth with subtle touches. Masood Qadir Malik’s Prabhakar displays tenacity to rebuild his fate in the metropolis despite being ruined by a sadistic lady of high society. Payal Amar Pande as the shrewd and smart domestic help and Amir Khan as a policeman give highly satisfying performances.

333,2020/01/23,A play on Nani Palkhivala,"One of India’s most prominent economists and jurists was Nanabhoy ‘Nani’ Ardeshir Palkhivala. On his centenary birth anniversary (January 16), the Dummies Drama troupe inaugurated its new play, ‘Dharaniyin Perumai’ (translates to “The pride of the world”), a docu-drama of Nani Palkhivala (their second docu-drama play after ‘Vaayu’). The two-hour play, staged at Mylapore Fine Arts, covers several important aspects in Nani’s life, from his childhood till his seventies.

First, we are introduced to Nani’s family — his parents, brother and sister. Right from his childhood, Nani is shown to be a voracious reader of books. By the time he has become a young adult, Nani has earned a Master’s degree in English literature, and in the process, overcomes his stammer. Despite his initial aversion to law, Nani eventually enrols at the Government Law College in Bombay and becomes an excellent barrister, with his remarkable presentation skills and memory. He also authors The Law and Practice of Income Tax, which has since become a primary reference for the Indian Tax Code.

From the late 1950s, Nani becomes famous for his budget speeches and also for being a strong defender and protector of the Indian Constitution (including the famous 1973 case, when the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 368 of the Constitution “does not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution”). The play ends with Nani being conferred Padma Vibhushan.

With nearly 40 actors portraying different characters — including most of Dummies regulars — this is the largest crew the troupe has put together for a play. Lead actor Sridhar — who also supervised the set design — was all praise for the backstage crew. He also said that while Sreevathson gave instructions on acting, he did allow them freedom to use their own mannerisms and creativity. This is also the first time different actors have played the same character — Srijith, Prasanna and Sridhar portray Nani at various stages of his life. Although most of Dummies’ plays employ simple household settings, now and then they manage to impress the audience with extraordinary set pieces (as they did in ‘Hanuman’ and ‘Vaayu’). ‘Dharaniyin Perumai’ is yet another example where elaborate sets are used.

The most challenging task in making a biopic or a docu-drama, according to this writer, is to decide what to present and in how much detail. Director Sreevathson has done a commendable job in depicting the life of Nani while covering most of the important events in his professional career, as well as giving enough time for key incidents in his personal life, especially the “rivalry” he had with Indira Gandhi (a sublime performance by Prema Sadasivam). Look out for some biting exchanges as the two face off in a battle of wits. Prema, who played Indira Gandhi, found it relatively easy to adjust to the role because she has portrayed the same character in ‘Vaayu’ as well, and being a lawyer by profession enabled her to be comfortable with all the technicalities. She also credited Sreevathson for giving her enough freedom to experiment with the body language and also for the way he maintained the right balance between sticking to the facts while also using imagination to make the tale exciting.

Sreevathson also maintains the right balance between sticking to the facts while also using creativity to make the tale exciting. The dialogue is a strength — with a touch of humour and occasional punchlines, which one would find in most of Dummies’ plays. Nani’s “Law must win, not lawyers” and “We're not an underdeveloped country; we're ruled by underdeveloped minds” would be two of my favourite quotes.

In an aside, Sreevathson said that he worked for nine months on the script, doing intense research. Being a fan of Nani after listening to his budget speeches in the mid-1980s, Sreevathson’s main aim was to inspire and create an awareness of this great personality among today’s generation through his play. “I hope that those who watch the play get intrigued enough to read about Nani on their own,” he said. He plans to make the play entirely in English and take it across India in the future.

‘Dharaniyin Perumai’ is certainly one of Dummies’ more ambitious projects, but the packed audience and their support indicate that it has paid off well. With an engaging script and brilliant performances by Prasanna and Sridhar, the play serves as a good source of entertainment while also being highly informative.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/xqv67t/article30633679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FRPLAY1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a-play-on-nani-palkhivala/article30633683.ece
334,2020/01/23,"‘I regret not having done much acting,’ says Nadira Babbar","She sits calmly in the living room amidst the noise of the renovation work going on in a part of her large bungalow, aptly named Nepathya (backstage). But Nadira Zaheer Babbar can hardly be relaxed. Earlier in the afternoon, she had a meeting with a publisher for another volume of her plays. Her group Ekjute’s new play Khajoor Mein Atakaa (directed by longtime associate Hanif Patni) is due to open in a few days, while she is already working on two plays she is writing. Besides keeping track of the household and her actor-children, Aarya and Juuhi, she loves to spend time with her grandson.

Nadira Babbar started writing plays because at some point in Ekjute’s journey, she found herself looking for new material. She wrote a one-man show, Dayashankar Ki Dairy, and cast Ashish Vidyarthi, followed it up with another solo, Sakubai, starring Gujarati stage doyenne, Sarita Joshi (which are still being performed a decade later), and then her pen never stopped. She has written over 15 plays so far, and directed a lot more, from the time Ekjute was established in 1981 in Delhi. She moved with husband Raj Babbar to Mumbai in 1988, and since then the group has been active staging plays in Mumbai and travelling extensively.

One of them, on Indian mythology is still a work in progress, but she is willing to talk about the other — a play on the life of actor-filmmaker Satish Kaushik. “When we came to Mumbai, other fellow National School of Drama graduates followed soon after. Among them were Satish Kaushik, Raja Bundela, Rajesh Puri and Alok Nath, but Satish has maintained a closeness with us. His life has had interesting ups and downs, right from his growing up in Karol Bagh, to overcoming the drawback of his looks with his talent, and making a success of his career. I am not interested in his personal life, what is important is the positivity, the goodness of a human being.”

She has written a play, Meri Maa Ke Haath, about the life and times of her parents, the eminent writers Razia and Sajjad Zaheer, in which she starred, and it was, one of the few plays directed by someone from outside the group — Makrand Deshpande. “I couldn’t direct myself, and it is difficult for me to surrender to another director, so I called him. He said, ‘Direct for Ekjute? Why?’ I said I want to act in this play, that’s why. And he said zaroor karunga (I will definitely do it). I have always admired his work, but the group was a bit wary, because he has such a different personality. He turned out to be so straightforward, warm. loving and down-to-earth. Another director I would like to work with is Feroz Abbas Khan, but he is on another level. Whenever somebody else is directing a play for our group, I try to stay away as much as possible.”

Has she not considered a play about her own life with Raj Babbar? “Who would I cast as Raj?” she wonders, and then adds, “What we went through in our marriage is no longer important. I never dwell on it. What matters more is that I read, write, think, direct plays and meet inspiring people.”

Nadira has also written several plays on social issues, and rues the fact that today, audiences want to see only comedies, “Theatre has to contribute in some way or the other to happenings in society, otherwise, what’s the point of doing plays?”

The plays she performed in, like Sandhya Chhaya and Begum Jaan were acclaimed, but she says that if she regrets something it is her acting getting neglected. “It is my biggest strength, but I was so busy managing the group, I could not worry about which role to give myself. Comedy is my forte, and I never got a chance to do one. I feel bad I did not act in Sakubai. It was just the second play that I had written, and I did not have the confidence to direct as well as act. Now I wish to write a play in which I can act too.”

Of the plays she has written, she is fond of Yeh Ja Bombay Meri Jaan about film aspirants (or strugglers as they are known) , however, Sakubai, about the caustic observations of a Mumbai bai (domestic worker) about her employers, remains one of her most popular plays. It has been performed by other actresses, mostly, as she says, without her permission…people do my plays without informing me, so they don’t have to pay! “Only one of them in Delhi (Monika Misra) actually had the courtesy of inviting me,” she says

Ekjute tours a lot with their plays. “ The audience in small towns is growing, the auditoriums are also getting better — the rest rooms are still horrible though — the organisers should improve the facilities. They treat theatre people callously. We don’t demand five star accommodation or banquets, but at least give decent rooms and edible food, show that much respect. We have to fight all the time. Recently, they had booked us on a 2.30 a.m. train, in the height of winter, and did not even provide transport, The group had to get into three autos with the luggage. This sort of treatment does not augur well for theatre and causes anger and resentment in the group.”

336,2020/01/23,‘Extremist outfits will not be part of anti-CAA protest’,"Extremist and communalist organisations will not be part of the ‘Manushya Mahasringhala’, a human chain across the State, being planned by the Left Democratic Front against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on January 26, CPI(M) Kozhikode district secretary P. Mohanan has said.

He told the media here on Thursday that the protest against the CAA was part of the resistance against attempts to set up a religious nation state. Involving organisations which had similar political objectives in the protest would question its credibility. “Only through secular means such protests can be held. Years ago when a section of people came up with the slogan ‘India’s salvation through Islam’, another section had replied with a slogan ‘Islam’s end in India’,” he said.

Mr. Mohanan claimed that members of the minority communities were apprehensive about the implications of the legislation and had come forward to support the protests staged by the Left. “Even those who had distanced themselves from our party in the past were seen participating in our public meetings,” the CPI(M) leader said.

In Kozhikode district, the human chain would be formed on an 83 km-long route from Poozhithala on the northern side to Aikkarappadi that is on the border of Malappuram district. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution would be read at 4 p.m. on the day and an oath to protect the constitution would be read out, Mr. Mohanan added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/extremist-outfits-will-not-be-part-of-anti-caa-protest/article30635321.ece

The new campus, spread across 15 acres, has a total built-up area of 3 lakh sq ft. Water, soil and energy conservation measures have been extensively adopted in Phase V, owing to which the campus has been certified with ‘Five Star’ rating under GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment), an initiative of the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).

Solar energy of 50 kWp (Kilo Watt Peak) is also being harnessed on the campus. Additionally, a rainwater harvesting pond has been developed for catering to the water requirements of the whole campus. Besides, the campus boasts rainwater storage tanks with 40 lakh litre storage capacity and these have been provided under the campus buildings so as to meet any emergency requirement. A sewage treatment plant has been established on the campus for treating effluents which can be used for toilet and washroom flushing besides gardening and irrigation purposes.

Additionally, the classrooms also boast cloud-based conferencing, streaming and audio-conferencing facilities with both wired and wireless presentation capability. Students with access credentials will be able to participate in the classroom sessions virtually from anywhere in the world.

338,2020/01/23,New BJP district chiefhas his work cut out,"Newly elected BJP district president V.K. Sajeevan has said that his first priority is to address the concerns of the minorities, especially the Muslim community, about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Both the ruling Left Democratic Front and the Opposition United Democratic Front, Mr. Sajeevan said, were not only spreading falsehood but also creating a fear psychosis in the name of the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR). “Kozhikode has been the hub of the anti-CAA and anti- NPR protest in Malabar. One of the reasons for the apprehension is that the government machinery has been widely misused for these protests,” he said.

Mr. Sajeevan said the second priority for him is to rejuvenate the party for the upcoming local body elections. Although the network of the BJP is strong in the district, the party has not been able to make worthwhile electoral gains. “Now a conscious effort has to be made to fight the polls,” he said.

However, he has his work cut out in Kozhikode to keep factional politics at bay. The party had not been able to garner votes despite matching campaigning with its rivals in the recently held polls.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has increased its vote share in both the parliamentary seats of Kozhikode and Vadakara. But its performance was not as impressive as the Assembly polls in 2016.

The party fared better in the 2015 local body polls in the district as well as civic body polls such as Kozhikode Corporation winning seven divisions. Now Mr. Sajeevan has a daunting task to increase its presence not only in the Corporation but also in other municipalities as well in the district.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/new-bjp-district-chiefhas-his-work-cut-out/article30634691.ece

341,2020/01/23,Government contractors threaten to launch protest,"Government contractors have threatened to launch an agitation by boycotting the work tenders in protest against the government’s attitude towards them.

The All Kerala Government Contractors Association (AKGCA) said here on Wednesday that the government’s finding fault with the contractors was baseless when the former owed more than ₹4,000 crore by way of arrears to the contractors. AKGCA State working president K.C. John accused Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran of not only harming the contractors but also insulting them by spreading false statements.

He said the government was keen to hand over contract work to corporate firms and labour societies, by ignoring small-time contractors. AKGCA district secretary P.E. Thankachan and vice president Abdul Azeez urged Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac to keep the promise he made to the contractors that the State would pay them the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board funds. “Why is Dr. Isaac silent now? Even Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s silence on this matter is deplorable,” they said. AKGCA treasurer N.P. Chacko said PWD engineers had adopted a ‘go slow’ strategy against the Minister’s threats of suspension. “Because of that, we are unable to complete our work in time,” Mr. Chacko said, adding they were facing a situation where they could not get bank loans or cement, steel and tar from the government.

342,2020/01/23,Corn growers seek relief for crop loss,"Farmers who have suffered extensive crop damage in the recent north-east monsoon have urged the State government to compensate their loss.

Raising the issue in the grievance meeting here on Thursday, farmer Maharajan of MDMK, by showing rotten corn to Collector Sandeep Nanduri, who was chairing the meet, said agriculturists, who had cultivated rain-fed crops, especially corn, had suffered extensive loss due to downpour during the monsoon. The government should bail out farmers by giving them due compensation.

Mr. Sandeep said officials had surveyed affected areas and a comprehensive report on crop damage had been forwarded to the government, which would take appropriate decision.

When farmers complained about disbursal of varied insurance benefits for corn cultivated in different villages, he said the quantum of insurance benefit would be calculated based on the yield so that insurance benefit would naturally differ from place to place.

“If the insurance firm had given different insurance benefits to farmers of the same village, we’ll look into it and get it corrected as agriculturists from the same village cannot get different yield. At the same time, the quantum of insurance benefit given in one revenue village cannot be compared with that of other,” he said.

When farmers from Savalaaperi and Mela Eeraal said the insurance firm had neglected their villages in disbursing the insurance benefits though they had paid the premium, the Collector promised them that he would speak to the firm to ensure early disbursal of benefits.

He informed that the insurance benefits for green gram, black gram, chilli and onion growers would be disbursed within next 10 days and said the problems being encountered by farmers following the rechristening of Pandyan Grama Bank would be sorted out.

When a group of farmers complained that windmill firms were installing electric poles in their lands without getting their consent, none of the officials gave any reply to the affected farmers though the issue was being raised for the past three years.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/corn-growers-seek-relief-for-crop-loss/article30636102.ece

The camp at Palani was inaugurated by judicial magistrate Shanthi Chezhian and pamphlets were distributed to pilgrims.

Meanwhile, Collector M. Vijayalakshmi on Thursday inspected distribution of florescent wrist bands and reflecting sticks to pilgrims going to Palani on foot as part of preparatory work being carried out through village and town panchayats for the Thaipoosam festival.

344,2020/01/23,Plea for early reconstruction of culvert,"Traffic along Tiruchendur highway was hit for sometime on Thursday after a group of residents blocked the road demanding immediate reconstruction of a damaged culvert, which has been removed to enable construction of a new structure.

As damaged culverts in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai are being rebuilt, badly damaged road culvert across Pranthankulam in Manakaavalanpillai Nagar was removed two months ago to enable reconstruction of a new structure. As the construction got delayed even though materials were stored at the site, people using the culvert to reach Shanthi Nagar, Nehru Street, Kennedy Street, Thirumalai Street and ration shops are being forced to use a circuitous route which consumes more time.

Agitated over the delay, the locals blocked traffic on Tiruchendur highway at Manakaavalanpillai Nagar. The police had to divert vehicles through alternative routes. After corporation officials and the police held talks with the protesters and assured that the construction would commence within a week, the agitation was withdrawn.

345,2020/01/23,Missing youth’s body exhumed,"The body of a young man, who went missing after he left his house on January 15, was exhumed from a secluded place near Paalkattalai under Thatchanallur police station limits on Thursday.

In connection with this murder, the police have picked up eight persons including friends of the deceased for interrogation.

The victim S. Masanamurthy, 27, an earthmover operator from Karaiyiruppu, who was working in the VOC Port in Thoothukudi, went missing after he had gone to a nearby farm on January 15. When he failed to return home in the night, his wife Krishnaveni and father Sudalaimuthu searched for him but in vain. Mr. Sudalaimuthu filed a complaint the next day. When there was a delay in tracing him, Ms. Krishnaveni submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish seeking her intervention.

Even as the investigation was going on, the police received information that Masanamurthy was murdered and buried in a secluded place near Paalkattalai, also under Thatchanallur police station limits. When the police visited a spot, they could see a heap of thorny bush kept on a newly closed pit and suspected that the body could have been buried there.

The police grilled Masanamurthy’s friend who reportedly told them that they had consumed liquor at Vaeppankulam to celebrate Pongal and he left the spot after Masanamurthy became senseless due to excessive consumption of alcohol.

Meanwhile, relatives of Masanamurthy blocked the Tirunelveli – Madurai Highway on Wednesday evening. After the police and revenue officials pacified them, the agitation was withdrawn.

Meanwhile, a pit was dug on Thursday in the presence of Assistant Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli, Sathish Kumar, and Tahsildar, Tirunelveli, Rajeshwari, The suspicion of the police came true that Masanamurthy’s body was buried there. Even as the waiting family members and relatives were wailing, the body with deep cut injury on the neck was exhumed around noon.

346,2020/01/23,Russ Foundation director challenges detention order,"Russ Foundation director M. Berlin Jose on Wednesday moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court challenging the detention order passed against him under the Goondas Act.

He and his employee John Prabhakar were both arrested on the charges of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl, an inmate of the home run by the foundation, and subsequently remanded in judicial custody. The private home at Thondaimanpatti, Madurai District, was sealed.

Earlier, his bail petition filed before the High Court Bench was dismissed after the court was informed that the provisions of Goondas Act had been invoked against him.

In his habeas corpus petition, Berlin Jose said the detention order was passed against him in a casual manner. Without any material or evidence on the allegation of sexual harassment, the detaining authority assumed that he was a threat to the society.

The detention order was passed relying on the ground that a case was booked against him by Chatrapatti police under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The detention order ought not to have been passed when he was already remanded in judicial custody, he said.

He sought a direction to set aside the detention order passed against him and set him at liberty. A Division Bench of Justices T. Raja and B.

347,2020/01/23,Art gallery throwing light on Sangam age remains hidden in the shadows,"Located opposite Gandhi Memorial Museum is an art gallery, Sanga Tamil Kaatchi Koodam.

The nondescript building houses several paintings, life-size sculptures and 3D murals depicting scenes from Sangam literature including Purananooru and Agananooru. The gallery, which has potential to become a major knowledge hub and find a prominent place in tourist itinerary, however, lies underutilised.

The gallery, built at a cost of ₹50 lakh, comes under the purview of World Tamil Sangam. It was inaugurated by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa through video conference in February 2016.

It showcases beautiful paintings depicting scenes from five ancient landscapes of the Tamil country: Kurinji (mountain), Mullai (forest), Marutham (agricultural land), Neithal (coastal region) and Palai (desert). “This gallery has the potential to become a great tourist attraction as we can explain to tourists that the Pandya kingdom was prosperous where all five landscapes flourished along the banks of the Vaigai,” said Vani C. Chenguttuwan, a regional-level guide.

The art house also has life-size statues of Tamil poets such as Avvaiyar and Kabilar and paintings and murals depicting important episodes such as King Adhiyaman gifting a nelli kani (amla fruit) to Avvaiyar.

“For students and those preparing for competitive examinations, the gallery will be useful to understand and learn about the Sangam period in a more interesting way,” said R. Saravanan, a staff.

However, on an average only around 10 persons visit the gallery every day. “Even those who visit Gandhi Memorial Museum do not come to the gallery,” said an official from the Department of Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture.

“Many tourists from Southeast Asian countries, especially from Malaysia and Singapore, are interested to learn about the Sangam age. However, when they visit the gallery, it is usually deserted,” said Ms. Chenguttuwan.

The main problem is lack of visibility as there is not even a name board in front of the gallery, said M. Mahendra Babu, Tamil teacher in a government school. “The paintings on a compound wall outside the gallery, indicating the facility, often go unnoticed. In the evenings, two-wheelers are parked in front of the gallery, restricting entry.”

Officials must conduct events, seminars and even competitions among school students to promote the gallery, said N. Sulaiman, former Regional Assistant Director, Department of Art and Culture.

They could also erect boards near Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Tirumalai Nayak Mahal and Gandhi Memorial Museum directing people to visit the gallery, he added.

The School Education Department can also make an annual visit to the gallery compulsory for students, suggested Mr. Babu.

Director (in-charge) of World Tamil Sangam P. Anbucheliyan said funds had been allocated from the department to renovate the gallery.

“A name board will be erected. Renovation works, including retouching of paintings and walls, will be undertaken,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ylm5tb/article30631007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA23-GALLERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/art-gallery-throwing-light-on-sangam-age-remains-hidden-in-the-shadows/article30631008.ece
348,2020/01/23,Madurai Corporation to relay around 250 roads,"After months of riding through pothole-ridden and unpaved roads, motorists can finally heave a sigh relief as new roads across the city will be laid by Madurai Corporation.

The civic body has proposed laying bitumen and paver block roads in around 250 stretches across the four zones of the city.

A total of ₹35.26 crore has been allocated for the project by the 14th Central Finance Commission (2019-2020). The laying of new roads will begin from the first week of February, said a senior Corporation official.

Roads that have been damaged due to laying of underground drainage and drinking water pipeline fall under the new project, a Corporation engineer said. “Roads laid before five years and stretches that received a lot of complaints were also identified,” said an official.

In Zone 1, new roads, including Thangarajan Salai (ward 5) and New Jail Road (ward 14), will be laid. In Zone 2, roads, including Anna Nagar West - 80 Feet Road (ward 34) and K.K. Nagar West- 80 Feet Road (ward 44), will be relaid. In Zone 3, Villapuram Cross Streets (ward 63) will be relaid. In Zone 4, roads, including Tiruvalluvar Main Road (ward 76), West Vadampokki Street and Salaimuthu Nagar, will be relaid.

Wards that were annexed to the Corporation in 2011 and located to the north of the Vaigai will not be included in the project as an underground drainage work will soo begin in those areas, said the official.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-corporation-to-relay-around-250-roads/article30631006.ece

The Brahmalashotsava of the temple will be performed on January 30. The Suvarna Dhwaja Prathisthe will be carried out on Friday. The Nagamandala as part of the celebrations will be organised on February 1. The Sahasra Koti Japa Yajna and the Sahasra Chandika Yaga will be performed on February 2 and February 3, respectively.

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, Member of Parliament and president of the State unit of the BJP Nalin Kumar Kateel said that about 700 well-known artistes will present cultural programmes during the celebrations.

He said that the temple management committee expects between 15 lakh and 20 lakh people during the celebrations. The dining area spread over 1.5 lakh sq ft can accommodate 15,000 people at a time.

Mr. Kateel said that 11 shops in front of the temple have been evacuated by giving due compensation to the owners and the Saraswati Bhavan building in front of the temple has been demolished for more space now. Hence, the area in front of the temple has now become spacious and can host car festivals without any hindrance.

Three more buildings in front of the temple will be evacuated by providing due compensation to the owners, he said.

The MP said that the State government had released ₹ 25 crore for improving infrastructure in the town. Under this, the main road leading to the town between Moorukaveri and Permude is being widened now at an estimated cost of ₹ 10 crore.

Ullanje Road has been developed at an estimated cost of ₹ 5 crore. Arasulapadavu Road is also being developed. In addition, a 3.5-km bypass road to the town linking Bajpe-Kinnigoli has been developed. Hence, vehicles on Bajpe-Kinnigoli can now operate directly without having to go inside the town.

Mr. Kateel said that more land in and around the temple is required for future projects. Hence, the temple is appealing to devotees to sponsor the cost of land as “bhu daana”. Under this arrangement, if a land owner near the temple is willing to sell land, devotees can pay the cost of such land directly to the seller and the land purchased can be donated to the temple. It will then become donation to the temple in the form of land.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/e5qb0e/article30628861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MNKATEEL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/brahmakalashotsava-fest-begins-at-kateel-durgaparameshwari-temple/article30628863.ece

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Shenoy said that organisation was opposed to CAA because it was discriminatory.

The CAA provided Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, Jains, and Christians, who fled persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh before December 2014.

The CAA also did not take into account the Tamils who had fled from Sri Lanka. It would be impossible for poor people to produce documents to show that their ancestors lived here.

The National Register of Citizens, though aimed at Muslims, would ultimately make life difficult for all people, especially the poor, he said.

351,2020/01/23,‘Project to bring Varahi water to Udupi will be completed by 2022’,"S.L. Dharme Gowda, Chairman of Legislative Council Petitions Committee, said on Wednesday that he had directed the officers of the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), the district administration, and the Udupi civic corporation to complete the ₹300-crore project to supply the Varahi water to Udupi city within the stipulated time. The officers have promised to complete the project by 2022, he said.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Gowda said that he and other members of the committee had visited all the spots connected with this project in Udupi district over the last two days.

He had told the officers that there should be no delay in the implementation of the project.

Earlier, this project had envisaged water being drawn from the Varahi to be brought and purified at Baje dam. But this would have deprived the villages en route of getting treated drinking water.

Hence, the committee had directed the officers to construct a treatment plant at Halady village so that the 23 villages coming under 13 gram panchayats would get drinking water.

As many as 4 acres of private land had been purchased for the construction of water treatment plant at Halady. The water will be pumped from the Varahi at Bharatkal supplied to Halady for treatment, he said.

The committee had also directed the officers to first lay the pipelines from Halady to Udupi and then take up the work of laying the road. It had been decided to take water from not just Varahi Right Bank Canal but also the Varahi. “It is the river water which is going into the sea which is being utilised for this purpose,” he said.

Quality pipelines and materials will be used for the project. This project will benefit the people of Udupi city for the next 50 years. The committee had also held talks with the farmers with regard to this project, he said.

“The committee has sought a report on the progress of the project once three months. Should there be any delay, the committee will visit the district and inspect the works. We will take appropriate action against officers responsible for the delay,” Mr. Gowda said.

“Reliance Jio has paid ₹195 crore for AGR. This includes advance money that company has paid for the month of January, 2020,” the source said.

The company has made a provision of ₹177 crore to pay for the government revenue share based on the Supreme Court judgement dated October 24, 2019.

Rivals of Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have cumulative liability of ₹88,624 crore and have sought more time from the Department.

The apex court has set January 23 as the deadline to pay the AGR dues.

353,2020/01/23,Volkswagen in Canada fined $149 million over diesel emissions,"A judge in Canada approved a C$196.5 million ($149.7 million) fine against Volkswagen AG on Wednesday after the company pleaded guilty to dozens of counts of diesel emissions violations.

Volkswagen was charged in December with importing nearly 128,000 vehicles into Canada violating emissions standards. VW pleaded guilty after being charged with 60 counts of breaching the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and providing misleading information.

The fine was by far the largest environmental penalty in Canadian history, prosecutors said.

“This resolution serves the public interest. It reflects the gravity of the conduct, and is consistent with Canadian sentencing principles,” said prosecutor Tom Lemon in a statement. “This is an unprecedented fine in Canada. It is 26 times greater than the highest federal environmental fine ever imposed.”

Prosecutors had proposed the fine to resolve the issue earlier on Wednesday.

“The resolution acknowledges the extensive measures by Volkswagen to make things right in Canada and strengthen its global compliance policies. The payment from the company will be used to support environmental projects nationally and in the provinces across the country,” Volkswagen said in a statement.

Volkswagen admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs. In May 2019, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities as it continued to face penalties and lawsuits around the world.

Last week, Polands consumer watchdog, UOKiK, said it was fining Volkswagen more than 120 million zlotys ($31.4 million) for misleading customers about the emissions of its vehicles.

Volkswagen previously agreed to spend up to C$2.4 billion ($1.8 billion) to buy back or fix 125,000 polluting diesels and compensate owners in Canada. Volkswagen previously paid C$17.5 million ($13.3 million) in penalties in Canada to resolve a Competition Bureau investigation.

354,2020/01/23,"Tesla passes $100 billion, teeing up big payout for Elon Musk","The meteoric rise of Tesla shares that recently pushed the company’s value over $100 billion could turn into a supercharged payday for CEO Elon Musk.

Stock in Tesla Inc. rose another 4.1% on Wednesday, pushing the market value of the electric vehicle and solar panel maker past a critical milestone in Musk’s pay package. He could get a stock options package worth over $371 million.

Tesla shares closed at $569.56 on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalization of $102.7 billion.

Shares have tripled in value since May, meaning Tesla’s market capitalization now exceeds the value of Ford and General Motors, combined.

For Musk, hitting $100 billion in market value triggers an option to buy 1.69 million shares of Tesla stock for $350.02 per share. If he sells the shares, he would make just over $371 million.

But for the options to vest, the market capitalization has to average above $100 billion for the next six months, and it has to be above $100 billion for the next 30 business days, according to the compensation packages detailed in company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk could get more stock payouts for every additional $50 billion increase in market capitalization. By meeting ambitious market capitalization and operational milestones, he could earn more than $50 billion over the next decade if that value hits $650 billion.

In the third quarter, Tesla posted a surprising $143 million profit, raising hopes that the company, which also makes battery storage units, could finally be turning the corner to profitability.

But Tesla has posted mostly losses during its first decade as a publicly held company, and it lost $1.1 billion during the first half of last year. The company reports fourth-quarter results on January 29.

Earlier this year the company said it delivered a record of about 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and about 367,500 for the full year in 2019.

Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, had earlier projected deliveries of between 360,000 and 400,000 units worldwide.

361,2020/01/23,WHO’s unexplained hesitancy,"As the novel coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in China, is spreading across China and three other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken to Twitter to keep the public updated. With Twitter not available in China, WHO has been regularly posting updates on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site. Unfortunately, WHO’s updates have come in dribs and drabs. The WHO website, including the coronavirus news page, was finally updated on January 21, four days after the last update. Even on Twitter, there seems to be some unexplained hesitancy on WHO’s part to retweet important information about the virus that is being tweeted by the WHO Western Pacific Region.

Major developments

When the WHO website was updated on January 17, the number of confirmed cases reported stood at 41 and deaths at two. The silence on the WHO website for four days became especially pronounced given some major developments. One, the number of confirmed cases increased. On January 21 morning, the WHO Western Pacific Region handle tweeted that the number of confirmed cases rose to 222 and the total number of deaths, all in Wuhan, stood at four. In the evening, the WHO website updated the number of deaths to six and total number of cases to 282. On January 22, China’s National Health Commission reported 440 confirmed cases and Chinese officials confirmed that the death toll had gone up to 17. Strangely, the WHO has neither tweeted nor posted on its website an update on the new cases or deaths.

Two, in China, the virus spread from Wuhan to 13 provinces — there are 26 confirmed cases in Guangdong province, 10 in Beijing and nine from Shanghai municipality. Apart from the two imported cases — one in Thailand and one in Japan, mentioned in the January 17 update — two more such cases, in Thailand and South Korea, were reported. Since the last website update on January 21, one imported case each has been reported from the U.S. and Taiwan.

Three, the WHO Western Pacific Region also tweeted that the number of confirmed cases in China includes 15 healthcare workers. The WHO had earlier tweeted that there was limited human-to-human transmission of the virus as those infected had not visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where the virus is suspected to have originated. At the time, no healthcare worker had been found infected. The confirmation that healthcare workers are also infected strengthens the evidence that the virus has already acquired the ability to spread among humans. Though more information is needed to understand the full extent of spread, these developments are significant.

It is taking into consideration all these factors that the WHO tweeted saying that it will be convening an Emergency Committee meeting on January 22 to “ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it”.

Twitter is an excellent medium to quickly disseminate information, particularly for the WHO which has 5.1 million people followers. Therefore, it is crucial for the WHO to retweet the important updates of the WHO Western Pacific Region handle (30.3K followers). It is also important for the WHO to keep its coronavirus ‘disease outbreak news’ page on its website regularly updated. It is surprising that the WHO does not consider sharing on its website the information it tweets considering that the website will be the first place people will check for the latest information.

Keeping people informed

On many occasions, the WHO has been accused of not acting on time, especially when new and dangerous viruses make thousands sick and kill many. While it has so far shown alacrity in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, it should not be found wanting in sharing information and updates on multiple platforms. Millions of Chinese are set to travel during the Lunar New Year holiday this week. In these circumstances, it is the WHO’s responsibility to ensure that everyone is fully informed.

362,2020/01/23,Untapped soft power: Why the film industry requires adequate government support,"Last year, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited the earnings of three blockbuster movies to dismiss the economic slowdown. He went on to suggest that the film industry is largely immune to the recession that is slowing down other major industries. He is right about this. A PWC report states that the media and entertainment industry outperformed expectations in FY19 and was amongst the fastest-growing sectors with a growth rate of 13%. India produces the maximum number of films in a year worldwide.

Despite this, it is still far from being recognised as an important sector for the government. Initially, under the Goods and Services Tax regime, the film industry was slotted under the ‘luxury’ category. A tax rate of 28% was imposed on it. After an outcry, this was revised to 18%. However, GST poses a challenge: if a particular movie appeals to a State government, that government can grant ‘tax free’ status to that film. With the GST in place, States can waive off the SGST (9%) alone. Therefore, a movie deemed ‘tax free’ is still be liable to pay CGST.

Lack of infrastructure and courses

Deeming the entertainment sector as a ‘luxury’ sector undermines its soft power. The president of the Producers Guild of India, Siddharth Roy Kapur, observed how the spread of American content helped create desirability for the American dream and way of life and how this further cemented the hegemony of the U.S. The soft power of the Indian industry is seen in the many public service messages and political campaigns that use film actors to propagate their messages.

Yet, India lacks the infrastructure to take films to interior areas. For a population of 1.37 billion people, India has less than 10,000 screens, of which 6,700 are single screens. The procedure to convert a single screen theatre to a multiplex is tedious and costly. New permission and licenses are required, and existing licenses often hold little value. In stark contrast, China has about 60,000 screens for a population of 1.4 billion. These were created over the last decade with government support in the form of public-private partnership models, which makes the country a viable market for foreign film industries as well. This has created revenue for the Chinese government as foreign films have to share a sizeable amount of their profit with the state. Ironically, films set in the interiors of India, such as Secret Superstar and Dangal, have more footfalls in China than they do here. A large portion of the Indian population does not have access to the content that is derived from them.

The Hindi film industry was accorded industry status only in 1998, even though the first Indian film was made in 1913. The industry employs a vast number of technicians and creative professionals. But there are no formal guidelines for courses related to the film industry. The government created the Film and Television Institute of India, but its curriculum is not binding on other private film schools. There are barely any government academies catering to the industry. In contrast, film education in the U.S. is accorded the same importance given to journalism or biotechnology.

Not enough incentives

Much like the U.S., India allows its States to decide incentives for film shoots that take place within their territories. American states provide incentives such as tax shelters, cash rebates and grants to productions taking place in their territories. During a film shoot, the location gains tourist attention. Films also generate seasonal employment by hiring local staff and parts of the crew. It is a lucrative venture to have a film shoot at site. It is because of this that countries like the U.K. and Malta provide incentives such as easy clearances and rebates upto 30-40% of the total cost of the projects filmed there. In India the incentives are much lower, and in most States the cash rebates are capped at nominal amounts which are not lucrative for big-budget productions. Moreover, though there is now a single-window clearance for shoots in many States, shooting at various spots such as archaeological sites requires multiple permissions and is a time-consuming and arduous process.

The film industry deserves more support for its growth and protection. With high export potential, the content created helps disseminate the uniqueness of India’s culture. Yet, there are hardly any support tools from the government. The risk may be high, but the returns are good. Various countries are realising this and working to either strengthen their content-creating industries or become viable destinations for hosting shoots. Tapping into the potential of this multi-seasonal industry opens a plethora of opportunities: from better international awareness about the country to creating employment opportunities within.

363,2020/01/23,Myanmar’s growing dependence on China,"Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Myanmar last week is a vivid indicator of the region’s changing geopolitics, reflecting adversely on the West and its allies. Its real significance transcends the 33 agreements signed, although it is an impressive number in itself for a short sojourn of a day and a half.

President Xi took his own time in coming to the southern neighbour which had to be content with largely one-way VVIP traffic, as Myanmar’s top leaders travelled to Beijing with noticeable regularity. As the Vice-President, he had visited Myanmar in 2009. The last visit by a Chinese President took place in 2001. The 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations was judged to be the ideal occasion to launch a major renewal and strengthen the process of the bilateral relationship.

U. Nu, the first prime minister of Burma (Myanmar’s previous name), famously depicted his country’s position in the region as “hemmed in like a tender gourd amongst the cacti.” Then, it chose the policy of independence and non-alignment. Does the red-carpet treatment extended to the President of China show that today’s Myanmar, jointly led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the military, has taken sides?

The optics may probably indicate this, considering how things have changed since 2012 when Barack Obama became the first sitting American President to visit Myanmar and initiate a historic rapprochement. The previous leader, President Thein Sein, played the U.S.-China game with dexterity, but the present leadership, hobbled by the Rohingya crisis and its own internal vulnerabilities, feels compelled to keep moving closer to Beijing.

The outcome

The joint statement, issued on January 18, claims that “a new chapter” has been opened “in the ever-lasting friendship” between the two countries, stemming from the broad understanding to promote “comprehensive strategic cooperation.” It refers to building the “Myanmar-China Community with a Shared Future.” Exchanges of “experience in governance” will be deepened and strategic communication will be enhanced. Besides, the two governments plan to make good use of the 2+2 high-level consultations, comprising the two Foreign Ministers and Defence Ministers.

A close reading of what the Chinese stated before and during the visit confirms that the traditional “pauk-phaw” (fraternal) ties between China and Myanmar are in full bloom now. An explicit stipulation is that the relationship should encompass not only the governments but also the two peoples. Mr. Xi emphasised that the goal was to craft “a new blueprint for bilateral ties.”

A major focus undoubtedly has been on the economic dimension of the relationship that goes beyond trade and investment, as China has been Myanmar’s top partner for years. In the domain of infrastructure, a sustained push is being given to turn into reality the proposed China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), a vital component of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Through the agreements signed and discussions held about their follow-up during the visit, CMEC’s three pillars seem to have been consolidated. These are: the Kyaukphyu special economic zone; the China-Myanmar border economic zone; and the new urban development of Yangon City. The basic approach, as Mr. Xi explained, is to deepen cooperation in diverse areas like “connectivity, electricity, energy, transportation, agriculture, finance and livelihood to deliver more benefits to both peoples.”

The Chinese also made it clear that the Myanmar government, currently under intense international pressure due to its rigid position on the Rohingya issue, will continue to receive China’s full support. Beijing has positioned itself as the great defender of Myanmar’s legitimate rights, interests and national dignity at a time when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is about to pronounce on the charges of genocide against the Myanmar military. As regards the Myanmar people, their grievances against some of the Chinese projects are getting addressed, with an unspoken agreement reached not to push the controversial Myitsone Dam project just yet.

Other implications

Mr. Xi’s conscious choice to spend ample time on discussions with Myanmar’s top three leaders — President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing — conveyed a significant message. Despite past endeavours, the leadership has failed to deliver on ethnic reconciliation or constitutional reform and transition to full democracy. The Chinese side seemed comfortable with the status quo and may have advised its continuation, given the external challenges. This may well suit the NLD government and its military partners, as the nation heads to the elections later in the year. As long as Ms. Suu Kyi does not excessively exert herself to bring full-fledged democracy, her return to power, albeit with a reduced majority, may be on the cards. Her brave defence of the military before the ICJ last December turned her into a national hero, even as she further lost her international following.

As to what happens to Myanmar’s traditional inclination towards neutrality and independent foreign policy, the government is apparently running out of friendly nations that could help it to balance China. The U.S., the European Union (EU) and Japan are unable or unwilling (or both) to play that role any longer. Kyaw Zaw Moe, editor of The Irrawaddy, asserts that the “pauk-phaw” relationship “doesn’t exist beyond political jargon.” Nevertheless, it is certain that Myanmar’s dependence on China will rise dramatically. The country should be getting ready to receive more Chinese tourists, projects, companies, products and “Chinese diplomats across the country”, as he put it.

Impact on India

The situation around India has taken an adverse turn in the recent months. Against the general backdrop of consolidation of China-Pakistan relations, Mr. Xi’s visit to Nepal, his strategic gains in Myanmar, and forthcoming visit of the Sri Lankan President to Beijing form part of a pattern. It is one of the setbacks and challenges to India’s diplomacy in South Asia. It calls for deep reflection and comprehensive consultations with the finest minds in the country.

364,2020/01/23,"Think climate change action, act glocal","Almost everyone agrees that the recent global climate summit, the annual Conference of the Parties (COP25), held in Madrid in December 2019, was a failure and that the multilateral process to address the climate crisis is broken. At several discussions on finance, ambition, transparency of support and pre-2020 action, wealthy countries were recalcitrant. Although responsible for using the bulk of the carbon space in the atmosphere, they now disavow their obligations, with some even denying anthropogenic climate change. At this stage, there is a complete severance of climate science from the negotiations and agreements at the global level. The question is, what can we do now?

The next COP will be held at Glasgow, U.K. (in late 2020) and there may be little change in the outcomes, as the global political order may not alter much. The fact that we live in an unequal and unjust world is not going to change either.

But the right political leaders could nudge action in a new direction. For example, younger members could be elected to the U.S. Congress and the Green New Deal could pass sometime in 2021. In the meantime, climate activism is increasing awareness and having some success in removing insurance and financial support for fossil fuel companies. But these kinds of changes will occur slowly.

At least one expert has called for a parallel action COP at future summits where sub-state actors, civil society groups, non-governmental organisations and academics can share ideas and nudge action. How such an alternate meeting will be integrated with policy processes is unclear, but it is an idea whose time has come.

State action plans

The stalemate at the global level offers India the opportunity to focus earnestly on developing its climate change action at State and sub-State levels, where the environment and climate continue to be relegated to peripheral status. Over decades, this has led to the destruction of ecosystems, forests, waterbodies and biodiversity. Numerous studies have shown the high economic and ecological costs and loss of lives due to extreme events. We do not need more data to stimulate action. As is also well recognised, India is extremely vulnerable to the effects of warming.

With support from bilateral agencies, States initially took different approaches in the first round of State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs). Some of them set up separate climate change cells while some collaborated with academic institutions. A few produced detailed action plans while others developed strategy documents. Still others integrated improvements in energy efficiency (contributing to reducing emissions), while almost all focused on adaptation.

Attention to climate change offers co-benefits to India for development. For instance: improving energy efficiency in industry reduces costs and local pollution; improving public transport reduces congestion, pollution and improves access; and using natural farming methods reduces fossil fuel-based fertilizers, improves soil health and biodiversity. These show that there are synergies in the steps to be taken for good development and climate change.

As the next round of the SAPCCs are being drawn up, under recommendations from the Centre, the focus ought to be on integrating the response to climate change with the development plan in different departments. Since the States together are to deliver the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that India has promised, it means that they require guidance from the Centre. Unfortunately, taking the lead from the Centre, most State government departments are handling climate change as a fringe issue and do not seem to recognise its urgency.

On integration

Line departments for government schemes and programmes in key development sectors, such as agriculture, transport and water, should be identified for carefully integrating actions that respond to climate change. This integration should also take place at district and sub-district levels. But only a demonstration of its success in some departments would show how this can be done. But first and foremost, States need to get the signal that climate is an urgent issue.

How funds for implementing SAPCCs will be obtained is not clear. There will not be enough from the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund and bilateral agencies to support all States unless new sources are found. The coal cess in India is a good initiative, and as others have pointed out, could be used for environment and climate-related expenses. Similar alternative sources from high emissions’ industries and practices would be an option, but still probably insufficient.

There also needs to be a clear analysis of how the first round of action plans fared. What were the challenges and how did they perform? Which approaches and projects were successful and ought to be scaled up and what lessons do the failures offer? Finally, what institutional structure works best?

If States are to develop SAPCCs that would ultimately add up to India’s NDCs, then the country needs reliable greenhouse gas inventories. Individual research groups and the civil society initiative, GHG Platform India, have been producing such inventories and would be useful in synchronising and co-ordinating State and Central mitigation programmes.

States must also develop their programmes with longer timelines, with mid-course correction based on lessons and successes that can be integrated into the next stage of the plan. If the second round of SAPCCs were treated as an entry point to long-term development strategy, the States and the country would be better prepared for climate change. Ultimately, climate should be part and parcel of all thinking on development.

365,2020/01/23,Playing with learning: On status of early childhood education,"The Annual Status of Education Report 2019 data on early childhood education in rural areas makes the case that the pre-school system fails to give children a strong foundation, especially in government-run facilities. Going by the findings, the percentage of girls in government schools is higher than in private institutions, the cognitive skills of children attending official anganwadi playschools do not match those attending private schools, and there is a significant percentage of underage children in the first standard of formal school, in violation of the stipulated age of six. It is beyond question that children will be benefitted greatly if they are provided a properly designed environment to acquire cognitive skills. These skills are critical to their ability to verbalise, count, calculate and make comparisons. What the ASER data sampled from 26 Indian districts seem to indicate is an apparent imbalance in State policies, which is disadvantaging the less affluent as anganwadis and government schools are poorly resourced. Official policies are also not strict about the age of entry, resulting in four and five year olds accounting for a quarter of government school enrolment, and over 15% in private schools.

Also Read Chalk and cheese in private vs. government schools

Substantive questions of pre-primary and early children education raised even by meagre surveys such as ASER call for a deeper look at how governments approach funding of institutions and teacher training for better outcomes. It is as important to let teachers feel invested in anganwadis as play-and-learn centres aiding children in acquiring cognitive skills, as it is to provide physical infrastructure. Building human resource capabilities would depend on teachers being recruited on the basis of aptitude, their training in credentialed colleges and assurance of tenure of service. It is unsurprising that in the absence of policies with strong commitment, according to the ASER data, two-thirds of those in the second standard cannot read a text at age seven that they were meant to read a year earlier. The performance only marginally improves for those in the third standard. There are similar inadequacies for numeracy skills. It is a paradox that students appear to fare somewhat better in private schools with poorly paid teachers. Nationally, the problem is of a weak educational foundation with little scope for creative learning in the three-to-six year age group, and a governmental system disinterested in giving children motivated, well-trained teachers. There is no dearth of literature on what works for creative teaching and learning, including from programmes such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Neither is there a lack of financial resources. What remains is for governments to show commitment to education.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-with-learning/article30627773.ece
366,2020/01/23,Ending inaction: On Speakers and disqualification,"There are two significant aspects to the Supreme Court’s latest decision on the Speaker as the adjudicating authority under the anti-defection law. The first is that Parliament should replace the Speaker with a “permanent tribunal” or external mechanism to render quick and impartial decisions on questions of defection. Few would disagree with the Court’s view that initial fears and doubts about whether Speakers would be impartial had come true. The second is its extraordinary ruling that the reference by another Bench, in 2016, of a key question to a Constitution Bench was itself unnecessary. The question awaiting determination by a larger Bench is whether courts have the power to direct Speakers to decide petitions seeking disqualification within a fixed time frame. The question had arisen because several presiding officers have allowed defectors to bolster the strength of ruling parties and even be sworn in Ministers by merely refraining from adjudicating on complaints against them. Some States have seen en masse defections soon after elections. Secure in the belief that no court would question the delay in disposal of disqualification matters as long as the matter was pending before a Constitution Bench, Speakers have been wilfully failing to act as per law, thereby helping the ruling party, which invariably is the one that helped them get to the Chair.

The reference to a larger Bench, in 2016 in S.A. Sampath Kumar vs. Kale Yadaiah was based on the landmark judgment in Kihoto Hollohan (1992) which upheld the validity of the Constitution’s Tenth Schedule, or the anti-defection law. This verdict had also made the Speaker’s order subject to judicial review on limited grounds. It made it clear that the court’s jurisdiction would not come into play unless the Speaker passes an order, leaving no room for intervention prior to adjudication. Finding several pending complaints before Speakers, the Bench, in 2016, decided that it was time for an authoritative verdict on whether Speakers can be directed to dispose of defection questions within a time frame. While fixing an outer limit of three months for Speakers to act on disqualification petitions, in the present case, Justice R.F. Nariman given four weeks to the Manipur Assembly Speaker to decide the disqualification question in a legislator’s case. He also held that the reference was made on a wrong premise. He has cited another Constitution Bench judgment (Rajendra Singh Rana, 2007), in which the Uttar Pradesh Speaker’s order refusing to disqualify 13 BSP defectors was set aside on the ground that he had failed to exercise his jurisdiction to decide whether they had attracted disqualification, while recognising a ‘split’ in the legislature party. As “failure to exercise jurisdiction” is a recognised stage at which the court can now intervene, the court has thus opened a window for judicial intervention in cases in which Speakers refuse to act. This augurs well for the enforcement of the law against defection in letter and spirit.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-inaction/article30627769.ece
367,2020/01/23,Government school students in city participate in student exchange,"For twenty students from the Chennai Middle School, MMDA Colony, the green, sprawling campus of the Government Hobart Higher Secondary School, its students and faculty played perfect hosts on Thursday.

The students were visiting the school in Royapettah for a partnership programme under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and had a day filled with interactions and activities.

“We are keen that the students here meet and interact with students from other schools. It is also interesting to see how they adapt and learn in a different environment. There are several positive things that the children can pick up from each other through an interaction like this,” said S. Kanmani, headmistress, Hobart School.

The exchange program initially used to be between government schools in rural and urban areas. But with students in both schools part of the exchange programme from schools in the city, the focus was more on their interaction and camaraderie.

Soon after the students from Chennai Middle School arrived, they joined hands with their hosts and planted trees on the campus. “The school here has a lovely campus and we had a class outdoors as well. We also visited the school’s library and interacted with the teachers here ,” said Mona Varshini, a class 8 student from Chennai Middle School.

The visiting students and faculty were also taken on a field trip to the Amir Mahal on Thursday evening.

Ayesha Siddiqua, a student of the Hobart school, said that twenty of them will be visiting the Chennai Middle School on Friday as a part of the exchange programme. “We're looking forward to visiting their campus and engaging in the activities they have planned for us,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/x0jorc/article30633795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/school,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/government-school-students-in-city-participate-in-student-exchange/article30633797.ece

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Advocate General Vijay Narayan would be the non playing captains of their respective teams.

On field, Chief Justice’s XI would be led by Justice M.M. Sundresh and the Advocate General’s XI would be captained by advocate V. Ramesh. Acclaimed cricketer L. Sivaramakrishnan would handover the trophy to the winners of the T-20 match in a ceremony to be attended by the Chief Justice, companion judges and advocates.

We will have to pull up our socks and ensure that we register a hat trick victory,” said Mr. Ramesh.

The first match between the judges and the lawyers began during the tenure of former Chief Justice Indira Banerjee (now a Supreme Court judge) and the second match took place during the stint of former Chief Justice Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani. This is the first match under the leadership of incumbent Chief Justice, he added.

372,2020/01/23,HC calls for report on removal of unauthorised religious structures,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know whether the State government had complied with an order passed by the Supreme Court, way back in February 2010, and formulated a comprehensive policy for removal, relocation or regularisation of unauthorised religious structures, constructed on streets, parks and other public places.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed the Chief Secretary to file a comprehensive report on the issue, by March 2, since the apex court had on January 31, 2018, ordered that the respective High Courts in the country should ensure effective implementation of the orders passed in 2010, with respect to all States and Union Territories.

The Bench, led by Justice Sathyanarayanan, came across the orders passed by the Supreme Court during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by Madurai Mavatta Devendra Kula Vellalar Uravinmurai Sangam, accusing the government of having denied permission to it for installing a statue of Sundaralinganar, at a roundabout close to the Madurai district court.

Since the petitioner association’s request to install the statue at the roundabout, situated right opposite the Periyar arch in K.K. Nagar, was denied citing reasons such as possibility of blocking the vision of motorists, it sought for a direction to the government to remove the statue of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, installed recently a few feet away from the roundabout.

The association insisted that the statue of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar should also be removed from the Goripalayam junction in Madurai city, since it was also reportedly causing traffic problems in the area, surrounded by the Government Rajaji Hospital, the American College and other prime commercial locations.

In reply, Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal told the court that the statue of Jayalalithaa was installed right next to an existing statue of her mentor, M.G. Ramachandran, and that both statues do not cause any obstruction to the motorists, according to officials concerned.

373,2020/01/23,HC informed of decision to delete ‘objectionable’ sentence from textbooks,"The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that it has decided to delete an “objectionable” sentence from the Class X social science textbook meant for State board schools. The sentence read: Hindu Mahasabha as well as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had taken a pronounced anti Muslim stance during the pre Independence era.

Justice P.D. Audikesavalu was told that the SCERT has also written to the Director of School Education as well as the Director of Matriculation Schools to ensure that the sentence was effaced, by pasting a sticker on top of it, from the textbooks that had already been distributed to the students. The Director of School Education, in turn, communicated the instruction to all Chief Educational Officers (CEOs) in the State.

The CEOs have been asked to share the information with headmasters of all schools under their control and make sure that stickers were pasted in all English as well as Tamil textbooks already distributed to the students. The sentence would not find place at all in textbooks to be printed in the future, the SCERT said and produced a copy of the communication sent by it to the directors.

The submission was made in response to a writ petition filed by P. Chandrasekaran, secretary of Chennai chapter of RSS, through his counsel S. Ravi. Asserting that RSS had only opposed the partition of the country on religious lines, the petitioner said this had been “falsely misinterpreted” to mean as if it had taken an anti-Muslim stance. “If such wrong messages are included in a textbook, it will lower the image of the organisation... and it is highly objectionable,” he added.

When the judge wanted to know whether the SCERT had filed its response in the form of an affidavit as ordered by him during the last hearing of the case, a government counsel produced a draft affidavit and sought time to file a fair copy.

After finding that the draft read as if the court had ordered for pasting stickers on top of the contentious sentence in the textbooks, the judge told the law officer: “The court never said, you must delete the sentence. In fact, the court did not issue any direction. It’s you who said the sentence will be deleted. How can you now say the court had issued a direction? Change this and file a proper affidavit by February 20.”

In the meantime, a counsel representing advocate V. Elangovan told the judge that S. Doraisamy, vice-president of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK), had filed an impleading petition objecting to the plea for deleting the sentence from the textbook and hence that petition may also be taken up for hearing along with the main case.

Filing an affidavit in support of his impleading petition, Mr. Doraisamy said that deleting the sentence from the textbook would amount to not allowing the schoolchildren to know a historical fact. “I state that the sentence in the above textbook is not false. It is a true historical fact. The younger generation should know the past history of the land. It should not be screened at the request of the writ petitioner,” he said.

Further, fearing that the State government might concede to the plea for deleting the sentence due to closeness between the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the TPDK leader said, “Hence, I am a just and necessary party to the above writ petition and I may be impleaded as party respondent.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-informed-of-decision-to-delete-objectionable-sentence-from-textbooks/article30629214.ece

The time frame for completion is 45 months, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in reply to a Right to Information query.

According to the reply from the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY)-III of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, JICA funding has been sought for the facility in Madurai and the process is continuing.

The Cabinet had approved setting up a new AIIMS in Madurai at a cost of ₹1,264 crore. Pre-investment activities are on at the site, it said.

The Centre had announced establishment of AIIMS in Madurai district as part of phase-V in the 2015-2016 Budget. So far, it released ₹5 crore, the reply said. Twenty-two AIIMS are being set up across the country through PMSSY. In a release issued by Press Information Bureau in November 2019 on the status of new AIIMS under the scheme, loan agreement for AIIMS Madurai is likely to be signed by September 2020 subject to approval of the Government of India and Government of Japan.

In a letter to party cadres on Wednesday, Mr. Stalin said: “As far as the DMK is concerned, 2020 is an election year. We will reap the benefits of hard work all of us put in this year. Everyone should keep that in mind and work hard. If we are on the field all through the year, victory is surely ours in 2021,” Mr. Stalin said. He said the victory in the Assembly elections would not come easy. “We will have to work extremely hard. Those opposed to us will try to divert our attention, will try to prevent our victory at all costs,” he said and added that the recently concluded rural local body polls were a testimony to it.

Referring to the party’s win in the rural local body polls, Mr. Stalin said the party had won 60% of the seats despite the ruling party misusing the election machinery. He said had the polls been fair, the DMK would have won 90% of the seats.

378,2020/01/23,"Do not convert Marina beach into a shandy, Madras HC tells Corporation","The Madras High Court on Wednesday warned the Greater Chennai Corporation against converting the Marina beach into a shandy by purchasing 1,352 push carts at a cost of ₹22.27 crore and distributing it free of cost to the vendors on the beach.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar were taken aback to hear that the Corporation had decided to procure 1,352 carts, though it had all along been assuring the court that not more than 900 vendors would be given licence to operate in the beach.

Stating that even the figure of 900 was a bit too much for the beach, the judges ordered that the Corporation should not purchase and distribute even a single cart more than that since there was always a possibility of additional carts being used by vendors.

“Don’t keep on increasing the carts and turn the beach into a shandy. The beach is meant for the general public and not for those wanting to make commercial gains,” Justice R. Suresh Kumar said after Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal presented a report in the court.

The AAG pointed out that the push carts would have in-built gas stoves and burners for the vendors who sell hot snacks such as Bajji and Bonda, and refrigerators for those who were involved in the selling of soft drinks. They would, however, be uniform in size.

The judges were also shocked to hear that the Corporation had decided to collect a monthly rent of ₹100 from every vendor to whom the push carts were to be distributed by inviting applications and selecting the beneficiaries through a draw of lots.

“Are you joking?” the senior judge in the Bench asked the Corporation officials. He further directed the Chief Secretary as well as the Commissioner to hold a discussion and fix a reasonable monthly rent to be collected from the vendors since ₹100 was “abysmally low.”

The officials were also directed to ensure that the entire tender process was completed before the end of March and the carts were procured from the successful tenderers in batches. A comprehensive report on the issue was ordered to be filed in the court on January 29.

The Member Secretary of Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority was also ordered to be present on that day in the court to explain the delay in approving a proposal sent by the Corporation for construction of a footpath on the sea side of the loop road in the Marina beach.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/do-not-convert-marina-beach-into-a-shandy-madras-hc-tells-corporation/article30629034.ece

The department has already taken up works as part of the comprehensive flood mitigation projects for Greater Chennai and its peri-urban areas in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts and vulnerable pockets in northern districts in phases.

Of the total project cost, nearly ₹900 crore would be contributed by the State. Instead of assistance from the World Bank as expected earlier, about 70% of the project would be funded by AIIDB.

A meeting related to the tie-up was held in New Delhi on Tuesday. An expert team would inspect the works in a few months and provide the funds that have already been spent by WRD, according to sources.

The project mapped locations in northern coastal districts that were vulnerable to floods based on experiences in the past decade. The proposals include creating reservoirs, constructing canals to bridge missing links between lakes and improvement of surplus channels.

Meanwhile, the WRD has sought ₹285.06 crore from State government to prioritise projects in areas vulnerable to inundation and speed up works. It has submitted 17 proposals to be taken up in the third phase of the long-term flood mitigation work in the city and peri-urban areas. The long-neglected Adambakkam lake is set to be rejuvenated as the department has allocated ₹13.90 crore. Work to modernise a link channel between Adambakkam lake and Veerangal Odai would also be taken up.

Missing links

Besides construction of check dams across Manamathy Maduvu in Tirupporur taluk, channels would be constructed to bridge the missing links between various waterbodies.

This includes between Rajakilpakkam and Sembakkam lakes and Peerkankaranai and Irumbuliyur lakes. Paruthipattu lake, which was developed as an eco-restoration site in Avadi, would soon have a surplus course of its own at a cost of ₹28.94 crore.

388,2020/01/23,"Fearing anti-social elements, residents leave tenements","Plagued by the sale of ganja and the constant bother caused by a few anti-social elements, several residents of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements, at the AIR site in Ennore, want to vacate their houses. They claim that the police have not taken any action, despite repeated complaints.

The TNSCB’s AIR Site is located near Ennore and houses close to 3,000 families, mostly relocated from Kasimedu and the Flower Bazaar locality. “Ever since we came here, we have been troubled by the anti-social elements. One can see youngsters carrying weapons in autorickshaws, on the colony premises itself,” said a woman resident, who preferred anonymity.

She said that ganja and tablets were sold on the premises openly. “One can see teenagers sitting in a dazed state. These goons sell drugs even when the police patrol the locality. They do not fear law enforcers,” she added.

Though the Ennore police station will be shifted into the AIR premises soon, residents claim that this would be of no use. “Now alcohol is sold on the premises from 3 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. People drink and knock on the doors of random people and trouble them. Few residents lodged a complaint recently, but there was no action. This is how the police react to most complaints,” a resident also said.

Since they have lost their trust in the police, residents claim that till date, close to 35 families have moved out of the tenements, fearing the rowdies and the antics of drunkards who cause disturbances. “Many more want to leave the place, but are holding back due to their children’s education,” said S. Mani, a resident of the locality.

Residents fear that if they stay here for long, their children will also become addicts to the vices.

389,2020/01/23,"Velachery rail overbridge work resumes, to be ready by April","Southern Railway has restarted work on the railway overbridge (ROB) on Station Road near Velachery station and plans to finish it by April.

Once work is completed, the ROB, which runs parallel to the tracks of the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) from Velachery to Taramani stations, will give motorists easier access to Rajiv Gandhi Salai and ECR. It will also pave the way for decongesting the Vijaynagar junction at Velachery.

A senior official of the Southern Railway said the Station Road ROB had remained incomplete because of the delay in execution of the mini ROB near the Velachery railway station. The ROB would have 6 arms through which rainwater would drain into the Pallikaranai marsh.

He said three spans were complete and work on construction of two arms was under progress. The construction of the mini bridge had stalled because of the poor condition of the soil. The clayey soil caused the concrete foundation to sink at a few places and so construction was stopped for several years. To overcome this problem, huge concrete slabs are being readied near the construction site and once the foundation work of the six spans is completed, the concrete slabs would be fixed above the arms and the road would be paved, he added.

Southern Railway has completed 40% of the ROB work and the remaining is being speeded up. Work on the ROB, running for around 4 km, was started as early as 2009 by the railways to provide easy connectivity between the three stations.

Even as residents hope the mini bridge is completed and the Station Road is fully linked, they want the railways to improve the lighting on the road. At present Station Road has no streetlights. The lights on the service road near Perungudi station are also not working, complain MRTS users.

390,2020/01/23,The flawed spin to India’s cotton story,"Genetically Modified (GM) pest resistant Bt cotton hybrids have captured the Indian market since their introduction in 2002. These now cover over 95% of the area under cotton, with the seeds produced entirely by the private sector. India’s cotton production in 2019 is projected as the highest ever: 354 lakh bales. Bt cotton’s role in increasing India’s cotton production, which GM proponents have highlighted as being instrumental, has also been used to argue for extending GM technology to increase food crop yield. However, critics say that Bt cotton hybrids have negatively impacted livelihoods and contributed to agrarian distress, particularly among resource-poor farmers.

The Indian experience

This year, India is expected to be the world’s largest cotton producer, surpassing China in output. However, India’s productivity (yield per unit area), is much lower than other major cotton-producing countries, meaning a much larger area is used for cotton production. Indeed, India’s productivity has been only a third of these countries for over four decades. Why is this so? It cannot be explained by agronomic or socio-economic differences because these countries include both developed and developing countries, and different geographies. Which feature of cotton cultivation in India differs from other countries and might account for this large anomaly?

India is the only country that grows cotton as hybrids and the first to develop hybrid cotton back in 1970. Hybrids are made by crossing two parent strains having different genetic characters. These plants have more biomass than both parents, and capacity for greater yields. They also require more inputs, including fertilizer and water. Though hybrid cotton seed production is expensive, requiring manual crossing, India’s low cost of manual labour make it economically viable. All other cotton-producing countries grow cotton not as hybrids but varieties for which seeds are produced by self-fertilization.

A key difference between hybrids and varieties is that varieties can be propagated over successive generations by collecting seeds from one planting and using them for the next planting; hybrid seeds have to be remade for each planting by crossing the parents. So for hybrids, farmers must purchase seed for each planting, but not for varieties. Using hybrids gives pricing control to the seed company and also ensures a continuous market. Increased yield from a hybrid is supposed to justify the high cost of hybrid seeds. However, for cotton, a different strategy using high density planting (HDP) of compact varieties has been found to outperform hybrids at the field level.

Cotton planting strategies

For over three decades, most countries have been growing cotton varieties that are compact and short duration. These varieties are planted at high density (5 kg seeds/acre), whereas hybrids in India are bushy, long duration and planted at ten-fold lower density (0.5 kg seeds/acre). The lower boll production by compact varieties (5-10 bolls per plant) compared to hybrids (20-100 bolls/plant) is more than compensated by the ten-fold greater planting density. The steep increase in productivity for Brazil, from 400 to 1,000 kg/hectare lint between 1994 and 2000 coincides with the large-scale shift to a non-GM compact variety. Cotton is a dryland crop and 65% of area under cotton in India is rain-fed. Farmers with insufficient access to groundwater in these areas are entirely dependent on rain. Here, the shorter duration variety has a major advantage as it reduces dependence on irrigation and risk, particularly late in the growing season when soil moisture drops following the monsoon’s withdrawal. This period is when bolls develop and water requirement is the highest. The advantages of compact varieties over hybrids are considerable: more than twice the productivity, half the fertilizer (200 kg/ha for hybrids versus 100 kg/ha for varieties), reduced water requirement, and less vulnerability to damage from insect pests due to a shorter field duration. Yet, India has persisted with long-duration hybrids, many years after benefits of compact varieties became clear from global experience.

Impact of policy

If one grants that India would have benefited greatly from deployment of compact cotton varieties as supported by the evidence, then the question arises: why was this not done? Two phases of policy have contributed to this situation. The first is before GM cotton, when India persisted with hybrids from 1980-2002, while other countries shifted to HDP. Why was such a significant innovation in cotton breeding ignored for so long and what kept public sector institutions and cotton research centres from developing and releasing such varieties? The answers lie with the agricultural research establishment. The second phase where the question of hybrids versus compact varieties could have been considered, was at the stage of GM regulation when Bt cotton was being evaluated for introduction into India. It would not have been out of place to have evaluated the international experience, including the context of introduction of this new technology. Information should have been considered on the form in which it would be deployed (hybrids versus varieties). Importantly, agro-economic conditions where it would be used should have been a guiding factor. However, the scope of evaluation by the GM regulatory process in India was narrow, and did not take this into account. Consequently, commercial Bt hybrids have completely taken over the market, accompanied by withdrawal of public sector cotton seed production. The Indian cotton farmer today is left with little choice but to use Bt hybrid seed produced by private seed companies.

Farmer distress

The current annual value of cotton seed used for planting is about ₹2,500 crore, and that of lint cotton produced is ₹68,000 crore. Therefore, it appears that the interests of the cotton seed industry have constrained the very much larger value of cotton production and the overall cotton industry. It is likely that production levels could have been much higher, with considerably lower risk and input costs, had compact varieties been developed and used in India. Agricultural distress is extremely high among cotton farmers and the combination of high input and high risk has likely been a contributing factor. Compact varieties would have significantly reduced distress as well as increased yield. Therefore, the hybrid seed model for cotton that India, and India alone, has followed for over three decades, is inferior to the HDP model being used in other countries on three important counts: much lower productivity; higher input costs; and increased risk particularly for low resource farmers in rain-fed areas.

There are several takeaways from the experience of Bt cotton worldwide, and in the context of hybrids in India. First, we must be clear that the outcome of using a technology such as Bt is determined by the context in which it is deployed, and not just by the technology itself. If the context is suboptimal and does not prioritise the needs of the principal stakeholders (farmers), it can have significant negative fallouts, especially in India with a high proportion being marginal and subsistence farmers. Second, there is a need for better consultation in policy, be it agriculture as a whole or crop-wise. Notably, India is a signatory to international treaties on GMO regulation (the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety), which specifically provide for inclusion of socioeconomic considerations in GMO risk assessment. However, socioeconomic and need-based considerations have not been a part of GMO regulatory process in India.

It is important to recognise that adoption of any new technology such as Bt is a choice and not an imperative. For example, some of the major cotton-producing countries such as Brazil (until 2012) and Turkey (up to the present) have achieved high productivity without the use of GM cotton by using alternative pest-management approaches. The purpose of risk assessment in GMO regulation is to enable exercising of this choice by careful and comprehensive evaluation of costs and benefits. In the case of Bt cotton hybrids, the benefits were limited and costs may well have been too high, particularly for resource-poor farmers.

391,2020/01/23,Plight of Pandits,"It is heartwarming to note that The Hindu chose to highlight the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (Editorial page, “Thirty years on, still no spring for the Pandits,” Jan. 22). All the more so when political parties across the spectrum and many media outlets have been conspicuous by their deafening silence. Most damning is the silence of public intellectuals from all shades of political ideologies. Today, protests both peaceful and violent rack the country on citizenship and displacement. There is much anguish and hand-wringing with respect to the Constitution, secularism, democracy and minority rights. In this scenario, let us also spare a tear for displaced members from the community who, as the article terms, are “a persecuted Hindu minority, from a Muslim-majority State, within a Hindu-majority country.”

Ravindra Ramarao,

Bengaluru

The article has shone the light on the plight of the Kashmiri Pandits who were forcibly exiled from their homes three decades ago only to live as refugees in their own country. It is a poignant retelling of one of the dark chapters of India’s post-independent history, and a damning indictment of the hypocrisy of the liberal class that looked the other way and chose to mouth platitudes about Kashmiri syncretism when a brazen assault on India’s pluralist ethos was unfolding in its plain sight. The drumbeats of secularism were conspicuously silent, and the streets did not teem with the Preamble-readers.

The Kashmiri Pandits have no illusions about returning to their homelands even if political normalcy is restored in Kashmir. They know it is impossible to live safe and dignified lives in the region where the popular imagination is in thrall to extremist indoctrination so much that most people believed the conspiracy theory that the Indian government orchestrated the mass exodus of the Pandits from the Kashmir Valley.

392,2020/01/23,Periyar’s 1971 rally,"I appreciate The Hindu for making public the 1971 report on Periyar’s Salem rally. The truth is that atheists and agnostics had at that time found nothing wrong in the actions of the Dravidar Kazhagam. They had instead defended its demonstration, saying that the objective was to condemn superstitious beliefs and to promote rationalism. Distancing itself from the event, the Tamil Nadu government made the district administration the scapegoat and transferred the Collector to Chennai. But today, the whole affair is being subjected to scrutiny from a different angle. Religion has since become politicised. In such a situation, going on the defensive is tantamount to disowning Periyar and his way of making frontal attacks on social abuses.

Mr. Rajinikant’s reported speech on Periyar seems to have left him, knowingly or unknowingly, with a real big hot potato to handle, especially so in case he does make a political entry sometime in the future. If he were a seasoned politician, he would have perhaps realised that a mere flashing of newspaper reports, photos, etc as a political tool could very well become hugely counterproductive. He would have known that any strong statement made about an incident alleged to have happened in the past should be firmly backed by clear, solid legal evidence. Under the circumstances, Mr. Rajinikant finds himself clearly pushed on the defensive, even as many political parties in Tamil Nadu, including the DMK, have come out strongly against his controversial statement on this issue. It now remains to be seen how the superstar manages to come out of the rather unenviable position.

393,2020/01/23,Curtailing Speaker’s power,"The suggestion of the Supreme Court to revisit the power conferred upon the Speaker of the State legislatures in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution is exemplary. In the recent past, the nation has witnessed some arbitrary and biased rulings from the chairs of the Houses of various States. Undoubtedly, a Speaker can’t keep himself away from his earlier political affiliation. There are some other grounds to disqualify a Member, which are incorporated in the original Constitution. But the power to disqualify is vested either with the President of India or with the State Governors, and that too after getting the opinion of the Election Commission. But, the Tenth Schedule is strangely considers defection a matter of politics. Though the post of the Speaker is a constitutional one, there is no oath of office for him. They assume their office by means of a democratic ritual of taking the chair of the Speaker on the floor, flanked by the Leader of the House and Opposition.

Vesting a power in a post which has no oath of office ought to have been curbed and, as directed by the apex court, Parliament can make yet another enactment to reduce the same.

394,2020/01/23,An insensitive push,"Despite the increasing opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) from large sections of people across the nation, it is sheer arrogance on the part of Home Minister Amit Shah to push his agenda, unmindful of the people’s concerns (Front page, “CAA will stay despite protests: Shah,” Jan. 22). He continues to mislead by telling that the CAA is for ‘granting citizenship’, not for ‘taking it away’. This sounds right only if taken at face value. While Mr. Shah has repeatedly stated that the NRC will be implemented across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied that there was even a discussion on such a move. Now, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has also said that there is no question of extending the NRC to the entire country. Whom should we believe? Why has the government created all this turmoil and confusion over a wasteful exercise, if not for the sole purpose of diverting attention from the more pressing problems?

R. Fernandez,

Bengaluru

Nobody expected the Supreme Court to stay the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). And it did not, on the presumption that the law passed by Parliament is constitutionally valid until it hears both the petitioners challenging its constitutionality and the Central government and finds it to be unconstitutional — ‘presumption’ being the operative word. Hence, it is no cause for the government to celebrate prematurely.

Before going ahead with the implementation of the CAA, the government will do well to remember the apex court’s observation that ‘nothing is irreversible’. When the Sabarimala case was referred to a larger Constitution Bench, the original ruling allowing entry of women of all ages into the temple was held in abeyance or at least its implementation was not favoured by the BJP even in the absence of any stay on the ruling. Similarly, the government can put on hold the implementation of the CAA till the apex court’s final ruling.

Home Minister Amit Shah has refused to make a gesture towards the opinion of the anti-CAA protesters and ruled out a repeal of the CAA. The CAA is underpinned by religious hatred and malice. Rightly or wrongly, we are afraid that the BJP as a Hindutva-oriented party is keener on denying citizenship to Muslims than giving citizenship to ‘non-Muslims’.

Perhaps the fear that Islam might attract more people to its fold and Muslims are not amenable to be graded in the caste hierarchy explains the visceral hatred for Islam and Muslims. Hindu religious texts sanctify human inequality on the basis of accident of birth, whereas Islam treats all humans as equals in the spiritual realm.

Critics of CAA plead the case for the inclusion of Muslims as the seventh religious group to make the law ‘religion-neutral’. Secular India cannot and should not discriminate between a Hindu from Pakistan, a Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar and a Sri Lanka refugee of any faith on granting citizenship.

Further, it is wrong to suppose that all humans are theists and insist that they should be theists adhering to certain faiths to be eligible for citizenship. Furthermore, it is not clear what will be the fate of the society’s rejects including those who wander around the streets uncared for. Most of ‘human flotsam and jetsam’ have no religion to own and proclaim for grant or denial of citizenship.

When the Bill came to Parliament, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) wholeheartedly supported in both the Houses of Parliament and the Bill became an Act. Now, the SAD has taken an unequivocal stand for the inclusion of Muslims. The party, through this double role, is fooling the people. Still, if it is serious about opposing the CAA, it needs to make its position clear in public and withdraw its Minister from the Union government without any delay. The party needs to also state in public why it supported the Bill initially if it found it to be anti-Muslim in character.

Shivmudra is the royal seal of Maharashtra’s warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

The new flag was unveiled at the party's conference currently being held at Goregaon in suburban Mumbai.

The conference will also chalk out party's future course of action. According to reports, the MNS is likely to adopt the Hindutva strategy with a possibility of allying with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra. Both MNS and BJP are presently left with no allies in State politics as BJP's long-term ally Shiv Sena had joined hands with Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

398,2020/01/23,Timely CPR saves two lives in city,"Knowledge on how to perform timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and not giving up are crucial while reviving patients whose hearts have stopped beating, according to medical experts in the city. Chest compressions mimic the heart’s pumping action and help keep the blood flowing throughout the body.

Last month, a 68-year-old businessman’s heart stopped beating for nearly 10 minutes while undergoing treatment at Wockhardt Hospital in Mira Road. Timely and continuous cardiac massage by doctors helped revive his heart beat.

The patient, Dilip Shah, was admitted after a heart attack and an angiography revealed multiple blockages. While the doctors waited for Mr. Shah to stabilise, his heart stopped beating. “He had no pulse or regular heart rhythm. He regained the rhythm and blood pressure after 10 minutes of CPR,” said intensivist Dr. Bipin Jibhkate, who revived the patient along with cardiologist Dr. Chetan Bhambure. “The patient also needed a temporary pacemaker to stabilise his heart rhythm,” said Dr. Bhambure. Mr. Shah later underwent a bypass surgery, which was performed by cardiac surgeon Dr. Upendra Bhalerao, and was discharged on December 21.

In another case, a 65-year-old man’s heart stopped beating for nearly 45 minutes last week. Doctors at Breach Candy Hospital revived him after taking turns to give him CPR and 40 shocks using a defibrillator. Cardiologist Dr. Dev Pahlajani, who treated the patient, said he had undergone angioplasty after an heart attack and developed a cardiac arrest the next day.

Dr. Pahlajani said such cases are common and knowing how to perform chest compressions is important. He said, “With no heart beat, these patients are near dead. But the whole idea is to not give up. We kept checking the patient’s pupils, brain function, gag reflex [contraction of the back of the throat] and pinched him to look for spontaneous movements. We simultaneously continued the cardiac massage and shocks to revive his heart.” Dr. Pahlajani said the patient will be shifted out of the intensive care unit in a day or two.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/timely-cpr-saves-two-lives-in-city/article30629392.ece

Mr. Lakdawala was remanded in Crime Branch custody till January 27.

According to the Crime Branch, Mr. Lakdawala had demanded ₹2 crore from a businessman and threatened him with dire consequences.

But the businessman did not pay heed to his demand, which saw Mr. Lakdawala plan a plot to attack him.

Mr. Lakdawala asked one of his henchman named Prashant Rao, who is in Nashik jail, to carry out the attack on the businessman. Mr. Rao was in charge of Mr. Lakdawala’s gang in India, and was responsible for recruiting men to run his extortion business.

Mr. Rao contracted Sagar Indulkar, Ankush Tavde and Sagar Chavan to carry out the hit on the businessman. But the three were arrested by the Anti-Extortion Cell from SV Road in Jogeshwari based on a tip-off. Their interrogation led the Crime Branch to Mr. Lakdawala as an accused in the case.

The Crime Branch on Tuesday informed the court of wanting to arrest Mr. Lakdawala in the case. Mr. Lakdawala was arrested from Patna on January 8 for trying to extort money from a real estate developer in Bandra. He has been on India’s most wanted list since 1998, and is an accused in 25 cases of murder and attempted murder.

The accused, Ajay Jangam, who kept changing his residence, was arrested on January 11. Mr. Jangam had switched off his phone, but was traced after the unit kept watch over his family members. Police particularly kept watch over the accused’s father, who lived in Koparkhairane. They soon found the contact number of his wife and kept a watch on her movements, as well as that of their son.

Finally, the police caught the accused when he went to the circus with his son at Sanpada. “We recovered close to 1 kg gold worth ₹36 lakh from him. He had mortgaged the gold with a finance firm,” senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar from the central unit said.

According to police, the accused has cheated close to 15 people. A Kamothe family, who were cheated of ₹1 lakh and 22 tola gold, filed a complaint against him.

The complainant had approached Mr. Jangam as many of her husband’s debtors had been delaying payments. She met the accused at Ellora society in Kamothe in November 2019, where Mr. Jangam read her husband’s palm and said he would have to visit their house to solve their problems.

On November 22, he visited their house in Sector 6, Kamothe and said they will have to conduct a ‘swarnapooja’ for which they will have to present as much gold and cash as possible, which he would keep with him for 21 days.

At the end of the time period, they found the accused was not at home; neither did he take their calls. That is when they realised they had been cheated.

401,2020/01/23,"TRAI: broadcasters misuse pricing freedom, push bouquet channels","Broadcasters have misused the freedom given to them in fixing rates of a la carte channels and bouquets, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) stated in an affidavit filed before the Bombay High Court on Wednesday.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by the Indian Broadcasting Federation (IBF) and others challenging the broadcasting regulations and amended tariff orders by the TRAI. The petition says, “The restriction impinges [on] the fundamental right guaranteed to them under Article 19 (1) (a) [freedom of speech and expression] and 19 (1) (g) [practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business] of the Indian Constitution.”

On January 1, 2020, the regulatory authority introduced new rules that reduced the cost of a channel to ₹12 from ₹19 for television broadcasters to include it in their pack. On January 14, the High Court refused to grant ad interim relief to IBF and general entertainment channels that challenged TRAI’s new tariff order.

An affidavit, filed by Surendra Singh, joint adviser (legal) in TRAI, stated: “The subscription of most popular channels on an a la carte basis is less than 10% as compared to bouquet-based subscription. This yet again brings out the impact of artificial disparity created by the broadcasters in a la carte channel and bouquet prices, misusing their freedom to price. On the one hand, the a la carte prices have been increased, but on the other hand, huge discounts on bouquets have been given to ensure consumers choose only bouquets. This clearly works against the interest of consumers as the a la carte choice has been reduced, thereby increasing the effective cost to consumers.”

TRAI’s 114-page affidavit states, “The very purpose of giving choice to consumers and extending a helping hand to facilitate selection of channels through use of bouquets has been completely defeated. TRAI expects that the revised provision will promote the interest of consumers and extend real choices. The provisions are expected to discourage the anti consumer practice of pushing bouquets.”

TRAI further said, “Overall analysis of the present scenario leads to conclusion that the offering of bouquets by broadcasters, as is being done now, was generally depriving consumers of their basic right to choose channels and have been designed to better serve the commercial interest of broadcasters.”

It is reiterated, TRAI is not against offering of bouquets, however, it cannot be at the cost of the freedom of consumers to choose channels in a manner which they may like.

The affidavit mentions, “The regulations and tariff order will provide better choice to consumers and will make broadcasting services affordable for consumers without affecting freedom of broadcasters/distributors to offer their channels in the form of bouquets or an a la carte offering, and to offer discount to the consumers.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/trai-broadcasters-misuse-pricing-freedom-push-bouquet-channels/article30629358.ece

The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The Mumbai international airport had begun thermal screening of travellers from China on January 18. Last week, health authorities in the State held a meeting at the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which is one of the 11 laboratories in the country, under the Indian Council of Medical Research, which are equipped with testing samples of 2019-nCoV.

Dr. Pradeep Awate, the State’s epidemiologist, said, “As far as the preparedness is concerned, we have isolation wards from the time of the H1N1 outbreak. With news of the 2019-nCoV, we are ramping up our infection control measures, and assessing and enhancing overall preparedness.”

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened an emergency meeting to decide whether or not to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. The WHO was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause detected in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province, on December 31, 2019.

Chinese government officials have advised against travelling to Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, and classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures.

With reports of Preeti Maheshwari (45), an Indian living in Shenzhen, contracting the coronavirus, the travel and trade industry has begun to see a drop in bookings to China. Balu Ramachandran, senior vice president, Cleartrip, said, “We are seeing signs of travellers refraining from making bookings to China in response to the news of the outbreak and the advisory against travelling to Wuhan. In fact, last week, we registered a 31% dip in bookings. We are yet to observe immediate traveller reactions in terms of booking cancellations to China.”

Safety measures in place

The government on Wednesday said 9,156 passengers from 43 flights had been screened for 2019-nCoV across major airports in the country. Officials said no case of the virus has been detected so far.

405,2020/01/23,BMC picks contractor to build 3 approach roads to Delisle bridge,"Nearly 18 months after Delisle bridge at Lower Parel was shut for traffic, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appointed a contractor for constructing three approach roads to it. Meanwhile, the bridge itself is already being constructed by the Western Railway (WR).

The roads will cost ₹138 crore and a proposal was passed in Wednesday’s standing committee meeting.

The 100-year-old road overbridge outside Lower Parel station was categorised as extremely dangerous in an audit by the Railways and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. This was part of an audit of city bridges after the Gokhale bridge in Andheri crashed.

The Delisle bridge was shut for traffic in July 2018, hugely impacting office-goers working in the nearby business district of Lower Parel. It was then decided that the WR would construct the bridge while BMC would look into the approach roads. The civic body will pay WR ₹125 crore for the bridge’s construction.

The civic body has now allotted work on the roads and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to perform a bhoomipujan on Republic Day.

There will be two approaches to the bridge on NM Joshi Marg and another one on Ganpatrao Kadam Marg. Those on NM Joshi Marg will be constructed first and the remaining one going towards Currey Road station will be taken up after they are completed. It will take 18 months to construct the roads.

“I hope both the WR and BMC complete the new bridge soon as it is a huge inconvenience.

Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive officer, RAI, “This is a win-win for all. It will help increase customer satisfaction, because customers can buy things whenever there is a need. It will also help retailers achieve better sales as well as increase the revenue collection for the State government. More importantly, it will increase employment. Our expectation is that employment in the retail sector will increase by as much as 10% in the next three years.”

Grauer and Weil (India) Limited, which operates Growel’s 101 mall at Akurli Road in Kandivali, said it was happy to support the initiative. Chief operating officer, retail and real estate, Sachin Dhanawade, said, “We appreciate the concept of 24x7 in Mumbai … however, it is imperative that we take feedback and consensus from our retail partners.”

Mr. Dhanawade said to begin with, they might try this out on Fridays and Saturdays. “The entertainment and F&B tenants have responded positively … However, most retailers are still working on their revenue v/s expense projections to assess the financial impact … We as a mall … are also reviewing the impact on operational cost v/s the revenues that would be generated for tenants to support the initiative partially, if not fully,” he said.

This weekend, malls like Atria in Worli, Infiniti in Malad and Andheri, R Mall in Ghatkopar, Phoenix Mills in Parel and Phoenix Market City in Kurla, Inorbit in Malad and Oberoi Mall in Goregaon are among those set to stay open 24 hours.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/24x7-mumbai-will-create-jobs-help-economy-say-stakeholders/article30629149.ece

409,2020/01/23,Deonar landfill to finally get waste-to-energy plant,"Seven years after the Bombay High Court told the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shut the Deonar dumping ground, the civic body has finalised a contractor to set up a waste-to-energy plant there.

The BMC failed to find a contractor for at least five years, which led to inordinate delays and it coming under fire from the HC several times. Now, it has finalised a contractor for the first phase of converting 600 metric tonnes (MT)of waste into energy daily at a cost of around ₹600 crore.

This waste that will be processed in the first phase is the fresh waste coming to the dumping ground on a daily basis. The accumulated waste, also called legacy waste, will be tackled in the upcoming phases after its composition is studied. Eventually, all the waste that has been dumped at Deonar already will be processed and the fresh waste generated daily will also be processed there. The same is being done at Mulund, however no fresh waste is taken there.

Largest and oldest

Mumbai generates 7,000-7,500 metric tonnes of solid waste every day. Since the closure of Mulund dumping ground in 2018, the city only has two functional dumping sites — Deonar and Kanjurmarg. The dumping ground at Deonar is the largest and oldest one in the city, operational since 1927 with an area of around 132 hectares.

Following incidents of repeated fires at the ground, there was a firm demand to shut it. In 2013, the HC ordered that it and the Mulund ground be shut and a High Court monitoring committee has been overseeing this. When the BMC failed to tackle the issue, in 2016, the HC even banned construction in in the city. Even though Mulund has been shut, Deonar still has not been and receives around 1,000MT waste per day.

In April 2019, the court gave the BMC a final extension up to December to close it but recently, the civic body secured another extension. Right now, the height of garbage mounds is around 30 metres. The BMC had initially planned a 3,000 MT waste-to-energy plant at Deonar but when it did not get any response, it decided to break it down to a 600 MT and two 1,200 MT plants in three phases. The latest tender for the 600 MT plant was also floated twice and given four extensions. After this, the BMC finally received a response and has finalised a contractor for the job. It is only when the plant is completely set up that the ground will be shut for further dumping of waste.

“We took the help of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, to vet the technology put up by bidders and only after they approved did we give a go-ahead. Our estimate was ₹850 crore but in fact, we found a bidder who was qualified and bid lower than our estimate. The tender for phase II is also live, we will put forth all these points before the HC,” said additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal.

The contractor was chosen out of three who put forth their bids and the project is going to cost ₹670 crore. They have an experience of running a successful plant in Delhi and will take three years to construct this one. The contractor will use incineration to create around 25MW of electricity per day.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kfdv8n/article30629094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMDEONARDUMPINGGROUND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/deonar-landfill-to-finally-get-waste-to-energy-plant/article30629095.ece
410,2020/01/23,Molestation case: HC grants DIG interim protection from arrest,"The Bombay High Court on Wednesday granted interim protection from arrest to Nishikant More, the Deputy Inspector General of Police (motor transport) accused of molesting a minor girl at her birthday party in Navi Mumbai in June last year.

A single Bench of Justice P.D. Naik will now hear Mr. More’s anticipatory bail application on February 17.

An FIR into the incident was registered at the Taloja police station under Sections 354A (1) (i) (physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, apart from sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, six months after the alleged incident happened.

The officer had moved the High Court after a sessions court in Panvel rejected his anticipatory bail application in January. Senior counsel Ashok Mundargi, representing Mr. More, told the court that not only had there been a delay of six months in registering the FIR, but it had also been lodged because of a property dispute between Mr. More and the girl’s family. The two families were known to each other very well, and Mr. More had attended the birthday party with his wife, Mr. Mundargi said.

He also claimed that the sessions court had rejected the DIG’s anticipatory bail because it was deemed that the girl had gone missing, and since the victim had left behind a suicide note naming the officer, the court had deemed that it could turn out to be dying declaration. But since the girl was traced to Dehradun, the lawyer asked the court to restrain the police from taking any coercive steps against the officer.

The court has directed Mr. More to appear before the Taloja police on January 29, 30 and 31 to cooperate with the probe. It noted, “The accused and the victim’s family shared cordial relations, which later turned sour after the girl’s father refused to return money that he allegedly borrowed from him.”

It also said, “The manner and conduct of the victim in the video creates doubt over the alleged incident.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/molestation-case-hc-grants-dig-interim-protection-from-arrest/article30629058.ece

“No Aadhaar card would be necessary,” said Mr. Bhujbal, while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. The scheme will start from January 26, he said and added that government employees and staff of the establishment where the canteen will function would not be allowed to avail of the service.

“To begin with, Shiv bhojan canteens will be started at district headquarters and in municipal corporation areas. The canteen will be at places with very high footfall and they will serve food from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. The canteen owner will be responsible to ensure that the beneficiaries of the scheme are given space in the premises during that period,” he said.

Mr. Bhujbal said that the government will not provide space for the canteen but it is the responsibility of the owner to make sure adequate space is available. Each canteen will have the capacity to serve 25 customers at a time, and will be providing 75 to 150 meals between noon and 2 p.m. on first-come first-served basis.

The canteens serving ₹10 meal will not allow outside food. Taking food parcels also is not allowed. “Initially such canteens will open at government offices. However we have informed that ₹10 per meal service is not available to the government staff. It is for those who cannot afford costly meal. Also, the employees who are serving in the establishment where the canteen is opened are not allowed to take benefit of this scheme,” said Mr. Bhujbal.

The ₹10 meal scheme for poor was on the Sena’s manifesto ahead of the Assembly elections last year.

The scheme was also included in the Common Minimum Program (CMP) finalised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in November.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/17smlx/article30628958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMSHIVBHOJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/aadhaar-card-not-needed-to-buy-shiv-bhojan-says-chaggan-bhujbal/article30628960.ece
412,2020/01/23,‘This is a very subversive project’,"Despite the bustle, Rakhi Sarkar is a picture of serenity. All around her, there are boxes of artworks being unpacked, bubble wrap aplenty and Post-Its with tempting price tags. But it’s a scene that Ms. Sarkar is used to, having run the Centre of International Modern Art (CIMA) since 1993.

In town for the Affordable Art Mela that has experienced runaway success in Kolkata for 10 years now and more recently in Delhi, Ms. Sarkar is looking forward to bringing Mumbaikars serious art that is also pocket-friendly. For four days, January 23 to 26, the mela at the Nehru Centre in Worli will entice art lovers in the city to buy work of all shapes and sizes by over 80 artists. More than 2,000 artworks will be available — all under ₹1,00,000. As Ms. Sarkar emphatically declares, “This is a very subversive project. Because I subvert everything that happens in a mainstream gallery.”

A serious art collector, Ms. Sarkar established CIMA on the urging of the artistic community more than two decades ago. The impetus clearly was a love for art, and a space in central Kolkata that was readily available with the Sarkar family. After travelling the world, studying international museums and galleries, Ms. Sarkar took the help of Marc Glimcher, who is now president and CEO of Pace Gallery, a modern and contemporary art space that was established in 1960 in the U.S. “He helped me a lot. And was opposed to the name CIMA, as he thought it wasn’t appropriate for a commercial gallery,” recalls Ms. Sarkar. But is CIMA a commercial space? “Our formatting has been designed by international museums on one hand and art galleries on other. We function as a centre which also sells. But we do a lot of non-profit work. In fact, 99% of our work is non-profit,” she says.

Rakhi Sarkar, director of the Centre of International Modern Art.

The Affordable Art Mela then, is also an extremely serious exercise that aims to spread the love of art. For the Mumbai mela, Ms. Sarkar says that several younger artists have been identified who live and work in and around Mumbai and hail from Maharashtra. Ms. Sarkar is very happy to display the prices on yellow sticky notes; this is done to reassure both buyers and artists alike that the prices are indeed low. “The guarantee is that we are giving you the best. This is serious art, and it’s authentic and it’s at an affordable price,” she says. The idea is to remove the potential art buyer’s intimidations.

Several of the artworks will also have traditional art forms, some with a contemporary twist – but all with a modern outlook. Bolstered by the success of the mela’s Delhi outing in 2018, Ms. Sarkar decided on Mumbai for 2020, it’s also a city she has emotional ties with as she grew up here.

“To organise this mela is tough,” she says while recalling the Delhi show at The Habitat Centre. In Delhi, she is pleased to recount that people from the National Capital Region flocked to buy art. “They were clearly not collectors, but people who had never bought art before,” she says.

CIMA has also set up the Art and Heritage Foundation to augment the cause of art and heritage projects — national, regional and international — and initiated the CIMA AWARD Project. The aim of the project is to recognise and reward young artists from smaller towns, semi-urban and rural areas, to get adequately promoted and nurtured for their talent and creativity. Several of the mela’s artists are CIMA awardees, it is a process that works well — as the art has already been assessed by a panel of artists.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3cbkgh/article30628389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMAFFORDABLEART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/this-is-a-very-subversive-project/article30628391.ece
413,2020/01/23,Mumbai to remain open 24x7 from January 27,"The Maharashtra Cabinet on January 22 cleared the proposal to keep Mumbai open for 24 hours from January 27, but with no relaxation in excise rules. Only eateries, shops and cafes can remain open and not bars or pubs.

Mumbai 24 hours, a pet project of Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray since 2013 will finally be a reality. Food courts, shops and cafes in malls and mill compounds in non-residential areas in the city can now remain open for 24 hours.

No relaxation for bars

Mr. Thackeray said no changes in the excise rules had been made, and bars and pubs which serve alcohol cannot remain open after 1.30 a.m.

“I had first moved the idea in 2013. The previous government cleared the proposal in 2017 but it was never implemented for reasons unknown to me. But today, we have decided to go ahead with it from January 27,” said Mr. Thackeray.

According to the young Sena Minister, malls and mill compounds in non-residential areas will now have an option to remain open, always. “This is not mandatory to all shops, but those who want to remain open for 24 hours can do so. They will have to have to follow labour laws by bringing in workers in three shifts. The establishments can either have private security or can pay Mumbai police for it which will open a door of revenue for the force as well. There will be no violation of law or peace as it will be done in non-residential areas,” he said, adding that Mumbai is one of the safest city in the country.

“The malls and compounds have their own parking areas, CCTVs, noise control rules and security arrangements. This will help create jobs, increase revenue and as well as confirm the status of the Mumbai that of a city which never sleeps,” said Mr. Thackeray.

Apart from this, two lanes, one each at Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point will be made available solely for food trucks.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said that this is the first phase of the project. Last week, Mr. Deshmukh had created flutter by saying that it was not possible to implement the project across entire city.

When asked about the Bharatiya Janata Party’s opposition to Mumbai 24x7, Mr. Thackeray said that the present government is implementing what was sanctioned in 2017. “This is to benefit the people of Mumbai and to make this city vibrant, something which has been followed world over,” said the Sena Minister.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pzalli/article30628274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THRDAADITYA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-to-remain-open-24x7-from-january-27/article30628275.ece
414,2020/01/23,At Chennai’s slick new 100-seater bar,"We balance between construction rubble, wooden beams and bags of cement, drinking in the view. A week before Barracuda Brew launches, Chef Mohamed Siddiq and I are on the roof terrace, as he explains the team’s vision for the space.

Plans are necessarily fluid, in this city of challenging bar licences. Barracuda Brew was envisioned as the city’s first micro-brewery, and designed accordingly. Then, it pivoted to a restaurant, with an open-air rooftop bar.

However, for now, it is a bar with a strong focus on food, and a work-in-progress terrace. Fortunately, there’s nothing “work in progress” about the generously proportioned space: currently built around fanciful cocktails, pop music and thoughtfully styled global comfort food.

“The barracuda is the underdog of the ocean,” says brand consultant Naveen Howie, pausing between inspecting lights, supervising a photo shoot and discussing the night’s playlist with the DJ. “They hunt in schools. Are most unpredictable. And swim against the tide.” An apt metaphor, then, for this shape-shifting space and its determined team.

Resident Chef Elam Parithi, who comes from a family of fishermen, emerges from the kitchen to say hello and chat about how he went out on his father’s trawler last week to source barracuda for the bar. “My grandfather used a catamaran to fish. But you need to go deeper in for barracuda,” he states, adding that he first learnt to cook at a class held in Kovalam village after the tsunami hit in 2004.

He was mentored by Siddiq, then executive chef at Taj Fisherman’s Cove, after which he worked as a chef with a slew of hotels and a cruise liner before returning home to Chennai. The menu, created with consultant Chef Siddiq, is ambitious with multiple pages and genres, but also straightforward, focusing on familiar flavours.

I pick a party night — Saturday — to work my way through it, powered by gin, offered with a selection of Svami tonic water. Though the cocktail list is extensive, not everything is available, which means martinis are shaken with white wine instead of dry vermouth: an avatar that would make James Bond shudder.

There are, however, refreshingly bracing whisky and gin cocktails between the inevitable sludge of bright, syrupy drinks. Watch out for the slick flair bartending by mixologist Arjun Maravan at the 100-seater bar, reportedly the longest in the city.

Of course, since this is Chennai, we order sambar-idli, an affectionate take on the household staple, featuring cocktail idlis doused in clingy sambar concentrate, liberally dusted with crunchy podi and finished with ghee. It is as moreish as it is incongruous: Rayars Mess in Prada. Make sure you eat it hot. The nachos arrive lukewarm, a congealed mass of cheese and bacon.

Service is chipper, but haphazard. So our food arrives in bits and pieces, as a bevy of waiters circle, all bright smiles and absent-minded apologies. Most of what does turn up, however, is freshly made and satisfying, with robust flavours and clever plating. Worth the wait; especially if you are down one drink. Or four.

Barracuda Brew Address: 24, College Road, Subba Road Avenue, Nungambakkam

Hits: Chilli beef, rumali lasagne

Misses: Kumbakonam coffee brulee, loaded nachos

Call: 9884456786

We eat buttery pulled pork sandwiches, served with fat, chilli-dusted potato chips, and a crisp salad of crunchy rocket leaves, thin slices of radish and a skilful vinaigrette. The chilli beef is a crowd-pleaser, generously peppered with wickedly red chillies. Try their tender chimichurri prawns, or mussel moilee, served as a soup with tiny appams floating on top like determined catamarans.

“We want to do familiar food, with a strong accent on South Indian,” says Chef Siddiq, adding, “But we add a twist.” The sundal, for example, is served as a salad, with cheese and crumbled thattai. And the rumali lasagne features creamy galouti kebab between layers of rumali roti, with molten cheese on top. They also offer a spaghetti makhini for the brave.

“Please don’t call it fusion,” he adds, rolling his eyes. Fusion tends to get a bad rap, thanks to years of chefs trying to be trendy by jamming cuisines together. While there are some look-at-me dishes, most of Barracuda’s menu works because there is a clarity in the thought process: creating flavours and formats apt for the setting without making compromises solely for Instastory appeal. There are misses though: the ambitious Kumbakonam coffee mousse is too weak to be taken seriously, for instance. Especially here, in the filter coffee homeland.

As the bar evolves, expect to see more live performances, from jazz, rock and blues to stand up comedy. They also plan to work more closely with fishing villages, via chef Elam. In a bid to be more environment-friendly, there are bamboo straws, and the team will be collaborating with Wasted Solutions, for recycling and segregation.

In Kasimedu fish market, the barracuda — known as seela — is a staple, found in lunch boxes of fishermen and women. It’s cheap, plentiful and tasty. It’s also versatile: eaten dried, fried or in a gravy.

Given the fact that this space is still evolving, this is Barracuda Brew’s strength as well: a tenacity to stay versatile on shifting ground.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/uk2mhu/article30634509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MPBarracudaBrewjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chennais-new-destination-has-a-100-seater-bar/article30634513.ece
415,2020/01/23,Turn to these lesser-known indigenous carrot varieties,"In India, especially the North, come winter and it is carrot season, with the ever-popular gajrela or gajar ka halwa. Not all gajar ka halwa, however, is the familiar orange we are used to. White carrots or safed gajar is also used to make the halwa, as is the black carrot or kala gajar.

The latter is also part of a kanji made in the North during winters. Varanasi is particularly popular for its black carrot or kala gajar halwa. However, as cultivator G Krishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha points out, numerous other varieties of carrots exist in India as well. Krishna has been responsible for encouraging cultivation of heritage, heirloom varieties of cereals, rice, vegetables, and tubers, and bringing it into the mainstream. Krishna explains, “Before the 17th Century, almost all cultivated carrots were purple. Black or purple carrot was widely cultivated in ancient India. The modern-day orange carrot wasn’t cultivated until Dutch growers in the late 16th Century took mutant strains of the purple carrot and gradually developed them into the sweet, plump, orange variety we have today. It then came to India through the British. India’s pride is native black and purple carrot, which we have ignored completely.”

Raman Mann, an organic farmer who organises the Chandigarh Organic Market, says, “In Punjab, several farmers grow the black variety of carrots along with the traditional red one. The black carrot is grown using old preserved seeds. The white variety is not grown here.” Mann adds, “The black variety is an interesting one and can be used in a number of ways. It can be used for making kanji, murabbas, pickles and halwa. In my opinion, black carrot halwa is tastier than the usual red one. It also looks lovely, given its purple colour.”

To popularise these indigenous varieties, Karnataka-based Sahaja Samrudha embarked on a project. Anitha Reddy, Trustee, Sahaja Samrudha, works on vegetable projects providing market linkages and says, “This region, that falls in the Anekal Taluk of Bangalore Urban District, is renowned for carrot cultivation. The farmers belong to the Tillanga or gardener community, and have green thumbs. They grow over 40 varieties of vegetables, including 12 of brinjals. They were growing hybrid varieties of carrots which are resource intensive. We introduced four varieties of carrots and grew the hybrid one as a test exercise.” The farmers could test the produce and compare the yield with the hybrid one. The yield was more or less the same, and farmers took to the four varieties — red carrot, yellow carrot, karud kesari (orange coloured variety) and black carrot.

Reddy adds, “The farmers grow carrots from July onwards, going up to March. They are growing red, kesari and black.” Of these, the black variety is grown more for its health benefits. However, the most interesting carrot is the yellow one. It smells like jeerige maavu (jeera flavoured variety of mango), so the women grow these in small patches and use it to make pickles.

White carrots are grown in Uttar Pradesh, and make their appearance in Delhi during the winters. These are used to make the irresistible safed gajar halwa. Nothing much is known about white carrots, not even whether they are indigenous to India. However, as the tradition of white gajar halwa is about 60 years old, it is possible that it is an imported variety. Dr Shrawan Singh, a scientist at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, who has worked extensively on carrots, says, “Unlike mangoes or chillies, the desi varieties of carrots do not have any names. They are known from the area they are grown, like Hisar, Sirsa and so on. At Pusa, several such desi ones have been improved for cultivation. White carrots are not indigenous but more of an exotic variety. The production is not high.”

Sahaja Samrudha’s seed calendar talks about wild carrots and purple carrots. Wild ones grow like weeds, and their seeds have been preserved by a farmer from Gadag, dryland region of Karnataka. It may not be suitable for commercial cultivation, but excellent for loose soil and holds rain water. The case of the purple carrot is very interesting. It has the highest shelf life, highest carotene content and looks very pretty with a beautiful purple tinge. The calendar gives varieties and their growing methods.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/acjht/article30633183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MPFood1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/sahaja-samrudha-kala-gajar-halwa-g-krishna-prasad-raman-mann/article30633184.ece
416,2020/01/23,Mad over mandi,"Remember the shawarma wave in Hyderabad? For some time, anything offered in the shape of a roll and sold as shawarma was lapped up. The popularity resulted in shawarma joints springing up across the city.

Dinesh Kakollu a freelance food stylist and photographer elaborates: “When the shawarma wave first hit Hyderabad, many college students and fresh graduates pooled in funds to set up their own shawarma counters. As the investment ranged from ₹50k upwards, it was a safe investment and based on the popularity of the dish, most of them got back their investments within a few months. From a handful of counters in the start, it started spreading across the city.” However, with monotony creeping in, the palate craved something else.

That’s when another dish was planting its seeds, albeit silently — the traditional Yemeni dish called mandi. The Yemeni preparation is mostly lamb meat and rice with a special blend of spices, cooked in the fat of the animal. It first made its presence felt in the Barkas area of the Old City. Soon, Barkas Food Walks followed, introducing and popularising the mandi to food lovers. A long drive to that part of town was worth it all, they believed. In fact, mandi helped put Barkas on the food map of Hyderabad.

Beyond Barkas

With its growing popularity, mandi started travelling beyond Barkas, moving towards Mehdipatnam. Soon restaurants that sold mandi had long queues. Getting a table was like playing a game of musical chairs. In Hyderabad, the dish itself has acquired different versions with fish and chicken. Chicken mandi is currently very popular.

Says Sanjay Borra who chronicles Hyderabad’s changing landscape and evolving food trends, “After it reached Mehdipatnam, it was only a matter of time for mandi to take over the city. Every third food joint was selling mandi. Another reason for its popularity could be the pocket-friendly price at most of these places. If a dish priced at ₹200 can satiate two people, it’s bound to find more takers.”

While Barkas is credited with giving a fillip to mandi business, Spice 6 in Banjara Hills takes the credit of having offered authentic Arabic food for many years. They’ve been serving kabsa and mandi since 2015. Khaja Yousufuddin of Spice 6 explains what differentiates kabsa from mandi and why mandi is sold more commonly than kabsa. “Kabsa and mandi have the same rice-meat combination but are differently flavoured due to different spices. It is not very easy to get the flavour of kabsa. Mandi is flavoured rice with meat, and tastes somewhat like the biryani and is dry. That is why one gets to see mandi more often and not kabsa.” Kabsa has big chunks of meat and is a bit wet.

Now it is no more a hassle to search for a mandi place. Prices do vary and so do the flavours. Swiggy lists at least 10 places on an average. Khairatabad shows 22 mandi delivery options, Attapur shows 17, Sainikpuri 10, Ameerpet 23. Those who are adventurous and don’t care where the food comes from can know about the authenticity of the dish.

Popular food influencers from the city — Fooddrifter links the popularity of mandi with Hyderabadis love for their biryani. Ashis Nayak of Fooddrifter also likes to look at Mandi with a critic’s eye: “The one dish which you’d primarily find only in Barkas has now spread like wildfire all across Hyderabad. The variants of mandi that you get in most places, stretching from Toli Chowki to beyond is just spiced-rice topped with different kinds of grilled meat. The mandi has had a whirlwind of a transformation and now become truly Hyderabadi-fied with the multitude of spices thrown in. But I believe this is indeed a good thing in some ways as it’s given to the rise in popularity of mandi. The increase in places serving mandi has also got a lot to do with community dining. I’ve enjoyed having mandi in a huge thaal with lots of friends sitting around and sharing it. It’s like a get-together over food.”

418,2020/01/23,‘I take children very seriously’ : Subhadra Sen Gupta on her latest book 'The Constitution of India For Children',"“Read the words carefully – it says, ‘We the people of India’, not ‘We the Hindus of India’ or ‘We the men of India’. This sentence is just one of many such in Subhadra Sen Gupta’s latest book The Constitution of India For Children (Puffin). And the timing of the release is also very apt, given the furore in the country over undermining the Constitution. But, says the author, she had submitted the text in August last year as she wanted to celebrate 70 years of the document that underpins India’s state. But there was also another reason... “during sessions in schools, I sensed a confusion about history, identity, rights... because children are taught one thing in school and, in some cases, hear something completely different at home. Like the malicious misinformation being spread about Jawaharlal Nehru.”

The Constitution often seems to be inaccessible and difficult – “such big words that no one knows the meaning of,” as one student put it. But Subhadra’s book de-constructs what’s in it in uncomplicated and straightforward text aided by pithy and sharp illustrations by Tapas Guha. The chapter on the Constituent Assembly talks about the women members, the lone tribal members and the Constitutional Adviser and Chief Drafting Officer, whom she terms “The backroom boys”.

Subhadra says she “lays down the facts” and lets children make up their minds. “I take children very seriously. If you listen to them carefully, you’ll realise that even a nine year old has much more humanity and common sense than many adults. They want the truth.” As far as the illustrations are concerned, she terms her books “collaborative efforts. I couldn’t do it without an illustrator, editor and designer. Tapas and I have been working together for many years and he rescued the book from becoming too solemn by suggesting cartoons. Brooding over the illustrations, the editing and fact checking, the many options of page design ... that is the process I love as a book begins to be a reality.”

Admitting that the book was “tough, as I was working with dry facts and not exciting events”, she talks of how she struggled to make concepts like liberty or secularism easy to understand. “The chapters on the Preamble and Fundamental Rights were the hardest I have ever done.” She found “stories about people” in books by Granville Austin and Ramachandra Guha, Leila Seth’s book helped her refine the style. Those interested in further reading can check the list at the end.

Most of Subhadra’s books for children have revolved around history and this began“a bunch of school kids telling me that they found history boring.” So she began with historical fiction and “discovered that even the simplest of plots becomes rich with images if placed in the past. So I got kids wandering the streets of Pataliputra, riding elephants and meeting weavers, potters and chefs and I was hooked! When handled well, children love history because it is about their roots.” Another reason was “because every government changes the history syllabus to suit their own ideology.” She recalls the details of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination was once dropped from the class VIII textbook. “The nonsense on social media does not help,” she adds.

Write Way When: Early morning

Where: Often on a well-cushioned sofa

How: My first draft is usually done by hand

What: Making history a story about people

When I point out that historical fiction is mistaken for mythology-based fantastical fiction, Subhadra accepts that “history is easy to manipulate and will always be mixed with mythology and fantasy.” But she doesn’t have a problem as long as it is clear that the book is fictional. “The challenge comes when people knowing no history create their own mythology about their heroes and demonise people they do not like and pass it off as history. We don't need heroes; we need great human beings.”

A few favourites History books: Books by AL Basham, Abraham Eraly, and Upinder Singh

Historical fiction: By Mary Renault and Sharadindu Bandopadhya in Bengali

Historical films: Shatranj ke Khilari because it was historically correct

Authors: Hilary Mantel, Antonia Fraser, Bipin Chandra, and BR Nanda

Finally I ask about something I found intriguing. At the end of most books, Subhadra publishes her email id encouraging her “under-age pen pals” to give her feedback. “It helps me stay in touch with children,” she replies. “They tell me what they liked or did not like and often write when they are confused. My inbox was full during the controversy over Padmavat. They could not understand why anyone could threaten an actress they admired because of a film. One child wanted to know if jauhar was ‘compulsory’ for women and another wondered if the men also jumped into the fire.” There is a flip side too. “They try to get me to write their school history projects by sending me a mail dripping with praise and then a long list of questions.”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/lfoo2l/article30634402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22cmconstitutuion6,https://www.thehindu.com/children/writer-subhadra-sen-guptas-latest-work-breaks-down-the-constitution-for-children/article30634404.ece

420,2020/01/23,In the line...,"Mini looked at her uncle, Captain Mitran, with admiration. He was tall and handsome, with a big moustache, and kind and smiling eyes. After a long time, he was visiting Chennai. His wife, Dr. Lakshmi had already shifted to the city and settled in. Both of them loved Mini, whose parents were engineers.

Mini listened avidly to her uncle’s stories. The freezing cold of the frontiers, the life of the soldiers, their sleepless vigil along the borders and their lonely lives. All this made a great impression on her.

They made grand plans to ring in the new year with gusto. Then, all of a sudden, her uncle was summoned back to the frontier.

“Can’t you go after the new year?” she begged.

“No, Mini, I am sorry. I have to go. My country looks after me, paying me a good salary and giving me all the comforts and benefits. Now, it is time for me to repay. I have to fight and save my country.” While he was packing his bag, Mini saw tears in her aunt’s eyes.

Reward

Mini missed her uncle terribly. Back at school, when the teacher asked the class to write a composition on ‘My aim in life’, she wrote about wanting to join the army.

“You are a clever girl, don’t you want to become an engineer or a doctor?” asked her teacher.

“No. I want to protect my country from enemies. I want to join the army.”

The teacher was surprised by this answer. She noticed the steely determination in Mini’s eyes.

Days went by and there was no news from uncle Mitran. Lakshmi aunty was sad.

Then, one day she came home excited. “Mini, uncle Mitran is getting the Param Vir Chakra award for his bravery in battle. He will receive it from the President on the Republic Day.”

On Republic Day, they were all excited. They switched on the television and everyone crowded onto the sofa to get a good view of the proceedings. Lakshmi aunty took pride of place in the centre. Just as she sat down, her phone began to ring. It was the hospital. There was a complication regarding a patient and her services were required urgently. She grabbed her white coat and rushed to the hospital.

The rest of the family watched the award ceremony. They watched as uncle Mitran’s name was announced and he came forward and the President pinned the medal on his chest. Mini was sad that her aunt was not there to see this.

By the time Lakshmi aunty returned, everything was over. She was very tired and had dark circles under her eyes. She collapsed on to the sofa. “It was touch and go. At one point, we felt the mother would not make it. But we did it. Now, both the mother and child are fine.”

“Are you all right, aunty?” asked Mini.

“Yes, but I missed an important moment in my life,” replied her aunt.

“But you saved two lives. You too are a great patriot. The essence of patriotism is the sacrifice of personal interest to public welfare,” said her father-in-law proudly.

Mini beamed at her aunt with a new found admiration.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/ynyzsq/article30632124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Talespin-2,https://www.thehindu.com/children/in-the-line/article30632125.ece
421,2020/01/23,HomecomingSettling in,"The story so far: Akash has a tiff with his father, which is soon resolved. Later, when he goes to play cricket, the other boys, give him a hard time.

“Amma, come and look at the red tomatoes,” said the kids. They had been waiting for the tomatoes to ripen. As per Ajji’s instructions, they plucked the fully ripe red ones and some red and yellow ones. “It takes three months to grow a tomato from a seed. I will never waste another tomato again,” Dharti declared.

“What do you think Ajji will make from all the tomatoes — thokku, rasam or tomato bath?” wondered Akash.

“Maybe all three,” Amma said absent-mindedly.

Challenges

She was thinking that apart from rice and coconut which was their staple crop, they had tried a variety of vegetables and fruits through the year. There were many hardships too. The potatoes were smaller than expected. The vegetables had worms. Though, there was satisfaction in eating home-grown lettuce, cucumbers, palak and methi, it was not enough to run the kitchen.

“32-33-34...tomatoes. I think we have done well,” said Akash, and interrupted her thoughts.

Amma patted his head. In reality, they had only met with moderate success. They had a steady supply of vegetables and fruits, because a lot of villagers usually paid them in kind. They got pumpkins, papayas, grape fruits, jackfruits and coconuts instead of money, on many an occasion.

Once they even got a hen! Appa had returned from work one day with a new basket.

“What’s in the basket, Appa?” Dharti had asked.

“Look inside the basket,” Appa had said.

Appa opened the lid and a hen popped out and pecked Dharti on her nose.

“Oh, you naughty hen,” said Dharti, “I don’t like you.”

“You would be pecking everyone too, if you had to sit in a basket. She’s such a sundari (beauty),” said Ajji.

The name Sundari stuck. Her mood never improved, though. She was always ready to peck everyone in sight. Also, nobody ever saw her lay an egg.

The only creature she seemed to like was one of the new-born calves in the cow shed. She could be found napping next to the calf all the time.

“They talk to each other,” said Dharti. “I have even heard them laugh.”

“Only humans can laugh, silly,” said Akash.

“Well, friendships can develop in the most unlikely places,” said Amma.

The three of them looked at the odd pair from afar. After all, nobody wanted to go too close and get pecked by Sundari.

422,2020/01/23,And it backfired...,"What do you think of having to wear a uniform to school every day? Do you think it helps students feel a sense of oneness and stops people from showing off their Nike Air Jordans? Or do you think uniforms force us to look the same and takes away our right to self-expression? I can’t really decide whether uniforms are a good thing or a bad thing. I don’t mind my school uniform, it’s comfortable and I don’t have to wear a tie and a blazer or anything. But I hate our school jacket. It’s thick, itchy and ugly and TBH I’d rather go to school in a Big Bird costume than wear it.

So, I decided to ‘accidentally’ lose my jacket last week and started wearing my own cool jacket to school. It’s a nice, soft hoodie with lots of pockets to stash my fidget cube and lucky charms. Every time I got stopped by a monitor or house captain or teacher, I’d say ‘I lost my jacket and am wearing this till I find it!’, and I’d be let off.

When your PLAN flops

But, as Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” I wasn’t going to get away with it. (Note: he is not connected to the band Linkin Park in any way.)

At assembly on Wednesday, L Ma’am came up to me and said that she’d been watching my flagrant disregard for the school’s uniform code. Flagrant not fragrant, which is what I thought she’d said. Then she confiscated my jacket!

I went to the staffroom after assembly to try and get it back. BIG MISTAKE. All the teachers pounced on me for all sorts of things — my hair, my nails, my unpolished shoes! Thank God they couldn’t smell my armpits. After a super long lecture on cleanliness is next to Godliness (which I don’t get. If I use deo, I’m God?) I was told that I would get my jacket when L Ma’am felt I deserved to get it.

So I had no choice but to launch operation Hoodie Heist. I used the PB to create a diversion in the staff room the next morning because ALL the teachers love him and would never think he’s capable of lying! All he had to do was go in, pretend to look for his math workbook and then innocently point at a corner and say ‘Oh look! A rat!’

I don’t have to tell you how well this worked. In less than 30 seconds, the staff room was empty. All I had to do was sneak in, take my jacket and sneak out again. It’s not stealing if you’re taking what’s rightfully yours.

Of course, this does mean that I can never wear my jacket to school again. Plus, I need to find my actual school jacket which is currently in the radioactive stink pile known as lost and found. Maybe I should have thought this through a little bit. Sigh.

423,2020/01/23,Puducherry gets a ‘Bicycle Mayor’,"Ragunath Veeravel, a cycling enthusiast and founder of Aaranya Foundation, an afforestation organisation, has been selected as the ‘Bicycle Mayor’ of Puducherry by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based social enterprise.

The BYCS powers the “Bicycle Mayor and Leaders Program”, a global initiative to promote cycling in cities and help get one billion more people onto bicycles.

Puducherry now joins other Indian cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram from where Bicycle Mayors have been chosen.

As “Bicycle Mayor”, Mr. Veeravel’s initial focus would be on creating awareness about cycling and its benefits from health and environment perspectives; to conduct community cycling rallies with effective participation from the community; setting up/starting cycling clubs in schools and colleges and teaching more women cycling for gender equality and removing the stigma associated with their cycling.

Mr. Veeravel said school and college students, employees from various private and government sectors, should adopt cycling for daily commute to make Puducherry India’s most cycling friendly city.

There was a need to bring change in mindset among drivers to develop respect towards bicycle riders, he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/3vxodp/article30637055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPONDYBICYCLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-gets-a-bicycle-mayor/article30637056.ece
424,2020/01/23,Dairy sector heading towards crisis,"Lack of government support in getting adequate medicines and cattle feed is putting dairy farmers in severe stress.

If the government continues to neglect the sector, more than 6,000 farmers, who supply around 60,000 litres of milk daily to the government-run Co-operative Milk Producers Union, popularly known as Ponlait, will not be able to sustain the production, say many farmers.

A dip in production would prompt Ponlait to source milk from other States which would have a cascading impact on the price and quality of milk supplied to residents, said R. Arasu, a farmer from Abishekapakkam.

Shortage of veterinarians

One of the main issues was shortage of veterinary doctors and medicines. Data gathered from the government revealed that around 85 posts of livestock inspectors, who were entrusted with the task of artificial insemination, had been lying vacant for a long time. Besides, there was a shortage of 20 veterinary doctors. Farmers complained that most veterinary hospitals in rural areas were facing shortage of essential medicines.

“It is sad that essential medicines are in short supply. We are asked to buy medicines or wait for a few more days for the arrival of medicines. It is not a very profitable business but if our expenses increase, the dairy sector will meet the fate of struggling agriculture farmers,” said R. Ramadass, who owns three cows and supplies around 10 to 14 litres of milk daily to the primary society at Karikalampakkam.

Another issue was the shortage as well as rising cost of hay for feeding the animals.

There was shortage of supply and prices were increasing, said Arasu. He complained of non-disbursal of subsidy for hay and cattle feed.

Although the government had set aside ₹113 lakh for providing subsidy, the amount could not be transferred to beneficiaries because of ongoing dispute between the Cooperative Department and Ponlait over fixing the rates for procuring feed from open market.

“Earlier, we used to get subsidy from the government for buying feed. The quantum of subsidy was based on the number of milch cows the farmers owned but now the government had stopped giving the subsidy amount.

“At a time when agriculture was causing distress, the government should promote dairy farming as it is sustainable and profitable if properly done,” said K. Ramakrishnan, a dairy farmer at Karikalampakkam.

Board to be formed

A senior official told The Hindu that the government had decided to constitute a Livestock Development Board to improve the livelihood means of farmers.

The setting up of the board would help the administration avail more funds from the Centre and plan schemes to improve yield.

“Scientific planning is necessary to improve the yield per cow. Also funds could be utilised to supply better breeds to farmers. Filling the vacancies are also under the active consideration of the government,” the official added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/naf109/article30637048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/dairy-sector-heading-towards-crisis/article30637049.ece

Locals found the dead turtle with injuries on its flippers and alerted the Forest department. An official said that the turtle might have been washed ashore after getting caught in trawlers or due to rough sea.

About 60 km stretch of the coast of Puducherry is mainly used by the migratory turtles from December to March ever year. However, beach erosion because of natural phenomena as well as rapid urbanisation had reduced the nesting habits of turtles and resulted in a drastic reduction in their nesting along Puducherry coast, according to a report of the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII).",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/olive-ridley-turtle-carcass-found-near-lighthouse/article30633902.ece
426,2020/01/23,Lt Governor asked to stop AFT closure procedures: Puducherry CM,"Making it clear that the Cabinet will not go back on its decision to introduce Voluntary Retirement Scheme in Anglo French Textiles instead of winding up the mill, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said he has sent a file to the Lt Governor recommending suspension of her decision to close down the mill till a final order comes from the Centre.

Speaking at the 123rd birth anniversary celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at Pradesh Congress Committee office, the Chief Minister said a day after the Managing Director of AFT issued a notice to the Labour secretary and Trade Union representatives seeking permission to close down the textile mill on Tuesday, the Lt Governor was asked to stop all procedures related to winding up operations of the mill.

Recalling the day and night agitation by the Cabinet in front of Raj Nivas last year, the Chief Minister said the protest was called off after Ms Bedi agreed to appoint a committee to look into the government’s decision to introduce VRS to the mill workers.

The VRS for AFT, he said was one of the 37 demands raised by the Cabinet during the agitation. After the agitation was called off, the government forwarded the file related to setting up of a committee to the Lt Governor for her approval. But she then insisted on closing down the mill. Since there was a difference of opinion, the subject was referred to the Ministry of Home Affairs for its consideration, said the Chief Minister.

When the matter was still pending with MHA, the Lt Governor directed the officials to issue closure order against the wish of the elected government, he said. “The closure decision will impact the government only as the elected representatives are only answerable to people. They [employees] will start agitating against our government. Even BJP members are against closing down of the mill . Ms Bedi is trying to create anarchy,” the Chief Minister charged.

Speaking on the occasion, AICC secretary Sanjay Dutt urged Congress workers to be ready for another struggle to free the country from the “divisive,” policies of the Union government.

Kandasamy were among those who attended the function.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/h961uy/article30631970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHNETNARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/lt-governor-asked-to-stop-aft-closure-procedures-puducherry-cm/article30631971.ece
427,2020/01/23,A woman farmer’s switch to organic farming methods,"It was an acid test for Bagyavathi, a woman farmer in Karikalampakkam, when the paddy yield dropped in the first two years of her taking up organic farming. “It was seen as a risk at that time, but I believed that something good would come of it,” said the farmer, who gave up the use of chemical agents when she took to organic methods on a three-acre farmland in 2014.

Her belief and determination saw her come through the initial difficulties and today, Bagyavathi is one of the success stories in organic farming lore in the region. The farmer raises four indigenous varieties of paddy with good yield. At the opening of a five-day workshop hosted by the French Institute of Pondicherry, Bagyavathi shared her story with a roomful of agriculture experts and researchers.

As a pioneer in organic cultivation in her area, she has since influenced several others farmers to go the organic route.

In 2019, she was the recipient of the Mahila Kisan Award.

428,2020/01/23,Workshop on local food systems begins in Puducherry,"Inaugurating a four-day workshop on the local food systems of Puducherry, food sovereignty and the agro-ecology transition, hosted by the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP) in association with the Department of Agriculture, R. Kamalakannan, Agriculture Minister, on Wednesday said farmers engaged in organic forms of cultivation were at the forefront of a bottom-up transition to healthy foods.

Mr. Kamalakannan said while there were different organic farming practices such as ‘Nammalvar’ and the ‘Zero budget natural farming’ adopted by farmers in the region, they shared a fundamental focus on using local resources and prioritising consumer health.

Highlighting Puducherry's French legacy, Mr. Kamalakannan, who is a farmer himself, contrasted the looting ways of the British empire with how the French “gave us more than they took”. Their said the influence of the French was reflected in systems of governance such as the commune panchayats and the values of liberty, equality and fraternity.

“Even after erstwhile Pondicherry merged with the Indian Union, the French Government has continued to extend assistance for the development of the Union Territory,” the Minister said.

The IFP programme aims to discuss the concept of local food systems, how they apply to Puducherry, make sense for a variety of actors, and where they figure on the political agenda.

The challenge is to create a collaborative network that integrates sustainable food production, processing, distribution and consumption in order to enhance environmental, economic and social health.

There will also be discussions on food sovereignty, social and environmental justice and agro-ecology.

The workshop sets the discussions against the backdrop of three significant scenarios. Despite the agricultural modernisation of the Green Revolution, India has preserved, in certain contexts, a diversity of production around native and indigenous seeds. The preservation of these seeds is a political struggle led by social movements, peasant organisations, NGOs and activists. The question is how to build bridges with urban consumers to shape a political alliance and shake up public policies in favour of agro-ecology.

Though the Public Distribution System is a unique system of food redistribution to combat food insecurity, the transition to a monetary system has upset the foundations of the pact with society. The debate would reflect on the implications of this change to direct cash transfer.

The third scenario pertains to the consequences of the changes in food production systems on food consumption patterns at the family level, and on public health. The discussions would explore projects that could enhance food quality of rural and urban households, while preserving biodiversity and natural resources, and improving livelihood conditions.

Apart from debates on the city-region food system involving urban/rural consumers, researchers, farmers and food processors, the workshop will also feature field visits to organic farms and an organic food exhibition.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/teihjf/article30628836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23PONDYFOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/workshop-on-local-food-systems-begins-in-puducherry/article30628837.ece
429,2020/01/23,Pondicherry Heritage Festival to begin on Jan. 25,"The sixth edition of the Pondicherry Heritage Festival (January 25 to February 12), a celebration of the heritage and culture of the former French outpost, will begin across multiple venues in the city from Saturday.

The event will combine entertainment spanning music, dance and theatre with a food festival, cycle rides, quizzes and various workshops. The festival spotlight will be on the city’s natural heritage, specifically its wetlands and waterbodies.

Host organisations

Apart from the primary triad of host organisations — People for Pondicherry's Heritage, INTACH and PondyCan — the festival is supported by an array of organisations including the Department of Tourism, the French Institute of Pondicherry and the Alliance Francaise.

The heritage festival and the ten-day Francophone festival (in March), which is also co-hosted by the Alliance Francaise, aim to showcase the city as a spiritual and cultural hub, Satish Nallam, president, Alliance Francaise told presspersons.

Both events also coincide with the pre-summer peak of tourist arrivals in the city, he added.

Originally conceived to draw attention to the city's architectural legacy, the Pondicherry Heritage Festival (PHF) over the years has enlarged its scope to embrace a spectrum of other facets of heritage such as the environment, the idyllic seasides, spiritual and intellectual histories and the interplay between indigenous and imported cultural practices.

Unlike previous editions, the PHF 2020 will have a unique opening with the staging of a theatrical event based on the life and works of Subramania Bharathi, said Sunaina Mandeen of PondyCan and a part of a team that has been conceptualising and conducting the festival.

The show, happening at the Gandhi Thidal, will draw from theatre, recitation, folk and classical dance, and videography. Performed by a 30-member cast, Bharathi Yaar?, an SB Creations production, will be akin to a theatrical showreel of the poet, who had taken refuge in the city during a crucial phase in his life. Not just as a revolutionary poet, the show will also pay tribute to the Mahakavi's relatively less celebrated aspects as an environmentalist and advocate of feminist ideals.

The field trips planned for as part of the event would seek to highlight the loss of wetlands, the man-nature relationship and would try to explore new forms of solidarity with all forms of life, said Raphael of the IFP.

The event will also host two important conversations, one on Ahmedabad's UNESCO application for world heritage stature conducted by Saswat Bandyopadhyay and Rabindra Vasavada, and the other on the heritage conservation experience by Arun Menon from IIT-Madras and a consultant for PWD Chennai.

Tours of heritage buildings, launch of a book on Puducherry, a ‘Made in Pondy’ exhibition showcasing the handicrafts of the region and a food trail to celebrate native cuisine are also part of the events.

World Wetlands Day

Activities have also been planned around World Wetlands Day on February 1 and 2, including a photography exhibition, a dedication of the Joan of Arc garden restored by the People for Pondicherry's Heritage and three cycle rides — a 5 km ride around the city, a 15-km ride to the Velrampet lake and a 50 km ride to Bahour.

430,2020/01/23,NHRC seeks report from DGP on SI’s death,"National Human Rights Commission has directed the police department to submit a report within 8 weeks on the circumstances leading to the death of Sub-Inspector of Police B. Vibal Kumar in the police quarters last year.

In response to a petition filed by the Secretary of Federation for People’s Rights G. Sugumaran, the Commission has asked the Director-General of Police to submit a report within 8 weeks on the death of Mr. Kumar. In his petition, Mr. Sugumaran had sought a probe by the CBI as several people had raised doubts about the death of the officer. The family itself had given a complaint to the DGP alleging foul play in the death, he said.

Mr. Sugumaran told The Hindu that two days ago he received an intimation from the Commission that his petition had been forwarded to the DGP for further action.

The current probe by the CBCID will not be able to establish the truth when accusations are levelled against a superior officer under whom Mr. Kumar served at Nettapakkam police station, he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/nhrc-seeks-report-from-dgp-on-sis-death/article30628630.ece
431,2020/01/23,Govt. had no role in issuing closure order to AFT: CM,"Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday clarified that his government had no role in the closure notice issued to Anglo French Textiles.

Shortly after a delegation of legislators and trade union representatives called on the Chief Minister, he told a select group of reporters that the Cabinet decision was to introduce VRS scheme in the AFT.

But the Lt. Governor had reportedly put pressure on officials to issue closure notice as a condition for clearing pending salary for the employees, the Chief Minister said.

AFT managing director P. Priyatarshny on Tuesday had issued a notice to the Labour Secretary and Trade Union representatives seeking permission to close down the textile mill.

The closure notice was served at a time when the issue had already been referred to the MHA following differences of opinion between the Lt Governor and Cabinet on the future course of action to be adopted to revive the mills, Mr. Narayanasamy said.

AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan, who led the delegation, told reporters that the decision to close down the historic mill was condemnable. The party was in favour of reviving the mill, he said adding the decision to close down the textile unit under Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 would deprive employees much of the financial benefits.

The compensation given to the employees under the Act would only be half of the money eligible under VRS, the AIADMK leader said. Criticising the government for not placing the Vijayan Committee report, which looked into measures to revive the mill, in the Assembly, Mr. Anbalagan said a decision should have been taken only after eliciting the views of legislators. The Lt. Governor and Chief Minister are both responsible for issuing the closure notice, he charged.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/qejhof/article30628599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23PONDYAFT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/govt-had-no-role-in-issuing-closure-order-to-aft-cm/article30628600.ece

434,2020/01/23,Repairs completed on 17 roads near Attukal Bhagavathy temple,"Repairs on 17 of 21 roads in the vicinity of the Attukal Bhagavathy temple have been completed, Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran said on Wednesday.

The work was undertaken in view of the Attukal Pongala festival which will be held at the temple in March. The work on the four remaining roads will be completed by January 31, the Minister said. The Public Works Department had decided to complete the repairs by December 31, 2019. The Minister reviewed the progress of work at a meeting on Wednesday.

The department had earmarked ₹2.14 crore for the maintenance of these roads. In addition to this, the department had undertaken the modernisation of five other roads linked to the 21 roads. This is being undertaken at a cost of ₹7.3 crore, Mr. Sudhakaran said.

The roads are; Manjalikulam road, West Fort-Kanjiravilakom Road, Karamana-Thaliyal-Kalady road, Chiramukku-Ambalathara road and the Kalady-Marthurkadavu road.

435,2020/01/23,Local bodies to get funds for septage treatment,"Local self-government institutions that identify land for starting units to process septage waste will be given ₹5 crore as construction cost, Minister for Finance T.M. Thomas Isaac has said.

He was inaugurating the valedictory of Suchitwa Sangamam, an exhibition of alternatives to plastics that was organised by the Haritha Keralam Mission in association with the Suchitwa Mission, here on Wednesday.

Dr. Isaac said septage waste processing was the biggest challenge faced by the State. But for the Muttathara plant here and the newly launched one at Brahmapuram, no other place in the State had sewerage plants. Only if the large quantities of septage generated everyday was processed properly could water pollution be checked to a large extent.

Local bodies should strongly intervene in this regard, he said, urging everyone to think of the waste generated by them as their responsibility and give importance to its processing.

Grading system

To the question of the future after the Suchitwa Sangamam, he recommended a grading system for panchayats. Grading should be done as per a questionnaire on the basis of activities such as arranging for alternatives to plastics, ensuring source-level waste management, and clean-up of waterbodies.

Dr. Isaac presented a memento to film-maker Vidhu Vincent for her documentary ‘Oru nadiyude punarjaniyude katha.’

Minister for Local Self-government A.C. Moideen who presided over the function said the recommendations that arose at the Suchitwa Sangaman would be codified to chalk out the future course of action for a plastic-free State.

One of the recommendations that arose was to set up a rapid action force for activities related to recycling of waste. Including extended producer responsibility (EPR) in waste processing was one of the demands raised.

Determining the quality of compostible bags used as an alternative to plastic was mooted, as also basic wages for Haritha Karma Sena workers. Recommendation for bringing about a change in attitude and waste management practices and creating awareness among students were also made.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/local-bodies-to-get-funds-for-septage-treatment/article30631129.ece

The panel will consist of 20-25 experts representing various sectors, who are expected to put forward creative suggestions on a broader scale.

A good part of the discussions at ward sabhas and working groups have been completed. Meetings of the 19 working groups, representing various sectors, were completed last week.

“The suggestions of the working groups are focussed mostly on the immediate demands. But, for a master plan, which will decide what the city will be like in 2040, we need a much more broader vision, exploring the unseen potential in each sector. For this, we will need a panel of experts, whose inputs will turn this into a kind of vision document. The master plan will also have a basket of projects which can be taken up in the next two decades. This basket will be the reference point for the preparation of the annual budget in the coming years,” said a Corporation official.

Land use survey

The panel is expected to be formed this month. On Wednesday, a presentation on the land use survey, which has been completed, was made to councillors from various wards. The survey ascertains the present use of land in each ward. Compared to previous surveys of dividing the land use into just two categories, residential and commercial, the current one divides the land use into 20 classes and 360 sub-classes.

440,2020/01/23,Tussle over consecration hots up,"The tussle between two groups over the language in which the consecration of Thanjavur Big Temple should be performed heated up with coordinator of Thanjai Periyakoil Urimai Meetpu Kuzhu, P. Maniarasan issuing a fiat to the State government.

Delivering the valedictory address at a conference organised by TPUMK here on Wednesday in support of Tamil groups demanding that the ceremony be conducted in Tamil, Mr. Maniarasan said the government must announce that the consecration would be conducted in Tamil, before January 30, failing which the group would stage demonstrations.

Members from Cauvery Urimai Meetpu Kuzhu, Tamil Desiya Periyakkam, Hindu Veda Marumalarchi Movement, Naam Thamizhar Katchi and various other Tamil and ‘Siddhar’ organisations and associations participated.

On the other hand, the Tamil Nadu Archagargal Samooga Nalasangam urged the State government to ensure that the consecration of Brahadheeswarar Temple was conducted as per the existing tradition and practice.

In a statement, State president of TASN S. Arunachalam claimed that the Supreme Court had already clarified that the rituals and other events being held in temples built as per ‘agamas’ should be performed as per the ‘agamas’ only. Attempting to deviate from the existing tradition and practice would not only go against the religious principles and beliefs but also tantamount to contempt of court, he maintained.

Hence, the organisation urged the State government to ensure that the consecration was performed in accordance with the ‘agamas’ through the Aadhisiva community people, the ‘archagas’.

When contacted those involved in the preparation of the consecration ceremony said the ‘kumbabishekam’ would be performed in the same manner in which it was held in 1997 where due importance was given to both languages.

Recitation permitted

Meanwhile, the Aalavai Annal Trust, Madurai, and Aalavai Annal Trust, Chidambaram, have been allowed to organise Thanjai Raja Rajecharam (Big Temple) Thirukudamuzhukku Thirumurai Vinnappa Vizha from February 1 to 5 at the temple premises.

The Thirumurai Vinnappa Vizha will begin with recitation of Thirumurai Pannisai by Thanjai Peruvudaiyar temple Othuvamoorthy M. Sivanesan at the ‘yaga salai’ on February 1 at 5.30 p.m.

The Othuvamoorthys will render the Thirumurai hymns at the `yaga salai’ both in the morning and evening from February 2 to 4 and on the morning of the consecration day, February 5.

Apart from this, Panniru Thirumurai Muttrodhal will be performed by the Othuvamoorthys at the ‘yaga salai’ from February 1 to 5 and Thirumurai Aganda Parayanam will be held at Natarajar Mandapam during the consecration ceremony.

On the final day, the Othuvamoorthys and students learning Thevaram and Thiruvasagam will recite the hymns from 8 a.m. to noon near Nandhi Mandapam.

Asthra Homam begins

A homam (oblation in fire) for the smooth conduct of the consecration ceremony called Asthra Homam, sponsored jointly by Agasthiyar Trust, Thirukazhukundram, and Thanjavur Aranmanai Devasthanam, began at the Big Temple premises on Thursday.

The poornahuthi of Asthra Homam will be performed around 12.30 p.m. on Friday, according to sources.

In addition to Asthra Homam at the Big Temple, shanthi homams were performed at eight Kaliamman temples in and around Thanjavur town and at Mariamman Temple, Punnainallur, on Thursday as a prelude to the consecration of Big Temple.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/gk6xiq/article30640170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY24-ASTHRAHOMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tussle-over-consecration-hots-up/article30634866.ece

448,2020/01/23,A new dawn for Krishna University,"The 71st Republic Day is set to herald a new dawn in the history of the decade-old Krishna University, as the premier institute is all set to shift to its 100-acre campus on the outskirts of Machilipatnam from the National College campus.

The university had spent nearly ₹80 crore on construction of the administrative and academic blocks at Rudravaram. It had recently obtained permission from the Central Public Works Department, the developer, by paying the pending cost of ₹12 crore.

Established in 2008, the university is being run on the National College campus, offering 20 courses in various streams. A new team — Vice-Chancellor K.B. Chandra Sekhar and Registrar K. Krishna Reddy — has recently been appointed.

“This Republic Day is a new dawn for us in all aspects. We are all set to shift to our own campus formally,” Prof. Reddy told The Hindu.

“We strongly believe in the contributions made by the previous vice-chancellors in giving shape to this institution. All the former vice-chancellors will be roped in planning on how to utilise the sprawling 100-acre campus”, added Prof. Reddy.

Former Vice-Chancellor V. Venkaiah had been credited in initiating and finalising the design of the university buildings on the Rudravaram campus, where his successor S. Rama Krishna succeeded in completing the construction activity of the palatial buildings to be eligible to obtain 12-B status from the University Grants Commission (UGC).

12 B status

“In March, we are applying to the UGC for the 12-B status. It’s another milestone attempt. On the ground, we have met every eligibility criteria required to get the 12-B status that adds strength to the university to flourish further on all fronts, including financial aid from the UGC,” added Mr. Reddy.

In his maiden press conference in earlier this month, Prof Chandra Sekhar said: “On the academic front, a dedicated effort will be put to bring the academics back on track with a focus on the departments that are weak (in academics)”.

According to the office of the Registrar, the university formally got consent from various government wings — Space Science, Earth Science, Environment and Meteorological services — to sign pacts for the collaborative research in the respective areas.

Classical touch

It was former Mr. Venkaiah and Mr. Rama Krishna who explored the need to give a fillip to Kuchipudi, the classical dance, by encouraging the art form through academics.

However, in-charge Vice-Chancellor (till January 10) Y.K. Sundara Krishna showed his patronage towards the dance by setting up an exclusive department for it — Department of Fine Arts and Theater Arts — on the Rudravaram campus.

“Krishna University has embraced our dance. Such patronage by a government institution helps in spreading it across the globe in the age of technology. Students from across South India are enrolling with us to study the dance for Masters and P.G. Diploma courses,” Pasumarthy Kesava Prasad, Co-ordinator, Kuchipudi courses in the university, said.

449,2020/01/23,Data | How has the state of democracy in India changed since 2008?,"At rank 51, India dropped 10 places in 2019 from 2018 in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index, a measure of the state of democracy. In the last six years, among 167 countries India saw the second-highest decline in civil liberties. While the democratic index improved between 2008 and 2014, it worsened between 2014 and 2019.

Latest position

The overall democracy index is a combination of five categories. Each is graded on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). The table shows India’s index value in 2019 and the number of countries that rank better or worse than India. Countries that have the same index value as India were ignored.

The 2019 scorecard

image/svg+xml Index Value Nations better than India Nations worse than India Overall democracy 6.90 50 116 1. Electoral pluralism 8.67 64 102 2. Governance 6.79 39 123 3. Political participation 6.67 26 119 4. Political culture 5.63 57 80 5. Civil liberties 6.76 69 94 4. Political culture

Civil liberties include freedom of the press, freedom to protest, unrestricted access to the Internet, an independent judiciary, religious tolerance, equal treatment of all citizens and basic security.

Political culture refers to popular support for democracy, a strong tradition of separation of religion and State, etc.

Political participation takes into consideration voter turnout, share of women parliamentarians, etc.

Governance refers to influence of elected representatives in determining government policy, supremacy of the legislature etc.

Pluralism refers to free and fair elections, universal adult suffrage, equal campaigning opportunities, etc.

2014 vs 2019

The table shows the change in index values between 2014 and 2019. For instance, the civil liberties index decreased by 2.65 points in 2019 from 2014. In the period, 164 countries saw lower degradation of civil liberties than India. In other words, their values did not decrease beyond 2.65 points. Only Nicaragua saw a higher degradation of civil liberties in this period (-2.94 points.

The change since 2014

Two time periods

The table compares the change in India’s index values between 2008-2014 and 2014-2019. For instance, the overall democracy index of India increased by 0.12 points between 2008 and 2014 only to decrease by 1.02 points between 2014 and 2019. Except the governance index, all the other categories saw an increase between 2008 and 2014. All the categories saw a decrease between 2014 and 2019.

450,2020/01/23,Students line up for biryani in midday meal,"As the bell rang at noon, students of the municipal primary school at China Waltair ran out of their classes and formed a line near the school dais. They took out plates and waited for their turn as the new midday meal (MDM) menu for Wednesday was vegetable biryani, served with aloo kurma and a chikki.

The children were all smiles. “Biryani was very tasty, so was aloo kurma. Yesterday, we had pulihora” said Class I student Avinash. Another student K. Praveen quickly added that he liked the ‘chikki’.

Earlier, chikki made up of ‘Jonna Palukul’ used to be served and many children did not like. But they liked the groundnut ‘chikki’ served on Wednesday, said a teacher after tasting the midday meal.

R.V.K.D Mahalakshmi, in-charge of the school, said it is now a mandatory that some faculty has to taste the food before it is served to the students.

Students from a several government schools in China Gadili, Madhurwada and other places were also in favour of the new menu.

“We have different varieties now. Biryani, pulihora, khichdi and sweet pongal have included in the new menu and they are being served in rotation. The students are liking the new menu,” said M. Sarada, a teacher of a government school in Arilova Colony.

As per the new menu, rice, pappu charu, egg curry, chikki are being served on Mondays and pulihora and tomato dal are prepared on Tuesday. Biryani is being served with aloo kurma on Wednesday, while khichidi and tomato chutney will be provided on Thursday. Friday menu includes rice and leafy dal, while Saturday menu includes rice, sambar and sweet pongal. Chikki is being served on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while boiled eggs is being given four days a week except for Monday and Saturday.

Officials said that ward and village volunteers have been instructed to pay random visit to schools and check the quality of the food. Issues in the implementation of the midday meal can be also reported through an app which has been designed for the purpose.

However, many schools in the district reportedly failed to serve boiled eggs. Teachers claimed that they had not received eggs by Tuesday.

‘Eggs not supplied’

“This is not for the first time that we did not receive eggs. It happened several times earlier,” said a teacher of a government school.

When this was brought to the notice of the District Education Officer (DEO) B. Lingeswara Reddy, he said that efforts were on to supply eggs to all schools.

“We have been receiving reports that all schools are receiving eggs as per the menu. However, if some schools did not receive it, it might be because of holidays. Being holidays, contractors might not have preserved eggs. So, the supply may take time. We will look into the issue,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/z9g9xl/article30628698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VZ3MIDDAYMEAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/students-line-up-for-biryani-in-midday-meal/article30628699.ece

452,2020/01/23,YSRCP leaders burn effigy of Naidu,"YSRCP activists and leaders staged dharnas and burnt the effigy of Telugu Desam Party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday late evening.

The protesters took to the streets after the Legislative Council referred the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill-2020 and the CRDA Repeal Bill to the select committee for perusal.

Both the Bills were passed in Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, but the TDP invoked the Rule 71 and moved a motion in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. After a debate and day-long hectic activity, the Chairman of the Legislative Council referred the Bills to the select committee.

“This clearly indicates that Mr. Naidu does not want development for Visakhapatnam and the North Andhra region,” said YSRCP spokesperson Konda Rajeev Gandhi. K.K. Raju condemned the stand of the former Chief Minister on the three capitals issue and the way he conducted himself in the Legislative Council on Wednesday.

“It is the right of the people of Visakhapatnam to get the Executive capital,” he said during a protest at Gurudwara Junction.

454,2020/01/23,Vizag youngsters develop ‘Bhai’ app for women in distress,"In an attempt to make it easy for the women in distress to alert the police and family members, two youngsters from the city have developed an app for android cellphones titled ‘Bhai’.

How it works

E. Jeevan and A. Shankar have designed the app. “In case of emergency, the users can hit the ‘alert button’ in the app and a message will be sent to the nearest police station. The family members or trusted contacts who have installed the app will also receive the alert.

“People who have downloaded the app will receive a notification as soon as any user clicks the alert button. They can also see the location of the person in distress. The users can add trusted contacts in the app. The app will send alerts to the people within 20 km radius. A message mentioning the location of the user seeking help will also be sent to all the trusted contacts even if they do not install the app,” explained Mr. Jeevan, while demonstrating the feature of the app here on Wednesday.

Offline mode

Mr. Jeevan said that they were working on several features so that the distress alert will be sent to police and trusted contacts in offline mode. “We are sure to get this feature done in the next few days,” he said.

Mr. Jeevan, son of a head constable, said that the spurt in the crimes against women had prompted him to develop the app. “We started working on the app from December 2 last year and developed it within two months. The app will be available in Google Play Store for download from January 26,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fjwuhj/article30628574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VZ2BHAIAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-youngsters-develop-bhai-app-for-women-in-distress/article30628575.ece

457,2020/01/23,"I drew on the stories I have been hearing from childhood to write ‘Meesha’, says author S Hareesh","In a sliver of land defined by water and caste, unfolds a tale of a man and his moustache. The ripples of unrest and change that the Dalit Vavachan’s moustache brings about in a caste-ridden village in the early part of the twentieth century in Kerala is narrated in Meesha, as only a master wordsmith can, blending magic, myth, fact and fiction.

S Hareesh, one of the most-discussed Malayalam writers in recent times, sets his first novel, Meesha, in the fecund soil of north Kuttanad, where he hails from. A multiple award-winning writer, Hareesh says he had always wanted to write about the land, its inhabitants and unique ecology.

“North Kuttanad is different from other parts of Kuttanad. There is the annual intrusion of salt water into our fields, paddy is cultivated in fields that are below sea level... It is a land rich in myths, folklore and traditions. I drew on the stories I have been hearing from childhood to write Meesha,” says Hareesh speaking on phone from Kaipuzha, near Neendoor in Kottayam, where he works in the revenue department.

Collector of tales

Travelling all around Kuttanad and interacting with elderly residents in the region who have witnessed the change of seasons helped him gather material for the novel. “It was a heartfelt desire of mine to make Kuttanad a character in one of my works because of its special characteristics. Even the flora and the water-dwelling creatures and birds here are special. That is why I conceptualised Meesha in this place of enchantment,” says Hareesh.

Moustache, the English translation of the novel, published by Harper Collins, reaches book stores on January 30. Translated by Jayasree Kalathil, the book, hopes Hareesh, will enable a broader audience to read his work as “the novel was mostly read in Kerala in the backdrop of the controversy that erupted around it. Such a controversy is the worst catastrophe to befall a book. It takes away the attention from what the author has discussed in his book and focusses it on the controversy. I hope the translation will be read in its true spirit,” says the 44-year-old writer.

Although the writer and the translator did not meet in person, they were in constant conversation over phone and WhatsApp. “Meesha has a great deal of regional nuances, words, dialects and usage that are rooted in Kuttanad. It is not necessary that everyone should be familiar with the language and the context in which certain words and phrases are used. After every chapter, she (Jayashree) would send me her work to read. She saw it as a creative piece,” says Hareesh.

Since the novel deals with the intricacies of a casteist society, the book begins with a short note by Hareesh that explains its background, which he hopes will serve as an explanation for the ambience in which the novel unfolds.

‘Moustache’, English translation of S Hareesh’s ‘Meesha’

And how does a story unfold for Hareesh? Is it all planned in his head or do the characters take on a life of their own on paper? “Both happens in the case of every writer. When one sits down to write, there is a rough idea of how the book should be, the number of chapters, the broad storyline, the conclusion and so on. But once the actual writing starts, changes creep in, whether it be a short story or a novel. I doubt if any writer can stick to a completely planned framework. Therein lies the creativity and comfort of writing a story. A lot of changes and addition come in while writing. Those changes often become the most interesting part of a story, imbuing the characters with life,” explains the author.

World of words He is the author of three short-story collections. Adam received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award. Rasavidyayude Charithram won him the Geetha Hiranyan Endowment Award of Kerala Sahithya Akademi and Appan is a collection of six stories.

Hareesh has written two screenplays, Aedan and Jallikattu. Aedan, based on three stories in Adam and directed by Sanju Surendran, received the Kerala State Award for best screenplay in 2017. Jallikattu, based on his short story ‘Maoist’, premièred at the Toronto Film Festival and won a silver peacock at the International Film Festival of India.

Admitting that he was disappointed about the controversy that ensued after a certain dialogue of a character was read out of context, he avers that the incident has not cowed him down in any way. “Never. If one can’t write what one wants to, then it is best not to write. There is no need for any kind of censorship. One should have the courage and the right circumstances to write what one feels will do justice to the story. If that is missing, it is best not to write. In the case of Meesha, I never expected such an uproar as the manuscript had been read by at least 10 people before it went into print,” he says.

However, Hareesh warns that there is a “new kind of censorship in vogue among mainstream publishers in Kerala.” “Recently, a reputed author and scenarist’s work on the Channar Lahala (revolt) in erstwhile Travancore in the early part of the nineteenth century was sent back because it was about a sensitive phase in history involving caste. The publisher decided that it would rake up a controversy and took the safe way out. That is an extremely dangerous trend for writers in Kerala. Today, nothing is free from commercial concerns and there is a kind of hidden censorship,” he elaborates.

The writer points out that if people can’t fictionalise history or write about it, it is a disastrous trend for the language. However, he rues that many writers seem unaware of this or don’t want to get into a tussle with the publishers. “At present, the trend is to please the publishers.”

Moving on to his works adapted for the screen, Hareesh says that in all the projects, he has been an active participant. “But cinema is a director’s art. He is the creator, not the writer. My story will remain as a story. When that gets transformed into a cinema, it is 100% the art of the director. He is free to do what he wants,” explains the writer.

Welcoming the revival of films inspired by literary works, Hareesh says Kerala has always had a rich literary tradition and many famous works have been visually translated on to the screen. “There was a decline in between. But now, there is a renewed interest in cinematic adaptations of literary works. I take it as a positive sign,” says the writer, who is currently working on a new novel.

IN OTHER WORDS

Jayasree Kalathil, who recently won the 2019 Crossword Book Award for Indian Language Translation for her translation of N Prabhakaran’s novella, Diary of a Malayali Madman, says translating Meesha was a challenge that she enjoyed.

“It is set in a different century. A lot of what the book covers is historical and includes many myths, legends, folklore and all of that. So, I had to do a lot of background reading to get a sense of things. For instance, I read about below-sea-level farming in Kuttanad, agrarian Dalit relationship at that time, the people mentioned in it... getting a sense of the area and its history. The other challenge was in the language itself. Since I hail from Malabar, the dialect in the book was not familiar to me but I had enjoyed reading the book and that is why I agreed to take it up,” says Jayasree from London where she lives.

“It is not about just translating Malayalam into English. Meesha has lots of different types of people speaking in different time periods. There are chapters in the book where the narrator is talking to his son, telling him a story. That is in the present, which has a different register while the story itself is in a different register. There is a whole chapter made up of songs. That was quite tough. I was in constant dialogue with Hareesh. Rather than focussing on the poetry of the songs, because that would have been impossible to do, we decided to turn them into songs in English. Even the politics of the language came into play.”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/bat4ai/article30633084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvmhareesha,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/s-hareesh-on-his-first-novel-meesha-which-is-getting-translated-into-english-as-moustache/article30633087.ece
458,2020/01/23,Sujata Massey explores what being an ethical person means to Perveen Mistry in her second case,"After solving the murder on Malabar Hill, the only female lawyer in 1921 Bombay, Perveen Mistry, goes to the princely state of Satapur to mediate between the dowager queen and her daughter-in-law, on the tricky matter of the crown prince’s education. With the king meeting an untimely death, Perveen has to negotiate palace intrigue, ancient curses and a jewel with history while advising the maharanis. The Satapur Moonstone (Penguin) is the sequel to Sujata Massey’s A Murder on Malabar Hill. talks of Perveen’s further adventures in an email interview. Excerpts.

When we spoke earlier for A Murder on Malabar Hill, Sujata spoke of the need to keep the main character single. Does the government agent, Colin Sandringham's presence indicate otherwise?

Status single

“When we consider the lives of India’s first two women lawyers, Cornelia Sorabji and Mithan Tata Lam, marital status had a big impact,” says the 55-year-old British-American author based in Baltimore, Maryland. “Cornelia, the lawyer who remained single, had a robust career as both solicitor and barrister that spanned over 30 years. Mithan retired as a barrister within a year of marriage. Why? Was it because of social pressure? Those real life outcomes make it logical for Perveen to remain single as long as she can. Can her social life be fun and rewarding without marriage, though? I absolutely think it can.”

The title brings memories of Wilkie Collins’ The Moonstone, often described as the first detective novel, involving a precious stone stolen during the Siege of Seringapatam. “I first read The Moonstone when I was 12. My father gave me the book as a Christmas gift. He knew I had been reading Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle and thought another classic mystery with a link to India would be suitable. The Moonstone’s deeper theme of unjust theft from India was something that I didn’t focus on until an older age — and we need to remember that although it is called “moonstone” in that novel, it is actually a very huge diamond, not a semi-precious stone.”

Sujata says she decided to use the actual semiprecious moonstone for after learning it was one of India’s indigenous rocks. “A moonstone also has a mysterious, milky glow that makes it perfect as a missing jewel in a mystery.”

The author of the Rei Shimura series says she set the book in a princely state because almost half of the subcontinent was under royal command in the late British period. “The Indian landowners and nobles had a complicated relationship with the British government. The British offered them military protection as long as they didn’t advocate for freedom and cooperated with British regulations including the schooling and marital choices for the maharajas. Many royal women lived in purdah, and because they had the power to give birth to heirs, they were often at risk from jealous relatives who wanted to create new dynasties.

Perveen learns about these conditions when she goes to visit the princely state of Satapur, a fictitious place I’ve tucked in the Sahyadri Mountains not far from the real Lonavala and Khandala. I think Perveen could easily travel to other states in future books as well as interesting cities in British India.”

Life lessons

In A Murder on Malabar Hill, which won the Mary Higgins Clark Award, Perveen confronts a serious fear that stems from trauma in her past. Sujata says, “She is ultimately empowered to go full-steam-ahead in the law practice with her father, Jamshedji Mistry. She has so much more confidence. This makes her willing to travel for the assignment she is offered in The Satapur Moonstone, although it raises some concerns. She knows it could be a great way to secure a lot of future work from royal women in princely kingdoms, yet she has to balance this with the interests of her client, the British government. Can she represent a client like this when she longs for India to be independent? What does being a professional and an ethical person mean?”

Sujata says she has not conceived of the series with a finite number of books. “I would like to find out how long I enjoy writing about Perveen Mistry. Lots of plot ideas keep popping up, so I am sure that I will be busy for years to come.”

The humble poha has a starring role in the book. “I noticed poha on many breakfast menus in Maharashtra, and it is also a family favourite. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like poha. It looks innocent and plain and that makes it all the more suspicious to Perveen. The breakfast she eats at the palace: bread, eggs, fruit is a lot like a meal for a nervous traveller trying not to get sick.”

Like the earlier book, the clothes are exquisite whether the divided skirt Perveen wears to go riding or the gorgeous saris. “I collect art books and pamphlets about sari design and am happy to talk about the different weaves and draping styles, though I must confess I am all thumbs when it comes to putting a sari on myself. I particularly like the moment when Perveen arrives at the Circuit House, bathes by candlelight since there is no electricity, and then dresses in a sari of blue watered silk sari shot through with gold threads. It is subtle but appropriate for dinner. Or so she thinks!

Her dining companion has only made the effort of changing into a fresh shirt. Hasn’t everyone experienced a sartorial mismatch, and felt anxiety or irritation because of it?",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/2jf4xx/article30631798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgmsujataJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/sujata-masseys-the-satapur-moonstone-penguin-is-out/article30631799.ece
459,2020/01/23,How three friends are giving a new lease of life to ‘kasturi manjal’ or wild turmeric,"Kasturi manjal with milk cream or rose water has been grandma’s potion for glowing skin. Turmeric, an essential ingredient in all Indian kitchens, has gained fame and acceptance for its cosmetic and healing properties and has been a core ingredient of many beauty products and medicines.

However, kasturi manjal (wild turmeric) or Curcuma aromatica is on the verge of extinction and what is being sold in the market isn’t authentic. Creating awareness about the crop and its properties is BK Jayachandran, M Abdul Wahab and KR Balachandran, who are on a “mission to promote and popularise real kasturi manjal”.

Hortico Greens, their venture, offers seeds or rhizomes of the turmeric and organic turmeric powder. “We are growing it on 25 cents at Vandithadam near Thiruvallam. It is now ready for harvest,” says Abdul Wahab.

The initiative is a continuation of Jayachandran’s one-and-a-half-decade-long research on wild turmeric at the Department of Plantation Crops & Spices at Kerala Agricultural University (KAU). “I took up the species for study after it was found that it caused a burning sensation on the skin. A student of mine travelled across Kerala and collected 12 varieties of the species. We did a DNA fingerprint test and it was found that only three of them were authentic. Our ‘re-search’ led to the conclusion that what is being sold in the market is a fake genotype, which is the manja koova or Curcuma zedoaria. The same crop is powdered and used in confectioneries as well,” he says. He adds that the actual kasturi manjal powder does not usually cause any burning sensation and its colour is cream and not bright yellow.

Plan of action

Support came from the National Horticulture Board and the Kerala government through which farms were set up in select areas in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts. A scheme was implemented in Kunnathukal panchayat in the district and later it was included under the people’s plan projects. Now a few farmers in Kunnathukal and Kallikkad grama panchayats are cultivating kasturi manjal.

Fact file BK Jayachandran, M Abdul Wahab and KR Balachandran were classmates for their graduation and postgraduation courses. Jayachandran retired as head, Department of Plantation Crops & Spices at Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), while Prof Abdul Wahab was former head, Department of Vegetable Crops at KAU. Balachandran retired from Canara Bank.

Hortico Greens promotes homestead cultivation and offers assistance in setting up kitchen gardens and orchards. Their nursery at Manacaud has saplings of fruit-bearing plants.

In the 1970s, of the total turmeric plantation in India, five percent was kasturi manjal. But by late 80s, it reduced to 3.6% and now, but for isolated plantations, especially in forest areas and gardens dedicated to plants with medicinal values, the crop is hardly grown on a large scale.

Although Jayachandran’s research led to the development of a “comprehensive package of practices” to popularise kasturi manjal cultivation, the project lost steam after he retired from service. “Nevertheless, I preserved the rhizomes, cultivated it at home, sold the seeds and made the powder for personal use. I was disappointed I couldn’t achieve what I had envisaged,” he says. However, a discussion with his friends Abdul Wahab and Balachandran brought it back on track.

The turmeric can be cultivated in open fields, in flower pots or grow bags. “The farming methods are easy and it can be harvested in seven to eight months. You get a decent yield and once it is dried, the powder can be prepared at home itself,” Jayachandran explains.

They now plan to supply the seeds and powder across India. “Our objective is to propagate the crop and create awareness about it. Profit is the last thing on our mind. This is a small effort from our part to protect a crop that has been proved to be immensely beneficial,” Balachandran avers.

460,2020/01/23,‘Rising carbon dioxide levels may double floods’,"The risk of extreme floods or storms could double every 13 years at the rate carbon-dioxide concentrations are building up in the atmosphere. This could spell a “catastrophe” for India, scientists have warned in a study.

The number of intense “hydro-meteorological” disasters could increase by 5.4% annually for an “average” country facing annually nearly one “extreme disaster” (defined as one that causes 100 or more fatalities and/or affects 1,000 or more people).

India faces 5-10 times as many extreme events as the average country, the authors say. “One more extreme event in India [such as the Kerala floods of 2018 that killed at least 400] would strain the ability of the country to cope; a doubling of the numbers in 13 years, using the above estimation, would be catastrophic,” authors Ramon E. Lopez, Vinod Thomas and Pablo A. Troncoso write in a note accompanying the study. The report, Impacts of Carbon Dioxide Emissions on Global Intense Hydro-meteorological Disasters, appears in the January issue of Climate, Disaster and Development Journal.

The authors relied on econometric modelling which, they say, complements the traditional approach of climate modelling to explore the factors that have contributed to the increase in the frequency of flood and storm events. Econometric modelling involves accounting for a country’s vulnerability to hazards and its GDP, population density and changes in mean rainfall.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/cra1mu/article30636710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THLTKERALAFLOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rising-carbon-dioxide-levels-may-double-floods/article30636711.ece
461,2020/01/23,"This bird can walk up a tree, hunting for insects","We’ve got so used to the call of the Brown-headed Barbet (Psilopogon zeylanicus) that we don’t even notice it anymore. It is, in fact, one of the most familiar sounds of India: loud and monotonous through the year, and most persistent from January to June — from the start of ‘developing bonds’ with the other sex to the nesting period.

The species often engages in a sort of ‘follow the leader’ calling, where others take up the call when one starts. It begins with a harsh sort of laugh, followed by tur-r-r-r kutur-kotur-kotur. While trying to pair up, the bird usually stations itself almost at the top of a tree and calls out loud, incessantly.

The sexes look alike, with an overall green resonating with most Barbets of the world. Adults are about 27 cm long and have a streaked brown head (hence the name). Its neck and breast are also brown, with white speckles on the shoulders.

Barbets are invariably mistaken to be woodpeckers, as they have similar characteristics. They both have cavity-nesting behaviour, the ability to walk vertically up and down the trunk and branches, and wood-pecking behaviour for making holes (for nesting) and sometimes drumming on the trunk for insects.

If you see a hole in a tree and think, ‘Ah, woodpecker’, know that there are a lot of other birds that nest in tree cavities and are referred to as cavity-nesters.

It feeds chiefly on the fruit of wild fig trees, such as the banyan and peepul, essential components of our city gardens. This makes the Brown-headed Barbet one of the most common birds around us. They are primarily frugivores (fruit eaters), but are often observed feeding on insects, which they also feed their young ones with, to meet their body protein requirement.

The species is purely arboreal, living high from the ground in heavy foliage, making it hard to spot. Thus, like several other birds in India, this Barbet is exceedingly well known to many people only by sound and not by sight. Considering their strict arboreal nature and their green plumage, they blend most naturally with leaves, and their curious flesh-coloured beak and yellow eye patch resembles berries, a camouflaging characteristic which helps them evade imminent risks.

In times of danger, they remain still and silent. The flight between trees is silent too, strong and undulating, with a smooth rising and falling form, which furthermore helps them in avoiding danger.

Their eggs are usually laid in March and April, in chambers excavated by both parents in one of the larger branches of soft-wooded trees (such as banyan) with a short neatly cut tunnel as entrance.

Once the eggs are laid, both males and females take turns in incubating them. The parents are also very particular about keeping the nest clean by ridding it of excreta regularly. They do experience competition from other birds like Parakeets and Mynas for nesting space, so they aggressively defend their turf.

In all, the species is fairly tolerant to the presence of humans around them, and have adapted rather well to urban life.

462,2020/01/23,Climatic fluctuations impact climatic niches of owlets,"Ongoing climate change and global warming may cause a shift in the climatic niches and habitats of the owlets or small-sized owls (20-25 cm) notes a new study. Climate niche is the optimal climatic conditions in which the species can survive. Owlets primarily feed on insects and small vertebrates, playing a vital role as a member of predatory guild, and acting as natural insect-controllers and rodent-killing machines.

The study looked at how climatic changes in the past affected the climatic niches of owlets and how the present climatic scenario may influence them. This can help frame new conservation strategies, adds the paper recently published in Ecology and Evolution.

The team of researchers from across India studied four owlets - Forest Owlet, Jungle Owlet, Spotted Owlet and Little owl. Using available field observations, climate data and modeling studies, the team reconstructed the climatic niches for the four owlets in the four time periods - Last Interglacial (120-140 thousand years ago), Last Glacial Maximum (22 thousand years ago), Mid-Holocene (6000 years ago), and present scenario (1960- 1990).

They found that the climatically suitable areas for owlets underwent many cycles of expansion and reduction across the years.

“It is known that changing climate affects vegetation and hence, the habitat structure of the species. In the wake of global warming and climate change, several researchers have predicted that there will be detrimental effects on several species due to increase in global temperatures. It is hard to comment on how increasing temperature will change habitats, but what we can say is, it will,” says Dr. Pankaj Koparde, who carried out the study as part of his PhD at Sálim Ali Centre for Onrnithology & Natural History (SACON) and Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati. He is the first and corresponding author of the paper.

The study also tried to understand the biogeography of the Forest Owlet, an endemic and endangered owlet of India. Though the Forest Owlet occupies the same geographical region (Central India and North Western Ghats) and share similar food habits with the Spotted Owlet and Jungle Owlet, it is narrowly distributed. Why such a strange pattern in their geographical distribution? “Answering this complex question needs a comparative biographical perspective, hence we thought of understanding the impact of past climate on their distribution,” he adds.

The team notes that Forest Owlets are generally found in teak-dominated landscapes at the edge of the forests while Spotted Owlets are human commensals occupying human-dominated landscape (rural and urban areas). Jungle Owlets occupy dry and moist deciduous forests.

“We are still trying to understand their habitat and niche requirements. We are presently involved in a genomic study on these species which will answer questions regarding their population past and give us clarity about their evolutionary trajectories,” adds Dr. Koparde. “We are also involved in understanding global trends in owl species richness, factors affecting them, and impact of night light intensification (light pollution) on them using biodiversity informatics.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/i2s5rj/article30631886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPOTTEDOWLET,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/climatic-fluctuations-impact-climatic-niches-of-owlets/article30631890.ece
463,2020/01/23,"Cabbage, pineapple and bitter-gourd lamps?","When it is dark, Vaidehi Thakkar switches on a cabbage. Well, cabbage-inspired light to be precise.

Veggie Lights is a line of lamps created through a collaboration between interior architect Vaidehi and light designer Nir Meiri. Nir’s studio in London launched Marine Light in 2013, incorporating seaweed, and Mycelium Lights 2018, with the vegetative part of the fungus. Vaidehi is lead designer at ‘Spaces, Things, Etcetera,’ a multi-disciplinary design studio in Pune, which experiments with contemporary materials and techniques. The collaboration resulted in red cabbage lamps, which made an impact at the 2019 London Design Festival, triggering conversations on design and sustainability.

“The inspiration was from the form of the cabbage and the lamp was moulded from fibre flats,” says Vaidehi, who hails from Alappuzha, and now lives in Pune with her husband and two sons. Fibre flats, she explains, are tiles that she created from dehydrated fruits and vegetables. The result is a fine, brittle paper-like material, “more like skin”, which is fused with glass when made into a tile and used as veneer with wood. The process focuses on sustainability, as even the adhesives are water-based, adds Vaidehi.

The designer was in Kochi recently to plan an exhibition during Kochi Muziris Biennale in December 2020.

She says she was introduced to fibre art while volunteering at Ohio’s Akron Art Museum in 2007. She also did some courses related to fiber art at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia and Cleveland Institute of Art. Watching a friend work with handmade paper at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine was an eye-opener and she began to refine the process. When she returned to India in 2010, Vaidehi did not want to limit herself to being an artist and ventured into manufacturing as well. “I don’t do it as pure art in 2D form, but more for functional objects. With a language of architecture, I relate more to design products,” she says.

In 2012, Vaidehi worked with Tony Davlin, the Boston-based glass artist, to create a series of glass tiles for the American design house Ann Sacks (part of Kohler). Called the ‘The Market Collection’, it featured thin slices of bitter gourd, pear, carrot and cucumbers, that were cut with a special mandolin, then pressed, dried and arranged over a white backing to create tiles.

Depending on the application, fibre flats can be moulded, says Vaidehi. A year and a half ago, the product was short-listed for the Hirosaki design competition in 2018-19.

Vaidehi is now working on a table, using the flats as veneer. The process of creating a long-lasting material from natural fibres is a challenge, she says, adding, “We tried different processes to make it fire-retardant and anti-fungal. The treatment differs from application to application.” She explains that each A4 size tile needs around two pineapples or four pears.

Since they are primarily an engaging visual material, Vaideshi says she allows fibre flats to do the talking. Once the application is decided — whether it is lighting, screen or wall art, furniture — she selects the type fiber flat that is to be used. This is critical and needs some time as there are over 40 types to choose from. Then begins the experimentation with the material — whether to use it in multiples; in sheet or a moulded form; how to get the maximum strength from inherent fibres for a particular form and so on.

“Every fruit and vegetable has its own texture, which we may not notice while consuming it. This is highlighted in a dehydrated state,” explains Vaidehi. De-seeded, the pear has muted brown tones, a flowery centre and a slightly leathery feel; the bitter gourd has an attractive snake-like scaly texture; the pineapple’s big flowery pattern and lemony colour makes it pert and interesting and the onion turns lacy. “All these are translucent, so they are good for lighting.”

Growing up in Alappuzha, where her family owned a jute business , she says she has always been attracted to natural fibres. Looking back, she recalls the wonder with which she watched women in the village deftly work with jute. “I have always observed how people have try to bring Nature into their spaces. Some hang pictures of waterfalls or flowers or birds; some put flowers in vases; some have nature-inspired prints on their wallpaper... This is my way of bringing Nature into spaces; a way of perceiving it in a different light, with all its perfections and imperfections.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7bd6i/article30634044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpSTEFiberFlatsPShadowJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/vaidehi-thakkars-vegetable-inspired-lights/article30634049.ece
464,2020/01/23,Novel Chinese coronavirus may have ‘jumped’ to humans from snakes: Study,"The novel Chinese coronavirus, which has so far claimed 17 lives and infected over 550 people, likely resided in snakes before being transmitted to humans, according to a new study that may help design better defensive strategies against future outbreaks of the deadly pathogen.

The researchers, including Wei Ji from Peking University Health Science Centre in China, said patients who became infected with the coronavirus -- named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) -- were exposed to wildlife animals at a wholesale market, where seafood, poultry, snake, bats, and farm animals were sold.

The study, published in the Journal of Medical Virology, offers insights on the origins of the most recent outbreak of pneumonia caused by the virus, which started in the middle of December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, and has now spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan.

Conducting a detailed genetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV, and comparing it with those of different coronaviruses from various geographic locations and host species, the study found that the new virus formed from a combination of CoV found in bats, and another of unknown origin.

“It is critical to determine the animal reservoir of the 2019-nCoV in order to understand the molecular mechanism of its cross-species spread,” the scientists reported in the study.

The new virus, the scientists said, developed a mix, or “recombination”, of a viral protein which recognises and binds to host cells.

According to the study, this recognition is key to allowing viruses to enter host cells, and cause infection and disease.

On further analysis, the researchers found evidence that the 2019-nCoV may have resided in snakes before being transmitted to humans.

“Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV,” the researchers said.

However, some scientists, not involved in the study, have questioned the conclusions derived from the analysis.

David L Robertson from the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research in the UK, told PTI, “there’s very likely to be an intermediate non-bat host which would have picked up the virus from bats.

“So bats are definitely involved it’s just a question of whether this was directly or another animal was involved,” Robertson added.

The researchers in the new study said recombination within the viral receptor-binding protein may have allowed for cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

“New information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia,” the researchers said.

The new virus is similar to the one which caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, infecting 8422 people, and killing more than 900, they said.

However, the current study noted that unlike the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV causes a mild form of viral pneumonia, and has limited capability for person-person spread.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes.

Common symptoms of the 2019-nCoV strain include respiratory ailments such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the WHO.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4efydy/article30622541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HONGKONGOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/novel-chinese-coronavirus-may-have-jumped-to-humans-from-snakes-study/article30633526.ece
465,2020/01/23,WHO to meet again today to decide on declaring novel coronavirus a global health emergency,"The World Health Organization’s Emergency Committee has postponed making a decision on Wednesday whether the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan city in China constitutes Public Health Emergency of International Concern. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said physicians need more information and the committee will meet again on Thursday. The novel virus has already infected 440 people and killed 17. Cases imported from China have been reported from a few countries — Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S.

“The situation with new coronavirus is evolving and complex. For that reason, I have decided to ask the Emergency Committee to meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion, and the Chair, Dr Houssin, has agreed with that request,” the Director-General said during a conference call after the meeting on Wednesday.

“The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern on new coronavirus is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence,” he said.

“Today, there was an excellent discussion during the committee meeting, but it was also clear that to proceed we need more information,” he added. “We will meet again tomorrow to continue the discussion.”

Apparently, the emergency committee on Wednesday was split on whether to designate the illness a global health emergency.

Chinese authorities said many of the patients with infection caused by the novel virus had come into contact with seafood and meat markets. They have also found evidence of human-to-human transmission including health-care workers. Sixteen health-care workers have been infected as on January 21.
