0,2020/02/07,Premier Badminton League | North-Eastern Warriors in maiden final,"A stunning display by Lee Cheuk Yiu and the men’s combination of Bodin Isara and G. Krishna Prasad powered North-Eastern Warriors to its maiden final in the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Friday. North-Eastern outclassed former champion Chennai Superstarz 3-(-1) in the first semifinal.

Warriors got off to a smooth start when Lee Yong Dae and Kim Ha Na registered a thrilling 15-12, 9-15, 15-14 win over B. Sumeeth Reddy and Jessica Pugh in mixed doubles.

Exciting match

It was an entertaining contest as the scores were level at 12, 13 and 14 in the decider after the pairs had shared the first two games. Yong Dae’s forehand smash settled the issue in North-Eastern Warriors’ favour.

In men’s singles, Warriors’ World No. 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu defeated the more experienced Tommy Sugiarto, World No. 21, in a closely fought match. Lee came up with splendid drops and telling smashes, but made some weak returns too.

To the delight of the Warriors camp, Lee raised his game at crucial junctures in both games against an erratic Sugiarto, who lost his first match of the tournament.

Trailing 2-0, Superstarz had to field B. Sumeeth Reddy and Dhruv Kapila in men’s doubles in its Trump match, the latter replacing the big-hitting R. Satwik Sairaj, recovering from an ankle injury.

The experienced Isara and the young Krishna Prasad combined to pip the Chennai pair in three games. Isara’s tenacity came to the fore as he handled a series of smashes with aplomb and also played well at the net. Superstarz felt the absence of Satwik in this crucial match.

The results: North-Eastern Warriors bt Chennai Superstarz 3-(-1) (Lee Yong Dae & Kim Ha Na bt B. Sumeeth Reddy & Jessica Pugh 15-12, 9-15, 15-14; Lee Cheuk Yiu bt Tommy Sugiarto 15-12, 15-12; Bodin Isara & G. Krishna Prasad bt B. Sumeeth Reddy & Dhruv Kapila (T) 15-13, 14-15, 15-10).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lck56h/article30765541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08PBL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-north-eastern-warriors-in-maiden-final/article30765542.ece

3,2020/02/07,"Petroleum inter-unit: Sharath subdues Amalraj, takes title","Continuing his blistering form, Sharath Kamal stopped A. Amalraj in six well-fought sets to win the men’s singles crown in the Petroleum inter-unit table tennis tournament at the Thyagaraj Sports Complex here on Friday.

Sharath, representing Indian Oil, showing signs of his brilliant best in his preparation to qualify in April for the Tokyo Olympics, scripted an impressive 11-7, 8-11, 14-12, 11-5, 9-11, 11-8 triumph in a much-anticipated clash of two former National champions.

Earlier, in a one-sided women’s final, former inter-Institutional champion Pooja Sahasrabudhe defeated fellow ONGC player and former National champion Ankita Das 11-4, 11-3, 11-8, 11-7.

As though to make amends for their poor showing in the recently-concluded National championship in Hyderabad, Sharath overpowered the newly-crowned National champion Harmeet Desai 11-6, 7-11, 12-10, 10-12, 11-8, 11-5 in the semifinals and Amalraj halted National runner-up Manav Thakkar 15-13, 11-6, 11-13, 11-1, 5-11, 11-4 in the quarterfinals.

With top seed G. Sathiyan, troubled by back-pain, withdrawing from the quarterfinals, his much-awaited final clash with Sharath never came off.

Overall, Sharath’s quality of play and intensity on display made Indian Oil stop the juggernaut of ONGC in both team and singles final.

Indeed, the sharpness of his finishing strokes, on both flanks, was for everyone to notice.

Against Amalraj, Sharath started off well. He not only kept pace with his speedy rival but also produced strokes that left Amalraj and the spectators applauding the class of the nine-time National champion.

Amalraj, too, had his moments as he produced a series of powerful finishing drives, particularly from the forehand, and kept his senior opponent guessing with some stunning backhand blocks and counters.

With the players locked 1-1, the third set saw Sharath jump to a 10-7 lead. Undeterred, Amalraj drew level but could not move ahead. Eventually, Sharath converted his sixth set-point.

Amalraj, after surrendering the fourth set, led through the fifth until Sharath made it 9-9. But Amalraj kept his cool and won two quick points to force the sixth set.

In what turned out to be the final set, Sharath gave very little away and asserted his supremacy to convert his second championship-point.

The results (final):

Men: Sharath Kamal (Indian Oil) bt A. Amalraj (ONGC) 11-7, 8-11, 14-12, 11-5, 9-11, 11-8.

6,2020/02/07,Coronavirus | Indian women’s hockey tour of China cancelled,"The outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus has forced the Indian women’s hockey team to cancel its tour of China, leaving the federation with the difficult task of finding an opponent to compete with as part of its preparation for the Olympics.

The Indian women’s team was scheduled to travel to China from March 14 to 25. However, due to the fast-spreading disease, that has killed over 636 people and infected at least 31,161, it has been cancelled.

“We had to travel to China but that has been cancelled due to the virus. So a lot of teams are also not available to play with because they are participating in the Pro hockey league,” Indian skipper Rani Rampal told PTI.

“Hockey India and our coaches are working out whom to play,” she added.

All the top teams including Argentina, Belgium, Australia, Germany, China, Great Britain, Netherlands, New Zealand and United States are competing in the FIH Pro Hockey League.

With less than five months left for the Olympics, time is crucial for preparing for the quadrennial event. “For good preparation, you need to play with good teams,” Rani said.

After the tour of New Zealand that ended on Wednesday the Indian team is schedule to go through a four-week training and conditioning camp from February 16 to March 14.

With uncertainty looming over the schedule the women’s team will be left with three weeks of free time before they again head to a training and preparatory camp on April 6.

Last year, the Indian women’s team booked an Olympic berth by defeating USA at the Bhubaneswar leg of the 2019 FIH Olympic Qualifiers.

13,2020/02/07,Jiri Vesely staggers into Maharashtra Open semis,"Jiri Vesely entered the semifinal of the Tata Open Maharashtra after ending on the right side of a wild, capricious three-setter against Belarus’ Ilya Ivashka at the Balewadi Stadium here on Friday.

Following the 2-6, 6-1, 7-6(11) win, the Czech will meet the Lithuanian second seed Ricardas Berankis who battled past Japan’s Yuichi Sugita 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-2.

Vesely, once ranked as high as 35, may not have liked the manner of his victory; he was a nervous wreck for large tracts of the evening, survived a complete breakdown of his forehand, saw four match points fly by and had to save two of his own.

But the feeling at the end was one of relief as he secured his best result since Antalya 2018 that is set to pull him back into the top-100. That he ousted Alexander Zverev in the first round at Wimbledon 2019 seems an aberration during a injury blighted period in which he fell to his lowest ranking since 2013 (No.142).

“I know what I have gone through in the last 12 months,” Vesely said after the win. “The way back is really tough. I had to play Challengers and beat all those tough guys who want to enter the top-100 and play Slams.

“Today I was nervous because I had the opportunity to earn the points to be safe for Paris [Roland Garros]. Now I can relax.”

Turning the tables

During the match, however, Vesely didn’t free up until the start of the second set. After having lost the first tamely, allowing Ivashka to break him twice, the 26-year-old turned the tables in the second by breaking thrice.

For much of the third set the two looked like boxers feeling out each other before moving in for the knock-out punch. The first such opportunity fell Ivashka’s way when he earned a breakpoint in the fourth game. But Vesely snuffed it out with some clutch serving. In the seventh game it was the turn of Ivashka to serve well and negate two break opportunities.

In the tie-break that ensued, Ivashka went up 5-4 with two serves in hand. After allowing Vesely to level scores by hitting a backhand long, Ivashka sent a deep penetrative forehand to earn his first shy at the match. Vesely came up with a good body serve to wriggle out but couldn’t take any of his three subsequent chances to end the contest, two of them courtesy forehand errors.

At 10-9, Ivashka had his second matchpoint but a daring charge to the net by Vesely forced his opponent to overhit the pass. Vesely missed one more chance at 11-10 before clinching the tie on his fifth when Ivashka’s return on a second serve could only travel as far as the net.

“On match points I didn't put any first serve in,” Vesely said. “But sometimes it is just our day. I had to stay there and get every ball back. He can get nervous as well. And he got.”

The results: Second round: Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Ilya Ivashka (Blr) 2-6, 6-1, 7-6(11); Ricardas Berankis (Ltu) bt Yuichi Sugita (Jpn) 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-2.

14,2020/02/07,"Everywhere I play, it's just a rekindling, says Paes as he bids farewell to Maharashtra Open","Every event Leander Paes graces in his last year as a professional athlete is sure to mark an end to a glorious chapter. On Thursday night, he bid farewell to the Tata Open Maharashtra, India’s only ATP Tour level tournament, where he holds the record for the most number of doubles titles (6).

“Books are being closed, the library will soon shut,” Paes said. “I just said thank you [while exiting]. Those lines of a tennis court.. I've lived a lot of my life within those lines. When I looked at them, there were just flashbacks of memories, moments, matches.”

“When I left Australia it was the same. In Pune I had flashbacks of Davis Cup and other moments. Everywhere I play, it's just a rekindling.

No archives

“Through my whole career, I really haven’t read the archives or watched what one has done. Because I’m always trying to stay in the moment and look ahead.”

The taste of an on-court victory is something Paes still craves for, even at the fag end of a storied three-decade career. But a good transition into his post-retirement life is as paramount.

“There are so many things still to win,” the 46-year-old said. “I could say a Grand Slam, an Olympic medal, to get India to the Davis Cup World Group.

Second innings

“But if I can transition well from being a professional athlete into my second innings, something most athletes have trouble with… that’s one thing I’d like to win.

“It’s funny how motivated I am by this. Now that one library [will] close, there are others to open.”

It’s the same spirit that reflects in his readiness to compete for India in the upcoming Davis Cup tie against Croatia in March. Paes has been named in the preliminary six-man squad which will eventually be cut to five.

“If I’m selected, you can be rest assured I’ll be putting my best foot forward,” Paes said. “That's part of the reason why I'm playing in Bengaluru next week, and then in Dubai two weeks after that, leading into the Davis Cup camp. I think it's important to get matches.

“Here I was very ordinary on the second day [during the loss]. But, the first day I was pretty damn good. That's sport.

“Some days you play great, some days you don't. But in the end you've got to put your best in forward,” he said.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ejik32/article30764903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08PAES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/everywhere-i-play-its-just-a-rekindling-says-paes-as-he-bids-farewell-to-maharashtra-open/article30764904.ece
15,2020/02/07,Indian-led team develops software to reduce space taken by smartphone apps,"A team led by an Indian-origin scientist has developed a new ‘streaming’ software that can reduce the space taken up by apps on a smartphone by at least 85%.

The software “streams” data and code resources to an app from a cloud server when necessary, allowing the app to use only the space it needs on a phone at any given time.

“It’s like how Netflix movies aren’t actually stored on a computer. They are streamed to you as you are watching them,” said Saurabh Bagchi, a professor at Purdue University in the U.S.

“Here the application components, like heavy video or graphics or code paths, are streaming instantly despite the errors and slowdowns that are possible on a cellular network,” said Bagchi, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.

The study shows how the software, called AppStreamer, cuts down storage requirements by at least 85% for popular gaming apps on an Android.

The software, described in the journal Communications of the ACM, seamlessly shuffles data between an app and a cloud server without stalling the game, the researchers said.

Most study participants didn’t notice any differences in their gaming experience while the app used AppStreamer, they said.

Bagchi noted that since AppStreamer works for these storage-hungry gaming apps, it could work for other apps that usually take up far less space.

The software also allows the app itself to download faster to a phone, he said.

The researchers noted that AppStreamer is a type of software known as middleware, located between the apps on a device and the operating system.

AppStreamer could help phones better accommodate 5G connectivity, the researchers said.

5G is a high-speed wireless cellular network that would allow devices to download movies in seconds and handle other data-heavy tasks much faster than the 4G networks currently available to most phones, they said.

Using AppStreamer on a 5G network would mean that an app downloads instantly, runs faster and takes up minimal space on a phone, according to the researchers.

The findings will be presented on February 18 at the 17th International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks in Lyon, France.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/ow7euf/article30762233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETSOFTWARE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/indian-led-team-develops-software-to-reduce-space-taken-by-smartphone-apps/article30762234.ece

A Bench led by Justice S.K.

17,2020/02/07,Love in the time of CAA: Do your political opinions decide who you date?,"During the crackdown on social media sites like Facebook in December, student activists turned to dating apps to mobilise protests against the implementation of CAA and NRC. Going beyond activism, in these times of divisive politics in the country, a potential partner’s political affiliation has gained new importance. While markets like the US have seen this trend — especially in the wake of Donald Trump’s election in 2016 — India’s woke millennials and Gen Z have been on a similar path over the past couple of months. And dating apps are taking note.

Recently, OKCupid released three questions to understand the political sentiments of the dating millennial and if their stance on the act has impacted or can impact their dating lives. Based on the responses of over two lakh users, a majority of people are open to dating someone who has a strong inclination for the right or left wing, as long as it’s not violent. Melissa Hobley, CMO, says, “Surprisingly, women care more about their partner’s political leanings than men.” Sharing match questions like these on your profile can “help potential dates see who you are”.

That time of the year

With Valentine’s Day barely a week away, it is one of the busiest times for online dating apps. “In fact, Tinder activity reaches an all-time high between January 1 and February 13,” says Rashi Wadhera, communication lead at Tinder India. Competitiors OKCupid and Bumble’s numbers concur with this uptick. Current hot topics of conversation are climate change and pets, and for some reason, an increased popularity for astrology and star signs. A regular on several dating apps, Bengaluru-based Prashant R*, finds that the political mentions are usually subtle. “But I’ve also been seeing bios that say ‘If you’re right wing, move along’,” he says.

Meanwhile... Any seasoned web user would be wary of the ‘Hot Singles Near You’ pop up advertisement. But what if it came from a popular website like Amazon? In time for Valentine’s Day, the Internet giant has partnered with creatives and animation studio Thinko to create a spoof dating site called amazondating.co. It reimagines the shopping user interface to showcase people — complete with ratings, reviews and “product” details. The viral website has some hidden gems as well: Prime Video links to ChatRoulette; Your Last Relationship to a video of ‘Toxic’ by Britney Spears; and Don’t See What You’re Looking For takes you to Netflix.

Bumble, the Priyanka Chopra-backed dating/networking app, believes that political beliefs can have an impact on whom you want to connect with. Users can indicate their political beliefs as a badge on their profile, choosing from apolitical, moderate, liberal and conservative — or skip. “They also have the option to filter their matches based on this,” explains Priti Joshi, vice president strategy at Bumble.

However, Tinder takes a contrarian approach. “The motivation for us is to empower users to make diverse connections and break preconceived notions. That being said, people are free to share their beliefs in the bio, and if it matters to others, they will swipe right or left,” says Wadhera. Anita C* from Delhi, who uses the app during her travels across the country, agrees that it can lead to needless confrontation, which can hinder the experience of just trying to meet someone new. “Politics is hardly appropriate to talk about on a first date, let alone put on your profile. If we have differing views, but the chemistry works, perhaps we will agree to disagree,” she concludes.

18,2020/02/07,Tesla CEO Elon Musk takes a dig at WhatsApp with free phone hack emoji,"Taking a dig at WhatsApp over repeated users privacy violation amid security vulnerabilities, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter with a meme, showing various ‘mechanical arm’ emojis representing Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and WhatsApp respectively.

Musk posted the image with the caption: “New emoji! Last one comes with free phone hack.” The “last one” happened to be the WhatsApp version of the robotic arm emoji.

The meme led to several users reacting to Musk.

Multiple reports claimed this week that a WhatsApp bug would have let hackers read files on a victim’s computer.

A user wrote: “Hey Elon, can you pull some weight and get a few more rocket Emoji? This one is not cutting it.”

“Funny that everyone else is left-handed. Gotta remember that when greeting them,” said another.

Investigators believe that Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s iPhone was compromised after he received a 4.4MB video file containing malware via WhatsApp — in the same way when phones of 1,400 select journalists and human rights activists were broken into by Pegasus software from Israel-based NSO Group last year.

In an interview to the BBC, Facebook’s Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, said it wasn’t WhatsApp’s fault because end-to-end encryption is unhackable and blamed Apple’s operating system for Bezos’ episode.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/xtzzh/article30762041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETELONMUSK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-takes-a-dig-at-whatsapp-with-free-phone-hack-emoji/article30762042.ece
19,2020/02/07,Twitter adds option to disable multi-column view for iPad,"Twitter for iPad, after replacing single timeline layout with a multi-column view that works in both portrait as well as landscape mode, has now introduced a new update in which a user can turn off the multi-column view.

With the latest update, users can now hide the right-hand column altogether so that their attention is centred on the content of their timeline, MacRumers reported on Thursday.

As per the report, the option to use the new layout can be activated in the Twitter app by going to ‘Settings and privacy’ and then toggling the ‘Show search column’ switch under the ‘Display and sound’ preferences.

With this, one can use Twitter on iPad back to the same interface as on the iPhone, with a single timeline with two big unused spaces on either side of it.

Additionally, to make following conversation threads easy, Twitter rolled out a new reply layout for iOS devices. It will soon be rolled out for Android devices.

Twitter threads can sometimes be a bit confusing to follow, especially if your account is public and anybody can reply. The micro-blogging site has started rolling out a feature that could help make them easier to parse, and will also ensure that you don’t miss your friends’ responses.

The new feature update draws a concrete line between a parent tweet and replies, with the replies indented slightly and connected by the series of vertical and horizontal lines.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/lvpvze/article30761586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETTWITTERNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/twitter-adds-option-to-disable-multi-column-view-for-ipad/article30761587.ece
20,2020/02/07,"Tinder users appropriating app for political campaigning, marketing: Study","Although Tinder is a platform facilitating casual dating, some of the app’s nearly 50 million users around the world are employing it for multilevel marketing, political campaigning and promoting local gigs, a new study says.

The study, published in the journal The Information Society, found that Tinder’s off-label use — a term borrowed from pharmacology describing when people use a product for something other than what the package says — appropriates its infrastructure and sociocultural meanings.

“When people encounter a new technology, whether it’s a hammer or a computer, they use it in ways that fit their needs and lifestyle,” said study co-author Stefanie Duguay from Concordia University.

“However, once you buy a hammer, it doesn’t undergo regular updates or develop new features — apps do. They come with their own marketing, vision for use and sets of features, which they regularly update and often change in response to user activity,” Duguay explained.

In the study, Duguay assessed media articles about people using Tinder for purposes other than social, romantic or sexual encounters. She also conducted in-depth interviews with four off-label users.

One of the users was using the app to conduct an anti-smoking campaign, the study noted. Another, Duguay said, ran an anti-sex trafficking campaign on Tinder.

A third user, she said, was using the app to market health products, and the last was supporting U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders’s Democratic Party presidential nomination run in 2016.

“I also observed individual users adapting their Tinder profiles to self-promote, market local bands, participate in business networking and conduct private sales,” the researcher wrote in the study.

When Duguay compared and contrasted these different approaches to off-label use, she found that a lot of the time, Tinder’s expected function informed or complemented their campaigns.

“There would be an element of flirtatiousness or they would draw on users’ perception of Tinder as a digital context for intimate exchanges,” she said.

According to Duguay, many Tinder users who were on the app for its expected uses became upset when they discovered these profiles’ actual aims.

“That shows that off-label use can be somewhat disruptive on the platform. Though this depends on how narrowly people see that app’s purpose,” she noted.

“Platforms like this are more like an ecosystem, and when users adopt different purposes than the ones they are designed for, the platforms can change their guidelines or features in ways that greatly affect their users,” Duguay added.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/ose70r/article30759492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETTINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/tinder-users-appropriating-app-for-political-campaigning-marketing-study/article30759493.ece
21,2020/02/07,"Google Maps seeks business, transit reviews in new look as it turns 15","Alphabet Inc’s Google Maps on Thursday launched a redesign that prominently solicits users’ reviews and photos of places they visit, seeking to increase its data in a field led by local search apps such as Zomato, TripAdvisor and Yelp.

The new look, which coincides with Google Maps’ 15th birthday, introduces a ‘Contribute’ tab to a menu at the bottom of the service’s mobile app, Google said in a blog post.

The move prompted concern from TripAdvisor Inc, which along with Yelp Inc and other companies that feature user reviews on businesses have encouraged antitrust investigations into whether Google has improperly used its dominance in search to popularise its newer tools, such as restaurant comparison.

Google’s “maps redesign efforts is something antitrust enforcers should scrutinise closely,” TripAdvisor said in a statement. “We believe their continued practices should raise increased concern in the name of competition and consumer protection.”

Yelp and Zomato did not respond to requests to comment.

Google said it had responded to user feedback to make contributing easier for the hundreds of millions of people each year who submit data.

Apple Inc’s maps app, which launched seven years ago, takes a different approach by incorporating reviews and photos from services such as Yelp.

Google has invested billions of dollars from its search ads business to digitally map the world, drawing 1 billion users each month to its free navigation app.

The company has sought to turn a profit on that investment by increasing ad sales throughout Google Maps, and having users be able to rely on it for data on places and transit would expand advertising opportunities.

Among other announcements on Thursday, Google Maps said it would ask users to share more about their train and bus rides, including the temperature of cabins, accommodations for people with impaired mobility, and security and safety features.

It already uses its ability to track users’ location and survey them to determine how crowded transit is.

Some regional apps for transit and local business information contend they have better real-time data and more vetting of user content than Google. But Google’s global footprint, along with its ability to crowd-source user data, have been big advantages.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/lj8z21/article30759331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETGOOGLEMAPS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-maps-seeks-business-transit-reviews-in-new-look-as-it-turns-15/article30759333.ece

In one sign that some saw as retaliation, authorities threw into jail six oil executives with joint U.S. and Venezuelan nationality, two months after allowing them to shift to house arrest.

Elliott Abrams, the U.S. envoy leading the drive to oust leftist leader Nicolas Maduro, warned that the U.S. was “prepared” with unspecified actions if Mr. Guaido faces trouble.

“We urge those member states to share that information immediately,” he said.

“No one country or organisation can stop this outbreak alone. Our best hope and our only hope is to work together. We have a common enemy which is dangerous and which can bring serious upheaval, social, political and economic. This is the time to fight it and in unison,” he said.

Tedros also pointed out that for the past two days the number of reported cases of the virus had declined.

24,2020/02/07,Pakistan resolution for public hanging of child molesters,"Pakistan’s Parliament passed a resolution on Friday calling for the public hanging of convicted child killers and rapists, drawing a quick backlash from human rights organisations.

The non-binding resolution follows a spate of high-profile child sex-abuse cases that have provoked outrage and riots across Pakistan in recent years.

Child killers and rapists “should not only be given the death penalty by hanging, but they should be hanged publicly,” said Ali Muhammad Khan, Pakistan's Parliamentary Affairs Minister, who presented the resolution in the national assembly, or lower house.

“The Koran commands us that a murderer should be hanged,” Mr. Khan added.

Though a majority of lawmakers approved the resolution, Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari stressed it was not sponsored by the government. The resolution “on public hangings was across party lines and not a govt-sponsored resolution but an individual act. Many of us oppose it — our Ministry opposes this,” Ms. Mazari tweeted.

Child sexual abuses are rampant in Pakistan.

In October 2018, authorities hanged a child rapist in an infamous case in Kasur, near Lahore, that sparked nationwide protests. In that case, a six-year-old was raped and murdered by a 24-year-old man.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mt0wck/article30635905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-pakistan-parliament,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-resolution-for-public-hanging-of-child-molesters/article30765156.ece
25,2020/02/07,Coronavirus outbreak: Hong Kong unveils quarantine plans,"Hong Kong on Friday said it will deploy an army of volunteers to bolster plans to forcibly quarantine all arrivals from mainland China, warning that anyone caught breaching the new rules faces up to six months prison.

In a major escalation of its battle against the new coronavirus, the financial hub has said anyone arriving from the mainland from Saturday will have to undergo 14 days quarantine.

Officials hope the new measures will virtually halt all cross-border traffic while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland.

Cabinet Ministers unveiled the quarantine plans just six hours before the new policy was due to come on.

Hong Kong residents arriving from mainland China will be allowed to self-quarantine at home. Chinese and international visitors will be able to self-quarantine at hotels or any other accommodation they have arranged.

“If they cannot arrange accommodation, they will be taken to the temporary facilities prepared by the government,” health secretary Sophia Chan said.

Anyone who has been to mainland China in the past 14 days and then flies into Hong Kong from another destination will also be quarantined.

Officials – backed by volunteers from the civil service and some students – will conduct spot checks or make daily phone calls to ensure people were staying at home.

Those caught breaking their quarantine face up to six months in jail and a HK$25,000 ($3,200) fine.

26,2020/02/07,Hong Kong Airlines to slash jobs as coronavirus outbreak adds to woes,"Hong Kong Airlines said on Friday that it has been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and ask remaining staff to take unpaid leave as the coronavirus outbreak compounds problems at the already-struggling firm.

The announcement by the city's number two carrier comes days after Cathay Pacific said it had asked all its 27,000 workforce to take three weeks’ leave without salary between March and June because of collapsing demand caused by the health crisis.

The virus outbreak comes just as the city was struggling to recover from months of sometimes violent protests that battered the economy and gutted the key tourism sector.

Hong Kong Airlines said in a statement that strict entry and quarantine measures imposed by countries around the world have further impacted travel demand in the city and the firm had to take “vigorous measures” to mitigate the challenges.

The company said it will lay off 400 employees, with the remainder asked to take a minimum of two weeks no-pay leave per month or work three days a week from February 17 until the end of June.

“There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines' history as of now,” the company said in an email statement to AFP.

“As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat.”

The airline is owned by struggling Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which has been looking to lower its debt burden.

In November it announced it would delay salary payments to some staff as it struggled to find cash, triggering a warning from regulators that its licence might be at risk. While it managed to keep flying thanks to an injection of funds, it continues to struggle.

The coronavirus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spread over the Lunar New Year holiday and has now killed more than 600 people in the country, with at least 31,000 infected.

27,2020/02/07,Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa arrives in New Delhi,"Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa arrived in New Delhi on Friday evening on his first official visit abroad after being appointed to the office by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, his younger brother.

Mr. Rajapaksa is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at noon on Saturday while External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will call on the visiting leader earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement. The Sri Lankan Prime Minister, who will receive a ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, will also call on President Ram Nath Kovind, the ministry added.

Mr. Rajapaksa’s visit to New Delhi follows those of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in late November — when New Delhi announced a $450 million Line of Credit — and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena in January. From the Indian side, Mr. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval have visited Colombo after the new government took charge in November.

I will be in Delhi on a state visit, meeting my good friend PM @narendramodi, the President, the External Affairs Minister & other govt.officials. Looking forward to building new avenues of cooperation with this visit & strengthening the already existing ties between our nations. — Mahinda Rajapaksa (@PresRajapaksa) February 7, 2020

Development and debt

According to a statement from the Sri Lankan Prime Minister’s office, defence and maritime security cooperation, politics, trade, development, culture and tourism would be discussed during the visit.

Development cooperation is likely to be high on the agenda, while it remains to be seen if New Delhi might announce any new assistance. Especially since Mr. Doval, in his meeting with President Rajapaksa in Colombo last month, reportedly discussed countering “debt traps”, a term often used in the West and India while referring to large-scale Chinese loans. Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who also has the Finance, Economic and Policy Development portfolios, has the task of overseeing the repayment of Sri Lanka’s mounting external debt totalling billions of dollars.

Tamil concerns

Sri Lanka’s Tamil leadership will keenly watch if the pending political solution to Sri Lanka’s national question is discussed. Following Mr. Jaishankar’s Colombo visit in November, the MEA said New Delhi “expects” Colombo to take forward post-war reconciliation. Mr. Modi, during President Rajapaksa’s visit, expressed confidence that Sri Lanka would carry forward the process of reconciliation, “to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil for equality, justice, peace and respect.”

The Sri Lankan President has emphasised the need for development over power devolution in the war-hit areas and expressed reservations over devolving land and police powers to the provinces envisaged in the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, an outcome of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.

On the other hand, Prime Minister Rajapaksa told Tamil media heads in Colombo last month that there was “no change” in his position to implement “13 Plus”, implying he would implement the existing amendment in full and go beyond it — an assurance he had given India in the past.

Fisheries conflict

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Douglas Devananda, who is travelling with the PM, said he was going to propose that the two countries set up a joint marine resources management authority. “We should have seven members from either side, including bureaucrats, researchers, fishermen’s association representatives, and find a lasting solution to the Palk Bay fisheries conflict,” Mr. Devananda told The Hindu on Friday.

Further, the Minister said he planned to request India to build more houses in the north and east and provide assistance for deep sea fishing techniques. India has so far helped build 46,000 homes in the war-affected areas.

Minister of Community Empowerment and Estate Infrastructure Development Arumugan Thondaman and former foreign minister G.L. Peiris are also part of the PM’s delegation. Following his meetings in New Delhi, Mr. Rajapaksa will proceed to temples including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, the Maha Bodhi temple in Bodh Gaya and Tirupati before concluding his four-day visit, the MEA said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b1rt58/article30763123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RajapaksainNewDelhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-prime-minister-mahinda-rajapaksa-on-a-four-day-visit-to-india/article30762249.ece
28,2020/02/07,Japan finds 41 more cases on ship as virus alarm doctor dies,"Japan on Friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland China rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.

Following an online uproar over the government’s treatment of Dr. Li Wenliang, 34, the ruling Communist Party said it was sending an investigation team to “fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public” regarding the case.

Two docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan.

Before Friday’s 41 confirmed cases, 20 infected passengers were escorted off the Diamond Princess at Yokohama near Tokyo. About 3,700 people have been confined aboard the ship.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Thursday that Japan will deny entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship - Holland America’s cruise ship Westerdam, on its way to Okinawa from Hong Kong - because of suspected virus patients found on board. The Seattle-based operator denied anyone had virus.

Mr. Abe said the new immigration policy takes effect Friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into Japan.

The ship was currently near Ishigaki, one of Okinawa’s outer islands, and was seeking another port, said Overseas Travel Agency official Mie Matsubara. Japanese media reported there were 2,257 people aboard.

“Everyone is starting to reject the ship and we are getting desperate,” she said. “We hope we can go somewhere so that passengers can land.”

At least four other cruise ships, two foreign and two Japanese-operated, are headed to Japan by the end of the month, Transport Minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said, urging port authorities around the country to turn them away.

Dr. Li had worked at a hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. He was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others when the government did not, writing on his Twitter-like Weibo account that on Dec. 3 he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak that the government initially tried to cover-up.

Dr. Li wrote that after he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he was visited on Jan. 3 by police, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to having spread falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued.

A copy of the statement signed by Dr. Li and posted online accused him of making “false statements” and “seriously disturbing social order.”

""This is a type of illegal behavior!” the statement said.

Dr. Li wrote that he developed a cough on Jan. 10, fever on Jan. 11 and was hospitalized on Jan. 12, after which he began having trouble breathing.

""Please rest easy, I will most certainly actively cooperate with the treatment and seek to obtain an early discharge!” Dr. Li wrote on Jan. 31. He posted again on Feb. 1, saying he had been confirmed as having the virus.

On Friday, the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper and usual staunch defender of the authorities, reported that “many said the experience of the eight ‘whistleblowers’ was evidence of local authorities’ incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus.”

It quoted Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as telling the paper’s editor that “we should highly praise the eight Wuhan residents.”

“They were wise before the outbreak,” Mr. Zeng was quoted as saying. The paper also cited online voices saying local authorities owe Dr. Li an apology. It quoted one posting as saying, “We lost a hero.” “If his warning could send an alarm, the outbreak might not have continued to worsen,” the posting said.

""Looking back, his professional sense of vigilance in particular is worthy of our respect,” the paper said in an editorial.

The police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation’s highest court. “We have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors,” a posting on the court’s Weibo account said.

Within a half-hour of announcing earlier on Friday that Dr. Li was in critical condition, the hospital received nearly 500,000 comments on its social media post, many of them from people hoping Li would pull through. One wrote- “We are not going to bed. We are here waiting for a miracle.”

Meanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. The number of people infected globally has risen to more than 31,000. Precisely how the child became infected was unclear.

""The baby was immediately separated from the mother after the birth and has been under artificial feeding. There was no close contact with the parents, yet it was diagnosed with the disease,” Mr. Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children’s Hospital, told Chinese TV.

Mr. Zeng said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.

China’s state media Friday that President Xi Jinping urged the U.S. to “respond reasonably” to the virus outbreak in a phone call with President Donald Trump.

""A people’s war against the virus has been launched,” Mr. Xi was quoted as saying by broadcaster CCTV, using timeworn communist terminology. “We hope the U.S. side can assess the epidemic in a calm manner and adopt and adjust its response measures in a reasonable way.”

Beijing has complained that the U.S. was flying its citizens out of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China.

The White House said Mr. Trump “expressed confidence in China’s strength and resilience in confronting the challenge” of the outbreak.

“The Bangladesh Prime Minister thanked the EU members, including Italy, for their support to the cause of the Rohingya,” The Daily Star newspaper quoted a joint statement issued on Thursday after talks between Hasina and her Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte in Rome, as saying.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, Hasina’s Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim said both sides welcomed the January 23 decision of International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the Rohingya crisis.

Mr. Karim said that Mr. Conte appreciated Bangladesh’s management of the Rohingya crisis, adding that he encouraged Ms. Hasina to continue with the policy of hospitality.

In its January ruling, the ICJ directed Myanmar to prevent the alleged genocide against the Muslim minority community.

The court said Myanmar must “take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts” described by the convention.

Nearly 738,000 Rohingya refugees are living in camps in Bangladesh since Aug. 25, 2017, following a wave of persecution and violence in Myanmar that the UN has described as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing and possible genocide.

30,2020/02/07,"Ehsanullah Ehsan, responsible for shooting Malala in 2012, escapes from prison in Pakistan","Ehsanullah Ehsan, the former Pakistan Taliban spokesman who was responsible for the shooting of Malala Yousafzai in 2012 and carrying out the deadly Peshawar Army school terror attack in 2014, has escaped from prison, according to a audio clip released by him.

In the audio clip, which surfaced on social media on Thursday, Ehsan said that he escaped the confinement of Pakistani security agencies on January 11, claiming Pakistani forces failed to keep their promises made to him during his surrender in 2017.

“With the help of God, I succeeded to escape on January 11, 2020 from the confinement of the security forces,” he is heard saying in the clip.

It would be a big blow to Pakistan and its campaign to eradicate the remnants of Taliban if the clip is proved to be authentic.

Without revealing his current location, Ehsan said that he would make a detailed statement about the days of his confinement in the coming days as well as about his future plans.

Ms. Yousafzai, 22, the youngest Nobel Peace prize winner, was shot by a gunman for campaigning for female education in 2012 in Pakistan’s Swat Valley.

Ehsan was also involved in the one of the most gruesome attacks on children anywhere in the world when 8-10 suicide attackers wearing paramilitary Frontier Corps uniforms on December 16, 2014 entered the Peshawar’s Army Public School and went from classroom-to-classroom shooting indiscriminately, killing 149 people including 132 students.

31,2020/02/07,Five killed in Alaska commuter air crash,"Five people were killed on Thursday when a commuter aircraft crashed in rural southwestern Alaska, killing all aboard, officials said.

The plane, a Piper PA32, crashed “under unknown circumstances,” Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said in an email.

The crash happened near the Yup'ik village of Tuntutuliak, a community about 430 miles southwest of Anchorage, the Alaska State Troopers said in a statement. The plane was operated by Yute Air, a carrier based in Bethel, Alaska, the hub community in the remote region, the troopers said.

The plane, with a pilot and four passengers, was traveling from Bethel to another Yup'ik village, Kipnuk, on the Bering Sea coast. About two hours after the plane was reported overdue, a National Guard helicopter reached the crash site, and officials confirmed that all aboard the Yute Air flight had died, the troopers said.

The victims' identities were not released, and attempts were under way to notify their families, the troopers said in the statement.

The crash will be investigated by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, Kenitzer said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e09x8t/article30458480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BreakNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/five-killed-in-alaska-commuter-air-crash/article30759377.ece
32,2020/02/07,Brazil judge rejects hacking accusation against journalist Glenn Greenwald,"A judge in Brazil’s capital on Thursday dismissed accusations that journalist Glenn Greenwald was involved in hacking phones of officials, following weeks of criticism that his prosecution would infringe on constitutional protections for the press.

Prosecutors last month levelled accusations that Mr. Greenwald helped a group of six people hack into phones of hundreds of local authorities, saying his actions amounted to criminal association and illegal interception of communications.

Since last year, Mr. Greenwald’s online media outlet The Intercept Brasil has published a series of excerpts from private conversations on a messaging app involving current Justice Minister Sérgio Moro.

The attempt by prosecutors to criminalise Mr. Greenwald’s work had prompted swift backlash from national and foreign journalist associations, freedom of expression advocates and Brazil’s national bar association.

Those groups said prosecutors were abusing their power to persecute Mr. Greenwald, an attorney-turned-journalist who lives with his husband and children in Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Greenwald’s lawyers called the allegations “bizarre” and said they challenged a previous ruling in the case by the Brazilian Supreme Court protecting freedom of the press.

Thursday’s decision by the Brasilia-based judge, Ricardo Leite, invoked that earlier ruling by Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes, who barred investigations of Mr. Greenwald and The Intercept Brasil in relation to the alleged hacking.

""My feeling is that the decision of Justice Gilmar Mendes adopted a wide and extensive sense and it does include the interpretation of blocking any action of investigation by the state, both in the investigation phase and in the judicial one,” Judge Leite wrote in his decision.

While rejecting the claims regarding Mr. Greenwald, Mr. Leite accepted those against the six alleged hackers, who will now face charges as defendants.

The journalist said in a statement that he welcomes “the fact that this investigation will not move forward,” but adds that he believes “this decision is insufficient to guarantee the rights of a free press.”

""We seek a decisive rejection from the Supreme Court of this abusive prosecution on the grounds that it is a clear and grave assault on core press freedoms. Anything less would leave open the possibility of further erosion of the fundamental freedom of the press against other journalists,” Mr. Greenwald said.

The Intercept also welcomed the ruling, with reservations.

""As federal police investigators affirmed last year, he did nothing wrong,” said Betsy Reed, The Intercept’s editor-in-chief. “However, the ruling is narrow and procedural, based on the injunction issued by a Supreme Court minister last year.”

The leaked excerpts published by The Intercept Brasil purport to show that Mr. Moro, then a judge, was improperly coordinating with prosecutors he was overseeing in a vast corruption investigation.

That probe led to the imprisonment of numerous business executives and politicians on corruption charges, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Da Silva was released from jail in November because he has appeals pending.

While many Brazilians hail Mr. Moro as a hero, others believe he unfairly targeted Da Silva and other top leftist figures. Mr. Moro is now a key member of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro’s Cabinet.

In Mr. Greenwald’s case, Brazil’s federal police had previously looked at the same evidence that formed the basis for the allegations against the journalist and determined there was no wrongdoing.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ku7705/article30759068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAZILGREENWALDTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazil-judge-rejects-hacking-accusation-against-journalist-glenn-greenwald/article30759069.ece
33,2020/02/07,"New virus cases in UK, Germany, Italy put Europe total at 31","Britain, Germany and Italy have announced more cases of the new virus from China, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Europe to 31.

In Germany, all but two cases are related to auto parts supplier Webasto, whose headquarters near Munich was visited by a Chinese colleague. Germany’s 13th confirmed case of the new coronavirus, announced by Bavaria’s health ministry, was the wife of an employee previously diagnosed with virus.

Two of their children are among those infected. Neither they nor their mother are showing any symptoms.

Germany’s two other cases tested positive after arriving on an evacuation flight from China last weekend.

British authorities confirmed the country’s third case, saying the patient did not contract the virus in the UK. They did not elaborate. The two other cases are a Chinese student studying at York University in England and a relative of that student.

Italy announced the first case of an Italian citizen confirmed to have the virus. A government health institute official, Giovanni Rezza, said the 34-year-old man contracted the virus in Wuhan, where he was living. The man was one of 56 Italians who arrived in Italy on Monday via an Italian air force plane that evacuated them from Wuhan.

All the evacuees were put in quarantine at a military facility near Rome, but the man was moved to Rome’s Spallanzani infectious disease hospital after test results Thursday indicated “a suspected case” of the virus.

That is the same hospital where a Chinese couple in their 60s were admitted last week with confirmed virus cases. They are in intensive care with pneumonia.

In Geneva, the head of the World Health Organization said it is convening an international research conference next week to identify promising drug and vaccine candidates to be fast-tracked for development against the new virus.

At a news conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency will be inviting scientists from around the world, both in person and virtually, next Tuesday and Wednesday to identify research priorities and coordinate the effort to find effective drugs and vaccines.

On the travel front, Air France announced it was prolonging by more than a month its suspension of flights to mainland China, which won’t now restart before March 16 at the earliest because of the new virus.

The company’s current suspension of all flights to Shanghai and Beijing was meant to last until this Sunday. Air France and partner airline KLM plan to gradually resume services to China on March 16, together offering one daily flight to both Shanghai and Beijing, either on Air France from Paris or on KLM from Amsterdam.

Air France says all of its flights to mainland China should resume beginning on March 29, including to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic.

Spain’s national airline Iberia says it has extended its suspension of flights between Madrid and Shanghai until the end of April. Spain’s tourism department says there has been a significant slowdown in Chinese tourists visiting Spain and in Spanish travelers going to China.

Virgin Atlantic said Thursday it was suspending its London-Shanghai flights until March 28 because of the outbreak. British Airways has also halted all flights to China, apart from Hong Kong.

In London, China’s ambassador to the U.K. said his country was fully confident in beating the virus, and urged other nations not to overreact.

“It is of hope that governments of all countries, including the U.K., should understand and support China’s efforts, avoid overreaction, avoid creating panic, and ensure normal co-operation and exchanges between countries,” he told reporters.

As of Friday, China had 636 virus deaths and 31,161 confirmed cases on the mainland. Two other deaths occurred in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Besides Germany, Britain and Italy, other European nations with cases of the virus include France, Russia, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Spain.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9xnwi2/article30712415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-virus-cases-in-uk-germany-italy-put-europe-total-at-31/article30759051.ece

Mr. Trump is expected to visit India on February 24, 25. For a President who markets himself as a negotiator and closer of deals, signing a trade deal while in India is likely to be an important aspect of his trip. Nevertheless it is not a given that the deal will be completed before the visit, the source told The Hindu

Also Read Analysis | India faces a year of tough trade negotiations

U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer’s reported visit to New Delhi next week to wrap up the deal has not been finalised – a decision on whether or not he will visit has not been made, the source said.

Removing price caps on medical devices

The U.S. side is also “disappointed” about the tariffs announced in the Union Budget , particularly the import cess on medical devices, the source said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a health cess of 5% on medical devices (except those exempt from basic customs duty) to help local manufacturers and finance health infrastructure. Currently duties on medical devices are in the 0-7.5% range. A customs duty increase on a number of agricultural goods including walnuts (kernels) and some dairy products like cheese and butter was also announced.

India and the U.S. have had months of talks over restoring India’s benefits under the U.S.’s preferential trade system, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), revoked in June last year. The U.S. has also wanted India to remove price caps on medical devices, and wanted a deal on dairy products and elimination of tariffs on ICT products (not subsequently part of the latest round of trade discussions as per reports)l.

Current trade talks include a discussion on partial relief for the U.S. on medical device price caps in India, partial restoration of GSP for India, and discussions over agricultural products, as per news reports.

The last time negotiators scrambled to reach a deal was on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September last year when Prime Minister Modi and Mr. Trump had a bilateral meeting. The current trade talks are a consequence of the continuing discussions from September when a deal could not be reached.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/537gw5/article29459255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/despite-gaps-us-hopeful-of-trade-deal-with-india-ahead-of-trumps-visit/article30759020.ece
35,2020/02/07,Saudi Arabia rejects Pakistan’s plea for discussion on Kashmir at OIC,"In yet another setback to Islamabad, Saudi Arabia has once again declined Pakistan’s request for an urgent meeting of the council of Foreign Ministers on Kashmir at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).

In December, Pakistan had trumpeted that it secured a diplomatic win by prevailing on Saudi Arabia to hold a special session on Kashmir at the OIC. However, officials in New Delhi had expressed skepticism about the news, saying that the OIC did not make any official announcement or issue any confirmation of the meeting.

On Thursday, Pakistani daily Dawn reported that Prime Minister Imran Khan’s plea for a discussion on Kashmir has been rejected by Saudi Arabia. The OIC is holding its senior officials’ meeting in Jeddah on February 9 to make arrangements for the council of foreign ministers.

Mr. Khan has been campaigning around the world against India ever since the Narendra Modi-led government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.

Recently, Mr. Khan was forced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohamad Bin Salman to cancel his trip to Malaysia where he intended to slam India over Kashmir at the Islamic Summit hosted by the Mahathir Mohamad government in Malaysia.

Challenge to its leadership irks Riyadh

Riyadh took serious offence to the summit where it was not invited and perceived it as a challenge to its leadership in the Muslim world by Turkey, Malaysia and Pakistan. The Saudi Kingdom threatened to withdraw its massive aid to Pakistan, already reeling under an economic crisis.

“Islamabad’s feeling of unease with the OIC on its failure to get the CFM’s meeting appears to be growing. Prime Minister Imran Khan voiced frustration over the OIC’s silence on Kashmir while speaking at a think-tank during his visit to Malaysia,” the Dawn reported.

The newspaper quoted Mr. Khan as saying: “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We can’t even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Riyadh in October last year, the second time since 2016, and met the Crown Prince five times. The outcome of the meetings has been strategic partnership pact between the two countries, making India fourth country after France, the UK and China to earn such a significant status in Riyadh.

36,2020/02/07,"At least two Palestinians killed, 16 Israelis hurt in violence over Trump plan","At least two Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank and 16 Israelis were hurt on Thursday in a surge of violence that erupted amid Palestinian anger at a U.S. peace plan.

In Jerusalem, an Arab citizen of Israel was killed after he shot and slightly wounded an Israeli paramilitary border policeman at an entrance to the walled Old City, Israeli authorities said, calling the attack politically motivated.

The peace proposal announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 28 would give Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including the disputed holy city of Jerusalem and nearly all the occupied land on which it has built settlements.

With violence on the rise, the Israeli military said it was sending reinforcements to the West Bank, where Israeli troops in the city of Jenin shot dead a 19-year-old man during clashes. Palestinians said he had thrown rocks at soldiers who came to demolish the home of a Palestinian involved in the 2018 killing of a Jewish settler.

In a separate incident in Jenin, a Palestinian officer in the police station was killed by what Palestinian authorities said was Israeli gunfire. Israeli officials did not comment, and Israeli media reported he was shot by troops by mistake.

In a scene reminiscent of a wave of Palestinian street attacks in 2015, a car ran down Israeli soldiers on a Jerusalem sidewalk, injuring at least 14 of them, Israeli police said.

The assailant fled and was arrested later in the day, the Israeli military said, without immediately identifying the driver. Israel's YNet news website identified him as a 25-year-old Palestinian.

On a road to a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, a suspected Palestinian gunman slightly wounded an Israeli soldier before fleeing, the Israeli military said.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Israel for the deaths, linking them to what Mr. Trump has billed as the “deal of the century”.

Mr. Trump’s senior adviser Jared Kushner, the face of the U.S. plan, said Mr. Abbas bore some responsibility for the surge in violence.

“I think he does have responsibility,” Mr. Kushner said of Mr. Abbas moments after briefing United Nations Security Council ambassadors on the plan's details. “He calls for days of rage in response and he said that before he even saw the plan.”

Mr. Kushner added that he met personally Mr. Abbas four times as he was crafting the proposal, but “they chose not to meet with us again.”

The Palestinians, who have long shunned the Trump administration, accusing it of bias towards Israel, say the plan falls far short of their demands for a viable independent state and other rights.

Israel supports the Trump plan. The Arab League opposes it, while the European Union has rejected parts of it.

Visiting Israeli security forces in the West Bank after Thursday's incidents, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also accused Abbas of inciting violence.

“We will do everything necessary to protect our security, to define our borders and to ensure our future,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “We will do it with you or without you.”

On Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian elsewhere in the West Bank, saying he had thrown a firebomb at them during a violent protest against Trump's plan. He was the first fatality since the blueprint was announced.

The Israel-Gaza border has also been shaken by several days of violence.

Palestinians have launched mortar fire, rockets and balloon-borne explosives into Israel, causing panic but no serious casualties. Israel has carried out nightly air strikes against sites belonging to Gaza's ruling Hamas Islamists.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v6kdf1/article30530951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-two-palestinians-killed-16-israelis-hurt-in-violence-over-trump-plan/article30758804.ece
37,2020/02/07,U.S. operation killed al-Qaida leader in Yemen: Trump,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the U.S., at his direction, has conducted a counter-terrorism operation in Yemen that killed Qassim al-Rimi, an al-Qaida leader who claimed responsibility for last year’s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where a Saudi aviation trainee killed three American sailors.

Al-Rimi is a founder of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. The affiliate has long been considered the global network’s most dangerous branch for its attempts to carry out attacks on the U.S. mainland. Mr. Trump said the U.S. and its allies are safer as a result of his death.

""We will continue to protect the American people by tracking down and eliminating terrorists who seek to do us harm,” Mr. Trump said.

While Mr. Trump confirmed reports that al-Rimi had been killed, he did not say when the U.S. operation was conducted or offer any details about how it was carried out.

Al-Rimi had said in an 18-minute video that his group was responsible for the December 6 shooting at the base. He called the shooter, Saudi Air Force officer Mohammed Alshamrani, a “courageous knight” and a “hero.” The shooter opened fire inside a classroom at the base, killing three people and wounding two sheriff’s deputies before one of the deputies killed him. Eight others were also hurt.

The shooting focused public attention on the presence of foreign students in American military training programs and exposed shortcomings in the screening of cadets. In January, the U.S. sent home 21 Saudi military students, saying the trainees had jihadist or anti-American sentiments on social media pages or had “contact with child pornography,” including in internet chat rooms.

Mr. Trump’s announcement confirmed earlier indications that al-Rimi had been killed. In late January, a suspected U.S. drone strike destroyed a building housing al-Qaida militants in eastern Yemen. Also, on February 1, Trump retweeted several other tweets and media reports that seemed to offer confirmation that the strike had killed al-Rimi.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tldtrv/article30758789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKFILES-US-YEMEN-MILITARY-ALQAEDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-operation-killed-al-qaida-leader-in-yemen-trump/article30758790.ece

Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, was one of eight people reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading “illegal and false” information about the coronavirus.

The Wuhan hospital where Li worked said in a statement on its Weibo account that he died at 2.58 a.m. local time on Friday.

Li, who was 34, had told a group of doctors on Chinese social media and messaging platform WeChat that seven cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been confirmed linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, believed to be the source of the virus.

He posted a picture of a test result confirming a ”SARS-like” coronavirus in a patient sample, according to a screenshot of the WeChat conversations seen and verified by Reuters.

Li said on China's microblogging site Weibo on February 1 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Reuters was unable to reach Li's family for comment.

A letter to Li issued by the Wuhan police bureau on January 3 said he had “severely disrupted social order” with his WeChat messages.

He was asked to sign the letter as a promise to stop such illegal behaviour immediately, and if he refused to comply he would face criminal charges.

40,2020/02/07,Shobana returns to cinema after seven years with Malayalam movie 'Varane Avashyamunde',"Danseuse-actor Shobana needs no introduction. Her body of work is as diverse as her roles in the 230-odd films that she has acted in, predominantly in Malayalam, besides Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and English. Winner of two National Film Awards and several others, her heart, however, lies in taking the traditions of Bharatanatyam forward. Trained under exponents Chitra Visweswaran and Padma Subrahmanyam, she is an independent performer and choreographer and runs a dance school Kalarpana in Chennai.

Shobana was in town recently for a performance as part of HCL Concerts, Kala Sangam, aimed at promoting Indian classical performing arts. She took centrestage in the packed Lakshmi Sundaram Hall and enthralled the audience with her power-packed performance based on the ever-evolving mythology of Siva, Durga, Kali and the rasleelas of Krishna.

Excited about her return to the big screen after seven years — her Malayalam flick Varane Avashyamunde releases today — she chats with Metroplus before her performance:

Excerpts:

Tell us something about your Malayalam movieVarane Avashyamunde that is releasing today?

(Smiles) It is better people go and watch the movie. I am acting after a long gap and am in a mother’s role. You will see me going through the gamut of emotions of every mother in every home. The film is written and directed by Anoop Sathyan and stars Suresh Gopi, Dulquer Salmaan and Kalyani Priyadarshan. I am looking forward to its successful run.

What is the difference between Shobana the dancer and Shobana the actor?

I act in films depending on the offers. I face the camera as and when I am shooting. But dance, I rigorously practice everyday. There is no let up ever.

Do you find any dilution of classical elements in present day Bharatanatyam?

What my teacher teaches me today is what she learnt from her teacher. But as generations move, people also change. Every field has seen a change. I will not be surprised if some nuances of Bharatanatyam change too. It is bound to happen given its long history. But as long as a dancer properly follows the basics of the dance form, the set of eight or ten adavus, padams and javalis, one should not really worry.

Even dance costumes are getting more gorgeous.

With changes happening all around, we cannot avoid many things. But as long as classical arts performers adhere to the basic tenets and traditions, it is fine.

Is Arangetram necessary given the cost involved these days?

It is not an absolute necessity. But it is done as a social thing to make known to the community. One need not make it an expensive affair either, though I know these functions are now held like major celebrations followed by a feast. Students mostly want to honour their teachers. What happens these days is the students who successfully go out to perform actually earn more than their teachers.

Is guru necessary after some years of experience?

Not really, it is up to each student. No matter how many years you have been dancing, I feel a guru is always needed for motivation and inspiration. For most Bharatanatyam exponents today, Dr Padma Subrahmanyam is the manaseeka guru

Tell us about the new generation of students whom you teach.

They are a fantastic lot, eager to learn and improvise. We only have to guide them to the right direction. If the teacher is good, they learn good. Because it is not like teaching mathematics, one formula for all. Students of Bharatanatyam or any other dance form, for that matter, are artistes first. A teacher has to understand the ability and capability of his or her student, their sentiments and varying levels of sensitivity to be able to bring out the best.

Why aren’t there many male Bharatanatyam dancers/ students?

There are definitely more male performers today than before. But an entire generation has to change to bring in that kind of parity. Even if the change is slow, I am sure in some more time, female teachers will be teaching this dance form to many more male students.

Shobana ….. yesterday, today and tomorrow ….how would you describe yourself?

Yesterday, is out there in the public domain. Today, I am here. Tomorrow, God only knows.

41,2020/02/07,Comic book films at the Oscars: How 'Joker' is tipped to be a big winner,"Hollywood enters the Oscar weekend with a comic book movie heavily tipped to be the big winner. Joker has been nominated in 11 categories, and most punters expect it to win Best Film and for its leading man, Joaquin Phoenix, to win Best Actor. When you consider Joker’s performance alongside last year’s awards, where Black Panther won for costume design, production design and Best Original Score, it tells you that we’ve arrived at a breakthrough moment. Today, a big-budget, A-list comic book movie will rightfully aim not just for box office glory (Joker became the first A-rated movie to earn over a billion dollars worldwide), but widespread critical acclaim as well.

As recently as the early 2000s, this would have been dismissed as a ridiculous notion. Consider some of the best-known movies of this genre from back then. You had the truly awful Daredevil (2003), where Ben Affleck ruined a superhero — he has since ruined Batman as well. Ang Lee’s Hulk (2003) was heavy on style, but had no narrative momentum, and the usually brilliant Edward Norton sleepwalked his way through the titular role. 2005’s Catwoman, however, delivered what appeared to be a killing blow to the genre. Halle Berry’s career took a hit, just a couple of years after winning Best Actress (for Monster’s Ball) at the Oscars.

Batman breaks the rules

All of this changed with Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which started with 2005’s Batman Begins. Heath Ledger’s unforgettable performance as the Joker (in the 2008 The Dark Knight) might be the most immediately identifiable aspect of the trilogy today, but it was Batman Begins that became the more influential film in the long run.

The thing that distinguished it from its peers was the attention to detail: whether it was the art direction, the dialogue, or the little hat-tips to vintage Batman story arcs (evoking the work of legendary comic artists like David Mazzucchelli and Frank Miller). If Iron Man opened the commercial floodgates and ushered in the Marvel era of box office dominance, Batman Begins showed Hollywood that well-made comic book movies could be competitive in the awards season. Cinematographer Wally Pfister was eventually nominated for an Oscar as well. Although he didn’t win, the point was well-made (and later consolidated, of course, with Ledger’s posthumous Oscar).

(Clockwise from left) Scenes from Joker, Batman Begins and Iron Man 3

The last laugh

Fans should, however, not get too carried away with Joker’s success. After all, one of the reasons comic book films are not taken seriously by awards juries is the Disney factor — the fact that most (certainly the Marvel ones) are R-rated affairs with no gore, nothing too controversial and allegories favoured over political references. Joker, of course, is a self-conscious tonal departure from these traits. And it could be argued, therefore, that the Academy, too, sees it as the exception, not the rule.

Does this mean that Joker will prompt more comic book adaptations to adopt a darker tone, to not be afraid of losing out on adolescent audiences?

The actor was announcing the Oscars’ 2020 nominations when something foul hit the air at the Best Director category — a section whose plummeting prestige is directly disproportionate to the median age of its nominees. Rae, along with actor John Cho, introduced the contenders vying for that golden statue. But so much is different this time round. Here’s what’s missing — the good, bad and oh, so ugly — from Oscars 2020.

Women: Unsurprisingly, the ladies are absent from the Best Director boys’ club category for the second year in a row. In the long-chequered HIStory of the Academy Awards, only five women have been nominated, with a dismal single win: Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. This year’s Little Women — by Greta Gerwig, who was nominated as the director of Lady Bird way back in 2017 — gets a nod in the Best Film section, but is conspicuously absent among the directors.

Women-centric films: Even the films nominated are gendered, and like life in general, women are on the back foot. Nine films in the Best Picture category and only one is about women. Five are male-centric. The Irishman says it all in the title; Joker is about an unstable man; Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is about a man and his friend, also a man; The Two Popes, about two men; 1917 is about several men fighting a war; and Ford v Ferrari takes on cars, racing and well, male bonding.

Diversity: Four years after its inception, former American lawyer April Reign’s hashtag #OscarsSoWhite looms large this year. Excepting, of course, a resounding two nominees: Bong Joon-ho and Cynthia Erivo (Harriet). It is a shame because the awards were doing so well, especially after 2017’s La La Land, oops, Moonlight’s Best Picture win; and Viola Davis’ Best Supporting Actress nod. Last year, too, Green Book took home Best Picture, along with Alfonso Cuarón’s Best Director for Roma, and acting awards to both Mahershala Ali and Regina King.

Meryl Streep: It has also been two years since we’ve seen Streep grace the nominations list. Could she be slowing down after 21 nominations? Who are we kidding; she’s going to live forever.

Worthy contenders: It is unfortunate that the Oscars snubbed some of the best titles and performances of the year: Lulu Wang’s The Farewell starring Awkwafina, Hustlers with Jennifer Lopez, Ad Astra, Us, Uncut Gems, Dolemite Is My Name, Frozen 2. The list is painfully long.

Host: There’s no host once again. So, less chances of bad comedy, like when Jimmy Kimmel said, “The only happy ending of all the nominees was the one in the middle of Moonlight.” Or Seth MacFarlane’s description of Django Unchained as a film about “a man fighting to get back his woman, who’s been subjected to unthinkable violence. Or as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie.” Cringe.

Meat: Another welcome move is the absence of meat. In a bid to continue being sustainable, the Academy Awards will serve an entirely plant-based menu. The move was encouraged by vegan actor Joaquin Phoenix, who called attention to animal cruelty in his win as Best Actor at both the Critics’ Choice Awards (CCA) and the Golden Globes.

Short speeches: Gone are the days when winners would pull an Alfred Hitchcock 20-second acceptance speech. Now we have political risers like Frances McDormand’s ‘Inclusion Rider’. Hopefully, Brad Pitt with his cheeky Tinder jokes and Quentin Tarantino jibes, will make hearts swoon again.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/7mq3tc/article30760283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dolemite-Is-My-Name,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/whats-missing-at-the-oscars-2020-a-host-diversity-women-centric-films-and-more/article30760286.ece
43,2020/02/07,A ‘shaircut’ during cancer awareness month,"To mark the World Cancer Day on February 4, the Green Trends Unisex Hair & Style salon chose temple town to launch its countrywide hair donation drive, ‘shaircut’. There are six franchise outlets in Madurai and the campaign was kicked off with one of the staffers donating her hair. The team now eagerly awaits customers who would wish to donate their hair for needy cancer patients. Store manager Kamali K. in Anna Nagar branch was able to convince two customers, who came for a regular haircut, to make the small gesture. “We have informed our clients about the campaign through WhatsApp messages and on social media and we hope to receive more informed customers over the next four weeks,” she says.

The campaign will run till March 4. Share your hair is first-of-its-kind month long campaign to build awareness on cancer from the house of CavinKare that runs 375 plus salons across the country. “It was heartwarming to get the hair from two of our clients as a beginning,” says Kamali. On an average four to six women walk in for haircut daily at this branch, which is the oldest and the biggest in the city,” she says.

“We also intend to talk to our regular walk-ins about the campaign in case they are not aware,” says G. Deepak, Store Manager in TVS Nagar Green Trends salon. Other centres in KK Nagar, Thiru Nagar, Bypass Road and Chinna Chokkikulam, where three haircuts are done on an average daily, is yet to get a donor. But the staff is confident that the movement will pick up as the word spreads. At the end of drive, all the hair will be collected and sent to the head office in Chennai for processing and making wigs. The Salon division’s business head, K. Gopalakrishnan says, the idea behind the campaign is to ensure cancer patients do not fight their battle alone. “It is our way of making things little better for them because there are many needy patients who cannot afford wigs made with human hair. We will give it to them free,” he says.

“To donate hair is an easy and gratifying way to make a difference in the lives of those who are emotionally affected by cancer,” says Deepak Praveen, the COO of the group. Wigs made of synthetic hair can be unpleasant to wear for long and can cause irritation and boils on scalp, but those made with human hair are comfortable to wear. ”The ‘shaircut’ developed by our team will ensure that the donor’s hairstyle and looks do not get affected and any woman can donate as less or as much as she wants without shying away from a good cause,” he adds.

Each donor will receive a pink clip-on hair extension, that represents the symbol of hair donation and hope, and a certificate of appreciation. Those who wish to donate can call 18004 202020 to locate the nearest Green Trends salon or visit mygreentrends.in",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/2hfhmg/article30761482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/green-trends---Shair-donation-drive,https://www.thehindu.com/society/if-your-hair-is-more-than-10-inches-long-here-is-an-opportunity-to-donate-for-cancer-patients/article30761483.ece
44,2020/02/07,Queerythm’s Pride Walk 2020 in Kerala capital to showcase talents from the LGBTIQ community,"‘Love makes a family’ goes their slogan. Taking inspiration from their motto, city-based Queerythm’s third edition of its Pride Walk today aims to “grow beyond the individual and to the heart of the family” even as, perceptibly, there’s been a greater awareness about the “lives and loves” of the LGBTIQ community in the society.

With a plethora of cultural events lined up, the annual jamboree by transpersons, spearheaded by Queerythm that works towards the welfare of the LGBTIQ community, promises to paint the town in rainbow hues.

“Post the historic Article 377 verdict, more people have been coming out. However, we still have a long way to go with regard to family acceptance for many, one reason why this year’s Pride Walk 2020 is more inclusive, with families too invited to be a part to bring about a larger change,” says Prijith P K, president of Queerythm.

With banners and placards in support of the community, the Walk commences from Ayyankali Hall (formerly VJT Hall), all the way to the day’s cultural stage at Manaveeyam Veedhi. The march features flash mobs and short dance performances highlighting “queer love.”

This year’s celebrations focus on the catchphrase “Adding more colours to life”, and Prijith points out that the cultural programmes have been drawn in line with this theme to “cover the broad spectrum.”

Perhaps, the centrepiece will be a solo theatre performance in Tamil, Vellai Mozhi, by Bengaluru-based writer and transgender activist A Revathi, encapsulating “her journey of struggle towards success.” The production features a poem by transgender activist Kalki Subramanian and is directed by Tamil theatreperson A Mangai. ‘Neev on Heels’ sets the ramp on fire with a fashion show. “The specially choreographed ramp walk aims at exhibiting the diversity of gender,” says Prijith.

Other programmes include a DJ session by DJ Mr. Pete and solo dance and music performances.

Jithin Lal, choreographer of the fashion show, says the costume design has been conceptualised in accordance with “rainbow” colour theme. “The ramp walk features 13 models, all members from the community, who will be accoutred in various outfits such as colour-coded gowns, tops, shirts and trousers to signify their respective sexual and gender identity,” adds Jithin, a fashion design student in the city.

Prijith says the cultural programmes are also meant as a platform to bring more members of the community to the fore and “showcase the talents of queer individuals who otherwise lack a venue.” The day will serve as a launchpad for a support group for parents who have shown acceptance towards their wards coming out. “The idea is to help these parents motivate others as well for a more progressive approach collectively,” adds Prijith.

Baby Latha, mother of a young transperson from the city who has come out, will be speaking about her life as the parent of a queer individual and the change in her mindset. “There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about transpeople. Often, it’s a source of apprehension for the person itself when self-perceptions about their true gender identity start emerging. When my son, who’s 17 now, was coming out three years ago, none of us had the knowledge or world-view to truly understand what was happening. But with the help of professionals, we came to terms with his gender orientation and choices. The support group we form aims at sensitising other parents as well who may otherwise inadvertently harm their wards either due to ignorance or reluctance,” says Baby.

A subsidiary unit of Queerythm, which was launched in 2017, will be putting up stalls for the sale of its ecofriendly products such as cloth bags, badges with quotes in support of the community, caps and so on. Also on display at the venue will be cloth-based installations done by members of Queerythm. “As in the previous edition, the Walk will be conducted in line with the green protocol and all the materials to be used during the event will be eco-friendly,” adds Prijith.

Queerythm’s Pride Walk 2020 begins from Ayyankali Hall at 4 pm. Cultural programmes will be held at Manaveeyam Veedhi thereafter.

47,2020/02/07,Steep hike in deposit insurance triggered by PMC,"The trauma and hardships faced by thousands of depositors of the scam-hit Mumbai-based Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank had led to the fivefold increase in deposit insurance for bank account holders announced in the recent Budget.

Speaking at a press conference here, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman said, “I do remember the last time I came to Mumbai was at the peak of the Punjab Maharashtra Co-op Bank problem. It was heart-wrenching. We did go back and spend a lot of time making sure that we do the needful.”

“And it was announced in the Budget that we have increased the deposit insurance from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh. Now, I am in Mumbai, this is one point I wanted to say,” she said, answering a question from The Hindu.

The Finance Minister was in Mumbai on Friday to meet industrialists, economists, academicians, CAs and tax planners to have their feedback on the Budget.

On the feedback she had received from several meetings, the Minister said the expanse that the Budget had covered was something which most people had liked. “It is very inspiring for me and for the entire team to do more dedicated, intense work. I am not getting carried away by this [the good response]. You can cross check,” the FM said.

She said the attention given in the Budget to rural India, agriculture and specifically the 16 action points, and the steps to deepen the bond market has been received very well.

“We have taken steps to make sure that Indices look at India so that we can get indexed for the bonds that we want to create. We have also taken steps to give life back to MSMEs and to handle their NPA problem,” she said.

She said it was heartening that the Reserve Bank of India had come clear on being supportive of the MSMEs which was the need of the hour. “I am glad that the RBI is being dynamic enough to support this. They have given a very very exhaustive thinking about this and responded in a timely fashion.”

The ways in which income tax has been given an alternative has also been appreciated, she added.

On the IPO for LIC, she said, “The IPO will bring retail investors into the picture and in a way, will bring transparency [in the organisation].

The intent of the current government is to move towards simplification of the tax regime, she added.

“We are coming up with steps to simplify the tax regime. We have shown our intent to move towards a simplified tax regime and corporate tax simplification and reduction is a move towards that. The taxpayer charter [as announced in the Budget] is based on trust that should be there between the taxation regime and taxpayers,” she said.

When asked about exemptions, she said, “The Indian investor is capable of deciding where to put money without being directed by anyone, and that is the principle through which we have decided the matters. Eventually, we want to have an income tax framework with low tax rates and easy compliance.”

48,2020/02/07,Going smart will offer productivity gains worth $167 bn for automakers: Capgemini,"The auto industry is expected to make 44% of its factories smart in next five years and three out of 10 automotive factories have already been made smart in the past 1.5 to 2 years, says a Capgemini report.

The sector is set to increase investment by over 60% in the next three years, which could result in productivity gains of up to $167 billion, as per the study.

Mercedes-Benz Cars has achieved a fourfold reduction in rejection rate on some key components through its use of advanced data analytics to create self-learning and self-optimising production systems.

“Automotive industry is set to accelerate smart factories investment. For instance, Bosch invested €31 million in an Indian plant that features the latest industry 4.0 solution,'' observes the study.

Interestingly, Indian executives, after Germany and the U.S., were surveyed the most with the main objective of analysing their progress in the last two years.

Seshu Bhagavatula, president, new technologies and business initiatives at Ashok Leyland who participated in the study, said that he opted for smart factory initiatives to improve the productivity of old factories, deal with the quality issues that were difficult for human beings to detect and to incorporate made-to-order or mass-customisation capabilities.

The study found that some 80% of automotive manufacturers believed 5G would be key to their digital transformation over the next five years. Cloud computing, advanced automation were considered as key enablers of digital transformation for auto manufacturers. Other technologies used in the factory included virtual assembly technology, autonomous ground vehicle, driverless floor conveyor, remote maintenance portal, metal 3D printing centre, collaborative robots, drones etc.

Across various industry verticals, as per the study, automotive industry leads the pack with regard to converting 44% of its factories into smart facilities, followed by 42% in discrete manufacturing, 41% in process industries, 40% in power, energy and utilities, and 37% in consumer products.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/going-smart-will-offer-productivity-gains-worth-167-bn-for-automakers-capgemini/article30763621.ece
49,2020/02/07,Coronavirus to have larger impact on global economy than SARS: IHS Markit,"The outbreak of coronavirus will have a larger negative effect on the global economy than the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2003, as any slowdown in Chinese economy would send not ripples but waves across the globe, IHS Markit said on Friday.

The virus has brought large parts of the world’s second largest economy to a standstill and its impact was felt across industries.

“Coronavirus will have a larger negative effect on the global economy than the SARS outbreak in 2003. At the time of SARS, China was the sixth largest economy, accounting for only 4.2% of world GDP,” IHS said in a commentary on coronavirus outbreak.

“China is now the world’s second largest economy, accounting for 16.3% of world GDP. Therefore, any slowdown in the Chinese economy sends not ripples but waves across the globe.”

If the current and unprecedented confinement measures in China stay in place until the end of February, and are lifted progressively beginning in March, the resulting economic impact will be concentrated in the first half of 2020, with a reduction of global real GDP of 0.8% in Q1 and 0.5% in Q2, it said.

In this scenario, the coronavirus and resulting measures will reduce global real GDP by 0.4 per cent in 2020.

Scenario two

On the other hand, if confinement measures begin to lift on February 10, the impact on global GDP will be more limited, resulting in a 0.1% reduction in global GDP growth in 2020 and 0.4% reduction in China’s annual growth.

“The effects of coronavirus are most pronounced in household consumption and somewhat mitigated in the industrial sector because factories are seasonally idle during this period. Nevertheless, in many ways China’s economy is more vulnerable today than it was in 2003, with productivity and overall economic growth already slowing and the effects of the US-China trade conflict,” it said.

In 2002, China contributed 23% of world GDP growth, in 2019 China contributed an estimated 38% of world growth, IHS said.

If the situation lingers into mid-March, and plants in adjacent provinces are also idled, the China-wide supply chain disruption caused by parts shortages from Hubei, a major component hub, could have a wide-reaching impact.

Scenario three

In this scenario IHS Markit predicted potential lost production of more than 1.7 million units for the first quarter, or about 32.3 per cent decline from its pre-crisis expectations.

In 2019, China’s oil demand was 13.9 million barrels per day or 14 per cent of world market as compared to 5.6 million bpd in 2003 which equated to 7 per cent of world demand.

“China accounted for half of world oil demand growth in 2019. In 2003 China accounted for one third of world oil demand growth,” IHS said.

51,2020/02/07,Jaguar Land Rover to cut output at two UK factories,"Jaguar Land Rover will reduce or stop production on certain days at two of its British factories over the next few weeks as Britain's biggest carmaker pursues cost-cutting measures in response to falling demand.

JLR posted a 2.3% drop in retail sales in the three months to the end of December and has targeted billions of pounds worth of savings to tackle falling diesel demand in Europe and a tough sales environment in China.

The firm will halt production on selected days over a four-week period from late February at its Castle Bromwich factory in central England and stop production on some half or full days at its nearby Solihull facility until the end of March.

“The external environment remains challenging for our industry and the company is taking decisive actions to achieve the necessary operational efficiencies to safeguard long-term success,” the company said in a statement.

52,2020/02/07,French industrial output plunges in December as strikes weigh,"French industrial production fell much more sharply than expected in December as factories contended with nationwide transport strikes and a broader European slowdown, official data showed on Friday.

The INSEE stats agency said industrial output plunged 2.8% in December from November when production was flat, marking the biggest drop in nearly two years.

Also Read Euro falls to four-month low on weak German data

The result missed economists average forecast for a decrease of only 0.3% with none of the 26 economists polled by Reuters expecting anything worse than a -2.5% drop.

Manufacturers were forced to slow production in December as supply lines were hit by industrial action against President Emmanuel Macron's overhaul of pensions.

Economists have blamed the slowdown in large part for a surprise decrease in overall economic growth in the fourth quarter when it fell 0.1% from the previous three months.

More than domestic problems

However, weak industrial output in other European countries suggest there was more behind the French slowdown than just domestic problems. Germany reported a 3.5% plunge on Friday in its industrial output.

Offering some solace, the French customs office said that the trade deficit narrowed in December to 4.1 billion euros from 5.4 billion in November as imports fell faster than exports.

Although the economy slowed in the final quarter, data published separately by INSEE suggested on Friday that the labour market continued to improve.

53,2020/02/07,Euro falls to four-month low on weak German data,"The euro fell to its lowest since October on Friday after German industrial output for December recorded its biggest decline in a decade and strong employment numbers in the United States encouraged investors to buy the dollar.

MUFG analyst Derek Halpenny said weak data in Germany undermined European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's comments on Thursday that the euro zone economy was stabilising.

“The hard data sits inconsistently with most sentiment data pointing to some improvement. But the political line that `recovery is coming' is losing credibility fast,” Halpenny said.

“The October 2019 low of $1.0879 is now a credible near-term target given the scale of weakness in the German data, especially if the much-anticipated improvement in the coronavirus outlook fails to materialise.”

Dollar rises

The dollar has gained in recent sessions from solid data and because of fragile risk sentiment, as investors gauge the economic ramifications from the coronavirus outbreak in China, where the death toll continues to climb.

The focus for Friday is non-farm payrolls data, which are expected to confirm that the U.S. labour market is in robust health.

The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of rivals, edged 0.1% higher to 98.557, near its strongest since mid-October.

Sterling traded near a six-week low against the dollar and fell against the euro. It was headed for its worst week since the aftermath of the December general election, dogged by persistent worries about negotiations between Britain and the European Union for a post-Brexit trade deal.

The pound was last down at $1.2923. It staged a small recovery against the euro, rising 0.1% to 84.86 pence .

Yuan and Australian dollar

Elsewhere, the offshore yuan slipped 0.2% to 6.99 yuan per dollar but remained below the 7 level it crossed earlier this week. The offshore yuan was headed for a small gain this week, supported by central bank stimulus and China's announcement on Thursday of tariff cuts on U.S. imports.

The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for China, weakened 0.5% to $0.6699 after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed growth forecasts in its quarterly economic outlook, blaming bushfires and the coronavirus.

The U.S. dollar traded at 109.9 yen on Friday, just below a two-week high reached earlier.

54,2020/02/07,"Uber loses $1.1 billion investing in food delivery, driverless cars","Uber continued to lose money as it builds up its food delivery business and develops technology for driverless cars, but revenue for its rides business nearly tripled as the company picked up more passengers around the world.

The ride-hailing giant lost $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, about 24% more than the same time previous year. The loss amounted to 64 cents per share, which was slightly better than what analysts were expecting. Analysts polled by FactSet predicted Uber would lose $1.18 billion, or 67 cents per share, during the quarter.

Uber brought in $4.1 billion in revenue, up 37% from a year ago. Its revenue grew around the world, although the biggest gain was in the U.S. and Canada, where Uber pulled in 41% more than last year.

But its Eats business lost $461 million in the quarter before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down 66% from the same time last year as Uber put money into growing the business in a highly competitive food delivery market.

“2019 was a transformational year for Uber and I’m gratified by our progress, steadily delivering against the commitments we’ve made to our shareholders on our path to profitability, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, in a statement.

In Uber’s last earnings call, Khosrowshahi said the company’s goal was to turn a full-year profit in 2021.

The fourth quarter was marked by painful disclosures at Uber.

In December, the company released a long-awaited report, in which its riders reported more than 3,000 sexual assaults during 2018.

The same month, Uber agreed to pay $4.4 million to end a federal sexual harassment probe about its internal corporate culture. But those announcements did not take a toll on the stock, which has been inching up over the past two months.

Uber’s stock cratered after its IPO, falling 42% to a low of $25.99 in November. But it recovered some ground over the last month, reaching $37 on Thursday, about 18% below its IPO price.

Its losses in the fourth quarter included $243 million in stock-based compensation.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/je85ef/article30644226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THUBER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uber-loses-11-billion-investing-in-food-delivery-driverless-cars/article30759192.ece
55,2020/02/07,UK High Court to set terms in Chinese banks’ claim against Anil Ambani,"The High Court of England and Wales here on Friday will set the terms for the “conditional order” of a payment into court it had granted to three Chinese banks last year against Reliance Communications boss Anil Ambani.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd Mumbai Branch, on behalf of itself, China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China, had sought summary judgment against Ambani over an alleged breach of a personal guarantee on a debt refinancing loan of around USD 925 million in February 2012.

Ambani denies providing authority for any such guarantee, resulting in the High Court action in the UK — the jurisdiction agreed to as part of the terms of the loan agreement.

At the last hearing in the case in December last year, Justice David Waksman said he was “very nearly prepared” to grant judgment against Ambani because he found the Reliance Communications (RCom) chief’s evidence “inexplicably incomplete, implausible and highly unlikely”.

“I think it is highly probable that at trial his defence will be shown to be opportunistic and false I consider that this is a plain case for the making of a conditional order,” Justice Waksman said, as he granted a conditional order in principle to the Chinese banks.

The order means the Commercial Division of the High Court will hear arguments this week on Ambani’s financial means and set an appropriate amount as an effective court deposit, pending a full trial in the case.

The focus of Ambani’s evidence at the hearing last year revolved around a Power of Attorney (POA), which he claims he was unaware was being required as security by the banks.

There are references to a non-binding “comfort letter” and RCom executives, including Hasit Shukla, who allegedly kept him in the dark over the true nature of any personal guarantee.

“The essential thrust of Ambani’s evidence is not merely that he was unaware that the POA was in respect of a guarantee, he was never aware at any stage that this was being required as security by the bank. He had no inkling of it at all,” notes the judgment dated December 16, 2019.

“A truly remarkable feature of Ambani’s case is that he has himself proffered no explanation as to why he should have been deceived in this way, nor has he provided any evidence as to what he did when he discovered, in early 2017, the existence of the guarantee signed by Shukla,” the judge noted.

According to court documents, RCom had sought the loan from the Chinese banks in order to meet its obligations under certain foreign currency convertible bonds due to mature on March 1, 2012. It went on to default on the payments agreed under the loan arrangement and between February and November 2017, the banks made various demands for payment.

On May 24, 2019, the banks eventually issued an application for summary judgment, alternatively for a conditional order requiring Ambani to pay into court all or some of the sum claimed “on the basis that on any view his defence is improbable”.

Following the hearing on Friday, the judge may give his verdict on the amount to be paid into the court or reserve judgment to be handed down at a later date.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wd2zjl/article30759148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKANILAMBANIRELIANCEGROUP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uk-high-court-to-set-terms-in-chinese-banks-claim-against-anil-ambani/article30759149.ece
56,2020/02/07,Tourists shun South-East Asia as novel coronavirus spreads,"The novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak and its rapid spread to different countries has resulted in a close to 50% fall in travel demand to South-East Asia from India as well as in-bound visitors Kerala, according to travel aggregators and operators.

Countries like Japan, Malaysia and Singapore have recorded as much as 50% fall in demand from tourists in February this year as compared to the same period last year, according to travel portal ixigo.

“While Thailand and Vietnam bookings have not been impacted, our search queries reveal that travellers who have made advance flight bookings for travel to Thailand in the next two months are holding off on confirming their hotel bookings due to the virus scare,” said Aloke Bajpai, co-founder, ixigo

In-bound tourism has also taken a hit as India has cancelled visas of all Chinese nationals as well as other foreigners planning a trip from China. resulting in many cancellations. Kerala, which has seen three confirmed cases of nCoV infection, has borne the brunt.

In Chennai, Several planned trips to Mamallapuram by Chinese groups have now been cancelled, said Pawan Gupta, Managing Director, P K Holidays. The seaside heritage and resort destination had become a popular destination among Chinese nationals visiting India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping held a summit there last year.

There also seems to be a cascading effect on destinations in the Far East after Chinese carrier China Southern cancelled many flights.

“Passengers booked on China Southern, which offers cheaper fares for New Zealand, Australia, U.S., have also been affected due to the cancellation of flights. This has caused discomfort to travellers as they now have to rebook on a different flight at a much higher price point,” said Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Chennai-based travel technology startup, Pickyourtrail.

Other say that passengers seem to be shifting to alternate international destinations.

“Travelers are prefering to visit Norway, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Brazil and Finland. Domestically, Shimla, Nainital, Guwahati, and Andaman are in demand,” says Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO Corporate Travel and Head Industry Relations, Yatra.com

In Karnataka, the huge demand for travel to Cambodia and Vietnam has been been hit, according to Sanjar Imam, founder director, Panache World and president, Karnataka Tourism Forum.

57,2020/02/07,"Include gender bias in scope of law to curb sexual harassment, says Congress member Rajeev Gowda","There is an urgent need to widen the scope of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act to include gender bias, Congress member Rajeev Gowda said in the Rajya Sabha on Friday. His point is that the Act does not cover the other kinds of harassments, including denial of promotions and exclusion from important tasks.

The recent Economic Survey pointed out that the female labour force’s participation had dropped from 33% in 2011-12 to 25.3% in 2017-18 in a sign of an acute problem.

The 2013 Act provides a mechanism for protection against sexual harassment in the workplace and for redress of complaints of sexual harassment in private institutions and government organisations. But there is no legislation that explicitly prevents or redresses gender bias, harassment and discrimination.

Mr. Gowda said gender bias refers to discriminatory acts against women that may not be of a sexual nature. “It can take the form of humiliation, it can take the form of exclusion from important tasks, it can take the form of removal of responsibilities and withholding of resources. There are numerous ways in which women are harassed at the workplace, and their promotion is prevented,” he said.

Citing the instances from multinational corporations, he said the cases were heard and passed on to foreign committees, and there is no system within the country to help women handle the challenges. “There are often the other problems, there are false accusations, there are whisper campaigns, subtle rumours passed on to other companies: ‘This is a troublesome person and do not hire her’.”

He suggested that the Ministry of Women and Child Development include a new provision in the Act to prevent of harassment and discrimination stemming from gender bias. He said the jurisdiction of internal complaints committees should be widened. They should have an NGO member and half of their total members should be women, and in the case of multinational companies, they should include members from the Indian branches. He also demanded that the companies publish the number of complaints of gender bias in their annual reports and increase the awareness of the Act among their employees.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gfq5r7/article30765010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rajeev-Gowda-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/include-gender-bias-in-scope-of-law-to-curb-sexual-harassment-says-congress-member-rajeev-gowda/article30765037.ece
58,2020/02/07,Chinese national on Delhi-Pune flight isolated after falling sick,"A Chinese national who vomited while flying from Delhi to Pune in an Air India flight is among the five people placed under isolation in Maharashtra on Friday due to suspected exposure to the novel Coronavirus (nCoV). While the Chinese national and two others have been admitted to Naidu Hospital, Pune, one patient has been admitted to District Hospital in Ahmednagar and another one in District Hospital, Jalgaon.

According to State’s epidemiologist Dr. Pradeep Awate, the Chinese national has no other symptoms like fever, sore throat or cold. “Samples of all the patients have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and their reports are awaited,” said Dr .Awate.

Air India spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said the “unwell” passenger was de-boarded and admitted to hospital in Pune. The aircraft which was scheduled to return to Delhi, was delayed by over four hours after passengers and the flight crew raised concern due to the nCoV scare. The flight was sanitised thoroughly.

Dr. Ramchandra Hankare, who heads the Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department, said the Chinese national had landed in India from Bangkok late last month

“He displayed symptoms like cold and cough. We have sent his throat swab samples to the NIV and are awaiting the report,” he said.

According to Dr. Hankare, prior to boarding the flight for Pune, the patient arrived in India on January 29, following which he made a number of trips to the cities in the East including Kolkata and Bhubaneshwar before reaching New Delhi on January 5.

DON’T DISCRIMINATE

State health officials on Friday said they have come across a few cases of discrimination against those who have a travel history to China and some other regions.

“We have come across a few cases wherein employees who have a travel history were not allowed to join back work unless they get a medical report. Some people have been inquiring at various hospitals and the NIV, Pune urging authorities to test their samples so that they can take the report to their employers,” said Dr Awate. People with travel history to affected regions are advised to be at home for 14 days.

The State officials follow up with all travellers from Maharashtra up to the 14-day period. “Employers should therefore not make unreasonable demands,” said Dr Awate. He said that the State helpline has received a few calls from employers inquiring about medical records of the employees. “We had encountered a similar situation during the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala,” he said.

59,2020/02/07,Furore in Lok Sabha over Health Minister Harsh Vardan’s remarks on Rahul Gandhi,"The Lok Sabha on Friday witnessed multiple disruptions as Opposition and Treasury members nearly came to blows after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan used the Question Hour to criticise former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi’s remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made at an election rally earlier.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held separate meetings with Congress leaders and Union Ministers Pralhad Joshi and Harsh Vardhan following the commotion but it failed to break the deadlock as Congress insisted on an apology from the Minister.

Blame game

As the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day at 2 p.m., Congress and BJP leaders engaged in a blame game.

While Mr. Gandhi maintained that the Health Minister was instructed by “someone else” to prevent him from speaking in Parliament, Dr. Vardhan said Congress members wanted to “attack him and snatch his papers”.

The fracas started at 11.50 a.m. when Mr. Gandhi mentioned a starred question regarding a medical college in his constituency, Wayanad, during the Question Hour.

“Sir, please excuse me. Before I begin answering this question of dear Shri Rahul Gandhi ji, I want to condemn in no uncertain words the outlandish language that he has used against the Prime Minister of the country,” Dr. Vardhan said.

Though Speaker Om Birla asked the Minister to stick to the subject, Dr. Vardhan continued and condemned the ‘outlandish’ statement made by the former Congress chief.

“In a recent speech, he (Gandhi) used words like 6 mahina baad, iss desh ka yuva, Narendra Modi ko dande maar maar ke desh se bahar karenge (after six months, youth of the country would beat Modi with sticks and throw him out),” the Minister quoted the Congress leader’s speech that Mr. Modi had also referred to on Thursday. The Congress MPs then trooped into the Well of the House. Manickam Tagore from Tamil Nadu moved towards the Minister aggressively at which BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh held him by the arm. Mr. Singh is incidentally the president of the Wrestling Federation of India. Congress MP from Kerala Hibi Eden also tried to intervene.

Irani intervenes

Several MPs from both sides, including Union Minister Smriti Irani, prevented them from coming to blows. “Guys, what are you doing? What is going on?” Ms. Irani was heard saying.

Later, Mr. Tagore wrote a letter to the Speaker in which he accused Mr. Singh of manhandling and “threatening to kill” him.

“It is highly uncalled for. If anything is wrongly spoken then it is up to the Speaker to take a call but trying to attack the Minister is condemnable,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mr. Joshi told the Lok Sabha when it reassembled at 2 p.m.

“In a completely unparliamentary manner, the Health Minister raised something that I said outside which he has no business doing during Question Hour….Perhaps, he was instructed by someone else to raise another issue,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after meeting the Speaker along with Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.

Asked to comment on Mr. Modi calling him a tube light, he said, “Our Prime Minister does not have those rules, he does not behave in a Prime Ministerial way and there is not much I can say.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/skjkym/article30765057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tagore-Harshjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/furore-in-lok-sabha-over-health-minister-harsh-vardans-remarks-on-rahul-gandhi/article30764945.ece
60,2020/02/07,Opposition stalls BJP MP’s Bill on uniform civil code in Rajya Sabha,"The Opposition on Friday managed to stall BJP member Kirodi Lal Meena’s private member’s Bill, “The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill, 2020,” in the Rajya Sabha.

At least three members including MDMK’s Vaiko, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva and CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem sent letters to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu objecting to introduction of the Bill saying that it will fan communal passions in the backdrop of ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

In the post-lunch session, when his name was called out by Deputy Chairman Harivansh to move the Bill, Mr. Meena was absent. The opposition benches loudly protested against the introduction of the Bill.

To become a law, a private member’s Bill needs to be endorsed by the government and cleared in both Houses of Parliament. In parliamentary history, there are very few instances of a private member’s Bill being turned into law.

Second Bill

Mr. Meena reappeared in the House minutes later to move his second private member’s Bill to provide for special financial assistance to Rajasthan for the purpose of welfare of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes for development.

Mr. Meena’s Bill sought to impose a uniform civil code that would subsume all personal laws. “Under the Uniform Civil Code a collection of laws will be prepared which will protect the personal rights of all citizens without considering the religion, which seems to be the need of the hour. In reality this is the foundation stone of secularism,” the statement for objects and reasons of the Bill states.

Mr. Kareem, in his letter to the Chairman, said the Bill “violates the fundamental aspects of the Constitution and there is a chance to affect the communal harmony.” He said the Bill could also aggravate the ongoing country-wide protests against the CAA.

Asked why he was absent when his name was called out, Mr. Meena told The Hindu, “Majority of BJP MPs were absent because of Delhi elections. And I felt that if the opposition asked for a division on whether the Bill should be introduced or not, we would have fallen short of numbers.” He said he would re-attempt to introduce the Bill.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sjsj06/article30764920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8th-meena,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oppn-stalls-bjp-mps-bill-on-uniform-civil-code-in-rs/article30764921.ece
61,2020/02/07,HAL’s light utility helicopter crosses a milestone,"The indigenous light utility helicopter (LUH) being developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) crossed a milestone on Friday as it received the initial operational clearance (IOC) at the ongoing Defexpo. The choppers will replace the ageing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters along with the Russian Ka-226T helicopters.

Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said this edition of Defexpo had witnessed signing of about 200 Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), technology transfer agreements and product launches in the three business days.

“The LUH has complied with all the requirements of the users and with the completion of hot and high altitude testing, it is close to operational clearance certification,” said R. Madhavan, Chairman and Managing Director of HAL. He received the IOC document from G. Satheesh Reddy, Secretary, Department of Defence Research and Development.

The LUH is a 3-ton class helicopter with glass cockpit for reconnaissance and surveillance roles. The helicopter will be capable of flying at 220kmph, with a service ceiling of 6.5km and a range of 350km with 400 kg payload, HAL said in a statement.

HAL is moving towards the next phase of integrating and flight testing of mission and role equipment on LUH, said Arup Chatterjee, Director of Engineering and R&D, HAL. There is a tentative order of 200 LUH for the Army and the Air Force.

It is powered by a Safran-HAL Shakti single turbo shaft engine capable of handling high altitude missions. The first prototype made its maiden flight in September 2016 and the second prototype made its maiden flight in May 2017. The LUH completed hot weather trials at Nagpur in 2018, cold weather trials at Leh in 2019, sea level trials at Chennai in 2018 and at Puducherry in 2019.

The Army and the IAF began scouting for a LUH to replace the Cheetah and Chetak over a decade ago and in 2015, the Defence Ministry decided to split the order into two, by procuring around 200 in partnership with a foreign original equipment manufacturer and another 200 to be supplied HAL through indigenous development. This was done after cancelling an earlier tender for 197 helicopters.

India has since entered into an agreement with Russia to manufacture the Ka-226T in India through a joint venture between HAL and Russian Helicopters. The deal is in advanced stages but has been held up due to differences over localisation issues.

Mr. Kumar said that 71 MoUs were signed on Thursday, including 14 between Indian and Russian companies. Among the MoUs signed, 23 were by the Uttar Pradesh government. U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said these agreements envisage ₹50,000 crore investment in the defence corridor being set up in the State and would generate 3 lakh jobs.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hals-light-utility-helicopter-crosses-a-milestone/article30764907.ece
62,2020/02/07,SC takes suo motu cognisance of involvement of children in demonstrations,"The Supreme Court on Friday took suo motu cognisance to “stop involvement of children and infants in demonstrations” following the death of an infant on January 30 at Shaheen Bagh here.

The apex court website showed that the issue would be taken up for hearing on February 10 by a bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde.

The matter assumes importance as a letter was recently written by a 12-year-old National Bravery Award winner to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) seeking directions to prevent children from participating in demonstrations as it “amounts to cruelty”.

A 4-month-old baby had passed away in his sleep on the night of January 30 after returning from Shaheen Bagh where his parents had taken him during the anti-CAA protest.

Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, a recipient of the 2019 Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) National Bravery Award, said in the letter to the CJI’s office that the parents of the baby and the organisers of the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh had “failed” to protect the rights of the kid, resulting in his death.

Sadavarte, a student of Class 7 from Mumbai, has also alleged that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh include infants and children, who are exposed to conditions unfavourable to them, which is violation of their rights.

“The Shaheen Bagh protesters at New Delhi, include women, senior citizens, newborns and children, ignoring the fact that new born babies need a lot of attention and care as they cannot express their pains in particulars thereafter also ignoring the conditions unfavourable to the children, they are brought to the protest place which is violative of their child rights and natural justice,” the letter said.

It also alleged that the police failed in stopping children from participating in such agitations harmful to their health and expressed surprise over the fact that the death certificate of the 4-month-old does not mention the cause of death.

Sadavarte received the National Bravery Award for guiding 17 people to safety when a fire broke out at Parel’s Crystal Tower.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egsxj2/article30679238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-takes-suo-motu-cognisance-of-involvement-of-children-in-demonstrations/article30764467.ece
63,2020/02/07,Army gets upgraded 155mm artillery gun at Defexpo,"The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) on Friday handed over Sharang, the first 130mm M-46 artillery gun upgraded to 155mm to the Indian Army. It was formally handed over by OFB Chairman Hari Mohan to Army Chief Gen. Manoj Naravane at the ongoing Defexpo.

There was a major exhibition of heavy artillery guns, both under induction by the Army and being developed by industry, at the Defexpo.

“Sharang is the 130mm artillery gun ‘up-gunned’ to 155mm, 45 calibre up-gunning based on the Army’s tender,” an OFB official said. The Army had issued the Request For Proposal (RFP) in 2013 for both OFB and private industry.

“It was competitive bidding and OFB solution was the only one qualified during field evaluation trials,” the official said, adding that it was a low cost solution. The contract, worth ₹200 crore, was signed in October 2018.

The gun’s range has now gone from 27km to over 36km with the upgrade. It also has more explosive capability and hence and more damage potential, the official stated. In all, OFB will upgrade 300 130mm guns to 155mm and the contract will be completed in four years.

This step will reduce the logistic trail of the Army as it does away with the need to carry 130mm shells and support equipment as the mainstay of the Army’s long range artillery is 155mm guns. As part of the development and validation, OFB had ‘upgunned’ six guns for testing. An artillery regiment of the Army consists of 18 guns.

After close to three decades, the Army inducted its first modern artillery guns system in November 2018. These include M-777 Ultra Light Howitzers (ULH) from the U.S. and K9 Vajra-T self-propelled artillery guns from South Korea. The Army has the older, battle-proven Bofors 155mm guns in service. The 155mm Dhanush towed gun system, developed based on the Bofors guns by OFB, is under induction.

In addition, the Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), a 155mm, 52 calibre gun, being jointly developed by the DRDO in partnership with Bharat Forge of Kalyani Group and Tata Power SED, is in advanced stages of testing.

In October last year, the Army procured and inducted 155mm Excalibur precision guided ammunition from the U.S. which gives its 155mm artillery guns extended range and also the ability to hit targets with very high accuracy.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kwo4to/article30764036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEFENCEEXPO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-gets-upgraded-155mm-artillery-gun-at-defexpo/article30764037.ece
64,2020/02/07,Word from Modi’s speech in Rajya Sabha expunged,"In a rare move, a word from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Rajya Sabha was expunged from records.

Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu expunged the word used by Mr. Modi on Thursday during his reply to the discussion on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament at the start of the Budget session.

“Chairman was pleased to direct expunction of a certain portion of the proceedings of Rajya Sabha dated February 6 at about 6.20 and 6.30 pm,” a statement issued by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat said.

The Chairman routinely expunges any remark found unsuitable from Rajya Sabha’s records after going through the proceedings of the day. This has been done on several occasions, but rarely was any remark of Modi expunged.

Mr. Modi had made the remark as he launched a strong defence of the NPR saying the country’s population register was being updated with demographic information for better targeting of government’s welfare schemes.

He had targeted the opposition Congress for making a U-turn, saying the party had brought the NPR in 2010 and was later updated in 2015 by adding photographs and some biometric information.

Mr. Naidu also expunged a word from Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s statement made after Mr. Modi had finished his speech.

65,2020/02/07,Russian oil shipments to India will avoid Strait of Hormuz,"Russian energy giant Rosneft has decided that its India bound shipments will avoid the Strait of Hormuz — a global artery for transiting oil and gas — which is in the cross-hairs of military tensions between the United States and Iran.

The decision is in tune with India’s call on diversifying energy sources, and lowering reliance on the Persian Gulf, where geopolitical rifts are rife.

IOC signs contract

On Wednesday, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) signed the first ever supply contract of two million metric tonnes of crude oil with Russia’s Rosneft. “Sourcing of Russian crude oil through long term contracts is a part of India’s strategy for diversifying the country’s crude oil supplies from non-OPEC countries...” said a statement issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB).

It pointed out that that the contracted oil “will be loaded in Suezmax vessels at Novorossiysk port of Russia and will come to India, bypassing Straits of Hormuz.” Suezmax ships are medium to large sized vessels of 1,20,000 to 2,00,000, tonnes, which can transit through the Suez Canal when carrying a full load.

Nearly one third of world’s production of liquefied natural gas and 25% oil transits through the Strait of Hormuz — a passage between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

Energy security

Analysts point out that the drone attack, claimed by Yemeni Houthi fighters last September on two giant refineries in Saudi Arabia was a turning point, which imparted urgency to diversify imports to beef up energy security. “The attack on the two Saudi Aramco refineries, which together process a mammoth 8.45 million barrels of crude per day, was noted with grave concern in New Delhi. Thankfully the Saudis responded with maturity and did not retaliate,” says R.S. Sharma, former head of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), during a conversation with The Hindu, on the sidelines of the World Energy Policy Summit in New Delhi. The Houthi rebels are apparently backed by Iran, and are seen as part of a larger regional Shia “resistance” network led by Tehran against Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Soleimani’s killing

Mr. Sharma stressed that the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, top Iranian general, in a U.S. drone attack outside Baghdad airport on January 3 has further fuelled anxiety in India. “The Iranians have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz and it is well within their capability to do so. If the situation worsens we would be worst hit as India does not have the economic firepower that is comparable to other major energy importers such as China or Japan,” Mr. Sharma observed.

Asked whether a more prominent inclusion of Russia in India’s energy basket was a welcome step, he pointed out that, “India has to urgently diversify its energy procurement — whether it is from Russia, the United States, Africa or Venezuela.”

The oil contract signed on Wednesday appears part of deeper energy engagement between New Delhi and Moscow, covering Russia’s resource rich Far East as well as the Arctic zone. The Nikkei Asian Review is quoting Rosneft as saying that Indian oil companies will join the $157 billion Vostok oil development project in the Arctic. Reuters had earlier reported that Rosneft also wanted Japanese investors to pitch in 10 to 40% of development costs of the Vostok project. China was also on the company’s radar.

Working group

Mr. Akbar made the allegations before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja through his lawyer during the final hearing of a private criminal defamation complaint filed by him against Ms. Ramani after his name cropped up on social media as the #MeToo campaign raged on in India.

Mr. Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.

Ms. Ramani had in 2018 accused Mr. Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist. She worked at the Asian Age from January to October in 1994.

Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Mr. Akbar, said that if there was any grievance, it had to be raised then and there before the appropriate authority.

“Allegations are a figment of her (Ramani’s) imagination. Things that I (Akbar) took 49-45 years to build, without any sense of responsibility, were trashed,” Ms. Luthra said.

“Can you expect a man to answer to something which you allege happened 20-25 years ago? Why now? What is the public good that you are claiming? If there is a grievance, it has to be raised then and there before the appropriate authority... I don’t want to jump onto a political bandwagon,” she added.

“My whole life has gone without any controversy... Can you mar anybody’s life without any impunity, without any evidence? We can’t be a social media country,” she said.

Referring to an article written by Ms. Ramani, which was allegedly termed Akbar a “predator” and a “pervert”, she said the allegations were “false narrative“.

“This has caused great humiliation to Akbar and his reputation has been irreparably damaged. He developed a reputation and that’s why he was a Minister (of State) of External Affairs. He wrote extensively on South Asia. In that sense, the country needs such people,” she said.

She further added, “You (Ramani) are a person who is saying things without bothering. You are tarnishing someone’s image without bothering.”

The court will further hear the matter on February 28.

Mr. Akbar has also denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.

Ms. Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of alleged sexual harassment by Ms. Akbar has come at “a great personal cost” and she had nothing to gain from it.

She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at workplace. Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by him while they were working as journalists under Akbar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3riueg/article29234686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THMJAKBAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/metoo-accused-akbar-says-priya-ramanis-allegations-of-misconduct-are-a-figment-of-her-imagination/article30763426.ece
67,2020/02/07,"A Prime Minister has stature, Modi does not behave like that: Rahul","Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “tubelight” barb, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said he does not behave like a Prime Minister.

He also alleged that the ruckus in the Lok Sabha was “orchestrated” to prevent him from questioning the government.

“Normally, a Prime Minister has a particular status, a Prime Minister has a particular way of behaving, a particular stature, our Prime Minister doesn’t have these. He does not behave in a prime ministerial way,” he told reporters outside Parliament.

Mr. Gandhi said this when he was asked about Modi’s “tubelight” barb at him during his reply to the motion of thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

He also said: “We are being stifled and we are not being allowed to speak in Parliament. They have suppressed our voices.”

On Friday, there was an uproar in the Lok Sabha over comments made by BJP MP and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan against Mr. Gandhi. The House was adjourned for the day at 2 p.m.

“The orchestrated ruckus in Parliament today was designed to prevent me from questioning the government. The youth of India can clearly see that the PM has no clue about how to tackle the unemployment crisis,” said Mr. Gandhi.

“To protect him (Narendra Modi), the BJP will keep disrupting Parliament, preventing debate,” the Congress leader said on Twitter later.

Mr. Gandhi told reporters that he was seeking to raise an issue of the people of his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad not getting access to medical facilities in the absence of a medical college.

“But I was prevented from doing so,” he said.

Mr. Vardhan’s comments on Mr. Gandhi led to the ruckus in the Lok Sabha with some Congress MPs, including Manickam Tagore, protesting in the Well of the House.

“The BJP obviously does not like me to speak in the House. In a completely unparliamentary manner, the Union Health Minister raised something that I said outside, which he has no business of doing during the Question Hour. So, we were raising it with the Speaker,” the former Congress chief said.

“I think, the main issue is that we are being stifled. We are not allowed to speak in Parliament. The health minister instead of giving an answer to my question, was raising some other issue. Where ever they can suppress our voice, they try to do that,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi denied that Mr. Tagore attacked anyone and alleged that he was instead attacked.

“Yesterday, the Prime Minister gave a long speech, I asked him what is happening about jobs and employment. The Prime Minister talked about Jawaharlal Nehru, he spoke about Pakistan and all sorts of things, the Congress party, but the Prime Minister is unable to answer what he is doing to give jobs to the youth of the country.

“He is unable to give an answer and jobs to the youth, and that is why this drama that you saw today,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi along with Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury later met Speaker Om Birla over the ruckus in the House.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j9n0pm/article30755151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7TH-RAGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-prime-minister-has-stature-modi-does-not-behave-like-that-rahul/article30763341.ece
68,2020/02/07,200 MoUs signed at Lucknow DefExpo: Rajnath Singh,"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said over 200 Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) have been signed so far at the DefExpo in Lucknow, asserting that the country is on its way to achieve the target of USD 5 billion in defence exports by 2024.

Addressing an event at DefExpo-2020, he said the Centre’s policy for the sector has begun delivering results.

“In 2018-19, defence exports were ₹10,745 crore, which was seven times the exports in 2016-17. Seeing the success of this Defence expo, I am sure that by 2024 we will achieve the target of five billion dollars in defence exports,” the Minister said.

He said so far 200 agreements have been signed during this DefExpo and described the outcome as “historic”.

Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said the initial target for the Lucknow DefExpo was 100 Memorandums of Understanding and business agreements, but till now 200 MoUs have been signed.

Mr. Kumar described it as the beginning of a new chapter in this sector.

Indigenously developed products including artillery guns, helicopters, anti-tank missiles and bulletproof jackets are showcased at the DefExpo.

Rajnath Singh said this reflected Indian capabilities in defence production, according to a press release.

Defence manufacturing firms from across the world are participating in the five-day event inaugurated on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who indicated that the country is eyeing the export target of USD 5 billion by 2024.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the State has signed 23 MoUs at the DefExpo through the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPIEDA).

This is is expected to bring in an investment of ₹50,000 crore and generate 2.50-3 lakh jobs. Uttar Pradesh has emerged as a favourite investment destination,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that during the last two and a half years, the State government has attracted investment of more than ₹2.5 lakh crore, which will help provide employment to over 33 lakh people.

He said the land banks at Aligarh and Jhansi, part of the State’s defence manufacturing corridor, are booked.

69,2020/02/07,Visas issued to foreign nationals coming from China cancelled: Harsh Vardhan,"India has cancelled all visas issued to foreign nationals coming from China as it stepped up efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus after several passengers showed suspected symptoms and were sent to isolation units, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a suo motu statement in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.

“We have also asked people not to travel to China. Screening of passengers has been stepped up at 21 airports, as well as at 12 major seaports and at all minor ports. Also, screening is being done at all integrated checkpoints on the Nepal border after the Himalayan nation reported a confirmed case,” he said.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said 80 Indians remained in Wuhan, where the virus broke out. Among them were 10 students, who came to the airport with fever and who were not allowed to board the special Air India flight by the Chinese authorities. The remaining 70 have voluntarily stayed back.

When members asked whether Pakistan had sought India for help in evacuating its citizens from China, he said India made the offer of evacuation to all neighbours, but only the Maldives accepted it.

“As of today, ...1,275 flights have been screened, covering a total of 1,39,539 passengers, and 150 passengers identified with symptoms have been referred to isolation facilities,” the Health Minister said.

Mr. Vardhan said the visas issued (including the eVisa) to foreign nationals travelling from China were no longer valid. “Universal thermal screening has been made mandatory for all flights from Singapore and Thailand, besides Hong Kong and China. All these flights will park at the earmarked aero-bridges to facilitate screening,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x5z2uo/article30763243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HarshVardhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gom-headed-by-health-minister-monitoring-coronavirus-situation-says-harsh-vardhan/article30763244.ece
70,2020/02/07,BMAC likely to move SC to stake claim on debris of Babri mosque,"The Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) plans to move the Supreme Court to stake claim on the debris of the demolished Babri mosque.

BMAC convenor Zafaryab Jilani told PTI that he has spoken to Muslim residents in Ayodhya to arrange land to dump the debris.

“We have discussed with our lawyer Rajiv Dhawan and he is also of the opinion that we must claim the debris of mosque, so next week we will be meeting in Delhi and move forward our process,” Mr. Jilani said.

The Muslim parties want to remove the debris of Babri Masjid, which was demolished in 1992, before the construction of a Ram temple starts.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Wednesday announced the formation of a trust for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya as directed by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in November last year.

Chairman of Babri Masjid cell in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, SQR Ilyas said, “We will move the Supreme Court through our litigants who were in the Babri Masjid case, and it is necessary that the debris of Babri Masjid must be removed before the temple construction starts.”

Sayyad Ekhlaq Ahmas, a prominent cleric of Ayodhya, said he has got a land in Ayodhya where the debris of Babri Masjid can be easily dumped.

Haji Mahboo, who was one of the litigants in the Babri Masjid case, said the land to dump the debris can be easily arranged in Ayodhya.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bx2qtc/article29938242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THRDBABRI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bmac-likely-to-move-sc-to-stake-claim-on-debris-of-babri-mosque/article30762958.ece
71,2020/02/07,HC rejects Tihar plea seeking fresh date for Nirbhaya convicts’ execution,"A Delhi court on Friday dismissed the Tihar jail’s plea seeking fresh date for execution of the four death row convicts in the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, taking note of the Delhi High Court order giving them a week’s time to exercise their legal remedies.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana said, “It is criminally sinful to execute the convicts when law permits them to live. The High Court on February 5 has permitted the convicts, in the interest of justice, to exercise their legal remedies within one week”.

The court said, “I concur with counsel for the convicts that death warrants cannot be executed merely on basis of surmises and conjectures.”

On January 31, the trial court stayed the execution of Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31).

The Tihar jail, in its plea, said the President had dismissed the mercy petitions of three convicts and that no application by any of the four was currently pending before any court.

Except Pawan, all convicts have exhausted their legal remedy available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court.

72,2020/02/07,‘Unwell’ Chinese national onboard Air India flight admitted to Pune hospital,"A Chinese national on an Air India flight from Delhi fell ill and was taken to a Pune hospital after the flight landed in the city.

Air India spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said the “unwell” passenger was admitted to the hospital.

The passenger's medical samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for testing, officials said.

The aircraft’s departure back to Delhi was delayed by over four hours owing to fumigation following concerns over the coronavirus scare.

Landed from Bangkok

Dr. Ramchandra Hankare, who heads the Pune Municipal Corporation's health department, said the Chinese national had landed in India from Bangkok late last month.

""He displayed symptoms like cold and cough. We have sent his throat swab samples to the NIV and are awaiting the report,"" he said.

According to Dr. Hankare, prior to boarding the flight for Pune, the patient arrived in India on January 29, following which he made a number of trips to the cities in the East, including Kolkata and Bhubaneshwar, before reaching New Delhi on January 5.

73,2020/02/07,"Nirbhaya case: SC not in hurry to hear Centre, Delhi government pleas to separately execute convicts","The Supreme Court on Friday conveyed it is in no hurry to hear the appeals filed by the Centre and the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT) for permission to separately execute Nirbhaya convicts.

A Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi remained impassive as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged the court to issue a formal notice to the convicts on the appeals. The law officer intermittently asked the court to at least allow the government to serve the copies of the appeal papers to the convicts through the jail authorities.

Mr. Mehta said the “nation is losing patience” seeing the convicts misuse the legal process to delay the execution of their death sentence. “A law needs to be laid down,” Mr. Mehta stressed. But these submissions hardly created a ripple among the judges.

Instead, Justice Banumathi drew Mr. Mehta's attention to the fact that the Delhi High Court, in its February 5 judgment rejecting the government's plea to separately execute the convicts, had given the condemned men seven days to exhaust whatever remedies left to them.

If the condemned men exhaust all their remedies within that time, the question of separate hangings do not arise, the court reasoned. It scheduled the next hearing on February 11 at 2 p.m.

The High Court judgment had acknowledged that “it cannot be disputed that the convicts have adopted all the delay tactics to frustrate the death warrants”. In this context, it noted that one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, was yet to file his curative and mercy petitions though his review petition was dismissed on July 9, 2018. However, all these factors do not allow executing them separately, the court reasoned.

But it put the four convicts on a deadline. “I hereby direct the convicts to take steps if they wish to make any type of petition before any institutions/authorities available under law within one week from today, failing which this court [Delhi HC] expects from the authorities concerned to deal as per law applicable without further delay,” Justice Suresh Kait, directed in the judgment on February 5.

The Supreme Court Bench, also comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna, was referring to this particular direction of the High Court while opting to wait out and see what the four convicts intend to do within the time frame of a week.

“The convicts are making a mockery of the legal process... So we have seen calculated and deliberate attempts to delay the hanging,” Mr. Mehta submitted.

Sessions Court decision

The Centre, through the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the NCT of Delhi, through the Lieutenant Governor, have challenged the February 5 High Court judgment, which was based on the government's challenge against the January 31, 2020 decision of the Sessions Court to postpone the issuance of fresh death warrants against the four convicts.

The government had argued in the apex court that, under the Delhi Prison Rules of 2018, the pendency of legal remedies or mercy petitions of other co-convicts would have no bearing on the fate of a convict whose plea for mercy had been rejected. It argued that the 2018 Rules did not prohibit the execution of the death sentence of co-convicts, one by one, on the rejection of their respective mercy petitions.

Deferring the execution of the death sentence of all the four convicts, specifically when Mukesh’s mercy plea has been dismissed by the President, has led to “gross miscarriage of justice” to the victim’s family as well as society as a whole, the government had contended.

The High Court judgment, however, held that the 2018 Rules observed that the pendency of any application filed by one convict would necessarily require the postponement of the death sentence of all his co-convicts, even those whose mercy pleas had been rejected.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qomwfi/article30692813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-DELHIGANGRAPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-supreme-court-to-hear-on-february-11-centres-plea-against-delhi-hc-verdict/article30761447.ece

75,2020/02/07,"Narendra Modi lauds Bodos for peace pact, allays fears over Citizenship Amendment Act","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday advised the youth in central India's Maoist belt and Jammu and Kashmir to emulate the Bodos and shun the path of violence.

He also allayed fears that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would bring illegal foreigners to Assam. This was his first visit to the State since the protests against the citizenship law began last year.

“I congratulate you for taking the right path and will ensure no thorn pricks you hereafter. I appeal to the youth elsewhere in the northeast, the Naxal areas and Jammu and Kashmir, who still believe in guns, bombs and pistols, to learn a lesson from the Bodo people,” Mr Modi said at a rally organised in western Assam’s Kokrajhar to celebrate the recent signing of third Bodo Peace Accord among Centre, Assam government, Bodo insurgent groups and two other Bodo organisations.

The Prime Minister said 130 crore Indians have been congratulating the Bodos for their peace initiative that would be “a new beginning for those who laid down arms” and for Assam.

“We are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and its relevance has increased after the signing of Bodo Accord. It will serve as an inspiration (for others) to renounce the path of violence,” Mr Modi said.

Development priority

“The Bodos have received respect after five decades. The two previous accords signed in 1993 and 2003 could not restore peace completely. After the signing of the latest accord, no demands of the Bodos are left. Through this pact, the (newly-created) BTR (Bodoland Territorial Region) will get strengthened. Everybody has won through this pact. Peace and humanity have won too. Our first and foremost priority now will be development. I will never retreat without fulfilling your aspirations,” he said.

“Let us take a resolution on development today. We should work to ensure that the darkness of violence does not return to this land again and no blood is spilt,” the Prime Minister added

Mr Modi recounted the Centre's initiatives to settle long-drawn conflicts in the northeast, such as the issue of the Bru refugees from Mizoram that was hanging fire for more than two decades.

“Previous governments never tried to touch the complex issues of the northeast. Their approach alienated the people and they started losing faith in democracy. Development in the region took a backseat. We started with a new approach by trying to understand the problems and people’s aspirations. We could take them into confidence and considered them as our own,” he said.

Extremism waning

He also claimed that extremism-related deaths became a thing of the past in the region after the BJP-led NDA government came to power in 2014.

“We lifted the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from several parts of the northeast after assuming power. Investment has started pouring into the region industrialists used to avoid. These all are the results of our hard work in the past five years,” he said.

Mr Modi said certain elements have been spreading fear about the amended citizenship law. In the same vein, he alluded to Congress president Rahul Gandhi's 'danda' (stick) remark.

“Sometimes people talk about beating with sticks but it doesn’t matter how many sticks I face. When such a huge number of people (the gathering in Kokrajhar), including mothers and sisters, bless me, nothing is going to happen to me,” he said.

Massive turnout

Bodo leaders said more than five lakh people turned up at the programme.

Promod Boro, president of All Bodo Students’ Union and a signatory of the January 27 Bodo Accord, said the peace pact helped the mothers get back their sons who were far from home waging an armed struggle. He was optimistic that everything committed to the Bodos through the accord would be implemented soon.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma were effusive in their praises of Mr. Modi for a peaceful solution of the Bodo problem.

However, Kokrajhar's independent MP Naba Kumar Sarania, who met Mr. Modi after he landed at the airport in Guwahati before flying in a chopper to Kokrajhar, said the non-Bodos would not accept the accord unless their rights are ensured.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/rcaslc/article30761872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/modi-rally-feb-7jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bodo-accord-has-heralded-new-dawn-of-peace-in-assam-modi/article30761288.ece

A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant took note of the appeal of the Reserve Bank of India against the Bombay High Court order.

The top court also issued notice on RBI’s plea to parties, including Sarosh Damania, who had approached the Bombay High Court for ensuring payment of dues to PMC Bank account holders.

Earlier, the Bombay High Court had set up a three-member committee for valuating and sale of encumbered assets of HDIL to expeditiously recover dues payable by the firm to PMC Bank.

The high court had passed the order while hearing a PIL seeking direction for expeditious disposal of HDIL assets and properties attached by the Economic Offence Wing and the Enforcement Directorate and repaying PMC Bank depositors at the earliest.

The fraud at PMC Bank came to light in September last year after the Reserve Bank of India discovered that it had allegedly created fictitious accounts to hide over ₹4,355 crore of loans extended to HDIL.

According to RBI, the PMC Bank masked 44 problematic loan accounts, including those of HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system, and the accounts were accessible only to limited staff members.

A Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana said the Justice Nair committee may take the help of an expert appraiser in the exercise. The detailed list will be handed over to the apex court in a sealed cover. The court listed the case for hearing in four weeks.

The order for the inventory was initiated on the advice of the Kerala government, represented by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal. The court had asked the State’s opinion on the measures to be taken to keep the ornaments safe and secure.

Mr. Venugopal drew the court’s attention to how the Supreme Court earlier secured “lakhs of crores” worth of Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple treasure.

Taking a leaf out of the Padmanabha Swamy case, Mr. Venugopal said the first thing to do would be to take a detailed inventory list of the Lord Ayyappa’s ornaments.

“What the State government has now is a very generalised list. Look, item eight in the list is a diamond object... but nobody knows how many carats. A jeweller can be taken on board by the committee to examine the jewellery so that later it cannot be replaced with fake items,” Mr. Venugopal submitted.

'Sabarimala issue different from Padmanabha Swamy'

Senior advocate R.K. Radhakrishnan, appearing for senior members of the Panthalam royal family, said the position in the case of Sabarimala was quite different from the Padmanabha Swamy matter. He said the ornaments belonged to the Panthalam Raja, who was the mythological father of the deity. The king ceremonially carried the jewellery to the temple to adorn his son with them.

Mr. Radhakrishnan objected to the move to make the Kerala government responsible for custody and security of the ornaments. He objected to the inventory as “indirect” intrusion by the State on the private property of the royal family.

Mr. Venugopal said this was the same mistake made by the Travancore royal family in the Padmanabha Swamy temple case. They had claimed all the valuables to belong to them. Petitions were filed. The AG said the treasure belonged to the deity and rested with the government.

Justice Ramana said the court was currently only concerned with the safety and security of the sacred ornaments. The Bench orally observed that though the jewellery was with the Raja, the ornaments ultimately belonged to the deity.

The Kerala government, meanwhile, informed the Supreme Court that it needed a month to finalise an exclusive legislation for the management of the famed Sabarimala temple.

Late last year, the Bench directed the Kerala government to draft by the third week of January a separate law covering the administration of the Sabarimala Sree Ayyappa Swami Temple.

The court had previously expressed dissatisfaction when the State produced a draft Bill — The Travancore-Cochin Religious Institutions (Amendment) Bill of 2019 — containing certain proposed amendments to the Travancore-Cochin Religious Institutions Act of 1950.

The 1950 Act is presently governing over a hundred temples, including Sabarimala.

Justice Ramana had pointed out that a temple that received lakhs of pilgrims should be governed by a separate Act. The court had said an exclusive law was imperative for the welfare of pilgrims and effective management of the temple.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/42umb/article30760465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDAIYAPPAORNAMENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-orders-inventory-of-sabarimala-deitys-sacred-ornaments/article30760466.ece
80,2020/02/07,"Coal scam case | Suggest names for Special Public Prosecutor, SC tells Centre","The Supreme Court on February 7 gave the Centre time till February 10 to make suggestions for the appointment of Special Public Prosecutor to conduct trials for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in money laundering cases related to the coal block scam.

A Bench comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justice Deepak Gupta was considering the plea of senior advocate R.S. Cheema, who wanted to be relieved as the prosecutor in money laundering cases.

The top court appointed Mr. Cheema as Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) in coal block scam cases in 2014.

The Bench did not seem to be in agreement with the suggestion of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that former Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh be appointed the special prosecutor to conduct trial in ED cases pertaining to coal scam.

“We need a trial court lawyer who has been conducting trials,” the Bench said, adding that “the other lawyer” suggested by Mr. Cheema seemed to be more appropriate.

Sources told PTI that Mr. Cheema has suggested the name of lawyer Satish Tamta for the job.

“The other name seems to be more appropriate,” the Bench said and gave the Centre time till February 10 to suggest names for this purpose.

Mr. Cheema had said that he would like to continue as CBI’s special prosecutor in the coal scam cases, but would not want to be the SPP in money laundering matters as there was shortage of law officers assisting him in such cases.

The top court had on December 9 asked the Solicitor General and Mr. Cheema to suggest names of advocates who could be appointed the SPP for ED matters.

The SC had earlier sought to know from the CBI and the ED the status of investigation and trial in the coal block allocation scam cases probed by the two agencies.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3gf97v/article30705514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-COU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coal-scam-case-suggest-names-for-special-public-prosecutor-sc-tells-centre/article30759711.ece
81,2020/02/07,SC to hear pleas against protest at Shaheen Bagh on February 10,"The Supreme Court on Friday deferred hearing a plea to direct the Delhi Police to stop the Shaheen Bagh protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens and clear the “roadblock” till the Delhi elections are over.

A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul indicated the court would not be party to any sort of pre-election narrative to garner votes a day before the polls on February 8.

“We will hear it on Monday,” Justice Kaul told the counsel. “But Delhi election is tomorrow,” the lawyer responded.

“That is exactly why we are saying Monday. You’ve read our minds... You let the cat out of the bag,” Justices Kaul and K.M. Joseph both said in one voice to the counsel.

The petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni has sought directions to the police to take action to ensure smooth traffic movement on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which has been closed for over a month due to anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests, making the public at large suffer.

The plea has sought supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh where several women are sitting on an indefinite protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court to avoid any further deterioration in the situation and to circumvent any violence.

“The respondents (Delhi Police) cannot be permitted to behave like mute spectators, particularly in a situation presently faced by persons living in the vicinity of Kalindi Kunj,” said the plea.

Mr. Sahni has contended that the Delhi High Court did not order the forthwith removal of traffic restrictions and observed that no direction can be issued on the methodology to handle protest and traffic movement successfully and left it to the discretion of the police.

“No one can be permitted to occupy a public road for any reason whatsoever under the pretext of peaceful protest and that too for an indefinite period to make others suffer for the same”, his plea said.

The High Court had asked the police to examine the issue while bearing in mind that law and order is supposed to be maintained.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q374l5/article30759511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRASHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-pleas-against-protest-at-shaheen-bagh-on-february-10/article30759512.ece
82,2020/02/07,Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president ‘upset’ over not being included in trust,"Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Mahant Nritya Gopal Das has indicated that he was upset with not being appointed to the trust charged with building the temple, prompting the BJP to rush in three leaders to pacify him.

The BJP top brass in Lucknow on Thursday sent Ayodhya party MLA Ved Prakash Gupta, Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and Ayodhya Mahanagar president Abhishek Mishra to the Mani Ram Das temple here.

The seers at the temple stopped the leaders from entering inside and forced them to return. Soon, the Mahant called an emergency meeting of seers at 3 p.m. and a press conference at 5 p.m., Mr. Mishra said.

Later, the two scheduled events were cancelled as the temple management received a phone call from the Ministry of Home Affairs, said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, the designated successor to Nritya Gopal Das.

Mr. Gupta told PTI that he had arranged for a telephonic conversation between the Mahant and Home Minister Amit Shah and for a phone call from Lucknow as well.

He claimed that three posts were still vacant in the trust and the Mahant will be “adjusted”. Mr. Gupta said they had managed to pacify the seer.

The Mahant had earlier said that those who gave their lives to the temple movement had been ignored.

Kamal Nayan Das claimed that the Vaishnav Samaj had been completely ignored in the trust and said that they do not accept it.

In a series of tweets, former Finance Minister Chidambaram said detaining someone without charges is the ‘worst abomination of democracy’.

“On what basis has PSA been slapped on Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti? They upheld the Constitution of India, abided by the democratic process, stood up to separatists, and never ascribed to violence and divisiveness. They deserve to be freed, not incarcerated indefinitely without any basis,” Ms Vadra said on Twitter.

“Shocked and devastated by the cruel invocation of the Public Safety Act against Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others,” Mr Chidambaram .

“Detention without charges is the worst abomination in a democracy. When unjust laws are passed or unjust laws are invoked, what option do the people have than to protest peacefully?” he asked.

Taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his Parliament speech o Thursday, he said, “the PM says that protests will lead to anarchy and laws passed by Parliament and legislatures must be obeyed. He has forgotten history and the inspiring examples of Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela”.

The CPI (M) Polit Bureau too issued a statement strongly condemning the decision and demanded the immediate release of the Ms Mufti and Mr Abdullah.

The party said Prime Minister Narendra Modi attributed wrong statements to Mr Abdullah and Ms Mufti as they statements were picked from a Twitter handle of a satire website “Faking News”.

“That the Modi government should take recourse to such false news for slapping the notorious PSA belies the claims that ‘everything is normal in J&K’. Thousands continue to be detained even after six months. The day to day activity in J&K has been disrupted and it's an affront to the Indian Constitution and democracy,” read the statement.

86,2020/02/07,CPI(M) to persuade people not to participate in NPR from March 1: Yechury,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Thursday announced that it would send its cadres to every household persuading people not to participate in the upcoming National Population Register (NPR) survey which, it said, would lead to implementation of a countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“A door to door campaign will begin from March 1 and culminate on March 23. During this period, our cadres will appeal to people not to cooperate with surveyors seeking answers on NPR questionnaire scheduled to begin from April 1. But people must participate in census work,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said at a public gathering held to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the NPR and the NRC here.

All Left parties were likely to mobilise public opinion against the NPR, the CAA and the NRC by March 23, which marked the martyrdom of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru, said Mr. Yechury.

“Our generation had participated in anti-Emergency movement to restore democracy in the country. There is a misconception about today’s generation that they live in cyberspace and don’t have anything do with the reality. But they are now out on the street holding national flags in their hands. They swear by the Constitution. We need to carry the momentum forward,” he observed.

“Home Minister Amit Shah had tried to explain the chronology to countrymen that the NPR will come first, then the NRC and finally the CAA. The non-Muslims who do not have any proof would get citizenship automatically. Now, I will tell you what the real chronology is. First the NPR will be implemented. There will be doubtful marks labelled against names of many people. These people will have to show papers to prove their citizenship. Detention camps are coming up everywhere and those who fail to prove their citizenship will go to these camps,” said Mr. Yechury.

A large section of people, including Dalits, tribal people and women did not have any birth documents and they would be forced to stand on queue to prove their bonafide nativity. “The Narendra Modi government is trying to alter the basic character of the country from a secular and democratic nation to orthodox, fascist and Hindutwa country,” he alleged.

Earlier, Mr. Yechury called Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik requesting him not to implement NPR in Odisha. “I explained to him how NPR would lead to the NRC, which his government is opposed to.

87,2020/02/07,Farmers staring at huge loss due to unseasonal rain in Odisha,"Hundreds of farmers hit by slow pace in paddy procurement are staring at huge losses as their paddy stocks are exposed to unseasonal rain in Odisha.

The State has been receiving widespread rain due to western disturbance since Tuesday. Eighteen of 28 meteorological observation stations in the State recorded rainfall on Wednesday.

The Bhubaneswar Meteorological Centre has predicted light to moderate rain across the State till February 9.

Farmers were stranded with their paddy stocks at procurement centres in Kalahandi, Jagatsinghpur, Boudh and Kendrapara districts. Their paddy could not be procured due to confusion prevailing in token system. The unseasonal rain has added to their woes as they are finding it difficult to keep their stocks at safer place.

As of now 9,54,870 tokens were issued to farmers for selling paddy. As many as 6,69,228 farmers have sold 39,02,737 metric tonnes of paddy in the current kharif season. Last year, 38,81,886 metric tonnes of paddy were procured around this time.

However, 16 of 30 districts have reported fall in crop procurement. “Percentage of paddy procurement achieved as on February 3 has fallen down in comparison to the progress achieved during last year by this time. Particularly, paddy procurement in districts such as Angul, Balasore, Dhenkanal, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Kendrapara, Khordha, Mayurbhanj and Nayagarh have shown negative growth with reference to last year,” said Registrar of Cooperative Societies of Odisha.

Deogarh and Gajapati districts have reported fall of 28% in paddy procurement this year.

89,2020/02/07,Naga groups reach out to NSCN(IM),"After meeting leaders of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Guwahati, the Naga National Political Groups (NNGPs) — an umbrella organisation of seven Nagaland-based extremist groups — have reached out to the rival Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, or NSCN(IM).

A church organisation and a federation of village elders brokered the “reconciliatory meeting” over breakfast in Nagaland capital Kohima on Friday.

The NNGPs comprise the NSCN (Unification), NSCN (Reformation), NSCN (Khango), Naga National Council and two of its factions, and Federal Government of Nagaland. Most of these groups have fought fratricidal battles with the NSCN (IM) since the NSCN, formed in 1980, split into the Isak-Muivah and S.S. Khaplang factions eight years later.

The other NSCN factions formed by Nagas on the Indian side of the border had broken away from the NSCN (Khaplang), which is primarily Myanmar-based.

“Leaders of the ruling dispensation [Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party and ally BJP] and the Opposition (Naga People’s Front) will take part in the meeting, besides delegates from the two groups and some key members of civil society organisations,” a member of Nagaland Gaon Burah (village elder) Federation said.

The meeting is believed to be the start of a process to bring the groups on a platform for pressuring the Centre for a solution to the Naga political process.

90,2020/02/07,UNESCO promises help for Jaipur's heritage conservation,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has praised the cultural and architectural heritage of Jaipur and promised to help in its conservation for a sustainable future. The Walled City of Jaipur, famous for its grid plan-based architecture, was declared a world heritage site in July last year.

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay gave away the world heritage certificate to the Rajasthan government's representatives at a glittering function held at the iconic Albert Hall Museum here on Wednesday. Ms. Azoulay laid emphasis on a “strategic partnership” between the U.N. body and India on the occasion.

“Jaipur is already an iconic city because of its heritage and has a special place in the world. This inscription goes even further and is a joint commitment to protect and preserve this cultural heritage for the future,” Ms. Azoulay said.

Ms. Azoulay affirmed that UNESCO and India had a history of strategic partnership based on cultural diversity and joint commitment for education. The recognition as a world heritage site would help promote responsible tourism in the city, she said.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who missed the ceremony because of ill health, dedicated the recognition to the people of Jaipur and the State. “Delighted and proud that Jaipur has got UNESCO heritage certificate... Jaipur is one of the most well planned and beautiful cities of the world. Let us preserve the heritage of the capital city,” he tweeted.

Famous for its buildings constructed with the pink facade, the Walled City had impressed the International Council on Monuments and Sites, which had recommended the world heritage status for it. The council took into account the architecture of streets with colonnades, which intersect the centre, creating large public squares called chaupars.

Ms. Azoulay visited several monuments of tourist significance during her visit to the city. She praised the architecture of the historic Amber Fort, built by the erstwhile Kachwaha Rajput rulers, and said that the uniform facades of markets, residences and temples in the main streets of the Walled City were impressive.

The UNESCO Director-General unveiled a stone plaque highlighting the world heritage status of Jaipur, installed outside the Hawa Mahal, which is considered Jaipur's most distinctive landmark. Tourism Minister Vishwendra Singh, Art & Culture Minister B.D. Kalla and Urban Development Minister Shanti Dhariwal were among those present at the certificate presentation ceremony.

A brochure on “intangible heritage promotion project” was also released at the function. The project, signed between the Tourism Department and UNESCO, aims at developing 10 new cultural tourism destinations in the State, for which the tourists could extend their stay by at least one extra day.

91,2020/02/07,Removal of Modi portrait a BJP conspiracy: Urdu Academy chairman,"Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy Chairman Aziz Qureshi said that the removal of portraits of President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from his office - just the night before he took charge - was intended to stoke a controversy and was the handiwork of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking to derail efforts at course correction at the literary institute.

“It was all a planned conspiracy. It was the mischief of an employee who allegedly removed the portraits for the purpose of cleaning them,” Mr. Qureshi, former Congressman and Governor, told The Hindu. He denied the charge that the portraits were removed by the employee to mark protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Stating that in the past 15 years, the former BJP government in the State had “destroyed” the academy here, he claimed it often pressured employees to march in lockstep. “They dissolved the working committee and the general body, and used funds for political purposes. This won’t be allowed anymore,” he said.

In March 2016, allegations regarding the academy’s ‘saffronisation’ came to the fore when Urdu poet Manzar Bhopali accused the secretary of it, who then filed a criminal defamation suit in return. He had in the past also written to former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleging corruption in the State-run body.

“The academy was a dream of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and I was among the advocates of it. The Chair is an opportunity for me to promote Urdu. It will function purely as a non-political, literary body. Irrespective of ideologies, students with merit can step inside it,” said Mr. Qureshi, who took charge on January 24.

On the morning of Januray 31, former BJP MLA Surendra Nath Singh led party workers to the Academy, where they raised slogans against the State government, and submitted portraits of Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind. Mr. Qureshi alleged the workers asked the staff, predominantly Muslim, to go to Pakistan.

Denying the charge, Mr. Singh said, “It’s a government-run institution, and both Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind hold Constitutional posts. When there are portraits of others, why not have theirs too?”

Though the Election Commission of India has prohibited the display of portraits of the Prime Minister in government offices, it hasn’t done so for the President. Still, in 2017, the former BJP government in Madhya Pradesh made it mandatory to display portraits of the Chief Minister along with the Prime Minister in all government offices, an order still in force.

The employee, against whom the police have registered an FIR on complaint from Mr. Qureshi, claimed he was being made a scapegoat to settle the issue. “The portraits have been there for more than a year, and dusting them before a new official joins is regular practice. When I took down the portraits someone took photographs and circulated them. This is affecting me and my family mentally and socially,” he said while requesting anonymity.

“I have never taken part in a protest. With a case charged against me now, there’s a blot on my life,” said the employee for 30 years, in response to the allegation that his removal of portraits came as an act of protest against the CAA.

Meanwhile, Deepak Vidrohi, a lawyer, and former student of the academy said the language was wrongly associated with one community—Muslims—who became easy targets. “Any language can’t be looked through the prism of religion or community. It is continuously evolving. Language is region-specific and not religion-specific.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/baun8w/article30716980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AzizQureshijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/removal-of-modi-portrait-a-bjp-conspiracy-urdu-academy-chairman/article30756299.ece
92,2020/02/07,Strained India-Bangla relation can jeopardise neighbourhood plans of Delhi: Former Bangladesh envoy,"Growing tension between India and Bangladesh can scuttle Indian plans for the South Asian neighbourhood, said a former envoy of Dhaka here on Thursday. Tariq Karim, who served as the High Commissioner of Bangladesh between 2009 and 2014, indicated that the Awami League government of Dhaka is under increasing domestic pressure because of the new citizenship law of India and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

""No regional project will take off if the sub-regional India-Bangladesh cooperation falls apart. Sequentially speaking, a lot was achieved because of the cooperation between the the Indian and Bangladesh governments. But Sheikh Hasina is a politician and she will have to face the questions about India that her people will pose before her,"" said Mr. Karim in comments to The Hindu on the sidelines of a think-tank event held here.

Palpable unhappiness

Mr. Karim said there is palpable unhappiness among the masses of Bangladesh that probably prompted Sheikh Hasina to criticise the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, of India, during a recent visit to Abu Dhabi. ""Basically she criticised the internal law of a neighbouring country because she had to send a message to her people who are fulminating,"" said the veteran diplomat.

The Prime Minister of Bangladesh had given an interview to Gulf News in Abu Dhabi in January where she had acknowledged that the citizenship law is an internal matter of India but termed the move as ""unnecessary"".

The former High Commissioner to New Delhi in November 2019 had criticised the Indian decision to abolish the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and the NRC process saying these actions validate the ""two nation theory"" that led to the Partition of India in 1947.

Call for cooperation

On Thursday, he highlighted the need for better coordination among all countries of the region for execution of regional networks like Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) initiative for transport and connectivity and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation). He pointed out that the Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA) of BBIN has failed to materialise despite being signed in 2015.

""The success of BIMSTEC will be in direct proportion to the success that BBIN can demonstrate. If you can't make BBIN successful then why should the other three countries of BIMSTEC have an interest in going forward with that,"" said Mr. Karim pointing out the shortcomings in the regional initiatives that have received attention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's foreign policy team.

The report was tabled by Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani on Thursday. It recommends a multi-pronged strategy detailing technological, institutional, social and educational as well as State-level measures.

Among its key recommendations is a code of conduct or a set of guidelines for ensuring child safety online. It puts a greater onus on ISPs to identify and remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) as well as report such content and those trying to access them to the authorities under the national cybercrime portal.

It has also called for strengthening the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) so that it can serve as the nodal body for curbing child pornography. “It should be empowered suitably to deal with the added responsibilities. The capabilities required in the NCPCR should include technology, cyberpolicing and prosecution,” the panel has proposed along with an inter-ministerial task force.

The committee has delved into great detail in using technology to curb circulation of child porn such as breaking end-to-end encryption to trace its distributors of child pornography, mandatory applications to monitor children’s access to pornographic content, employing photo DNA to target profile pictures of groups with CSAM, some of which are likely to lead to concerns over privacy and misuse.“Most of these are steps in the right direction and will help in creating a safer eco system, but some of the suggestions need a closer examination. For instance, asking ISPs to report content in addition to blocking and filtering may not be practical. The suggestion to break encryption may also just lead to traffic moving to different platforms,” says Siddharth P, co-director, Aarambh. He adds that there is also a need to develop a victim-centric strategy instead of just focusing on prosecution. He warns against “over-criminalisation” through misuse of provisions that penalise sexting and grooming, i.e. use of Internet to develop a sexual relationship with a minor, by punishing older consenting adolescents too.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yowaro/article30240827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cybercrime,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/panel-suggests-steps-to-curb-child-porn/article30756641.ece

“So far six chief ministers have come from Rayalaseema but none of them was successful in providing jobs for youth,” he added.

Commenting on the electoral performance of the party, the JSP chief said that he was not able to convert fans into votes. “While there are five ‘Janasainiks’ in every ward, there are 500 fans. Fans couldn’t turn into ‘Janasainiks’ as there was a lack of strong local leadership,” he said.

CAA and NRC

Addressing concerns about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Mr. Kalyan said, “Why would I get into an alliance with BJP if CAA and NRC will hurt Muslims?”

He later asked, “If Congress and YSRCP are secular parties, why haven’t the lives of Muslims in Rayalaseema improved?” If any religion were to face inconvenience, he would be the first person to raise his voice, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kurnool-needs-more-than-a-high-court-says-pawan-kalyan/article30765847.ece

Speaking at the event, Anantapur parliament constituency youth wing president, S. Chandrasekhar alleged that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had done real estate business in the name of developing a capital at Amaravati.

“Earlier, all the big companies were limited to Hyderabad. Due to this, the other regions had lost out on development,” he said, adding that Rayalaseema will see the dawn of development only when the High Court and necessary irrigation projects are brought to the region.

Vijayawada City Congress president V. Gurunadham, addressing the activists, said that Mr. Modi spoke several falsehoods about Nehru. The Congress party condemned Mr. Modi’s statement that Nehru was the reason for the country’s partition, he said.

Nehru was a stalwart who put the country on the path of development by building several irrigation projects that have alleviated the masses of the country from poverty.

As an important leader of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) he was an ambassador of peace in the world. To charge such a great leader with dividing the country was highly disrespectful and unpatriotic. It was totally unbecoming of Mr. Modi to utter such denigrating words about Nehru, Mr. Gurunadham said.

PCC official spokesperson Vimtha Sanjeeva Reddy said that it was not new for Mr. Modi to speak disparagingly about leaders who were no more. Mr. Modi had no interest in either the country or the progress of the country, he said.

100,2020/02/07,British couple on a mission to raise funds,"Alan and Pat Braithwaite from Suffolk in the UK, who are on a 5,600 km Trans-India Challenge, are all smiles during a stopover in the city on Friday. The couple are on a mission to raise funds for the ‘circular economy’ project of the India-based NGO Goonj.

The septuagenarian couple, who embarked on their road trip in their black and yellow Morgan 3-wheeler from Mumbai on February 1, has already covered 1,200 km passing through Pune, Sholapur, Hyderabad, Khammam and Rajamahendravaram before reaching Visakhapatnam. The team is accompanied by a film crew, which is making a full-length feature documentary to be released later this year.

“This is my third trip to India. I was fascinated by the good work being done by Goonj in supporting the rural communities in India through their ‘circular economy’ projects, which collects reusable goods discarded in cities for the benefit of the rural poor. It was my idea to do the Trans-India challenge and raise £200,000 (₹1.8 crore) to support the activities of Goonj and see smiles on the faces of the underprivileged rural masses,” Mr. Alan said.

“The cute new Morgan 3-wheeler is based on the original design of the Morgan, which was rolled out over a century ago in Britain. Every Morgan 3-wheeler is unique and all the components are hand-built and unique. I had done up to 140 km/hr. It costs £40,000 (around ₹36 lakh),” he said.

Apart from raising funds for the charity, Mr. Alan loves coming to India to connect with his roots. His mother was born in Belgaum (Karnataka) and his grandmother was born in Mysore. “On our last trip to India, we located the house in which my mother had lived. We drive for around 300 km a day and we avoid travelling at night. The traffic is insane but once you figure out it is great. Indian drivers are superb,” he said.

On the challenges faced during the trip so far, the couple says: “The roads were good overall. But, the stretch from Khammam to Rajamahendravaram was full of potholes and car exhaust suffered damaged. It was shocking for us to see two-wheeler riders coming close to our car and taking selfies even while riding their bike.”

“We have covered 1,200 km and raised ₹48.93 lakh, so far,” he said.

Peter Brill, team coordinator, said that individuals and organisations wishing to support the challenge can log on to www.transindiachallenge.com and make their contributions.

104,2020/02/07,CID unearths ‘huge’ cash transactions in Amaravati land deals,"Investigation into the allegations of large-scale insider trading in the purchase of vast tracts of land in Amaravati has gathered momentum with the Crime Investigation Department (CID) stumbling upon “fresh evidence” of huge cash transactions in the deals.

The CID, while examining the evidence, found that most of the transactions had been done in cash of more than ₹2 lakh during the years 2018-2019.

In a letter, P.V. Sunil Kumar, Additional Director General of Police, CID, asked the Chief Commissioner of Income-Tax to inquire into the cash transactions and ascertain if the buyers had violated the provisions of the Income-Tax Act and initiate action against them. The CID also submitted a list of suspicious land transactions to the Income-Tax Department as most of the sale deeds had been executed in the Mangalagiri Sub Registrar’s office. In a few transactions, the sale deed value was more than ₹20 lakh.

Assigned lands

The probe into the land scam also included lands that had been assigned to the landless Dalits. The YSRCP government had already cancelled the agreements between the assigned land holders and the buyers, and initiated an investigation into the allegations of purchase of assigned lands at throwaway price after allegedly intimidating the assignees that their lands would be taken away.

The TDP government had issued G.O.s in 2018 awarding returnable plots for assigned lands too. “The buyers violated the I-T Act by not disclosing their source of income before purchasing vast extents in Amaravati, whose market value is huge.

VPT Deputy Chairman P.L. Haranadh told The Hindu that the work to commence annual beach nourishment had been launched on Friday with the DCI deploying a trailing suction hopper dredger.

The VPT had signed annual maintenance dredging and beach nourishment agreement with the DCI for three years from 2019-20 at an estimated cost of ₹39.96 crore. This year, the VPT expects that the DCIL will collect two lakh cubic metres of sand deposited at ‘Sand Trap’ located between Dolphin’s Nose and South Breakwater.

The VPT has been undertaking beach nourishment as part of its social commitment since 1976. The ‘Sand Trap’ has a stretch of over three to four km. If the required sand is not available, the nearby area maybe explored.

Mr. Haranadh said this year they would be nourishing highly vulnerable area near R.K. Beach and INS Kursura Submarine Museum. February is preferred because of ideal wind speed.

He said they were expecting the work to be completed within 20 days. Now Visakhapatnam Port has become a major stake holder in the DCIL. Last year, majority stake in the company was picked up by the VPT and the JNPT, Deendayal and Paradip ports after the Central government cleared the proposal.

The fee reimbursement money had also not been released by the government, he alleged and wanted the funds to be released promptly.

Participating in the State credit seminar, Mr. Jagan said that the state government was expecting cooperation from Nabard in its effort to drive the State on a development path. Nabard had released ₹1,800 crore, which was used for power purchase. The Polavaram project was the heart and lifeline of the State. The government had spent about ₹5,000 crore so far and was paying ₹500 crore as interest on it. The government plans to complete the works by 2021. Another ₹10,000 crore per annum was required for R&R and ₹6,000 crore per annum towards civil works. The funds were not being released in time. The government expected special attention on the project, he said.

“Andhra Pradesh is primarily an agri-based economy as 62% of the people are dependent on agriculture. The State has vast opportunities in agriculture and allied sectors. Andhra Pradesh stands first in aqua and fisheries sectors. The economic slowdown, which the nation is experiencing, is likely to impact the primary sector, which is agriculture. At this juncture, it is necessary to focus on sectors that generate employment, Mr. Jagan said.

Nabard Chief General Manager Selvaraj said, “We will extend our full cooperation for the primary sector in the State.”

Farm credit

Nabard has pegged the State farm credit at ₹1,34,402.52 crore. The projections for agriculture infrastructure have been estimated as ₹4,200 crore. The ancillary activities such as food and agro-processing, loans to cooperative societies etc. are ₹7,698 crore, taking the estimate for total agricultural loans to ₹1,46,301 crore. The MSME working capital and investment capital have been estimated to be ₹42,206 crore. The export credit is ₹2,502 crore and education loans ₹1,329 crore. The projections for renewable energy have been put at ₹506 crore. In all, the priority sector loans will be ₹2,11,865.38 crore, Nabard said in the paper.

117,2020/02/07,Capital: officials told to identify land towards Vizianagaram,"Though the final “go ahead” on making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital of the State is awaited, identification of buildings to house various departments and offices has gained pace.

Top sources in the government say that the Chief Minister will be the first to move to the city, and the Chief Minister’s Office may be housed in the Innovation Tower building in the Rushikonda IT Park. It is learnt that the Chief Minister is keen on starting operations from Vizag by March and the other departments are likely to move in by April.

Though speculation is rife that unoccupied buildings in the Madhurawada Special Economic Zone may be taken over to house the Secretariat and a few departments, sources say officials had been told to identify land near Vizianagaram to build the permanent buildings.

According to a senior officer from the Revenue Department, efforts were on to scout and survey government lands in Viskhapatnam-Vizianagaram border area. The focus is on areas such as Padmanabham, Korukonda and Alamanda.

“There are huge tracts of government and agriculture land in these areas and most importantly they are either barren or not so fertile land and can be developed easily to accommodate the required buildings. The road and rail connectivity is already there, and a little investment can develop the area,” he said.

This area suits the government’s idea of ‘small investment and developing a huge under developed area’, he said. But it is still in the proposal stage, he added.

Buildings

While the buildings that are likely to house the CMO and Secretariat are almost finalised, discussion was still on where will the DGP office be based.

It is learnt that the Greyhounds training centre near Kapuluppada may accommodate the DGP’s office. The area is huge and shrouded from public view and suits the requirement. DGP’s office is the headquarters of the police force, said a senior police officer.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/capital-officials-told-to-identify-land-towards-vizianagaram/article30756434.ece

He told mediapersons at the Secretariat that the South Korean automobile major was happy with the support extended by the Andhra Pradesh government and that it was bound to grow at a faster pace. It has no necessity to relocate to another State, he said.

Mr. Reddy said the State had a favourable investment climate and that several blue chip companies were keen on foraying into the State. “Unfortunately, some vested interests have spread the rumour that KIA was moving out to Tamil Nadu, to defame the government,” he said.

In a press release, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said the report was false and action need to be taken against those circulating the fake news.

He quoted KIA Motors’ national head of sales and marketing Manohar Bhatt as saying that he was shocked to see the news report which came at a time when the KIA plant in Andhra Pradesh was doing extremely well.

‘Very much in State’

Minister for Industries and Commerce Mekapati Goutham Reddy denied the news against KIA Motors and Conduent in Andhra Pradesh.

He commented on Twitter that there was no iota of truth in the report and that KIA was very much with Andhra Pradesh. “Fake news can only make noise for a short time but not shake the confidence and faith people have in the government,” he asserted.

‘Baseless’

Special Chief Secretary (industries and commerce) Rajat Bharat clarified that the news report headlined ‘Kia in talks over moving $1.10 billion India plant out of Andhra Pradesh – sources’ cited unnamed sources.

He termed it as a completely baseless story as Andhra Pradesh had a strong partnership with KIA, which had planned to ramp up its production capacity in the State from 200,000 to 300,000 units per annum by the end of this year or early next year.

The YSRCP also promised that it would do away with one pension per family rule. On one hand, it is not implementing its promises, and on the other, it is also weeding out the names of eligible pensioners,” he alleged.

122,2020/02/07,Vijaya Sai Reddy decries‘injustice’ to State,"Rajya Sabha member and YSRCP leader V. Vijaya Sai Reddy has decried the ‘injustice’ done to Andhra Pradesh by the Centre in the allocation of funds.

Speaking on the motion of thanks to the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Reddy criticised the Centre for failing to grant Special Category Status (SCS) to AP and injustice in the release of funds for the promised special financial package to the backward districts in AP, release of funds for the Polavaram project, Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), and for the new railway zone.

He said that the lack of mention about the AP Re-organisation Act and the implementation of assurances given under it, in the President’s speech, has thrown cold water on the aspirations of the people of AP. The Centre should consider the financial position of States like AP and sanction funds.

The President mentioned that prestigious institutions like IITs would be set up in Jammu and Kashmir on the fast track mode. While welcoming it, Mr. Reddy said that though an IIM was established in Visakhapatnam three years ago, it was still running from a temporary campus. The AP Re-organisation Act would be meaningless without granting SCS as promised, he pointed out.

The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) national general secretary said it was unfortunate that Union Ministers were making misleading statements, both within and outside Parliament, trying to pass the buck on the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions saying they were against the granting of SCS. On the contrary, at the time of the framing of guidelines for the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions, the issue of SCS was not brought under their purview. The 15th Finance Commission had even clarified that the Centre alone was competent to take a decision on SCS.

Plea to PM

Dr. Fleming told The Hindu that he had received a written communication from the hotel management about the drill, but it began 30 minutes ahead of the schedule, taking him by surprise.

“I was checking out at the reception when I heard a blast and saw armed security men storming into the hotel. I am trained for such eventualities as I had worked earlier in Afghanistan and Iraq. As per Standard Operating Procedure, I ducked behind the counter and sprawled on the ground. But to my surprise, I found the hotel staff laughing at me,” said Dr. Fleming.

‘Communication lapse’

He said the hotel staff should have properly communicated to the guests that there would be a mock drill. “The hotel staff should also follow the SOP prescribed for the anti-terror drill and support the guests, instead of laughing at them. The hotel management should train its staff to communicate such important matters to the guests in a more effective way. Not only me, there were many who suffered due to this ill-timed operation. It would have been a disaster for a person with a fainter heart,” he said.

The British Deputy High Commissioner took to Twitter to express his displeasure.

“Not only did the said activity happen at 09:26; the note gave no mention of explosions, men with guns and all else I witnessed. Very poor,” he posted on the microblogging platform.

Dr. Fleming further said mock drills are conducted in embassies every week. “People should be informed specifically that it is a mock drill and explosives and guns will be used. The hotel staff was clueless about the drill. I have lodged a complaint with the management,” he said.

The anti-terror drill was organised by the Navy personnel, Coastal Security Police and Octopus, the anti-terror outfit of Andhra Pradesh, ahead of the international naval meet Milan-2020.

Last year, the British High Commission focussed on trafficking of tribal girls from Visakhapatnam Agency and empowerment of Dalits in the Godavari districts.

Dr. Fleming, who visited AP MedTech Zone, said he was impressed by the facilities offered there. “The zone has the potential to become a major drug testing centre. We have plans to collaborate for the upcoming Nutrify India Summit, which will be held some time in June this year,” he said.

He also appreciated the State Government’s move to make English medium of instruction mandatory in government schools. “In the last three years, the collaboration between India and Britain in the education sector has risen to almost 97% under various heads and this move by the State Government is a welcome sign for more collaborative efforts. The British Council is already engaging in a dialogue with the State Government for a collaborative project under this initiative,” said Dr. Fleming.

Research projects

According to him, the British High Commission has funded an amount of 10 million pounds in various research projects at universities and institutions of higher education in A.P. and Telangana. Across India, the funding has touched 320 million pounds during the last 11 years. “Collaborative research is another area where we intend to focus upon,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/britain-to-focus-on-financial-services-energy-in-andhra-pradesh/article30755767.ece
130,2020/02/07,Investment flow good in State: Buggana,"Making it clear that the government did not give up its demand for Special Category Status (SCS), Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy stated on Thursday that investments amounting to ₹32,000 crore were made in the State till October 2019 as per the Industrial Entrepreneurs’ Memorandum filed with the government. It was over and above the committed investments of ₹15,953 crore, he said.

But in 2018, only ₹9,500 crore investments came to the State against ₹19,800 crore for which MoUs had been signed. Investments made in 2017 stood at ₹4,500 crore.

The YSRCP government allotted 1,057 acres to 1,252 companies through the A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC), Mr. Rajendranath Reddy told the media at the Secretariat.

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said some big companies such as POSCO, Grasim Industries, Starchem Technologies, ATC Tyres, and Hyundai Steels were in negotiations with the government for setting up their units.

This proved that the government was sincere in attracting investments and creating the required infrastructure without creating much hype.

‘Burden of arrears’

Industrial incentives to the tune of ₹3,500 crore were not paid in the last five years, he said, and alleged that tenders worth ₹1 lakh crore were called for various works without even having the Detailed Project Report.

Besides, payments were not made towards bills amounting to ₹40,000 crore. These lacunae made the present government’s job difficult, but it was clearing the hurdles one by one, he said.

The Discoms and the Civil Supplies Corporation had debts exceeding ₹20,000 crore.

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said that A.P. had the flexibility to borrow ₹38,000 crore, subject to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) rules.

Finance panel

He observed that A.P. would be getting less funds from the 15th Finance Commission because it could not fulfil the norms on population and poverty.

The devolution of funds to Karnataka and Kerala was also going to be lower for identical reasons, he added.

In spite of various constraints, the government could reduce its debt burden from ₹40,000 crore to ₹20,000 crore, the Minister added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/investment-flow-good-in-state-buggana/article30755706.ece
131,2020/02/07,Coronavirus: State heightens surveillance,"Special Chief Secretary (health, medical and family welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy stated on Thursday that 54 travellers from the novel Coronavirus- affected countries had been identified so far and placed under surveillance.

Of them, 53 were under home isolation and one had completed the 28 days observation period without any symptoms.

“Samples have been collected from five persons and sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, and the results are awaited,” Mr. Jawahar Reddy said in a media bulletin.

Mr. Jawahar Reddy said that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic, which affected 23 countries, as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

In that context, Andhra Pradesh strengthened its surveillance and control measures against the disease, he said.

“A 24x7 State-level control room has been opened. Isolation wards have been being set up at all the government general hospitals and district hospitals,” he said.

Health advisory

Mr. Jawahar Reddy advised people to adhere to the health advisories issued by the State government.

“People are expected to cover their nose and mouth using a handkerchief / towel while sneezing and coughing and wash their hands frequently with soap and water,” Mr. Jawahar Reddy said.

Those who came from the affected countries should remain under strict home isolation for 28 days from the date of arrival in India, irrespective of whether they had symptoms or not.

“They are also advised against having close contact with other family members, allowing visitors and going out to public places,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-state-heightens-surveillance/article30755684.ece
132,2020/02/07,Karnataka HC to examine if Minister has power to stay GO issued in Governor’s name,"The High Court of Karnataka on Friday said it would examine whether the law empowered a Minister to stay a Government Order (GO) issued in the name of the Governor under Article 166 of the Constitution, instead of issuing another GO to stay the earlier one.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order while hearing a PIL petition questioning the legality of the August 3, 2019 direction of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to the Additional Chief Secretary. It asked the officer not to issue job code or call for tender until further orders on the works sanctioned in a GO issued on February 1, 2019 in connection with over 1,000 major development projects under the CM’s Nava Bengaluru scheme.

As the Additional Advocate General (AAG) contended that a Minister in charge of a department had the power to issue directions under Rule 6 of the Karnataka Transaction of Business Rules, 1977, the Bench asked whether exercising powers under these rule, a Cabinet Minister could interfere with a GO, issued after the Cabinet’s approval.

‘Works stalled’

The petitioners — Dasarahalli-Rachenahalli Lake Improvement and Conservation Trust and Jal Samriddhi Lake Improvement and Conservation Trust, Bengaluru — had complained that development works, including works of lake rejuvenation, which were sanctioned by the previous government had been stalled because of the “illegal” intervention of the Chief Minister.

As the AAG raised the locus standi of the petitioners while contending that they appeared to be canvassing for bidders, and the counsel for the petitioners said they had no problem if the court treated the petition as suo motu. The Bench said it would keep open the question of locus standi.

It was also contended by the AAG that the Chief Minister had to interfere for temporarily keeping the tenders on hold, as there were discrepancies in budgetary allocation and the number of projects approved earlier.

Asking the government to file its statements of objection, the Bench adjourned further hearing on the matter till March 16.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-hc-to-examine-if-minister-has-power-to-stay-go-issued-in-governors-name/article30765856.ece

Announcing this on Friday, Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh said preference would be given to wet lands that have standing crops. The authority was requested to release water to take up farming activities, subsequent to the demands from farmers. It has given its consent to the release of water, Mr. Venkatesh said.

At present, a variety of crops have been sown on around 12,000 hectares of land, and measures will be taken to ensure they get water, the DC said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cauvery-authority-nod-for-wetting-60000-hectares-in-mandya-district/article30765846.ece
134,2020/02/07,"Farmers in district should avail crop loan, says DC","Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha, on Friday, said that the district administration and the Lead District Bank have directed all banks in Udupi district to provide crop loans to farmers as a large number have not availed it.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Jagadeesha said the Union government had launched PM-KISAN scheme with a view to provide income support to small and marginal landholding farmer families having cultivable lands.

The scheme aimed to supplement the financial needs of farmers in procuring inputs, ensuring crop health, and appropriate yields commensurate, with the anticipated farm income. Under the scheme, an income support of ₹6,000 per year was provided to families across the country in three equal instalments.

On analysis of PM-KISAN and Kisan Credit Card (KCC) data, the Union government had observed that nearly 9.22 crore farmer families had been registered in PM-KISAN, whereas the total number of live and operative KCCs in the country are 6.76 crore.

The Union government had concluded that the 2.47 crore PM-KISAN beneficiaries did not have KCCs although they may be eligible for crop loans.

To bring these farmers under KCC quickly, a campaign will be launched from February 8 to 24, so that one crore new KCCs are issued by the banks.

In Udupi district, the number of farmers enrolled under PM-KISAN were 1,34,217, whereas the number of crop loans (KCC) financed by banks (nationalised banks, grameen banks, District Central Co-operative banks, and private banks) were just 30,940, which indicated that 1,03,277 farmers had not availed crop loan.

Farmers who had not availed the loan till date could approach their respective bank branches to get the facility. All bank branches in Udupi district had been directed to extend their support to farming community by the way of loan (KCC) to eligible farmers as per extant guidelines, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

135,2020/02/07,Drive to bring more farmers under Kisan Credit Card scheme,"The district administration and the district lead bank will launch a drive to bring more farmers under the Kisan Credit Card scheme so as to benefit them. In all, 2.16 lakh farmers have taken the credit cards as on date and nearly 2 lakh farmers who are enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi have to be brought under it. The enrolment drive will be conducted by all the 547 branches of various banks in the district.

Additional DC Poornima and lead bank manager Venkatachalapathy told mediapersons here on Friday that there was an outlay of nearly ₹285 crore during the current financial year (2019-20) and the land-holding farmers are eligible for a crop loan of upto ₹3 lakh that could be periodically withdrawn by the beneficiaries as per their requirements. “This helps reduce the interest burden as the charges will be only to the extent of money withdrawn and not sanctioned’’, said bank officials. The revised scheme helps farmers secure hassle-free short-term credit and is flexible with simplified procedures.

As per the revised norms of the Kisan Credit Card scheme, the funds can also be utilised for post-harvest expenses, consumption requirements of households, working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture, investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities.

136,2020/02/07,Funding for rail route electrification enhanced,"As part of phasing out diesel and going fully electric within the next few years, the Centre has increased funding for electrification of rail routes, and significant allocation has been made to the Mysuru division of South Western Railway.

Accordingly the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar and Mysuru-Hassan section is also set to be electrified.

The electrification from Hassan will be extended to Mangaluru and the Hassan-Arsikere section will also be electrified. An SWR release said the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar section has received ₹20 crore and Mysuru-Hassan-Mangaluru and Hassan-Arsikere lines, ₹60 crore.

The Chikkabanavara-Hassan section has received ₹30 crore while electrification of Kadur-Chikkamagaluru section has been allotted ₹25 crore. In addition, remodelling of Hassan yard will be taken up to facilitate dealing of trains from Bengaluru to Mangaluru directly without engine reversal.

Mysuru-Kushalnagar line

There is a provision of ₹1 crore for conducting the final location survey for the Mysuru (Belagola-Kushalnagar) railway line project which has run into rough weather with the environmentalists and people of Kodagu opposing it. The final location survey includes preparing the final alignment and sites of railway stations demarcated and is an indication that the project till Kushalnagar is on.

The railway line will branch off from Belagola to link Kushalnagar and the route length is 87.20 km. The towns to be linked include Yelwala, Bilikere, Uddur, Hunsur, Satyagola, Periyapatna and Doddahonnur and the cost per km of laying the track is ₹21.27 crore.

However, there is no reference to the alternative line from Hejjala to Chamarajanagar via Malavalli and Kollegal, a route which was approved in 1996, and continues to be in limbo.

This was originally part of a project connecting Bengaluru with Satyamangalam via Chamarajanagar but the last stretch – Chamarajanagar-Satyamangalam – was scrapped in view of environmental issues and the landscape being a prime wildlife habitat.

The remaining stretch was proposed to provide rail connectivity to a vast swathe of Mandya and Chamarajanagar districts by linking Malavalli and Kollegal with Bengaluru via Hejjala. This was supposed to give a fillip to the agrarian economy of the Malavalli-Kollegal belt by creating a direct linkage to the markets in Bengaluru.

At present passengers from Chamarajanagar to Bengaluru have to travel via Mysuru and the distance is almost 200 km.

But the alternative line will reduce it to about 142 km and hence provide direct connectivity to the State capital.

The estimated cost as on February 2018 was ₹1382.78 crore with 50 per cent of the cost to be shared by the State government which was also supposed to expedite the land acquisition process. But there is hardly any reference to the railway line in the pink book, the official railway document cataloguing all approved works.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nc9lc2/article30765186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MYSTRACK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/funding-for-rail-route-electrification-enhanced/article30765187.ece

The traditional belief is that Lord Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy’s idol was buried under an anthill in Melkote and the social reformer retrieved it in 1017 after arriving from Tamil Nadu.

The rituals started at 5.30 a.m. with the Vangeepuram family (of priests) offering a variety of fruits, dry fruits and flowers to perform the rituals. Later, Sri Ramanujacharya’s idol was taken around the temple in a procession of ‘Pushpa Pallaki’ (palanquin of flowers) and through the main streets of Melkote.

The electricity bulbs and surveillance cameras there were found to be damaged and a few sandalwood logs stored there were missing. Police visited the spot with a team of forensic experts and a sniffer dog squad.

Police initially suspected the involvement of Nagaraj in the crime as he was not found on the spot and his mobile phone was switched off. His body was later found near the bus shelter in Nedaravalli on the outskirts of Sagar town.

Police suspect that Nagaraj had tried to resist the burglars by raising an alarm, and they might have murdered him. While fleeing from the spot, they might have thrown his body near Nedaravalli.

142,2020/02/07,MMCRI’s hi-tech lab fights viral epidemics,"Not many are aware that a most advanced diagnostic laboratory for uncovering viral infections is located in a State-run hospital in Mysuru which does most tests required in the fight against viral epidemics. This is one among six hi-tech labs set up in the State under the Central grants for strengthening viral diagnosis.

Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at the Department of Microbiology on the premises of K.R. Hospital, the teaching hospital of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI), which became functional three years ago, comes into focus whenever there are viral outbreaks. It is the sole authority for despatching samples for the tests of newer viruses to the national labs and research centres such as National Institute of Virology (NIP), Pune.

The NIV in Pune is currently handling the analysis of samples of suspected cases of 2019 nCoV.

VRDL is a part of a network of such labs established across the country by the Department of Health Research, Government of India. The rise in the number of viral outbreaks and the resultant mortality from them had been cited as key reasons for the launch of network of such hi-tech labs.

The National Institute of Virology, Pune and the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi will be the top laboratories for the network while the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai will be supervising the data generated by the network of labs.

The VRDL, Mysuru had been established at a cost of ₹1.3 crore and all viral diagnostic tests are done under one roof. Samples from neighbouring districts are also sent to the lab and the tests are done for free.

VRDL here has so far not received any sample of suspected cases of nCoV from the region.

Other than the diagnostic services – serological and molecular tests, the VRDL also does research with scientists in the area carrying out the research and analysis.

VRDL Mysuru does around 80 per cent of tests related to viral infections. Since it’s a novel virus, it has not taken up venture testing of nCoV and routing such samples to NIV, Pune or the State-level lab in Bengaluru, according to the specialists handling the lab.

MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj told The Hindu that the VRDL was fully equipped for carrying out the tests on viral infections. It’s one of the advanced diagnostic labs under the government network and its services are available for fighting the epidemics.

K.R. Hospital, where the lab is located, has an nCoV isolation ward whose doctors and nursing staff had been trained for handling the cases. Necessary gear and masks had been given to the staff for dealing with the patients. So far, no suspected cases have come to the hospital for treatment, Dr. Nanjaraj added.

The Microbiology Department is headed by Anuradha K. and Amrutha Kumari B. is the nodal officer for the VRDL here. The lab can be approached for tests by the individuals and the tests are done for free if they come under the purview of the lab.

VRDL handles several thousands of samples in a year and private hospitals had banked on it for tests in cases of influenza. The duration of tests depends on the cases.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ne4dmm/article30765021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MYSVRDL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mmcris-hi-tech-lab-fights-viral-epidemics/article30765022.ece
143,2020/02/07,Portfolio allocation a delicate dance for Yediyurappa,"With the ministerial expansion behind him, but dissatisfaction over regional and caste imbalances in the Cabinet brewing in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is now finding it difficult to placate all his Cabinet colleagues as he has to allocate portfolios.

While the newly inducted Ministers have been lobbying hard for key portfolios, including those already allotted to others, those Ministers are unwilling to give up key portfolios, creating a new fault line, sources in the party said. The Chief Minister had, on Thursday, said that he would allocate portfolios by Saturday. However, the exercise may take a few more days, as he is still seeing intense lobbying. He has said that he would consult the party high command on portfolio allocation.

For instance, B.C. Patil, a former police officer, has demanded that he be given the Home portfolio, which is presently with Basavaraj Bommai. According to sources, Mr. Bommai is willing to give up that portfolio if he is allotted Water Resources. However, Ramesh Jarkiholi has been adamant that he be assigned the Water Resources portfolio that his political foe D.K. Shivakumar had held during the rule of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government. He has also demanded that he be assigned the same room in the Vidhana Soudha and the government bungalow Mr. Shivakumar held, sources said.

Charge of districts

Another tricky issue is assigning districts to Ministers, especially Belagavi which has been a political tinderbox for long. Though Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi is from the district, the in-charge Minister is Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, who is from Dharwad. With Umesh Katti already losing out, it is unlikely that Mr. Jarkiholi will be given charge of Belagavi even though he has been strongly pitching for it.

B.A. Basavaraja, K. Gopalaiah and S.T. Somashekhar have openly demanded that they be assigned the Urban Development or Bengaluru Development portfolios. Revenue Minister R. Ashok has also expressed an interest in holding the latter, according to sources. However, sources said the Chief Minister, who holds the ministry now, will retain it. Mr. Somashekhar is likely to be given the Cooperation Department as he has been active in the sector for over two decades. K. Sudhakar is believed to be keen on the Higher Education and Medical Education departments, presently held by Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan.

Mr. Patil, who is also an actor and producer, has expressed an interest in the Kannada and Culture Department as well, which is held by C.T. Ravi. However, the the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is said to be keen that an RSS man holds that portfolio.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/portfolio-allocation-a-delicate-dance-for-yediyurappa/article30764876.ece
144,2020/02/07,BSNL: Connecting people with skeleton staff,"At a BSNL telephone exchange in Bengaluru South, a junior engineer (JE), who survived the recent exodus through Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), is the lone person sitting amongst empty chairs and tables in a big room, which was abuzz with activity just a week ago. As VRS took away 14 of the 18 working staff, the JE has his hands full now.

The bigger challenge for the JE is coping up with his new work profile. For most of his 29-year career, earlier in the Department of Telecom and subsequently with BSNL, he had worked on the technical front. Now, he is juggling between attending to customer complaints and trying to understand administrative work. On the other hand, many telecom technicians working on contract have left over salaries left pending for eight months. Those who have replaced them are yet to be trained.

Work pressure

The work pressure on the employees is immense after about 6,000 BSNL workers in the State ended their careers on January 31. They were part of the national VRS exodus in which about 78,000 employees exited the telecom PSU. The staff strength of BSNL Karnataka Circle is down from 10,117 to 3,936. The number of contract workers had dwindled from 5,779 in July 2018 to 3,439 by October 2019, and it has only gone down further now.

For example, at a large exchange in Bengaluru South, 72 out of 78 technical staff members opted for VRS. In several exchanges with nearly 10,000 lines, there are two technical workers left to attend to service calls, which will be managed through people hired on contract.

Earlier, the work was divided into cabling, outdoor (for line faults, new lines, and shifting lines), and indoor (switchroom work and others) divisions. Now, the surviving employees have been asked to manage all the work by themselves. “But complaints are being addressed,” a technical staff member in Bengaluru West said. However, he wondered whether he could take leave at all in the present situation.

The VRS frenzy was such that BSNL received enquiries about its future from large public sector enterprises, including banks in the city, and senior officials had to allay fears of a service breakdown. “Most BSNL customers are long-standing and loyal. Large business houses have continued with us,” a senior official said.

Meanwhile, about 70% of the customer service centres have been outsourced to franchisees. At one such centre, only new SIM activation, top-up/recharge services, and bill payment for landline connections are offered. “For new connection, Broadband, FTTH (fibre-to-the-home) and other services, we are yet to be trained because we have come in new,” a woman at the help desk said. “Customers will not have issues as bill payment can be done at post offices and Bengaluru One and Karnataka One centres. It may take a fortnight or so for things to settle down,” a source said.

According to an office-bearer of the Bengaluru Circle BSNL Employees’ Union, with this kind of staff strength there is also a fear of exchanges being shut down. “If BSNL’s losses are connected to employees, whose numbers have now been brought down, why is it that private telecom players who have a lean staff strength are also saddled with losses?” he asked. “Unfortunately, when BSNL was doing well in the early years after starting mobile services, equipment was delayed. When the equipment arrived after 2010, employee numbers declined; both of this affected service quality. Now, with 4G being rolled out in the next few months, we do not have the staff to provide services,” he said.

‘Measures in place’

Amid jitters, senior officials said that several measures were initiated in time, including identifying critical activities, remapping of employee postings, and putting a contingency plan in place. “Work profiles have changed and pressure also has increased. But there is no other way. Services have not deteriorated,” he said. Meanwhile, owing to fund crunch, across Karnataka BSNL has not paid power bills, but has received backing from the State government to clear its dues after its financial position improves.

“The telecom sector is capital-intensive and we are hoping that the government will lends a helping hand to ensure that the PSU that connects the country survives,” said an officer optimistically.

145,2020/02/07,"Mayor, Deputy Mayor inspect Devaraja Market, favour demolition","The fate of the nearly 130-year-old Devaraja Market in Mysuru seems to have been sealed with Mayor Tasneem stating that the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) would submit a report to the government favouring its demolition.

This followed an inspection on Friday and the call has been taken following the views of various expert committees that were constituted to study the structural stability of the market.

The Mayor said she would send the report to the government on Monday and this is expected to pave way for its demolition and reconstruction. But the MCC report to the government will be placed before the High Court where a case is pending before it.

The court had directed the MCC to constitute a committee and submit a report regarding the feasibility of conserving the structure. But the committee, which did not give adequate representation to heritage experts and conservationists but appointed civil engineers, veered towards the view that the structure could be conserved only if it were to be showcased as a monument and not as a live market with footfalls of thousands of people.

Deputy Mayor Sridhar, who was part of the team that conducted a spot inspection, said that there was no alternative but to demolish the structure and construct a new one. “The structure is dilapidated and not in a position to withstand the load any more and any fresh conservation effort will not last long. It will be a perennial financial burden on the MCC to keep repairing it and it has to be demolished keeping in view the safety of the public.’’ The MCC Council has already passed a resolution in favour of demolition and even the expert committee report was in favour of reconstruction, he added.

The Heritage Committee which was opposed to the demolition has averred that the structure could be conserved to last a few more decades but their members expressed ire that the elected representatives were riding roughshod over their views. N.S.Rangaraju, a member of the committee, said there are examples of much older structures in the world that have been conserved. The city was losing its heritage block by block due to lack of financial and political support, he added.

There are nearly 700 plus shops in the Devaraja Market and the tenants have to be taken into confidence before any action could be initiated. “We will convene a meeting of all the stakeholders of Devaraja Market and take them into confidence’’, said Mr. Sridhar.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mayor-deputy-mayor-inspect-devaraja-market-favour-demolition/article30764140.ece

Ms. Sunanda said prisoners engaged in skilled work would get remission and also earn their daily wages. Inculcating work culture in them would help prevent idleness and indiscipline, she said.

She said many inmates were so talented that they did not even need any directions to make the products.

150,2020/02/07,Sammelana turns out to be visual spectacle too,"The Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, apart from a literary treat, has also turned out to be a visual spectacle as well.

The backdrops in the colours of the Kannada flag blended the local folk arts of Kalaburagi region.

A team of artisans, led by Harsha Cava, worked for weeks to create the stage and the various flags and images put up across the Gulbarga university grounds that hosted the sammelana.

It included the front door of a village home, carved in wood, with horse figurines at the top. It was created by award-winning sculptor Manayya Badiger.

Lines from Kavi Raja Marga, the ninth-century Kannada classic, were etched on top to highlight the pluralism and the harmony of Kalaburagi region. Written in the modern Kananda script, it said: “Religion and ideology that others follow can prove as valuable as gold, if we accept them”.

Kannada flags were hung inside the fibre tents put up for the main venue, and the book stall. Statues, mannequins, and busts were set up all around the venue. They became favourite selfie spots for the youngsters thronging the sammelana.

There was a large plaster of Paris statue of Anna Basavanna at the entrance.

There were mannequins of Yakshagana characters and Jnanpith Award-winning Kannada writers.

Enterprising artists put up painting kiosks at some locations. They finished pencil sketches and silhouettes within 10-15 minutes for participants.

151,2020/02/07,Film-maker stresses on need to improve quality of movies,"S.V. Rajendra Singh, film-maker and producer, spoke on the need to improve the quality of movies and was critical of the films produced and directed in recent times.

Delivering a lecture on ‘Challenges before the Kannada Films’ at the 85th Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelana on Friday, Mr. Rajendra Singh called upon producers and directors to develop the habit of reading books to improve their language as well as the content of the story.

Mr. Rajendra Singh alleged that officers are receiving bribes for selecting films for subsidy.

“Thus, quality films are being deprived of subsidy and films without any content are getting the government benefits.”

He said that people with no background were entering into the production of films and investing in them, without having a basic knowledge of the industry, just to make money.

He said that even non-starrer movies with good subjects can help revive the Kannada film industry and get back the lost audience.

Mr. Rajendra Singh also urged the State government to establish a film city at Mysuru.

Television personality and critic B. Suresh said that recent small-screen programmes were ruining core human values and breaking up society.

Speaking on ‘Television and Social Responsibilities’, Mr. Suresh said that the television programmes were entertainment based instead of being informative and educational.

He said that the small-screen serials have the capacity to reach more people.

“Though the medium has both negative and positive aspects, the negative things are outgrowing the positive contents. In fact, some of the television shows are sowing the seeds of poison,” he said.

Of the 60 serials telecasting on different Kannada channels, very few of them focus on good themes, Mr. Suresh said and recalled the industry of the 90s saying those programmes were more progressive.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/film-maker-stresses-on-need-to-improve-quality-of-movies/article30763469.ece
152,2020/02/07,"Poets speak out against CAA, caste discrimination","Poets at the 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana expressed the current zeitgeist of India, in Kalaburagi on Friday.

They expressed their angst against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the ills of globalisation, and the discriminatory caste system.

Writer and activist Vithappa Gorantli stated at the beginning that he had come to the sammelana only to protest against the State’s decision to register a FIR against poet Siraj Bisralli who read a poem against the NRC and the CAA in Koppal.

He read out a poem ‘The calamity called 2020’. He urged the youth to protest against injustice and State oppression.

Poet Gavisiddappa Patil read out Nanu Ninage Namo Ennuvidilla

(I will not call you Namo). He listed the unfulfilled promises by the BJP government and said that while others would praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he would not do so.

“You did not protect the poor and the deprived. You did not bring back black money, nor did you release enough funds for Karnataka. You kept on lying and misled people. Other people may sing your praises, but I will not,” he said, reminding the audience of Urdu poet Habib Jalib’s lines, Koi Mane Magar, Main Nahi Manta.

His poem was met largely with a loud applause from the people, though some tried to shout him down.

Writer Basavaraj Sabarad, who chaired the session, spoke out against the State government.

“Poets are the real voices of the people. They are common people who want to share their feelings with others. They should not be punished. They should be set free to express voices of dissent,” he said.

Prof. Sabarad recited the poem of a Pakistani poet who spoke against the silence of the poet in troubling times.

He showed a book Ninna Dakhale Yavaga Torisuttee that contained the poem that was the cause of the FIR. “The police have targeted poet and journalist Siraj Bisralli and another journalist Raja Baksh and lodged a FIR against them only because they are Muslims,” he alleged.

“This is unacceptable. If I don’t speak out against this, I become a fascist. I will stand with the oppressor and not the oppressed. If this attitude continues, all the poets of the State will start a jail bharo agitation,” Prof. Sabarad said.

Dalit writer Rajashekar Mang spoke against untouchability and caste oppression.

“You are all busy in sweeping the streets in the name of Swachh Bharat. But who will clean our minds that that are full of hate?”

He spoke of the daily struggles of the untouchables who are discriminated against in all walks of life.

“We are the aboriginal inhabitants of this country, but you are trying to push us out. My mother served you all her life, but you looked down upon her, branding her a Devdasi. You need us to skin oxen and make slippers, but you value the animal more than us,” he said.

153,2020/02/07,Hotels seek extension of timings,"The Hotel Owners’ Association in the city has urged the authorities to permit members to operate their establishments till 11.30 p.m. daily.

The association members submitted a memorandum to the Commissioner of Police recently and said that the hotels and restaurants in the city are entirely dependent on tourist inflow for revenue generation.

They said a majority of the tourists who visit the places of interest around Mysuru tend to return to the city only late in the night but find that hotels and restaurants are closed. There is also an increase in train and bus traffic to the city from other centres as a result of which the tourist and travellers’ arrival to the city does not abate even at midnight.

Hence the association members appealed to the police that a rule stipulating the closure of hotels at 10.30 p.m. should be relaxed to allow the hotels to function at least 11.30 p.m. Many of the tourists who reach the city late walk in at 10.30 p.m. and they are now being turned away due to the prevailing rules and this was not only affecting the tourists but creating an impression that the city was not tourist-friendly when it comes to eateries.

Drawing attention to a new circular issued by the Department of Labour, Government of Karnataka, the Association said it has permitted any organisation with 10 or more members to function round the clock. C. Narayana Gowda, president of the Association, said bars and liquor outlets are permitted to remain open till 11.30 p.m. and hence the same rule should apply for hotels and restaurants.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hotels-seek-extension-of-timings/article30763283.ece

155,2020/02/07,Filmmaker hits out at Kannada Sahitya Parishat leadership,"Dissent voices continued to pinch the government and the central executive committee of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) on the third and concluding day of 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan here on Friday.

Filmmaker B. Suresh, before beginning his actual speech on social responsibility of television media in a session on cinema and Kannada literature, raised the issue of the recently held Chikkamagalur District Sahitya Sammelana which right-wing forces had attempted to disrupt condemning the selection of Kalkuli Vittal Hegde, an environmental activist and writer, as its president.

“A few people attempted to disrupt the Chikkamagalur District Sahitya Sammelana. They threatened to attack the Sammelana premises with petrol bombs and police used it as a pretext to force the organisers to cut short the two-day event to one day. Those who threatened to attack with petrol bombs are the real terrorists. Police did not arrest them. The central executive committee of Kannada Sahitya Parishat did not extend its support and cooperation to its district unit. It did not release the funds for organising the event. It is wrong on the part of the central committee of KSP to deny the funds to its district unit for organising the literary fest,” he said.

As he finished his speech, Manu Baligar, president of KSP, emerged behind the podium to respond to Mr. Suresh.

“Many people are targeting me over what happened in Chikkamagaluru district Sahitya Sammelan. I have never interfered in the affairs of district units of KSP. I have never asked the Chikkamagaluru district unit of KSP to change the president of district Sahitya Sammelana. It is true that I had asked them to postpone the event for 2-3 months considering the threats and frictions over the selection of the president for the literary fest. They defy me and went ahead to hold the event,” he said.

Mr. Baligar justified the non-release of funds to the Chikkamagaluru literary fest by stating that he would be accountable to each and every rupee received from the government and the public. He also accepted that Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi had asked him to deny funds to the Chikkamagaluru event.

“Though we are an autonomous body, we cannot spend public money at will. We will have to be accountable each and every rupee received from the government and people. It is true that Mr. Ravi had asked me not to release the funds for Chikkamagaluru district Sahitya Sammelana. But, I disagreed with him. If the district units of KSP hold programmes in a proper way, releasing money is a matter of just five minutes for me,” he said.

But I have not asked the Chikkamagaluru unit to change the president. I was also not acting on the directions of Minister C.T. Ravi. Our financial transactions are audited and we need to be answerable to the public. We are not financially autonomous. We don’t want to waste resources on a Sammelana that could be disrupted.”

Mr. Baligar also said “Minister Ravi gave me no letter about not releasing money. Neither have I said we will not give money to the Sringeri Sammelana.

The publicity campaign through “rath yatra” will be flagged off from the Mookambika temple in Kollur in Udupi district from February 13.

The mass marriage programme “Saptapadi”, would be held in 100 major temples of the Muzrai Department the. The second phase would be held on May 24, 2020, Minister for Ports and Fisheries and Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary said on Friday.

The Information and Publicity Department has been roped in for providing publicity to the programme and it was decided to install 750 publicity boards across the State.

The district administration, district in-charge ministers, MLAs/MLCs and local level officials have made elaborate arrangements for the successful conduct of the marriages.

There would be no discrimination against APL and BPL families for mass marriages, Mr. Poojary said. The groom would be given a garland, a panche, a shirt and a shawl and ₹5,000 in cash. The bride would be given a garland, a sari and other items and ₹1,000 in cash. Also, the bride would be given ₹40,000 for a gold ‘thali’ and ‘gundu’ of eight grams, he added.

The Muzrai Department has also roped in Social Welfare and Revenue departments to ensure more benefits to the couples. Under the Social Welfare Department scheme, a sum of ₹50,000 cash would be given to each SC/ST couple while under the Revenue department ₹10,000 would be given.

The Revenue Department had not utilised ₹2 crore allocated under the Adharsha Vivaha programme and the fund would be used for giving ₹10,000 to each couple during the marriage, Mr. Poojary said.

The last date for registration of prospective grooms and brides is April 1, 2020. The list of names of grooms and brides who enrol for the mass marriages would be published in the temples. The last date for filing objections to this list is April 6, 2020.

Only those persons marrying for the first time could tie the knot at the mass marriages. Those intending to get married should submit proper government documents. The Registrar of Marriages would register the marriages at these temples.

Talking about a wide spectrum of people taking part in anti-CAA protests, Dr. Poornima said, “It is amazing to see thousands of women actively participating in the agitations. The fact that Bengaluru alone has seen 82 agitations in just 30 days speaks volumes about the rise in people’s consciousness. The source of this unprecedented challenge is the aspiration for equality enshrined in their minds,” she added.

Shivaganga Rumma, Kannada professor, Central University of Karnataka, also raised the issue of the sedition case slammed on Shaheen School for staging an allegedly controversial play and the breach of peace case against Koppal-based journalist-poet Siraj Bisaralli for reciting an anti-CAA poem at an event. Former Minister and writer B.T. Lalita Naik, who presided over the session, too opposed CAA and NRC by stating that the measures were meant to divide the communities.

At another session, writer and activist R.K. Hudgi demanded the resignation of Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Manu Baligar for failing to prevent interference of the State government in the affairs of the autonomous institution, when Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi tried to change the president of the Chikkamagaluru Sahitya Sammelana in Sringeri. “Mr. Ravi stopped the funding for the sammelan, but Mr. Baligar did not object to this,” he pointed out.

162,2020/02/07,‘Tatvapadas neglected in Kannada literature’,"Kannada writer Mallikarjun Kadikol, who spoke on tatvapadas at the 85th Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelan at the Mahatma Gandhi Auditorium, Gulbarga University campus, here on Thursday, expressed displeasure that such a rich contribution as tatvapadas has been neglected from the mainstream Kannada literature and Kannada hermeneutics.

He said that tatvapadas are not merely mystical songs or poems. They are a living tradition practised throughout the State, irrespective of caste and creed. Tatvapadas did not encourage any discrimination against people but represented true democracy, avoiding much significance to blind faith and motifs. Tatvapadakars tried to speak about universal human values, he said.

Mr. Kadikol said that though tatvapadas were not in the form of documentation, they were passed on orally and tatvapadakars were very cautious about preserving the main philosophy behind the tatvapadas.

Devendra Heggade, who spoke on the “Origin of Buddhism and its Literature”, said that the earliest Buddhist texts were found in middle Indo-Aryan languages called Prakrits. Buddhism gave the greatest blow to Brahmanism in the Sixth Century, he said.

Mr. Heggade divided Buddhism into the Golden Era, the Dark Age, the Revival and the Rejuvenation period.

The teachings of Buddhism spread far and wide like fire as it provided relief to society overburdened with Brahminical rites and rituals.

The factors that worked for the spread of Buddhism was Buddha’s ideal life, shortcomings of the Vedic religion, the use of Pali language, and the royal patronage extended by rulers such as Bimbisara, Ajtasatru, Asoka, Kaniska and Harshavardhana. Buddhism spread across Tibet, China, Indonesia and Japan, he added.

However, “we can observe the decline of Buddhism in India from the Seventh Century. The reasons being laxity of monastic rules, the revival of Hinduism and Brahmanism, and the invasion of Islam, the use of Sanskrit language, and the worship of motif,” he said.

Parveen Sultana, who spoke on Sufi literature, said that the first stage of Sufism appeared in the pious circles as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad period (661 and 749). The word Sufi is derived from the Arabic word Suf, meaning wool.

The other meaning for the word Sufi is in Persian. It goes in the rhyme: Sufi Chist-Sufi Chist. It means: A Sufi is a Sufi, and it is indefinable as there is no synonym for it and it cannot be defined linguistically.

Sufism has its great names in Prophet Mohammed, Ali-Ibn-Abitaleb, Maulana Rumi, Ibn-al-Arabi, Jami and Mansur-al-Hallaj, she said.

Ms. Sultana said that Sufism is believed as an essential pillar of Islam, but it also contemplated on the problems and deeper meanings of life. Sufism also questioned the prevalent dogmas of society and brought people together with the message of love and equality.

Almost all Sufis across the world trace their lineage back to Hazrat Ali, but it is in cities such as Basra, Kufa, Cario, Baghdad and Damascus, Sinai and Mesopotamia where the Sufi movement really took roots.

The famous Sufi Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti came to India in 1192. After staying in Lahore and Delhi for some time, he finally shifted to Ajmer. The Khwaja’s young disciple, Shaikh Hamiduddin Nagauri, made Rajasthan the chief Chistiyya centre; he was succeeded by his grandson Sheikh Fariduddin Mahmud, she said.

The Sufi who did the most to make the Chistiyya popular in the Deccan was Sayyid Muhammad Bin Yusuf al-Hussaini, commonly known as Hazrat Khwaja Bande Nawaz Gesudiraz. He was in Gujarat and then settled down in Gulbarga (Kalaburagi), she added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/viizn4/article30756132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGKALABURAGISEMINAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tatvapadas-neglected-in-kannada-literature/article30756133.ece

165,2020/02/07,SUV registered with fake papers in Shivamogga,"The registration of a luxury Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) with the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) in Shivamogga by furnishing phoney documents to evade statutory tax and fee has come to light.

In the sale letter, invoice and other documents submitted for registration of the vehicle on July 13, 2019, its price was put down as ₹9.31 lakh. An amount of ₹1.44 lakh was levied as statutory tax and fee for registration.

However, during a verification conducted recently, it was found that the actual price of the vehicle was around ₹37 lakh and the statutory tax and fee payable for its registration was around ₹5 lakh. To escape payment of the high tax and fee the vehicle attracted, fake documents quoting a lower price for the vehicle were furnished to the RTA.

The RTA recently issued notice to the owner of the vehicle, the owner of the showroom from which the vehicle was purchased, and the firm with which the vehicle was insured. L. Deepak, Regional Transport Officer, told The Hindu that a notice has been served even on the case worker serving with the RTA who executed the registration. The vehicle has been blacklisted to prevent a change of ownership. After responses are received for the notices, further legal action will be initiated against the erring persons and measures taken to recover the remaining tax and fee, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/suv-registered-with-fake-papers-in-shivamogga/article30755979.ece

169,2020/02/07,Kannada should assimilate other languages to grow stronger: Settar,"Dismissing concerns about the possibility of the extinction of Kannada given the onslaught of English, S. Settar, historian and scholar, argued that Kannada would assimilate English to grow into a more powerful language, just as it had done with Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian and Tamil in the past. He was speaking at the 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana here on Thursday.

“Many people express concerns about the future of Kannada in the face of the English onslaught. Kannada in the past faced a threat from Sanskrit as it was supported and nurtured by rulers. However, Kannada absorbed the essence of Sanskrit and grew,” he said, and added that Kannada has had similar experiences with Tamil, Marathi, English, Persian and Arabic. “Instead of antagonism towards other languages, we need to assimilate them to develop Kannada,” he stressed.

Strongly advising against puritanical approaches in the development of Kannada, the historian advised having a cordial, harmonious and interactive relationship with other languages. “Language faces the threat of extinction when its speakers stop speaking it. As for Kannada, the people who are stopping to use it are a minority. The majority are the saviours. Kannada continues to survive as long as people in rural areas use it,” Prof. Settar said. “We have to use Kannada with pride in our respective fields. We should be proud of using Kannada, but should not worship it. There is no language in the world that has maintained purity. Only those languages that have a cordial, harmonious and interactive approach towards other languages tend to develop,” he added.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the measures the government has taken for the development Kannada, the scholar said that classical language status accorded to Kannada did not help much in its development as its implementation was very poor. “The government could not even establish an institution to ensure proper implementation,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n9h3xf/article30755778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGSETTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kannada-should-assimilate-other-languages-to-grow-stronger-settar/article30755779.ece
170,2020/02/07,The loneliness of the exam writers,"For over six months last year, Avira*, a brilliant Class 10 student in Tiruchi, stopped attending school, saying she was afraid of failing the model tests being held in the run-up to the board exams in February this year. “After cajoling, counselling, alternative therapy and even violent arguments, we finally realised that Avira had been subconsciously affected by the constant threats of her teachers and peer group of dire consequences if she didn’t do well in the public exams,” says her father. “Avira has resumed school, and we hope she will be able to cope with the board exams. Perhaps my daughter reacted to stress in a very extreme manner, but I wonder how many children are forcibly suppressing their fears and attempting these exams every year. It’s a kind of mental harassment that is very hard for adults to understand.”

This week, the Tamil Nadu State government decided to cancel a proposal to hold public exams for Classes 5 and 8 in March and April, bringing much cheer to the children, parents and teachers, but senior school board exams, scheduled to start in mid-February, are still very much a part of the academic calendar.

Stressful experience

Every year, a familiar drama plays out in homes where children are attempting their Class 10 or Class 12 exams: panic, followed by months of fast-forwarded learning through coaching centres (usually begun the year before), model tests, and then the final event. The board of certification hardly matters – every school makes higher- and higher secondary education as tense and performance-driven as possible.

Competitive examinations such as the recently-introduced National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for Medicine have only added to the anxiety levels among school children.

“Exams are stressful, irrespective of your age. When someone is assessing your performance, it is a stressful experience,” says R Karthik Deivanayagam, District Mental Health Programme Officer, Pudukottai.

Dr Karthik sees at least one child daily with school-related stress problems per week. “Children learn by observing their parents and they should know that education is a tool to acquire knowledge and also to understand society,” he says.

When the sole responsibility for success or failure in an exam is laid on the student, parents fail to realise the extent of stress that a child undergoes to fulfill their expectations, adds Dr Karthik.

Fear of failure

The demand for some courses (Medicine/Engineering/Civil Services) over others, has boomed because it plays up to the dream of every parent for their child to be employed in a lucrative career.

Parents who graduated from school in more relaxed times, may be unable to understand why their seemingly well-adjusted children score low to poor marks in public exams despite extra tuitions.

Mind the knowledge gap Mental illness and mental health problems are often confused, which leads to misinformation, says R Karthik Deivanayagam, District Mental Health Programme Officer, Pudukottai.

“Mental illness/disorder, refers to a category of illnesses listed in the International Classification of Disorders. There are a cluster of symptoms that must be observed over a period of time for it to be labelled as a mental illness. This is essentially a clinical diagnosis, and there is no laboratory test to substantiate it,” he explains.

In mental health problems, a person may exhibit only a few of the symptoms similar to a mental disorder, but in varying degrees, and not serious enough to be labelled a full-blown illness. “When a person has a mental health problem, he or she has a functional impairment in carrying out their role as a family member, student or employee. That’s when we should think of getting help from outside,” says Dr Karthik.

Children exhibit their response to stress in different ways, he says. “Even high achievers in class start hating their school or classwork; some children can become insomniac; or start overeating or starving themselves; they have palpitations or panic attacks; they can be irritable or throw violent tantrums. Parents should realise that every child has some special talents that need space to be developed. Just focusing their day on studies is not healthy,"" Dr Karthik cautions, adding that all children need at least 8 hours of sleep for ideal growth.

“To clear board or competitive exams, you need to know the underlying principles. But our system of schooling, especially in small cities, is still oriented towards rote learning of answers. Lateral thinking and deeper perceptive understanding of concepts are not part of our educational curriculum, so children feel at a loss during external assessment,” says M Arulsubila, founder of Abi’s Psychological Counselling and Research Centre in KK Nagar, Tiruchi.

The certified counsellor says that though demanding parents create anxiety among their school-going children, they are reluctant to seek therapy. “For children, education means marks, while for parents, it is about the money they have spent on fees, and the prospect of a good job at the end of it. Though children are very creative today, they are also overly sensitive to defeat and rejection. Their stress-tolerance levels are very low, because they haven’t been taught to empathise with others and or analyse their own behaviour,” says Arulsubila. “Though my work is primarily with children, very often, I end up counselling the parents too.”

Race to the top

Private schools in Tamil Nadu continue to advertise their toppers on banners and billboards despite the practice being banned since 2017 and the emotional distress among students who don’t make the cut is high. Many institutions also ‘weed out’ slow learners or children with medium-range scores in the higher or higher secondary classes by issuing them Transfer Certificates to other schools so that their 100% pass percentage record will remain unaffected, say many parents and counsellors.

“I am not a parent who likes to give too much importance to marks over knowledge, but in the real world, these numbers do make a difference,” says Manushi*, a Tiruchi-based financial consultant who is also a mother of two. “Children these days are either too stressed out or too easy-going with regard to schooling. I feel my own kids are too laidback about their studies, so there’s always a difference of opinion between me and them when it comes to academics,” she says. “I suppose we must learn to appreciate that people who don’t do well in school can do well in life.”

181,2020/02/07,Budget brings cheer for cashew sector,"With an increased outlay of ₹135 crore and steps to support to private processors, the State Budget definitely brings in some cheer to the crisis-hit cashew sector.

The allocation is expected to fuel an intensive drive to revive the industry and reopen nearly 500 factories that had downed their shutters due to heavy losses. While ₹20 crore has been set aside as compensation for the owners of the factories that were taken over in 1970s, ₹20 crore has been earmarked as interest subsidy.

Private processors find launching a special drive to save the industry an appreciable move, something that can restore hope in lakhs of labourers.

“At the same time we need proper intervention as allocation alone can't save the processors. Currently the accounts of nearly 400 processors have been declared NPA and some banks are unwilling to restructure them,” says K. Rajesh, president, Cashew Industry Protection Council.

The last two Budgets had set aside ₹45 crore for arranging interest-free loans, a first-time subsidy introduced to help the ailing sector. “But in order to help processors restart operations, the government should ensure moratoriums and restructuring of loans,” says Nizamudeen I., president, Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters.

While ₹20 crore will go into clearing gratuity arrears, the public sector factories have been allocated ₹20 crore for modernisation. Since ensuring the supply of raw cashew nut is crucial in keeping the industry afloat, ₹5 crore has been set aside for promoting cashew cultivation.

“Though the Budget points out the increase in working days provided by Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) and Kerala State Cashew Workers Apex Industrial Cooperative Society (Capex), the allocations for gratuity arrears and renovating the factories of KSCDC and Capex are not adequate,” says KSCDC chairman S. Jayamohan.

Meanwhile, a major glitch comes in the form of a substantial allocation for Cashew Board among allegations of non-performance and corruption. A body constituted to procure RCN directly from cashew exporting countries, there has been widespread resentment among various stakeholders regarding the functioning of the Board. Of late, the Board has been facing many serious allegations including the purchase low-quality RCN from agents for KSCDC and Capex.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/budget-brings-cheer-for-cashew-sector/article30765727.ece

J. Shailaja, general secretary of the Network of Artistic Theatre Activists Kerala (NATAK), said it was a day of joy for thousands of Kerala theatre professionals, who despite being qualified, were being referred to as ‘amateur theatre artists’ for want of ample work opportunities. She said that the identity of an entire community of artists was recognised on the budget day. NATAK had last year contested the Budget allocation of ₹25 lakh to Lokadharmi permanent theatre saying instead of providing funds to individual groups, backing should be extended to the entire community.

Theatre groups

“Genuine theatre groups working in the rural areas of Kerala should get the benefit of this programme. A new body should be created for fund allocation and complete transparency should be ensured,” she said.

Writer Asokan Charuvil said that the allocation was indicative of the fact that the government viewed cultural activities as part of the fundamental life issues. “Otherwise, they would not have supported art and culture in times of economic downturn,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/activists-hail-allocation-for-artistic-theatre/article30765686.ece

185,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | Budget document paintings amplify political pitch,"In tune with the political pitch of the Budget, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac chose five masterful works by as many artists as jacket images of Budget documents, carrying on from where he left off last year.

‘Death of Gandhi’, a gouache work depicting the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, done by Tom Vattakkuzhy in July last year, was the cover of Dr. Isaac’s Budget speech in Malayalam.

Principles

A work that has been shared umpteen times on social media, mostly without acknowledging the artist, it seeks to depict an uncompromising man laying down his life for his principles.

“The situation demanded that I draw this. Attempts were being made to appropriate Gandhi’s legacy as also to misrepresent his ideals, which inspired me to go back to that moment in history to reclaim him,” says Vattakkuzhy, whose works draw on the social and cultural fabric of the times. But he rues that society very often overlooks the artist as it celebrates a work of art.

The Budget speech in English had another Gandhi painting as its cover. Titled, ‘Learning mind experience’, the work by artist P.S. Jalaja reinforces the need to recall certain hard facts in history.

“To build a society, it is utmost important to understand the larger meanings of the stories of yesterdays that construct the future. It also offers a possibility to survive the post-truth era by studying and leaving an imprint of history through all possible media and thus remembering and reminding others of some sacrifices,” says Jalaja.

Last year’s cover

Incidentally, Jalaja’s painting featuring Mahatma Ayyankali and Panchami was the cover of Dr. Isaac’s Budget speech last year.

The ‘Budget in Brief’ carried on its cover ‘The Flower Vendor’ by early 20th century Mexican painter Diego Rivera while iconic Bengali artist Somnath Hore’s ‘Auction’ was on the jacket of the Medium Fiscal Policy document.

Bengal Famine

Hore is known for his works of the Bengal Famine of 1943 and the Tebhaga Movement. Interestingly, an award-winning work, ‘Ente Ammayum Ayalvakkathe Ammamaarum’ done by high school student Anujath Sindhu Vinaylal, was on the cover of ‘Gender and Child Budget’.

Godfrey Das, designer of the documents, says that the works were selected meticulously in light of the growing resistance to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the attempts to write off Gandhian ideals.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/w267ev/article30768953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvkeralabudget01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-budget-document-paintings-amplify-political-pitch/article30765672.ece

The medium and large-scale units have been given an outlay of ₹468 crore. Of this, ₹109 crore is for the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) and ₹92 crore for the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra).

Public sector units in the State will be given loans worth ₹300 crore from the Kerala Financial Corporation and the State will pay the interest on the loan amount.

The Budget expressed enthusiasm about the “new vigour evident in Kerala’s industrial sector”. The share of industries in the State’s domestic revenue was 9.8% in 2014-15 and 13.2% in 2018-19, the Finance Minister said in his budget presentation. Adding to optimism is that in national factory production Kerala’s share rose to 1.6% from 1.2%.

The public sector Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Company (KEL), which looks to emerge as a major player in the electrical vehicles segment, has been allotted ₹21 crore. Managing Director Shaji M. Varghese said the money would go into the modernisation programme and electrical vehicles segment. During the coming financial year, KEL will modernise its Kasaragod plant.

188,2020/02/07,Panacea for Union budgetary cuts,"The State Budget for 2020-21 offers a panacea to the undue thrust laid on supply side economics in the Union Budget and makes an attempt to wriggle out of the crisis triggered by the shortfall in Central allocations.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac who launched a broadside against the Central bid to rock the pillars of fiscal federalism and the alleged unconcern for the fiscal woes of State governments reiterated the plan to boost capital expenditure in turbulent times to catalyse the economy and also cushion the impact of economic slowdown.

Political line

This is pursuant of the political line that a slowdown could be effectively contained only by reviving and increasing the spending capacity of the people which was expropriated by demonetisation.

The Budget strongly criticised the Central decision against whittling down the allocation for schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme that would have put money into the hands of the rural poor to boost spending.

The Budget also came out against the Central perception which held that the reason for the economic crisis was not lack of demand but problems in the supply side. The reluctance to provide housing and consumable loans at affordable rates is being drawn up against the Centre’s enthusiasm to dole out tax cuts to corporates, acceleration of privatisation and the anti-labour reforms being pushed vigorously.

The State Budget seeks to counter such policies with proposals to enhance the welfare pensions using the available fiscal leeway, opening of 1,000 outlets to provide meals at ₹25 and taking up schemes river revival to provide maximum employment to the rural poor.

People’s Plan

Dr. Isaac has also given due importance for the People’s Plan Campaign that was moulded under his tutelage as State Planning Board member in the late ’90s. The campaign would come under review in this silver jubilee year and the government would opt for a course correction, if needed.

This is in spite of the fact that the Kerala model in decentralised planning and governance had won accolades and is being touted as a successful one.

189,2020/02/07,"Kerala Budget 2020 | ₹2,400-cr. package brings cheer for Kuttanad","Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, has plenty to cheer about in the 2020-21 State Budget presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Friday.

Dr. Isaac said the Planning Board had prepared a package of ₹2,400 crore for Kuttanad. The second Kuttanad package would be implemented considering the experiences learned from the deluge with eco restoration of the Vembanad wetland ecosystem, farming, development and flood mitigation high on the government’s agenda.

The Budget proposes to get Vembanad Lake rid of plastic waste with the help of fisherfolk. Besides, the absorption capacity of the backwaters will be enhanced by mechanised lifting of muddy sludge from the backwater swamp. A sum of ₹10 crore has been earmarked for the purposes.

“A massive scheme with the financial assistance of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) will be implemented to draw sludge and sediment from the backwaters and canals. It will be utilised for widening the outer bunds and to strengthen them with suitable methodologies,” Dr. Isaac said.

The Minister said a scheme for deepening and cleaning of all canals on the banks of Vembanad Lake would be implemented in the ensuing summer. Further, it proposes the opening of the Thanneermukkom bund at least for one year for cleaning Kuttanad.

T.D. Jojo, project coordinator, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), said the proposal to remove plastic and opening of the Thanneermukkom bund would help ecological restoration of the Vembanad backwater system and improve livelihood of the people depended on the waterbody.

“The opening of the bund will increase salinity in the lake and will help to revive clam and fish population,” Mr. Jojo said.

Apart from restoring the wetland system, ₹74 crore has been earmarked to the Irrigation Department for flood control measures in Kuttanad. This will be utilised for construction of outer bunds and removal of sediments. “In the current year’s plan, ₹20 crore is earmarked for agriculture, ₹11 crore to inland fish farming and ₹7 crore to duck farming. The outlay for roads and bridges of the PWD for which permission has been granted or construction amounts to ₹385 crore. Apart from this, ₹50 crore is earmarked for post-flood road renovation works. Thus, ₹750 crore will be expended from the Budget provision for Kuttanad,” he said.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, who met the media on Friday evening said the decision, which had been taken after three persons tested positive for nCoV in the State, was being withdrawn as no more positive cases of the disease were reported. Also, 67 out of the 72 persons who had returned to the State from Wuhan tested negative for the disease.

This was a great victory for the Health Department since it could prevent a local secondary transmission of the disease by stringently maintaining patients in isolation, she said. Ms. Shylaja expressed her gratitude to all her colleagues for their tireless effort in maintaining a state of high alert against a possible spread of the disease.

After February 3 there have been no positive cases of nCoV in Kerala. All primary contacts of the patients continue to be under strict surveillance and none of the secondary contacts have developed any symptoms.

Kerala would continue to be on a state of high alert and all existing protocols would be strictly followed, Ms. Shylaja said.

61 on isolation

More people were put on nCoV surveillance on Friday, with the total number now reaching 3,014. While 61 persons are on isolation in hospitals, 2,953 persons are under home quarantine.

Of the 285 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology for testing, 261 have tested negative. The condition of all those admitted in hospitals are satisfactory.

191,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020| Promising and imaginative,"The Budget dexterously combines politics, economics and strategy, moderated by practical acumen. A common vision would have added greater sheen. Along with the many programmes for industrialisation, a mention of Kerala’s growing potential to become the South Korea of India could have captured the changing ethos.

Today Kerala is world’s largest producer of oleoresin, infant wear, white label electronics, dental implant, castings, footwear and so on.

The Budget presents an appealing and rewarding list of schemes and projects backed up by robust measures of revenue mobilisation. With manoeuvrable fiscal space of States fast shrinking, expenditure rationalisation from top to bottom non-tax revenue collections needs to be ruthlessly tapped. Resourceful Kerala need not behave like a beggar sitting on a bench of gold, especially because it has to forge ahead for a new ‘Model’. While the former Economic Adviser of India Arvind Subramanian holds that the Indian economy is heading toward the ICU, Kerala has registered a real 7.5% growth last year and has an estimated total expenditure of ₹1,44,265 crore for 2020-21 which is 14.71% of GSDP much higher than that of Government of India.

The size of Kerala’s expenditure could have been much higher if only the Centre has devolved 50% of Central taxes which is an entitlement. Even the revenue deficit grant of ₹15,323 crore recommended by the 15th Finance Commission was drastically pruned down to ₹11,694 crore. Reducing revenue deficit to 1.55% is contingent on reducing the mounting committed expenditures on salary, pension and interest which eats away all the own tax revenue and much more. This Budget is not an election-year gimmick. For me, the most exciting part is the promise to revive the spirit of the People’s Plan Campaign followed by the allocation of ₹21,174 crore to local governments.

The Meenangadi model has yet to become a central tendency. The local self-governments should be the hub of development and disaster management. Kerala has to work towards a new fiscal regime. There is a growing apprehension that the KIIFB is an off-Budget exercise and a heavy drag on the State economy.

No one can gainsay the fact the KIIFB is a great launch into the deep and demands discipline, transparency and accountability of a higher order. While the Plan progress reports heavy underutilisation of funds, PWD has overshot to the order of 113% by January. Anti-corruption initiative is an essential pre-requisite. That KIIFB moves cautiously keeping prudential norms holds out great promise.

The KIIFB is Kerala’s answer to meet the challenges thrown up by the restrictions of Fiscal Responsibility and Management Act, the cap to borrowing imposed by the Centre and the unprincipled flouting of the spirit of mutuality which the federal principles demand and so on.

The 1,000 Thali centres in different corners is a signal that people’s need is paramount.

192,2020/02/07,Gender budgeting continues to be a priority,"The Left Democratic Front government has continued to prioritise gender budgeting.

The Budget fixes the total outlay for schemes meant for women in the 2020-21 financial year at ₹1,509 crore, which is 7.3% of the Plan outlay.

This is up from ₹1,420 crore last year and double the total outlay of ₹760 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal, which came to 4% of the Plan outlay.

When the special component for women in other 50 schemes is taken into account, the gross provision for women in the State Budget comes to 18.4%. This was 11.5% during 2017-18.

Emphasis has been placed in the Budget on restoring women’s livelihoods by promoting women entrepreneurship, both traditional and non-traditional. These include women start ups and nano-micro enterprises under the IT and industries sectors.

Violence against women

A major initiative to prevent violence against women is Year of Women Safety 2020, which will be implemented by the Police Department. An amount of ₹1 crore has been earmarked for programmes under Saddhairyam Munnottu gender awareness programme of the Women and Child Development Department. These include night walks by women.

An international women’s trade centre will be set up on the Kozhikode campus of the Gender Park for women to start and expand enterprises safely and market their products globally.

A sum of ₹8.4 crore has been earmarked as the State’s share for the 28 POCSO courts to be set up.

The outlay for Women and Child Development Department, including that for Centrally sponsored schemes, is ₹1,053 crore.

Nirbhaya homes

The maintenance aid for the 16 Nirbhaya women and children’s homes in the State has been increased to ₹10 crore. Secure rooms will be arranged in working women’s hostels for women travellers.

Facilities will be arranged in select anganwadis for children with special needs. Anganwadis that lack proper buildings and enough children will be integrated to make model centres that remain open during the day.

The child Budget showed an increase in allocation as compared to the past two years. A total of ₹1,847.33 crore has been allocated, which is 8.9% of the Plan outlay. This was 7.7% in 2019-20 and 8.2% in 2018-19.

193,2020/02/07,Prepare inventory of Thiurvabharanam: SC,"The Supreme Court on Friday appointed retired Kerala High Court judge C.N. Ramachandran Nair to prepare a detailed inventory of Thiruvabharanam (sacred ornaments) of the Sabarimala temple deity Lord Ayyappa.

A Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana said the Ramachandran Nair committee may take the help of an expert appraiser in the exercise. The detailed list will be handed over to the apex court in a sealed cover. The court listed the case for hearing in four weeks.

The order was initiated on the advice of the Kerala government, represented by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal. The court had on Wednesday asked the State’s opinion on the measures to be taken to keep the ornaments safe and secure.

Padmanabhaswamy case

Mr. Venugopal drew the court’s attention to how the Supreme Court had earlier made the “lakhs of crores” worth of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple treasure secure.

Taking a leaf out of that case, Mr. Venugopal said the first thing to do would be to take a detailed inventory list of Lord Ayyappa’s ornaments.

“What the State government has now is a very generalised list. Look, item eight in the list is a diamond object... but nobody knows what carats. A jeweller can be taken on board by the committee to examine the jewellery so that later it cannot be replaced with fake items,” Mr. Venugopal submitted.

Royal family objects

Senior advocate R.K. Radhakrishnan, appearing for some senior members of the Pandalam royal family, objected to the move to make the Kerala government responsible for the custody and security of the ornaments.

He objected to the inventory as “indirect” intrusion by the State on the private property of the royal family.

Mr. Venugopal said this was the same mistake made by the Travancore royal family in the Padmanabhaswamy temple case.

They had claimed that all the valuables to belonged to them. Petitions were filed. The AG said the treasure belonged to the deity and rests with the government.

Justice Ramana said the court was currently only concerned with the safety and security of the sacred ornaments. The Bench orally observed that though the jewellery is with the Raja, the ornaments ultimately belong to the deity.

Temple management

The Kerala government, meanwhile, informed the Supreme Court that it needed a month to finalise an exclusive legislation for the management of the Sabarimala temple. Late last year, the Bench had directed the Kerala government to draft a separate law exclusively covering the administration of the Sabarimala temple by the third week of January.

The court had previously expressed dissatisfaction when the State produced a draft Bill, the Travancore-Cochin Religious Institutions (Amendment) Bill of 2019, – containing certain proposed amendments to the Travancore-Cochin Religious Institutions Act of 1950. The 1950 Act now governs over a 100 temples, including Sabarimala.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/v7svjc/article30768737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TV-THIRUVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prepare-inventory-of-thiurvabharanam-sc/article30764063.ece
194,2020/02/07,NRI welfare finds space in Budget’,"Amid concerns of a downturn in the Gulf economy and the resultant threat of return of expatriates, the State budget presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac appears to provide some succour for the rehabilitation of the Non Resident Indians (NRIs) returnees.

The Budget has decided to earmark ₹90 crore for NRIs welfare, a quantum jump from the allocation of ₹30 crore last fiscal. This apart, it also pointed out that an additional ₹36 crore had already been allotted for Non Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA).

Hailing the proposals, K.V. Shamsudheen, chairman of the UAE-based Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust, said the government had finally realised the importance of NRIs and their remittance towards the growth of the State.

He said the proposal to moblise ₹20,000 crore via KIIFB and the Pravasi Chitty would give a stimulus to the sagging economy.

The proposal under consideration is a merger of the welfare pension scheme drawn up by NORKA Welfare Board with investments in institutions like the KIIFB. As per this scheme, if ₹5 lakh or its multiples are invested, after five years, non-residents or their heirs will get a fixed amount as monthly income based on the investment.

Similarly, the deposit dividend scheme formulated by the KSFE to utilise the savings of the NRIs through Pravasi Chitty for the development of the State will be extended to other Gulf countries by the month of February and other countries later. At present, the Chitty had been started only in the UAE, the Budget said.

The amount obtained from Pravasi Chitty by way of security, floating money, and deposit of bidders will be deposited in the KIIFB bonds. Thus, the investors would have the right to suggest the KIIFB construction projects in which their investments could be utilised, it said.

A sum of ₹27 crore has been allocated for successfully running ‘Santhwanam Project’ aimed at providing financial assistance in emergency situations to non-resident returnees whose income is below ₹1.5 lakh. Previously, the cap was ₹one lakh.

Also, ₹18 crore has been set aside for providing capital and interest subsidy to non-resident entrepreneurs. Besides, the Kerala Non Resident Keralite’s Welfare Board will get ₹9 crore and the Norka Business Facilitation Centre and Pravasi organisations, ₹2 crore each.

The Budget has also come up with new proposals such as setting up a care-home scheme or ‘Garden of Life Project’ for senior citizens of NRI families. Others include setting up a 24-hour helpline and legal aid cell at the cost of ₹3 crore.

A sum of ₹1.5 crore has been allotted for airport ambulance and airport evacuation facilities. Now onward, NoRKA will meet the expense to bring home bodies of Keralites who expired in the Gulf countries.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nri-welfare-finds-space-in-budget/article30764020.ece
195,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | Local-level plans to prevent disasters,"On the 25th anniversary of People’s Plan, which gave more powers and financial independence to local bodies, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac pitched for the formulation of comprehensive plans to prevent disasters due to climate change.

The unprecedented floods witnessed by the State seems to have led him to nudge local planning in this direction too.

He said that such an extensive disaster prevention/response programme at the local level would be first of its kind in the world. Before finalising the annual plan, draft reports would be prepared, illustrating the preventive actions and precautions to be taken in each ward, based on the lessons learned during the natural disasters in 2018 and 2019. This would be discussed in all grama sabhas, based on which the plan would be formulated.

To mark the 25 years of the People’s Plan, each grama panchayat and municipality had to prepare a comprehensive report on what they had achieved, not achieved and advancements made in new directions as envisaged in the Development Report of 1996. Working groups would be constituted for preparing the report in May. After getting the approval of the new administrative council, this report would be subjected to elaborate local deliberations. Kerala Institute of Local Administration would organise an extensive conference in November 2021 for presenting these experiences. An amount of ₹1 crore was allocated for this, the Minister said.

Local bodies

An amount of ₹12,074 crore was earmarked for Local Self Government Institutions in 2020-21. Apart from this, ₹6,285 crore would also be made available to Local Self Government Institutions through Central and State-sponsored schemes.

Mr. Isaac said that 500 panchayats and 50 towns including Thiruvananthapuram would attain total cleanliness status in solid waste management. Speaking on the importance of centralised septage treatment plants, he said that an amount of ₹5 crore each would be given as a special grant for the developmental activities of panchayats, that ensure land and public consent for the installation of septage plants. A total of 12,000 public toilets would be constructed this year. In addition to the renovation of toilets in existing petrol pumps, toilets in “take a break rest centres” under Kudumbashree and toilets sponsored by other government agencies and public sector undertakings, local bodies would open new toilets.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zdnbtz/article30768852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/local-bodycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-local-level-plans-to-prevent-disasters/article30763858.ece
196,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | Treasury management and democracy,"An outstanding feature of the Kerala Budget 2020-21 is the painful but bold decision to scale down the annual Plan size by ₹3,000 crore.

It is noteworthy because it comes from a government steadfastly committed to the cause of development planning. The reduction in the Plan size and the decision of the 15th Finance Commission to provide the State ₹15,323 crore as revenue deficit grant, if realised fully and in time, would considerably ease the pressure on the treasury.

Treasury restrictions

Treasury restrictions in the State have a long history. It became acute during the previous UDF government when it introduced queuing of bills, arbitrary cuts of Budget commitments and a system of electronic ledger to park unspent funds.

Such ad hoc measures of treasury management undermine democratic control over public finance. They disrupt the priorities set by the Council of Ministers and voted by the legislature.

Plan size

The decision to reduce the Plan size, I should hasten to add, would not lead to a cut in welfare or development expenditure. Such a cut in government expenditure is not advisable in the present context of economic slowdown.

First, as the pattern of allocation of resources among competing goals, and the newly announced programmes show that the government has made a prudent effort to reset the priorities considering the resource constraint. Expenditure items deserving sympathetic consideration or having strategic importance have not been cut. Second, there will be considerable increase in the expenditure of institutions such as Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), financed by way of extra budget borrowings.

Initial hiccups

KIIFB has passed the stage of initial hiccups. Therefore, execution of projects and spending would pick up momentum during the year. Interestingly, for the LDF government ‘extra Budget borrowings’ is not the first best option to finance development.

It was forced to go for such suboptimal options because of the cap put on borrowings under the FRBM Act. There is no doubt in my mind that Budget is a much better tool for managing public finance, in mobilising resources as well as spending, because it is easily amenable for legislative scrutiny and democratic control.

Special efforts

Further, the government is making special efforts to integrate programmes undertaken through the Budget and off-Budget borrowings. It is important to avoid duplication of efforts and to achieve synergies. Contextually, the interim report of the 15th Finance Commission has stressed the need to phase out extra Budget borrowings of the centre as well as the States.

Such a position is unwelcome as it comes in the midst of an economic crisis. The commission should either substantially enhance the ceiling on fiscal deficit or formally accommodate off budget borrowings with proper regulatory arrangements.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6z26s1/article30768840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TVKNHARILAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-treasury-management-and-democracy/article30763594.ece
197,2020/02/07,"PM maligning anti-CAA protests in Kerala, says Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan","Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has refuted Prime Minister's statement in Parliament that extremist groups are infiltrating the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests.

“The statement of the Prime Minister about Kerala, made during the motion of thanks to the President's address, was untrue and condemnable,” Mr. Vijayan wrote on his Facebook page on Friday in response to Mr. Modi's quoting his purported statement that extremist elements had infiltrated the anti-CAA protests. The Prime Minister quoted Mr. Vijayan in Rajya Sabha on February 6 apparently to outmanoeuvre the Opposition.

“My remarks on extremist organisations such as the SDPI (Social Democratic Party of India) were made in good faith,” the Chief Minister said. Alleging that Mr. Modi's statement in Rajya Sabha ‘maligns the protests in Kerala,’ he said that it was unbefitting of a Prime Minister to be part of those who were disappointed with the fact that Kerala was leading the struggle against communalist elements of both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the SDPI.

Stating that Kerala would not concede ground to forces willing to use anti-CAA protests as an opportunity for communal polarisation, Mr. Vijayan said that people had been warned of such infiltrators and that proper caution had been exercised. “Our secular State has the strength to fend off any sort of infiltrators in this movement as well,” he said.

People from all walks of life transcending religious and caste lines joined the protests, the Chief Minister said. People living in such a society “don't need an external tutelage to separate the genuine protest from those opportunists who are trying to sow communal polarisation,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pm-maligning-anti-caa-protests-in-kerala-cm/article30763517.ece
198,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | Mahatma Gandhi assassination painting becomes face of Kerala Budget 2020,"For a document filled with cold numbers, the Kerala Budget 2020-2021 presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had quite a few poignant images and lines, which became unmistakable political statements.

Right on the front cover was Tom Vattakuzhy’s painting ‘Death of Gandhi’, portraying Gandhi felled by Nathuram Godse’s bullets, flanked by his followers expressing myriad shades of grief and disbelief.

Coming at a time when even some mainstream politicians have begun praising Godse, the image is perceived as attempt at reclaiming history which is being rewritten.

“Democracy and dictatorship are standing face to face in India. The rulers in Delhi speak only in the language of hatred and rancour. Their followers consider violence and attack as their karma. The administrative set up has completely yielded to communalism,” Dr. Isaac began his budget speech with these words.

Saying that we have to perceive the gravity of the unusual challenges being faced by our nation before entering into the budget proposals, he spoke at length on Kerala’s united struggle against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Taking the lead

“Which Keralite can’t be enthused by the fact that Kerala provided the moral leadership to these agitations? Kerala is already a model to India in many areas. Kerala shall create a new model of unity, when the country is facing a threat to its very existence. The joint agitation organised against the amendment to CAA by LDF and UDF, keeping away their differences was a surprise to other States,” he said.

Quoting 15-year-old Drupath Gautham’s poem ‘Fear is a nation, Silence is an ornament there’, he said that fear has engulfed even the imagination of our children.

“The anxiety spread by the amendment to Citizenship Act and National Register of Citizens is beyond words. The threat of detention camps is hanging over the heads of 19 lakh Assamese, who have lived as Indians till yesterday. But, we cannot give in to this threat,” he said.

Student agitations

Speaking on the student agitations against CAA, he said that the future of the nation is in the youth who thronged the street taking the pledge not to give up India.

“Agitations are rising up everywhere in the country against the CAA that undermines the very essence of the Constitution. We are passing through a period of the biggest agitation in the history of independent India. Students, youth and women are at the forefront of this struggle,” Dr. Isaac said.

The cover page of the Gender Budget Overview Report was a painting by Anujath, a 9th standard student from Thrissur, titled ‘My mother and mothers of the neighbourhood’, depicting all the unseen, often unpaid labour done by women.

Dr. Isaac compared Anuja’s painting to Kudumbashree’s immense contribution in increasing the visibility of women in Kerala’s public spaces.

He ended the budget with Rabindranath Tagore’s lines “Where the mind is without fear,” paying homage to the young fighters who campaigned fearlessly for the heaven of freedom.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/l27bc7/article30763708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/-Kerala-Budget-2020-2021-cover,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-mahatma-gandhi-assassination-painting-becomes-face-of-kerala-budget-2020/article30763427.ece
199,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | 60 new-gen courses to be sanctioned,"The government will sanction 60 new-generation courses for the best-performing colleges in the State to usher in a much-needed modernisation of the higher education sector.

The announcement, which has found a place among a slew of budgetary allocations made for the higher education and technical education sectors, will ensure priority for courses that are inter-disciplinary in nature.

While the courses are meant to be allocated for colleges that are graded A+ by NAAC, the stipulation will be relaxed for government-run institutions. A committee chaired by the Principal Secretary of the Higher Education Department will scrutinise the applications submitted by the colleges.

The Plan outlay for the higher education sector is ₹493 crore and for the technical education sector it is ₹210 crore. In his speech, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the KIIFB-funded infrastructure development of colleges and universities would be implemented in 2020-21.

Among them, the construction of a ₹100-crore worth laboratory is progressing at the Cochin University of Science and Technology. Allocations ranging from ₹50-100 crore will be allotted for other universities. Besides, a scheme to renovate laboratories in all government colleges will also be launched.

Considering the paucity of teachers for courses that were sanctioned in recent times, the government will create 1,000 posts within March to address the deficiency.

Uniform allowance up

A hike in the allowance for school uniform and installation of solar panels in all schools figured top among the Budget proposals for the general education sector.

The total outlay for the sector will be ₹19,129.5 crore. The school uniform allowance has been increased to ₹600 from the earlier ₹400.

Solar panels will be set up in a phased manner in all schools.

The Budget has given its nod for increasing the allowance of pre-primary teachers by ₹500. The wages of cooking staff has been enhanced by ₹50. A new scheme will be introduced to procure new furniture in new buildings . The old furniture will be reused.

200,2020/02/07,Kerala Budget 2020 | Start-ups to get a booster shot,"Entrepreneurs venturing into the world of start-ups have emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the State Budget presented by Finance Minister Thomas Isaac on Friday.

The Kerala Startup Mission, the nodal agency for start-ups, has been allocated ₹73.50 crore for the 2020-21 financial year.

Capital paucity

The Budget focuses on helping start-ups to tide over the capital paucity and proposes three major schemes to resolve the problem. While reminding that Kerala holds the first place in the ‘start-up promotion ranking’ by the Union Ministry of Commerce in 2018, the Minister observes that paucity of capital remains the “biggest issue” faced by 2,300 start-ups functioning across various sectors in the State.

The Minister said that loans would be made available without asset security to those startups, which had secured work order from government/quasi government/major corporates or institutions.

“A scheme is being announced for providing 90% of work order as loan, up to a maximum of ₹10 crore at an interest rate of 10%. If these are purchase orders, money will be given after discounting them,” the Budget proposes.

An expert committee to be set up under the chairmanship of the Information Technology Secretary will make recommendations based on which the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) and Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation will give money across the counter without any collateral security. Significantly, any loss sustained on account of this will be made good by the government.

Financial assistance of up to ₹1 crore will be provided at the time of expansion of new product prototypes, which are related to sustainable development goals of the United Nations and are also required by any government department. The KFC has been allocated ₹10 crore towards this end.

The Budget also takes a serious note of the continuing criticism that new companies evade Kerala and set up their headquarters in Chennai and Bengaluru on account of the higher stamp duty in Kerala for starting and merging the companies.

The Minister assures to rationalise stamp duty by including it in the Finance Bill.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/madg04/article30768716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/startupcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-start-ups-to-get-a-booster-shot/article30763286.ece
201,2020/02/07,"An anti-people Budget by Kerala government, says United Democratic Front","The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) on Friday described the 2020-2021 State Budget presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac as ‘anti-people’, ‘hollow’ and ‘a fantasy budget’ that bears scant connection to reality.

The Budget thrust an additional burden of ₹1,103 crore on the people, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said after the two-and-a-half-hour budget presentation by Mr. Isaac. “It will only serve to make the lives of the people more hellish. No Finance Minister has in recent times imposed such a heavy load on them. It has no connection to reality and it deceives the people,” he alleged.

Mutation fees hiked

Mr. Isaac had created a situation where the people would hesitate to even approach a village office or a registration office. Even the fees for mutation and ‘Thandaper’ (record of right) had been increased, the Opposition pointed out. “The real-estate sector is already neck-deep in crisis. The budget proposals would further aggravate that crisis. The tax on cars and other motor vehicles has been hiked at a time when the country’s automobile sector itself is witnessing a downturn,” Mr. Chennithala said.

“This a fantasy budget. The Finance Minister engages in verbal jugglery as did Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with the Union Budget,” he said.

Despite the Economic Review painting a bleak picture of negative growth in the agriculture sector, Mr. Isaac’s Budget lacked constructive proposals to inject fresh life into the sector, Mr. Chennithala alleged. The Budget lacked effective suggestions for employment generation in the State and prop-up measures for the ailing plantation sector. The Budget also lacked constructive bail-out proposals for sectors that were facing the consequences of a recession, he said.

A major charge levelled by the UDF is that Mr. Isaac’s Budget has nothing fresh to offer. Many of the proposals had been rehashed from past Budgets, UDF leaders said.

The packages for Idukki, Wayanad and Kuttanad and the coastal regions were part of previous Budgets. Same went for the proposal for branding Wayanad coffee, described by Mr. Isaac as one of the focal points of Wayanad package. None of the past announcements had borne fruit, they alleged.

Hollow

“It is a hollow Budget. Only the cover (of the Budget document) has changed,” alleged Deputy Leader of the Opposition M.K. Muneer.

In spite of the fact that Kerala had barely survived back-to-back floods, the Budget did not present any concrete proposal for helping the State overcome a similar crisis in future, Mr. Muneer said. Neither did the Budget earmarked funds for new construction methods for buildings and roads, which had been a favourite theme of the LDF government in the post-flood scenario, he said.

Mr. Muneer also blamed the Budget for not giving the State’s crucial health sector its due.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/an-anti-people-budget-opposition/article30763086.ece

203,2020/02/07,Maoists express regret for vandalising Wayanad resort,"The Wayanad Press Club here on Thursday received a letter of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) expressing regret over vandalising a newly constructed resort in the district.

The two-page letter, written by Jogi, spokesperson of the Western Ghats Special Zone Committee of the CPI (Maoist), said the attack on the resort was the result of a misunderstanding and expressed regret to the resort owners for the loss incurred.

It was on the night of January 14 that a group of Maoists vandalised the newly constructed resort on the fringes of the Meppadi forest range at Anakkunjimoola, near Attamala, in the district. Posters stuck by the miscreants on the wall of the resort said the attack was a warning to the resort mafia that was trying to molest tribal women in the district.

The attack was devised as per a report submitted to the area committee by a member of the organisation, prepared after a village visit, Mr. Jogi said in the letter.

Disciplinary action

It was sent to the apex committee of the organisation and the attack was carried out as per the direction of the party.

Disciplinary action would be initiated against the ‘comrade’ who had submitted a false report to the party, Mr. Jogi said.

Express regret

The Maoists had expressed regret over the misbehaviour of party members with a pregnant woman at Vythiri a few months ago. They had collected rice and other provisions after threatening the woman.

The letter urged the government to adopt actions against exploitation of workers in the plantation sector, fix the minimum wage at ₹800 a day, provide land and house to all landless people, and to rehabilitate the victims of landslips during the last monsoon. It also demanded that the public intensify their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maoists-express-regret-for-vandalising-wayanad-resort/article30758980.ece
204,2020/02/07,Not easy to get back Maoist case,"It is a tough task for State agencies to get back cases from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as only cases of “lesser gravity” or the ones in which fresh evidences to prove the innocence of the accused emerge are send back.

The legal position on the return of the NIA cases to State agencies assumes significance in the wake of the State government approaching the Union Home Ministry to get back the Pantheerankavu Maoist case.

To return the case, substantial evidence and set of facts that could reverse the hitherto findings or proving the innocence of the accused should emerge during the course of the investigation.

Lesser gravity

There should also be evidence to compel the agency to arrive at the conclusion that the case in question is of lesser gravity, which does not require the attention of the NIA and could be very well be investigated by a State agency, sources said.

In the Pantheerankavu case, the Central government had already decided that it would be investigated by the NIA considering the gravity of the case. The NIA takes over the investigation in a case on a directive from the Union Home Ministry.

It is the gravity of the offence involved in the case that justifies the NIA to probe a case, pointed out legal sources. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had informed the State Assembly on Wednesday that he had written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the investigation against Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fasal, the two youngsters who were booked on charges of Maoist links.

Incidentally, judicial and government sources indicated that there were no instances of return of cases in the recent history of the State.

The State government has sought the return of the case by invoking Section 7 of the NIA Act, which deals with the “power to transfer investigation to the State government.” The Act states that the agency can transfer the case to the State government for investigation and trial of the offence with the previous approval of the Central government.

Going by the provisions of the Act, it is the NIA and not the Ministry that should take a call on returning the case.

If the Union Home Ministry, which ordered the NIA probe into the case, forwards the letter seeking to return the case, the agency may begin the exercise of evaluating the gravity of the offence.

Currently, there are a set of facts and evidence related to the case before the agency.

There are also court orders which made out prima facie offences in the case, which led to the denial of the bail for the accused. If convinced, the agency can return the case to the State agencies, sources said.

The slapping of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on the youth had created a political turmoil in the State.

Serious difference of opinion surfaced among the CPI(M) leadership over the case and some of the Polit Bureau members of the party had publicly expressed their dismay over the LDF government charging the youth, maintaining that they were CPI(M) members, with the UAPA, which the party itself had termed a draconian piece of legislation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mh0psu/article30634807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NIA-SUDERSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/not-easy-to-get-back-maoist-case/article30758974.ece
205,2020/02/07,One more suspected nCoV patient admitted to MCH,"District Medical Officer K. Narayana Nayak on Thursday said that one more person suspected of the novel corona virus infection had been admitted to the Medical College isolation ward. With this, three persons were in the hospital under close observation.

He said that three more body fluid samples for suspected viral infections had been sent for testing.

As of now, the number of people in hospitals and homes under observation in the district had increased to 255, the health department reported. In order to assess the district's preventive measures against the corona virus threat, a district-level nodal officers’ meeting chaired by Dr. Nayak was held. The meeting concluded that there was no alarming situation in the district.

Special training was given to the members of the medical team who will screen passengers arriving at the Kannur airport from the areas affected by the disease. The airport has a 24-hour inspection facility, which would work in two shifts. Instructions had been issued to district hospital superintendents and block-level medical officers to intensify the preventive operation under the leadership of district nodal officer Dr. Abhilash, the health department said.

96 under observation

Meanwhile, in Kasaragod, the district health department said 98 persons had arrived from China and many others from other countries to the district. Of these, 96 were under home observation and two in Kanhangad district hospital

Two persons, who were under observation at the Kasaragod General Hospital, were discharged on Wednesday. So far, body fluid samples of 20 persons had been sent for testing. Of these, 14 tested negative and one positive.

The condition of those in the hospital was satisfactory, the Health Department said. An expert team from the Kozhikode Medical College visited the General Hospital on Thursday to assess the situation in the district. Training programmes were conducted at the civil station level and village panchayats in Kasaragod and Kanhangad.

207,2020/02/07,"Asna triumphs, braving odds","A living martyr of the cult of violence in Kannur, K. Asna officially started her career as doctor at the Cheruvancheri Family Health Centre (FHC) near Koothuparamba, her home town, on Wednesday.

A six-year-old Asna playing in the backyard of her house on September 27, 2000 was injured after a bomb, allegedly hurled by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers, exploded near her. Her right leg had to be amputated below the knee.

An undeterred Asna secured A+ in the SSLC examination and passed Plus Two with distinction. Her hard work helped her get admission for MBBS at Government Medical College, Kozhikode. Her desire to become a doctor was fostered by the love and care she received from doctors while she was hospitalised for three months. “Nurses used to give me stethoscope and doctors showered their love, kindling an interest in me to be like them,” she said.

“I wish to thank all those who helped and supported us to sail through the tough times. It is a great opportunity to serve the people who stood with us,” she said after joining duty. Asna was accompanied by her father Nanu, who ran a tea shop.

She was the first choice on the list of applicants, appointed by the panchayat board.

There was violence during polling at Poovathur Upper Primary School at Cheruvanchery in the local body elections on September 27, 2000.

208,2020/02/07,"Will abide by SC order, says Kadakampally","The Kerala government on Thursday said it will comply with the Supreme Court order over the possession of the sacred ornaments of Lord Ayyappa, but said they were already under police security at the Pandalam palace.

Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the government is ready to strengthen the security further if the apex court wanted it to do so.

Government’s stance

“The government has not said that it would take the sacred ornaments in its custody. But if the Supreme Court gives a direction in this regard, the government will abide by it. There is no need for the government to take in its custody the sacred ornaments of Lord Ayyappa. It is kept in the Pandalam palace under government security. If the Supreme Court says more security is needed, it will be provided,” the Minister told reporters here.

Apex court directive

He said this in response to questions on the Supreme Court directive to the Kerala government on Wednesday to suggest measures to safeguard the sacred jewellery of Lord Ayyappa.

A representative of the Pandalam palace said the sacred ornaments were kept under police security cover and the palace was not concerned about its safety because of the state-of-the art security measures being provided to it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/will-abide-by-sc-order-says-kadakampally/article30755775.ece
209,2020/02/07,2 Bills go to Subject Committee,"Local Self-Government Minister A.C. Moideen has said the Governor had approved the draft of the Bills formulated by the government to increase one ward in each local body in proportion to the population in the State. The Governor had earlier returned an Ordinance that the Cabinet had approved for the same purpose.

Responding to a discussion on the Kerala Municipality (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Moideen said the proposed legislation did not contravene any Central law. The Bills were both referred to the Subject Committee concerned.

Opposition’s stance

During the discussions, the Opposition maintained that the government’s endeavour threatened to violate the Census Act which, they claimed, bars delimitation of wards within a year before the Census.

It also overlooked a letter that was sent by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India and a High Court judgment, they said. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Bill was unlikely to survive judicial review.

However, the Minister dismissed such claims, saying the delimitation process would not contravene neither Census norms nor alter the administrative boundaries of districts, taluks, towns and villages. The Census will remain unaffected by altering the limits of wards within local bodies. He added that the exercise will not incur additional expenses for the State exchequer.

About discrepancies

Elaborating on the discrepancies that had occurred during ward delimitation in the past, Mr. Moideen said that while the boundaries of 88 local bodies had been redrawn in 2015 on the basis of the 2011 Census report, the wards of 1,112 local bodies were delimited in accordance with the 2001 Census.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2-bills-go-to-subject-committee/article30755764.ece

But the State cannot suspend the Census operations. The Census and the NPR and NRC are different.

The government has directed the officials concerned not to include queries related to the NPR and NRC in the Census questionnaire.

212,2020/02/07,"Oscar 2020 predictions: Joaquin Phoenix is the sure-shot win, while ‘Parasite’ is the dark horse","The Oscars are predictable. And there is a science behind such predictions.

While the degree of accuracy varies, from one predictive model to another, one nominee stands out in each category, every year. For instance, it can be predicted with 99.8% certainty that, this year, Joaquin Phoenix is going to win Best Actor in a Leading Role for Joker. Whereas in the Best Picture category, the win probabilities are relatively more closer, with 1917 at 71%, Joker at 10% and Parasite only at 2%.

But how do statisticians predict the Oscar winners? More importantly, how many past winners coincide with the predicted?

While the mathematical model involves complicated equations, the basic premise is simple.

Ever played the game of battleship? While the odds of spotting an enemy ship are initially slim, the probability increases as the game goes on. The Oscar predictions follow the same principle: when an exercise repeats itself over a period, it creates enough patterns to guess the future outcomes. With the 92nd Academy Awards to be presented on February 9, mathematicians have 91 previous results as data to build a model using which the future winner can be predicted.

Iain Pardoe, who has a doctorate in Statistics from the University of Minnesota, has built one such model, which has proved to be one of the most accurate.

He uses three basic patterns.

Firstly, the Academy members involved in deciding the Oscars are also present in the panel which decides the Golden Globes, Directors Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA etc. Thus, their choices can’t wildly vary between the two awards. For instance, of the 64 Best Picture winners from 1943 to 2006, 34 had previously won the Golden Globes. Thus, the awards preceding the Oscars is an important data point.

Secondly, winners of the Best Picture and Best Director are often represented by multiple nominees in other categories. For instance, between 1938 and 2006, only three movies have won the Best Picture without also receiving a Best Director nomination. Thus, the inter-relationship between nominations adds to the final probability.

Thirdly, past nominations of the lead actors and directors increases their chance of winning. Whereas, past wins decreases the chance of a repeat in case of Lead Actor and Lead Actress.

Weights are then assigned based on which of the above assumptions correlates strongly to the past Oscar winners. Using that relationship, the 2019 winners are predicted. The following table shows the predicted winners in the four major categories — Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director — and their win probabilities.

The winners are predicted using our data-driven model

A word of caution though. No model can be 100% accurate. Between 1938-2018, the chosen model has accurately predicted 71% of the Oscars winners.

The odds become better with a 80% success rate, when only the last 14 years are considered.

However, the Academy has thrown up surprises on many occasions. Especially the Best Picture category — as it represents a collective effort and not an individual's brilliance — have often gone off the charts.

Notable exceptions in recent years: 2016 winner Moonlight (had only 2% probability of winning, but beat La La Land which had a 97% chance); 2015 winner Spotlight (with just 6% probability beat The Revenant which had 56% chance).

This time too, there could be exceptions with the Korean movie Parasite riding the race as a dark horse.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1gsiiq/article30763126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/92NDACADEMYAWARDS-REDCARPETROLLOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oscar-2020-predictions-joaquin-phoenix-is-the-sure-shot-win-while-parasite-is-the-dark-horse/article30763130.ece
213,2020/02/07,Marathi filmmaker Akshay Indikar’s ‘Sthalpuran’ has been picked up for the Berlinale,"A road runs through both of Akshay Indikar’s Marathi feature films. In his debut feature Trijya and his second film Sthalpuran — Chronicle of Space, the road is a dominant image, always stretching ahead of the itinerant protagonists.

Travel reflects in 28-year-old Indikar’s own roots too. He belongs to the Gondhali nomadic tribe in Karnataka. “My ancestors used to travel on horses, pitch tents where work took them. They are supposed to be worshippers of the mother goddess Tulja Bhavani; they would narrate folk tales mixed with mythology,” he says. Indikar laughs sardonically at the fact that his ‘homeless’, ‘migratory’ grandfather would not have been able to provide any documentation for Indian citizenship today.

Trijya premiered in Shanghai and went to the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival; Sthalpuran has been picked up to compete in the forthcoming Berlinale in the Generation KPlus section, devoted to films about children and young people. Like some of the best in recent Marathi cinema — Vihir, Shala, Killa — Sthalpuran also looks into the child’s mind but does so with a philosophical and metaphysical voice.

Full circle

A still from Akshay Indikar’s ‘Sthalpuran — Chronicle of Space’.

“The road to school is more beautiful than the school,” says the simple diary entry of the bespectacled eight-year-old geeky boy who is the focus of Sthalpuran. His life is in an upheaval without him being able to articulate the turmoil. “Don’t know where father has gone, even sister doesn’t know,” he writes. We don’t get to know for sure either. Is he dead? Has he abandoned the family? Is he just an illusion?

It all starts with a train journey. The first ominous note in the diary says that the mother is not willing to say if they will ever return to Pune. The film ends with another diary entry about the sister attaining puberty: “Everyone is saying Minu has come of age”. The little boy wonders what the phrase means, little realising how much an absent father has made him grow up. Things have a way of coming full circle.

Indikar’s meditative frames underline the sense of calm with which the stoic family seems to take things in its stride. His filmmaking is also minimalistic. Against the family’s silence, there is the rain and thunder, the roaring sea and the deluge of water. They fill the frames of Trijya as well. Water, he thinks, is an element that unites.

Nature becomes a kind of refuge in Indikar’s cinema. It may help build the film’s mood, but more than that, it lays bare its metaphysical core. “We are one with nature as well, the water within our bodies and outside. I like how the duality gets resolved in the Advait philosophy,” he says.

A still from Akshay Indikar’s ‘Sthalpuran — Chronicle of Space’.

He likes the sound, texture and sensuality of water. Water is also something that signified a sense of craving in childhood. “Solapur is barren dry region. Water was supplied once in 15 days and we would be up at 2 a.m. filling it up. Rain is also a dream.”

In Sthalpuran, Indikar’s camera views things from a distance. He doesn’t plant the viewer in the child’s world but seems to give us binoculars to get close to him and his family — while we remain aware of ourselves as outsiders. Old film songs seem to play on the radio: K.L. Saigal’s ‘Gham diye mustaqil kitna nazuk hai dil’ in Sthalpuran and the classical strains of Kumar Gandharv, Mallikarjun Mansur and Kesarbai Kerkar in Trijya.

The hero of Trijya could be the grown-up boy of Sthalpuran. Does he see his own reflection in them? Indikar has definitely been as peripatetic as his protagonists. For someone who as a child wanted to do something larger than life, like become a magician, he joined theatre only to give it up for its linguistic politics. Exposure to world cinema and the autobiographies of V. Shantaram, Dada Kondke and Charlie Chaplin made cinema seem like a secular medium; he could also “celebrate his loneliness in the darkness of the cinema hall.”

Peace in chaos

A still from Akshay Indikar’s ‘Trijya’.

He joined FTII but quit at the end of the second year, disappointed that it was churning out filmmakers to feed the industry rather than nurture independent voices. “I didn’t want to work in Mumbai. I wanted to make films in my own language and on a small scale. You can’t play with characters if they talk in a language alien to you as a filmmaker,” he says. He started off with a docu-fiction film on the iconic writer Bhalchandra Nemade, titled Udaharnartha Nemade.

The protagonists in both Sthalpuran and Trijya reflect the sense of loneliness and alienation he felt while moving to Pune. “It is contradictory but they are all about finding peace in the heart of chaos.”

Indikar uses folk traditions such as Dashavatar in Sthalpuran and a Chitrakathi performance in Trijya, a way of going back to his own family’s migratory, performative roots. He wants to explore the oral folk traditions of India more acutely and widely and is working on a documentary on Vedic Lavani, a metaphysical, spiritual form of Lavani, different from the erotic one that is popularly known.

He is also working on a feature film called Construction, the love story of an archaeologist and an architect. One digs up the past, the other builds the future, and somewhere between the two is what is to become of the Indian identity.

214,2020/02/07,‘Vaanam Kottattum’ movie review: A warm family drama with a weak revenge parallel,"Rain has been a dominant part of conveying the emotional mindstate of characters in Tamil cinema: a visual style that was employed by K Balachander to create/recreate a dramatic pause-effect in the narrative. The motif’s untapped potential in retaining the core emotion of the scene was mastered by the man who’s a self-confessed disciple of KB: Mani Ratnam.

But Dhana Sekaran, an erstwhile assistant to Ratnam, has taken KB’s route by treating rain as a character, to introduce an effect on screen. It’s always raining in Vaanam Kottattum, whether the underlying emotion is sadness, joy or bliss. That, however, doesn’t explain its title, something like a ‘Megam Kottatum’ would have been more appropriate, no? But one could sense why it’s called Vaanam... instead. Like the unpredictable nature of the skies, you cannot predict the characters’ actions here. They’re explosive on the outside and fragile on the inside, if that makes sense.

Vaanam... starts exactly where Thevar Magan ended. A family feud results in a bloodbath that robs a man of his sanity and grants him a prison life. But unlike the Sakthivel of that movie, we don’t see heart-wrenching guilt or remorse on the face of Bose (a terrific Sarathkumar who seems to have finally gotten that movie he’s been threatening us with for a while). The movie opens with a young Selvam, who is Bose’s son, taunting a goat for a village ritual, before spotting his wounded uncle (a brilliantly cast Balaji Sakthivel, who brings charm and innocence to the character). But the actual scapegoats in Vaanam Kottatum are Selvam, his father Bose, and his family. In response to the blood spilt on his brother’s name, Bose takes to violence, slaughters people, and cuts the cord that was holding his family together. There’s a brief funeral scene that hints at a possible revenge story, which takes its full-form in the second half.

Vaanam Kottattum Cast: Sarathkumar, Raadhika Sarathkumar, Vikram Prabhu, Aishwarya Rajesh, Madonna Sebastian, Shanthanu Bhagyaraj, and Balaji Sakthivel

Director: Dhana Sekaran

Storyline: An ex-convict returns to regular life and tries to mend broken links with his family. Would his children pardon his wrongs and accept him for who he is, their father?

Dhana Sekaran offers a rare, even if limited, perspective on what a woman goes through as a result of a man’s impulsive nature. That we see in Chandra (an effective Raadhika Sarathkumar) when she comes to meet her husband Bose at the prison cell. She tries to have a sensible, reasonable conversation with him. But she is convinced that Bose has become an animal, when he exercises his male pride. She decides to carry the weight on her shoulders, and relocates to Chennai with Selvam and Mangai, in search of livelihood and life.

Fathers form the cornerstone in the three stories that Dhana Sekaran (he shares the writing credit with Ratnam) deals with in Vaanam Kottattum. There seems to be a tendency to show the twisted relationship between a father and son — holding them accountable for their actions — like how Mani Ratnam movies have done so far. But the movie is crowded with too many characters; those of which remain under-developed with a limited runtime, despite having a great potential to become individual stories. Take for instance the triangular love story between Mangai (Aishwarya Rajesh), Kalyan Reddy (Amitash) and Ram (a wasted Shanthanu Bhagyaraj). It dedicates very little time for the characters to gradually develop on their own, have their moments and complete their arc with a closure — an Alaipayuthey-level marriage proposal scene appears more like a hat-tip to the filmmaker.

Another is the story of Selvam (Vikram Prabhu), whose fate is tied to Preetha George (Madonna Sebastian). She too, has am issue with her father. Selvam is a hothead and reminds you of Inbasekaran from Aayutha Ezuthu. In fact, there’s an Aayutha Ezhuthu-styled romantic encounter that happens on a bridge, where Selvam meets Preetha. The third one involves twin brothers (played by Nandha), one of whom looks like he’s straight out of a Mysskin movie. In trying to stitch together these individuals stories with a common thread in Bose, director Dhana Sekaran does injustice to each of it. Vaanam... does waver a little. But it works really well as a breezy family drama, thanks to Sid Sriram’s atmospheric score.

Mani Ratnam once famously said that half the job of a filmmaker is taken care of, if he gets the casting right. That’s what Dhana Sekaran has done by pulling off a great casting coup, that makes even the slightest of scenes look great. Take the one where Bose and Chandra take a Bullet ride. Or when Bose meets Selvam and Mangai for the first time in years. They were kids when he left, and are adults when he returns. There’s genuine love, but more awkwardness. How would a man react when he’s neglected and kicked out by his own family? He looks at his wife and says, “Unna thottu pesaratha, illa dhoorama ninnu pesarathu-nu therila,” he says.

Just for this, I’d pay to watch a movie on Bose and his family.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ii7uk2/article30762119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vaanam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vaanam-kottattum-movie-review-a-warm-family-drama-with-a-weak-revenge-parallel/article30762120.ece
215,2020/02/07,"When white people were made to live out black lives, in 1970 film ‘Hi, Mom!’","Two recent events inspired me to revisit a favourite sequence (or really, a film-within-a-film) from an underseen but vital American movie that turns 50 this year. The first incident was after a screening I curated, where the conversation touched on the problematic tradition of “brown-facing” an actor – or, more generally, using someone from a privileged background to play an under-privileged character.

The second was the experience of visiting Shaheen Bagh, the hub of the Delhi protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). It was especially invigorating to be there on New Year’s Eve: to see the quiet resilience of the women leading the protest, listen to the poetry being read, the displays of subversive humour, the many little ways in which underdogs can use wit and satire to target the powerful. And yet, throughout, I was aware of my position as someone who was showing a modicum of support (for a few hours) without having much directly at stake – and with no real understanding of what it’s like to be from a class or community or demographic that is under immediate threat.

And I thought again of the virtuous white New Yorkers in ‘Be Black, Baby’.

This is a segment — three segments, to be exact — within Hi, Mom!, a funny, uneven, savagely political 1970 film made by Brian De Palma. The main narrative involves a deviant amateur filmmaker (played by a pre-stardom Robert De Niro) videotaping people without their knowledge, but woven into this story are the ‘Be Black, Baby’ interludes, shot in grainy black-and-white with a handheld camera, to resemble a low-budget documentary.

Here is the basic premise of ‘Be Black, Baby’: a troupe of African-American theatre performers goes around asking white people if they know what it is like to be black, and offering them first-hand experience. “You can’t intellectualise it,” a black interviewer tells his WASP respondent, “you have to live it.” What follows is a hilariously, deliberately reductive version of “living it”.

When eager wannabe liberals show up for the participative theatre experience they were promised, they are made to edge closer to the lives of those whom they claim to feel empathy for — and it’s more discomfiting than they expected. Roles are reversed: the black performers, made up in whiteface, smear soot on the faces of the white audience (“It’s going to ruin my make-up,” squeals a woman who was clearly not expecting to be so inconvenienced) and force-feed them soul food (“To be black and to feel black, you have to eat black.”).

Role reversal

Things quickly escalate, from a purse being taken away, to the threat of violence and rape. Just as the audience members are being assaulted by the black performers (who are now thoroughly in character as white oppressors), the De Niro character, Jon, shows up as a policeman. And then — this might sound familiar to anyone who has followed recent developments in Indian universities like JNU — instead of protecting the victims, the cop starts haranguing them, demanding ID, and siding with the assaulters.

Both familiar and audacious as all this is, what follows is side-splitting: once their ordeal is over and they know they are safe, the traumatised audience starts gushing about the experience. “Great theatre! I’m going to tell all my friends to come for this […] It really made you feel what it’s like to be a negro… uh, to be black.” In the end, that’s what it was for them — great theatre, to be intellectualised from a distance.

The sequence is a lacerating commentary on the delusions of the well-intentioned, how someone else’s reality can be too much to handle up close no matter how righteous you are feeling — and how, once you’re confident about the status quo being restored, you easily revert to the same homilies as before.

There has been much talk about the debt that Todd Phillips’s Joker owes to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver — both films being about anarchist violence as a response to a hopelessly unjust world. But six years before De Niro’s iconic role as Travis Bickle (and half a century before his supporting part in Joker), Hi Mom! dealt with this theme too — and neither of those other films, for all their virtues, contains anything as formally experimental and as unnerving as the ‘Be Black, Baby’ scenes.

216,2020/02/07,‘Shikara’ movie review: Vidhu Vinod Chopra's film is too simplistic and tepid,"A film can hardly be detached from the time it is releasing in. Kashmir today holds the record for India’s — and arguably the world’s — longest Internet shut down, with reports of human rights violations in the dark. In this scenario, the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in 1990 is often used for political whataboutery, pitting one human rights violation against another. Shikara walks this tricky terrain, where the impact of the film cannot be retained in the confines of a cinema hall. Perhaps aware of this, filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra contains the narrative to ‘personal’ experience, with loss of home, lives, identity and dignity of a Kashmiri Pandit couple, delivering a bland, simplistic and tepid weepy, which in itself isn’t incendiary. But by stripping the story off of any political and historical context, conflict or depth, the film stands at the danger of feeding into a one-sided perspective, in an already polarising time.

Shikara Director: Vidhu Vinod Chopra

Cast: Aadil Khan, Sadia, Zain Durrani

Story line: Newly-wed Kashmiri Pandit couple, Shiv Kumar Dhar and Shanti, are forced to leave their home and stay in a refugee camp in Jammu

A filmmaker is entitled to his perspective. And in doing so, by focusing on the loss and almost three-decade-long unfulfilled desire for one’s homeland, Chopra aims for emotions rather than politics. Shikara makes no attempt to discuss what disrupted the seeming harmony, adding nothing new to the conversation. In a picturesquely-portrayed Kashmir, bustling with a unique culture, the film attempts to evoke the loss of a paradise that was, as the narrative begins in 1987. The protagonist, Shiv Kumar Dhar (Aadil Khan) marries Shanti (Sadia) in a traditional Kashmiri wedding. His excited Muslim best friend Latif (Zain Durrani), whose father helps the young couple build their home, is an integral part of their lives. The death of Latif’s father in an attack pushes him to militancy. While the film ascribes Muslim militant extremism to personal loss, the moral upper-hand is always with Kashmiri Pandits. For instance, a couple of years after the exodus in 1992, Shiv gently corrects a few kids chanting, ‘mandir yahi banayenge’, by telling them that a good leader unites, not divides. But an opportunist Muslim neighbour back in the Valley has squatted Shiv’s home on the pretext of guarding it and painted the interiors all green.

During the exodus, as Pandits are forced to leave home, the memories of trauma are accompanied by chants of ‘azaadi‘ in Kashmir, and in one scene, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on television, displays her solidarity with Kashmiri Muslims. In its pallid narrative, therefore, what stands out are moments like these, which is a reminder that a film cannot bury the politics of a story under the garb of ‘love and hope’. Beyond the ‘good Hindu, good Muslim and bad Muslim’ trope, the conversation generated by the film is of denied justice by successive Indian governments and a loss of culture as the memories of Kashmiri Pandits begin to wane. The demand is for the 4 lakh Kashmiri Pandits to return to the Valley, and Shiv writes 1664 letters over the decades to the Presidents of America, to seek international solidarity. The letters fall on deaf years, which is evocative of the bitter truth that, irrespective of time and religion, the conflict in the Valley is always an ‘internal matter’.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/zezcz9/article30761523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kashmiri,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shikara-movie-review-vidhu-vinod-chopras-film-is-too-simplistic-and-tepid/article30761524.ece
217,2020/02/07,"'Messiah' on Netflix: Binge-worthy to the hilt, even if it takes itself too seriously","Messiah, Netflix’s first tentpole release of the new decade (it literally launched on New Year’s Day), has critics divided. The show, which deals with the Second Coming of Christ and is replete with religious symbolism, received many scathing reviews. Yet it is a big hit among audiences, and it is not hard to understand why; Messiah combines hot topics like religion, terrorism and global politics into a heady cocktail, with a plot twist at every corner. If there’s a downside at all, it’s that the show takes itself too seriously occasionally, given that it is singularly tailored to satiate viewers’ binge-watching needs.

The series begins with the emergence of a strange man in the middle of the Syrian war. His proclamation that the war will end soon coincides with the appearance of a sandstorm that lasts 43 days, ending ISIL (a fictional ISIS) in the process. While the man — dubbed Al-Masih (“Messiah”) by his followers — leads hundreds of Palestinian refugees to the Israeli border, attracting global attention to himself in the process, law enforcement agencies around the world perk up in doubt. Two major characters get embroiled in this growing phenomenon: CIA agent Eva Geller (Michelle Monaghan) and Mossad’s Aviram Dahan (Tomer Sisley).

Creator Michael Petroni brings together themes that have worked well in TV over the past decade. Dahan’s battle with his inner demons as well as his penchant for going up against authority is reminiscent of Fauda. The religious touch — and the resultant conversations around faith and redemption — reminds one of The Leftovers, which itself dealt with a biblical phenomenon called the Rapture. Meanwhile, Geller is fighting off an illness even as her investigative senses remain top notch, a la Carrie Mathison in Homeland.

In fact, Messiah seems to have been positioned as some sort of an updated Homeland (the final season of which, incidentally, begins airing this week). Much like the mystery surrounding the true intentions of Sergeant Brody after years in captivity, the Messiah writers keep audiences on the edge about the Al-Masih’s true intentions. Is he the real thing — a God who’s been sent to put all the world’s sufferings to an end? Or is he an impostor; a master illusionist with an evil plan? To the show’s credit, the narrative seesaws in both directions neatly, keeping the mystery alive consistently over the course of its 10-episode first season.

What really helps is the presence of Belgian actor Mehdi Dehbi in the titular role. The actor’s striking features and dominating screen presence gets half the job done, but Dehbi also brings a certain understanding and gravitas to the part. It’s the kind of breakout role that could overwhelm a lesser actor, but Dehbi revels in the opportunity. Sisley, too, shines in the part of the Israeli officer, and his scenes with Dehbi are dynamite.

Messiah feels a bit overlong and crowded towards the end, and it employs some of the most oft-repeated TV tropes (like an overbearing boss who constantly turns down Geller’s intuitive breakthroughs, or the shady politician who’s always frothing at the mouth). Yet, the show does enough in its first run to create eagerness for what it has to say in future seasons.

The first season of Messiah is now streaming on Netflix.

218,2020/02/07,You can now disable Netflix’s annoying autoplay feature,"Streaming giant Netflix is finally doing away with the annoying feature that autoplayed previews when users scrolled through the video-streaming platform's content.

The company will also let users turn off the autoplay feature that starts the next episode of a show they are watching.

Users can choose to disable autoplay in two different formats — one that automatically starts the next episode in a series and one that autoplays previews while browsing.

Netflix rolled out an option to disable autoplay with episodes in a series way back in 2014, but this new setting specifically relates to the autoplay previews on the homepage, The Verge reported on Wednesday.

It is pertinent to note that there have been Reddit discussion threads, YouTube videos, and Twitters posts from annoyed customers who have asked the streaming giant to do away with the autoplay features.

One person was so frustrated that they created an entire Twitter account just to ask Netflix to please stop. The company is now pointing subscribers to an updated help page on its website to learn how to disable the annoying function, the report added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/mpptvv/article30761244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETNETFLIX,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/you-can-now-disable-netflixs-annoying-autoplay-feature/article30761245.ece
219,2020/02/07,Amyra Dastur joins Saif Ali Khan’s political thriller series ‘Dilli’,"Actor Amyra Dastur has boarded the cast of Saif Ali Khan-led Amazon original Dilli. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, the political thriller show is set around the powerful corridors of Lutyen’s Delhi, which is the centre of Indian polity.

Amyra, who previously worked with Saif on 2018’s Kaalakaandi, said she immediately agreed to be a part of the show due to its “delicious script“.

“Yes, I’m doing the political thriller which is Ali Abbas Zafar’s next. It’s a delicious script that got me completely hooked. Saif is one of the finest actors that we have today and the kind of work he’s doing is putting us on a global map... So it was a yes for me from the word go because the story is extremely fascinating,” the 26-year-old actor said in a statement.

The series will also feature actors Sunil Grover, Gauahar Khan and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.

Amyra said her knowledge about Indian politics has “widened” after working on the series.

“It’s all about politics where each of us have important roles to play. Right now, with whatever is happening around us, everyone’s eyes are on this and the games that get played in the political world. My knowledge about politics has widened because of the show.

“I read the entire season because I’m not somebody who likes to just read my part.

220,2020/02/07,"And the monologue goes to: Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Martin.. who was the best Oscars host?","On the night of Sunday, February 9, or daytime February 10, depending on where you are, welcome to the Greatest Show On Earth — if your preference is to see a bunch of mostly Hollywood talent pat each other on the back. We are, of course, talking about the Oscars. After some incendiary tweets of his surfaced, comedian Kevin Hart quit as the 2019 host. The ceremony, and its host’s monologues, have always been a big part of the Oscars, but it went ahead last year without a host, and there’s none this year too.

As Bob Hope and Johnny Carson were before my time, my earliest memories of funny Oscar hosts begin with Billy Crystal, who seemed to host it every year. In fact, he hosted it eight times. That was a time when we were in thrall to his movies that included When Harry Met Sally… (1989), Forget Paris (1995) and Analyze This (1999). Crystal used to do elaborate cinematic opening sequences for the ceremony, and insert himself into them. I particularly remember the 1998 opener, where he takes the place of Kate Winslet in Titanic, for the nude painting sequence. He was also irreverent to the point of political incorrectness, but used to get away with his routines with his sheer joie de vivre. For example, at the 1993 Oscars, he said, with a straight face: “Ironically, 1992 has been a very poor year for women’s parts. Some of the most talked about women’s parts were Sharon Stone’s in Basic Instinct.”

Contrast that with the 2013 ceremony, possibly the worst ever, where host Seth MacFarlane left the audience scratching their heads because of the sheer bad taste of his routine, much of it centred on female nudity in films. There’s no point perpetrating that annus horribilis by repeating some of his ‘jokes’ here. Needless to say, MacFarlane wasn’t invited back.

In better years, Whoopi Goldberg managed to pull off a successful hosting gig in 2002, in a country still hurting from the tragedy of 9/11 that took place just a few months ago. “What a night!”, Goldberg said in her opening monologue, “Movie stars, Oscar winners, great big party, my God, is this Liza’s wedding?” bringing the house down. She was of course referring to the epic wedding of the year where Liza Minnelli married David Gest, where Elizabeth Taylor was the maid of honour and Michael Jackson was the best man.

Steve Martin was a delight both the years he hosted, but the ceremony in general has been steadily losing audience, until last year, when, without a host, it actually saw an uptick of 12% in viewership. Is that because there was no host? We don’t know. What we do know that this year, like the last, there will be a galaxy of stars to present the awards. They include Rebel Wilson, fresh off her biting speech at the BAFTAs last week, Taika Watiti, Tom Hanks, Mindy Kaling, Timothée Chalamet, Olivia Colman, James Corden, Keanu Reeves and Kristen Wiig.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/msexoe/article30760484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08wknamanGettyImages-563551377jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/and-the-monologue-goes-to-billy-crystal-whoopi-goldberg-steve-martin-who-was-the-best-oscars-host/article30760488.ece
221,2020/02/07,"‘Seeru’ movie review: A neat entertainer, despite the outdated ‘commercial’ presentation","(Spoilers ahead)

Hear the good news first: there are some pleasant surprises in Seeru. But to get there, you need to tide over the first hour of rudimentary Kollywood essentials like needless fights, a romance that has no future, and unnecessary build-up for the hero.

Sample the very first scene: a couple of girls are driving down hearing Ilaiyaraaja songs when a bunch of goons, dressed as policemen, accost and misbehave with them. They send a distressed Whatsapp voice note on a group, which receives prompt concerned replies from supposed ‘friends’. One of them replies, “I’ll be there soon,” and that sentence is enough for the girl — who has no clue who this knight in shining armour is — to tell the goons: “Kettala...” (Did you hear that? Wait for him.”) I’ve not seen many lamer hero-introduction sequences in recent times.

That hero is Manimaran (Jiiva), who, after arriving to slow-motion shots and thunderous music, is introduced as a person who runs a local cable channel. The town is Mayavaram, and that’s his ‘area’. So much so that when someone asks him his name, he says, “Just get down at Mayavaram and ask for Manimaran. You’ll get to me.”

He could well have been a plumber or a carpenter, it would hardly matter in the greater scheme of things. For, Seeru is a bit like Vijay’s 2005 flick Thirupaachi: designed to be high on ‘sister sentiment’ and ‘friendship sentiment’.

Seeru Genre: Action

Cast: Jiiva, Riya Suman, Navdeep, Varun

Storyline: A person running a local TV channel needs to find out who is out to kill him

Manimaran is very close to his sister Ilakiya (Gayathri) and leads a relatively happy life, but things take a turn when he receives a call from Malli (Varun, who seems to have paid more attention to his unkempt look rather than performance). Malli is out to kill Manimaran, who has an ongoing tiff with a local MLA (an issue that you think might be the core plot, but will actually vanish in a jiffy), Malli comes to Manimaran’s house, but the latter is not there and his pregnant sister is alone at home and experiencing labour pain.

The surprises arrive after this: the villain isn’t actually one, and much later, when Mani hits a few goons, it’s for a reason you wouldn’t fathom. An enemy becomes a friend, and a misplaced walkie-talkie comes to good use...so much that the actual hero-villain clash in the climax becomes perfunctory.

The commercial action sequences weigh down Seeru a lot, but there’s still some amount of thought in the director Rathnasiva’s storyline. The film becomes a different beast towards the second half when it starts veering into the ‘women empowerment’ angle, which Kollywood seems to have taken quite a liking for in recent times.

Seeru comes across as a film that’s at least a decade old, in terms of its outdated presentation and over-the-top sequences. The romance track featuring Riya Suman isn’t anything to write home about, but it does give us the lilting Vaa Vaasuki composed by Imman and sung with punch by Shankar Mahadevan’s son Shivam, who can find more meaningful work if he works on his Tamil diction. It doesn’t help that the main villain Navdeep is of little importance here. But the surprises within the traditional masala format, and an earnest performance by Jiiva, keep it engaging.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/f8vsw9/article30760024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/seeruii,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/seeru-movie-review-a-neat-entertainer-despite-the-outdated-commercial-presentation/article30760025.ece
222,2020/02/07,‘Little Women’ review: A nod for accepting the diversity within gender and not being judgmental,"Growing up reading Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, it wasn’t the politics of American Civil War in the backdrop that piqued our interest. It was the coming-of-age story in the foreground, involving the four March sisters — Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth — was what impacted us, notwithstanding the different country, culture and period in which the novel was rooted. In a similar vein, Greta Gerwig’s screen adaptation also retains the timelessness and universality inherent in Alcott’s tale. While the story harks back to 1868 America, the film feels up to date with modern times and could transpire in any part of the world today. It is a smart and modern, if not entirely radical take on the much-loved novel.

Take the slice of siblinghood for instance, which, along with the feminist questions and angst, that is what Gerwig choses to draw the audience’s attention to. The rivalries between the sisters, the game of one upmanship, their disagreements that descend from the civil to the ugly — all something many sets of brothers and sisters have experienced at close quarters. Then there is the articulation of the unfairness and skew when it comes to family dynamics — how one sibling is always saddled with the family responsibilities, while the other gets away relatively easy in life. But above all, there is also the overwhelming love, concern and care which resolves the issues and redeems the relationships.

Little Women Director: Greta Gerwig

Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Laura Dern, Timothee Chalamet, Louis Garrel, Meryl Streep

Run time: 135 minutes

Storyline: An adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel about the four March sisters’ coming of age against the backdrop of the American Civil War

The four little women, who are poles apart from each other, are also a reminder of the pitfalls of putting women in one bracket or refusing to see them beyond the extreme clichés of good and bad. The experiences, aspirations, desires and ambitions of the women are multi-hued despite sharing a surname, family and home. Little Women is a nod for accepting the diversity within gender and not being judgmental, especially when it comes to women. Meg may want to get away from the life of want and poverty but that doesn’t make her a vacuous social climber. While Jo is the most sensitive to the needs of the family, it doesn’t mean she is a saint who will sacrifice her own dreams. Amy’s savage anger doesn’t divest her of vulnerabilities and neither do the lofty morals of Jo make her righteous.

No wonder Jo and Amy in all their ambiguities are the ones who leave the strongest impression and offer Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh respectively the opportunity to invest in and dig into their characters with relish. Just as in the book, the circle of their life, Jo was and still is the alter ego for many of us wanting to not square up to the marriage question. The tomboyish one, not given to “furs and feathers” yet weeping at the loss of her lovely long tresses, wanting to chart her own way in life, sure of what she wants but questioning her own choices in moments of extreme loneliness, running away from marriage yet not being regarded irresponsible for that. the possibility of friendship between man and woman is the another impactful strand. As is a mother allowing girls to venture out on their own into the world, to make up their minds about life’s choices.

Before watching Little Women, I was apprehensive about how the film will tackle the marriage issue. There is the orthodox view in the narrative stemming from the society itself — that women need to marry well and the only way to stay unmarried is to be rich. But far from underlining it, the film looks at it from an amused distance and underscores the counterview — that marriage is an economic proposition after all. All of which are eternal truths!I also wondered if the focus on getting Jo married would seem out of joint. Like a typical taming of the shrew arc? Or a feel good romance of the cloying kinds. It may not be about rocking the boat but about the hopes and possibilities within the usual. Alcott’s book and Gerwig’s film end in an impossibly happy and neat resolution. But both underlay an assurance that it hasn’t happened at the cost of Jo’s spirit or will being thwarted. She remains her own woman.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/r6h05s/article30759984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7bm-pg5-little-women,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/little-women-review-a-nod-for-accepting-the-diversity-within-gender-and-not-being-judgmental/article30759985.ece
223,2020/02/07,"PSU Neyveli Lignite charged Vijay-starrer 'Master' unit ₹25,000 a day","The management of NLC India Ltd., a public sector undertaking, in Cuddalore district allowed shooting of Vijay’s latest film Master for a sum of ₹25,000 a day.

The film crew, comprising about 200 persons, including artistes and technicians, entered the mining area of NLCIL on February 4 for a ten-day shoot, that included fight scenes, NLCIL sources said on Thursday.

“The mining area is huge, around 100 acres, and a portion of it was earmarked for the purpose of shooting scenes for Vijay’s film. Yes, ₹25,000 a day is pittance for the high-budget film...we are in the process of revising the norms now. The management is considering enhancement of fee up to ₹1 lakh a day for commercial film shooting,” an NLCIL official said.

Besides ₹2.5 lakh for 10 days, the film crew paid separately for using guesthouses, water and electricity, the official said, adding that the shoot continued on the second day (on Thursday), after Mr. Vijay was taken away by officials of the Income Tax.

The original norms in NLCIL was to charge ₹5,000 a day for film shooting, and this was increased to ₹10,000 a day later.

“There are no clear-cut norms on categorisation of shooting for non-commercial purposes like documentaries, research work etc. We are now in the process of rolling out a clear tariff chart for the purpose,” the official said. Since a mine is an industrial area that is vulnerable to mishaps, at least 8 employees of NLCIL were posted on duty, in two shifts, to supervise the shooting.

“We are aware that the cost of the man days, involving 8 of our officials, is not more expensive than the money we charge for the shooting,” the official, who preferred not to be quoted, added.

‘Ulterior motive’

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said that the I-T searches at Vijay’s properties had an ulterior motive and the actor should not be afraid of these raids if they were aimed at silencing his criticism of the BJP and the AIADMK governments through his films.

224,2020/02/07,Crack down on schools that don’t implement RTE Act: HC,"The Madras High Court has directed the School Education department to initiate immediate and appropriate action against private schools which fail to allocate and fill up free seats for economically poor children in the neighbourhood under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act of 2009.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by Mohamed Ghouse who claimed to be State secretary of Welfare Party. The plea of the petitioner was to order simplification of procedures involved in submitting applications online for RTE admissions.

Pointing out that the State government had created an exclusive web portal for submission of RTE applications, the petitioner alleged that many parents could not submit applications for the academic sessions 2019-20 due to some technical glitches in the fourth stage of the application submission process.

Refuting the allegation, Special Government Pleader (Education) C. Munusamy told the court that a well defined mechanism had been put in place to admit students under RTE Act. He said, the RTE intake capacity in the State was 1,24,859 seats and that 74,667 students were admitted in the entry category of LKG and 2,260 candidates in Class I during the current academic year.

Without doing any due diligence and collecting sufficient particulars, the petitioner had approached the court just for publicity, he alleged.

225,2020/02/07,Family of Adivasi boy to withdraw police complaint against TN Forest Minister,"The family of the 14-year-old boy, whom Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan got to unbuckle his slippers, said that they would withdraw the complaint they had submitted to the police, after he expressed “regret” over the incident.

The Minister met the 14-year-old Adivasi boy, his family and also Theppakadu villagers and expressed his “regret” at the incident. The villagers were brought to the Tamizhagam guest house in special buses and they met the Minister at the guest house for around an hour, officials said.

Mr. Sreenivasan reportedly met the boy, as well as his friend, to whom he had gestured on Thursday at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) to help him take off his slippers.

The two boys were not allowed to speak to reporters. However, the mother of the 14-year-old boy spoke to the press and said that she was satisfied with the Minister expressing his regret and would withdraw the complaint they had lodged at the Masinagudi police station. “The Minister said that he would sanction a pension for our family and also a job for my daughter,” said the boy’s mother outside the Tamizhagam guest house.

Mr. Sreenivasan also addressed a press conference and said that he had expressed his “regret.” He added that the villagers had submitted a list of demands that they had with them for improvement of their lives in Theppakadu, before he promptly left the press conference without entertaining any questions from journalists.

Outside, members of various outfits, including the Social Justice Party raised slogans against the minister for his “casteist” actions.

Disputes also broke out between various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) present at the meeting, with some claiming that certain groups had acted in connivance with the minister and the district administration “to sweep the incident under the carpet.”

Sobha Madhan, a local tribal rights activist based in Gudalur and a member of the Nilgiris Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups Federation who was present at the meeting between the boy and the Minister, alleged that certain NGOs had intervened between the government and the local community. “They simply made the issue a bargaining chip and got some throwaway demands for welfare from the government, without addressing the issue at hand,” she charged.

The Tamil Nadu Malaival Makkal Sangam and the Social Justice Party objected to the meeting with the boy, stating that the minister was accused of a crime which could attract sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Sreenivasan should tender an open apology for asking a tribal boy to remove his slippers at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp on Thursday, said K. Balakrishnan, State Secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mr. Balakrishnan told reporters on Friday that if anyone else had done this, the police would have taken action. But they are not doing so now.

On the IT Department questioning actor Vijay, the CPI (M) leader said the party was not opposed to Income Tax raids or action on those evading tax. But, in the name of IT raid, the BJP Government at the Centre seems to be threatening those who speak against it. Actor Vijay was taken for questioning when he was shooting for a film. The actor is not a terrorist and the IT Department could have issued a summons asking him to come in for questioning. “We cannot allow the government to use its agencies to threaten people who speak against it,” he said. The IT case against actor Rajinikanth was withdrawn. The government had different approaches for different people, he said.

Mr. Balakrishnan also claimed that the Minister for Milk and Dairy Development K.T. Rajenthira Bhalaji was continuously inciting communal hatred “Why is the CM not taking action against him. Action should be taken against the Minister,” he said.

On the scams in various government recruitments, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged that corruption was high in the State and some Ministers were also involved. There should be a CBI inquiry into the scams with the High Court monitoring it.

227,2020/02/07,"Now, minor degrees in emerging technologies to be offered at engineering colleges","From this year, all engineering branches can offer courses in emerging technologies either as minor degrees or electives. The approved electives/minor degrees include artificial intelligence; Internet of Things; blockchain; robotics; quantum computing and augmented reality/virtual reality.

Institutions however, cannot increase their intake for regular courses. The specialisation in emerging areas is “permitted within the approved intake without hampering the generic course” according to the approval process handbook released by the All India Council for Technical Education.

The Council has permitted Universities to evolve syllabi for any minor degree/honours for which model syllabi are not available on its website. Undergraduate degree courses in the emerging areas shall be allowed as specialisations from the same department, however.

Candidates who take the courses must do a minimum of 18-20 credits in addition to the 160 for major degree and it will be mentioned in the degree as a specialisation in that particular area. A candidate from another department who takes courses in the emerging areas for the additional credits will received “a degree with minor from another department”.

Colleges with CSE and EE department can offer AI, machine learning, blockchain, IoT, cyber security, virtual and augmented reality and data science as minor degrees. ECE can offer AI, ML, blockchain, IoT, cyber security and data science. EE and Mechanical Engineering can offer systems engineering as minor degree.

The Council has given a new breath of life to civil and chemical engineering by allowing minor degrees such as GIS and remote sensing; sustainability engineering; strategic civil infrastructure; smart cities; and underground space utilisation.

However, only institutions with the required infrastructure can run specialisation in emerging areas. If a technical institution is unable to accredit 60% of the eligible courses in the next three years then the extension of approval will be cancelled, the Council has decided.

But are the colleges equipped to offer such courses?

AICTE chairman Anil D. Sahasrabudhe said, “These are add-on courses, minors and not full degree nomenclatures. Moreover, these courses will come in the third year or, at most in the second year. Over the last one year we have trained more than 8,000 faculty members through 200 faculty development programmes in one of these areas each. Next year we have targeted 500 programmes and 20,000 faculty.”

50% reduced intake

The Council will reduce by half the approved intake of colleges where admission has been consistently 30% or lower than the approved intake for the past five years.

Colleges will have to present to the inspection committee the ECS of salary paid to faculty members, besides presenting the faculty in person. Colleges have also been instructed not to “demand for the original degree certificates from the faculty at the time of joining the institution”.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/360gmy/article30760092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07FEBTH-ENGG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/now-minor-degrees-in-emerging-technologies-to-be-offered-at-engineering-colleges/article30760093.ece

Mr. Panneerselvam was participating in the valedictory function of the 12th National Tribal Youth Exchange programme organised by Nehru Yuva Kendra held in the city on Friday. He said the Central and State governments, which can never disregard the strength of the youth community, should take steps for the welfare and development of youngsters. Quoting the words of former President A.P.J.

229,2020/02/07,Explained: The Tamil Nadu police’s Kavalan SOS app,"​There have been several instances of late when the Tamil Nadu police’s app, Kavalan SOS, has come in handy for users during an emergency. Be it harassment on the road or intrusion at home by strangers, the police have responded to those who used the app. While the app was launched in May 2018, downloads shot up after the 2019 Hyderabad rape incident. The police have also conducted several awareness programmes in schools and colleges on the benefits of the app. So, what is the app all about? Read on to know more.​​

What is Kavalan SOS?​

It is an app brought out by the Tamil Nadu police as part of its Master Control Room initiative. It will enable users to alert the police immediately during emergency situations such as sexual assault, kidnap or ‘eveteasing’ and natural disasters such as earthquake or floods. It can also be used in situations when the user is trapped unexpectedly, such as in an elevator or a toilet, and is unable to contact anyone. ​

​How does the app work?​

An SOS button will be visible on the home page. Upon pressing it, a five-second countdown will begin. At the end of the countdown, the app will send the user's current location, along with a panic signal and a video recording from the back camera to the police control room. Call receivers at the master control room will alert a team of police personnel. The personnel will review the call and alert the relevant control room, police station or patrol team, who will reach out to the victim. The service is available 24x7​.

Who can download the app?​

Residents of Tamil Nadu can download the app. The police especially encourage women and the elderly to use the app. Android and iOS versions of the app are available. ​

What details does the app seek?​

Users must provide their mobile phone number, address, date of birth and gender to register. The app seeks a wide range of permissions to make and manage phone calls, access contacts, view SMS messages, take pictures, record video and audio, view device location and access photos and files. ​​

How secure is user data?​

While there have been concerns over the safety of user details, the police have clarified that the details are gathered only to reach out to the users and the data will be stored securely.​",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4z5hpr/article30759382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kavalan-SOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/explained-the-tamil-nadu-polices-kavalan-sos-app/article30759383.ece
230,2020/02/07,Those under nCoV watch must help us: Health Secretary,"With over 1,300 persons who travelled from countries affected by the novel coronavirus (nCoV) under home quarantine in the State, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh on Thursday made an appeal to those under surveillance. “They should help us help them. They must ensure that they use masks, and approach us immediately if they develop the three symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing,” she said.

Dr. Rajesh said that all persons under surveillance were being contacted at least twice a day to check on their health status.

She stressed on the importance of personal hygiene and hand washing — before and after food and after visiting public places, and cough etiquette.

“Elderly persons, and those with co-morbid conditions such as severe diabetes and hypertension should take proper treatment and reduce going to public places,” she told reporters. She pointed out that nCoV had a mortality rate of 2%.

With four more persons, including two Chinese nationals, admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, a total of 11 persons are under observation for symptoms of nCoV in the State.

“We are waiting for the results of 13 throat, nasal swabs and blood samples that were sent for testing,” she added.

A second flight that brought Indians from China also included Tamil Nadu students who were in the quarantine facility, she said, adding that a Central team surveyed the State’s preparedness and expressed satisfaction. They stressed on continuing surveillance to prevent cases.

On availability of masks, she said N95 masks were meant only for doctors and those handling suspected persons. “We currently have a stock of 3,08,184 masks in various government hospitals in the State,” she said.

On Thursday, the department organised an orientation for private practitioners, private hospitals and members of Indian Medical Association. Dr. Rajesh added that they had already informed the protocol and guidelines.

During the orientation that was attended by 250 persons, information from World Health Organisation, guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and activities of the Tamil Nadu Health department were outlined, she added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/those-under-ncov-watch-must-help-us-health-secretary/article30756571.ece
231,2020/02/07,Chief Minister urges Centre to lift restriction on import of peas via Thoothukudi port,"Opposing the restriction imposed on the import of peas by the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), the Tamil Nadu government on Thursday urged the Centre to permit the import of peas with HSN codes through Thoothukudi seaport, contending that the restriction has led to cost escalating to ₹65 per kg in the State.

In his letter to the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami noted, “This ban has detrimentally affected dal and flour mills operating as MSME units in Tamil Nadu and thereby the livelihood of labourers and others who depend on this trade. This restriction has also increased the demand and due to its shortage, the cost of green peas in Tamil Nadu has gone up.”

Referring to the representations he received in this regard, Mr. Palaniswami highlighted the difficulties faced by dal and flour mills in procuring peas of various varieties. Peas are primarily used in the preparation of traditional and region-specific snacks. Peas are being cultivated in over 5.40 lakh hectares across India with an annual estimated production of 54.22 lakh tonnes.

The average requirement of peas in Tamil Nadu is around 2 lakh tonnes, of which only 10,000 tonnes were sourced from the northern States, he said. “Moreover, because of the heavy demand for peas in other States, cost of peas transported from northern States after fulfilling their internal demand is very high and can range up to ₹65 per kg.”

Peas were being imported from Australia, Canada, Russia, among others countries, through Thoothukudi at cheaper rates before the Director-General of Foreign Trade imposed a restriction on the import of peas to 1.5 lakh tonnes for the entire country. “I request that the Union Government may kindly permit the import of peas with HSN codes 07131010 (yellow peas), 07131020 (green peas) and 07131090 (other) through Thoothukudi seaport for the welfare of the dhal and flour milling trade in Tamil Nadu as well as the neighbouring southern States.”

The lifting of restriction on import of peas through Thoothukudi would hardly affect the domestic market in northern States, Mr. Palaniswami added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chief-minister-urges-centre-to-lift-restriction-on-import-of-peas-via-thoothukudi-port/article30756554.ece
232,2020/02/07,Sasikala’s benami transactions: I-T dept. initiates proceedings,"The Income Tax department has initiated proceedings under the Prohibition of Benami Properties Transaction (PBPT) Act of 1988 to attach all immovable properties that were reportedly purchased by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala in Chennai, Coimbatore, Kancheepuram, Puducherry and Madurai using demonetised currency notes to the tune of ₹1,674.50 crore in 2016.

Consequently, shareholders of Puducherry-based Sri Lakshmi Jewellery group’s Bonjour Bonheur Private Limited, which owns the Ocean Spray Beach Resort, supposedly sold to her for ₹168 crore, have rushed to the Madras High Court challenging an order passed by U.N. Dilip, Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (Benami Prohibition), on January 20 this year for attachment of their properties under the PBPT Act.

Justice Anita Sumanth on Thursday directed senior standing counsel for Income Tax A.P. Srinivas and A.N.R. Jaya Prathap to ensure that counter affidavits were filed in reply to all six writ petitions, five by individual shareholders and one by Bonjour Bonheur Private Limited, on or before February 19.

In his proceedings, the Deputy Commissioner had stated that the petitioners had conceded to have received at least ₹148 crore, out of the total sale consideration of ₹168 crore, in cash after the Centre demonetised old currency notes in the denomination of ₹500 and ₹1,000 on November 8, 2016, and gave time till December 30, 2016, for all those who were in possession of such notes to deposit them in their bank accounts.

Utilising the opportunity, the petitioners, belonging to Pondicherry Sri Lakshmi Jewellery group, deposited the demonetised notes in their bank accounts by falsifying business transactions and claiming it to have been earned through their jewellery business. Even after receiving the money, they had not transferred the ownership of the resort to Sasikala till date and hence it amounts to a benami transaction, the officer had concluded.

Denying the charge, the director of Bonjour Bonheur, N. Naveen Baalaji told the court that in 2016, the family business was failing. Hence, they decided to sell the resort and got introduced to Sasikala’s lawyer S. Senthil through Kumar, the then personal assistant of incumbent Industries Minister M.C. Sampath. The lawyer informed them that he was negotiating the deal on behalf of Sasikala and fixed the sale consideration at ₹168 crore.

“The entire transaction was supposed to happen through bank transfer for the reason that the transfer was mainly intended to settle of all the existing loans of Pondicherry Sri Lakshmi Jewellery and the resort. In the meanwhile, the Central government declared the existing ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes as illegal tender. Since there was no word from the proposed buyer, the company was of the honest opinion that the transactions would take place only in 2017.

“However, on November 22, 2016, Mr. Senthil, advocate, came along with his associates and instructed the petitioner and other promoters of the company to sign a memorandum of understanding. The MoU was, however, incomplete as the name of the buyer was left blank. The petitioner and other promoters were not allowed to read the MoU nor allowed to take a photo copy. They were also asked to hand over their original share certificates to Mr. Senthil,” the affidavit of Mr. Baalaji read.

He also claimed that on the same day, the shareholders of the resort were forced to accept ₹148 crore in demonetised currency notes. “Though the said amount was blatantly refused by the petitioner and other promoters, it was informed that such amount could be returned if it could not be put to use,” the petitioner said and claimed that Kumar took ₹12 crore of the cash for having brokered the deal and another ₹75 lakh was found missing when they counted the cash.

Therefore, effectively, the family got only ₹135.25 crore of which a major portion was infused against stock drawings in various firms and deposited in different bank accounts. When the family expressed its inability to deposit about ₹37 crore of the demonetised notes in the bank accounts, Mr. Kumar informed that the deal for the sale of the resort stands cancelled and demanded that the family should return around ₹100 crore in new currency notes.

He also told them that their share certificates would be returned only if they pay back the money. Even before the family could arrange the money, the Income Tax raided their premises, he said and contended that the entire narration would prove that the nature of the transaction could not be termed as benami transaction.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sasikalas-benami-transactions-i-t-dept-initiates-proceedings/article30756524.ece
233,2020/02/07,‘RO can’t order recount after winner is declared’,"Holding that a Returning Officer cannot order a recount after issuing the victory certificate, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday allowed the petition filed by M. Devi, one of the two candidates who were declared panchayat president- elect in Sankarapuram village panchayat, Sivaganga district.

Two candidates were declared president-elect to the panchayat, that is reserved for woman (general), in the rural local body elections held recently.

Devi and A. Priyadharshini, had both contested for the post of president to the Sankarapuram village panchayat.

The petitioner, Devi, said that at about 8 p.m. on the day of the results, she was declared the winner.

However, a recount was done, following a commotion, and at 5 a.m. the next morning, A. Priyadharshini, the other candidate, was declared the winner. Both were issued the certificates (Form 25).

Devi alleged that Priyadharshini was favoured as she was associated with the ruling party and sought a direction to declare the certificate awarded to Priyadharshini null and void.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran allowed the petition filed by Devi and observed that the Returning Officer had no power to entertain an application for recounting under Rule 66 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat (Election) Rules, 1995, once Form 25 was issued. “In a democratic country like India, people expect officials to remain neutral,” the court said.

Election petition

Even assuming that the RO had issued Form 25 certificate, wrongly in favour of the petitioner, Devi, the remedy open to Priyadharshini was to file an election petition under Section 258 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. Even the consent of the candidate for recounting after declaration under Form 25 certificate was not permissible.

The unsuccessful candidate can only file an Election Petition, the court said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r7iimd/article30756518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMADURAIBENCHOFMADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ro-cant-order-recount-after-winner-is-declared/article30756519.ece
234,2020/02/07,No power cuts this summer: Thangamani,"Electricity Minister P. Thangamani on Thursday said that there was sufficient power production in the State and it was prepared to meet excess demand during summer.

He launched the trial run of a newly established power sub-station in Elampally, Namakkal. He said, “Tamil Nadu is a power surplus State. The power usage at present is 15,000 MW in the State, and it is expected to go up to 17,000 MW during the months of April and May. Even if demand goes upto 17,500 MW, there is sufficient power in the State, and there will not be any power cuts during summer,” he said.

He said sub-stations were established to ensure intermittent power supply and the public should cooperate with the government in providing land for such projects. He added that 119 sub-stations had been set up till date, this year, and 130 sub-stations would be set up by the year-end. Mr. Thangamani said that in four years, 480 sub-stations were set up, while on average, only 60 sub-stations were established earlier.

Regarding the Central share of power, Mr. Thangamani said that while the State should receive 6,000 MW, only 4,000 MW had been provided, and he mentioned that he had raised the issue with the Union government during his recent visit to Delhi. Mr. Thangamani said that the Union government had assured the government that necessary steps would be taken.

235,2020/02/07,Shelter Fund comes into being,"With the Tamil Nadu government recently constituting the State Shelter Fund to rehabilitate the urban poor, all new construction of commercial, residential, industrial and institutional buildings across the State, whose floor space index (FSI) area exceeds 3,000 sq. m, will attract shelter charges between 1% and 3%, based on their guideline value per sq. m.

Though shelter charges have been levied earlier too, it was calculated as a blanket earlier and was not equitable. “Earlier, it was not equitable and all areas were charged equally. As a result of this notification, development of posh areas will be charged more and not-so posh areas will be charged less, explained a senior official.

The State Shelter Fund is levied to rehabilitate the urban poor in the State and to fund affordable housing projects for the economically weaker sections, through the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board and the Tamil Nadu Housing Board.

Date for levy

The Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning (Levy of Shelter Charges and State Shelter Fund) Rules, 2020, notified recently, will be applicable to areas covered by the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971.

“The crucial date for levy of shelter charges, in respect of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning area, is the date of issue of technical clearance by the Directorate of Town and Country Planning, where it is required,” the notification stated.

In all other cases, including in respect of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning area, the same is the date of raising demand notice for payment of development or infrastructure and amenities charges, it stated.

On receipt of the final assessment order, the shelter charges are liable to be paid to the planning authority or the local authority.

The State Shelter Fund is also meant to meet the State government’s share of the grant component of centrally-sponsored housing schemes for the urban poor and other purposes related to affordable housing units. The fund has two components — Tier-I and Tier-II.

While Tier-I will be administered by an eight-member Tamil Nadu State Shelter Fund Committee, the Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Fund Management Corporation Limited will manage the Tier-II component.

In cases of non-approval of planning permissions or withdrawal of applications or non-commencement of the project, shelter charges shall be refunded after deducting a scrutiny fee of ₹5,000. In case of grievance over charges, appeals can be preferred in 30 days from date of receipt of the order.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5r54oy/article30756291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07fundingcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shelter-fund-comes-into-being/article30756292.ece

242,2020/02/07,"A princess’ Christmas gift, now a collector’s item","When Robert Kennedy, a collector of antiques, stumbled upon a small box made of brass, he could sense it was unique, but was not sure of its value and history.

The words embossed on the box, ‘Imperium Brittanicum Christmas 1914’, kindled his curiosity and he immediately looked for details online.

“The box was actually a Christmas gift sent by Princess Mary in 1914 to British sailors and soldiers serving across the world. The gifts also reached India and this one has survived more than a century,” said Mr. Kennedy, who is primarily a collector of clocks, watches, timepieces and lanterns.

The princess actually wanted to use her private allowance to buy the gifts, but opted for public funds, since the former proved impractical, he learnt.

The Buckingham Palace released a letter of Princess Mary making an appeal to the public to help her send a Christmas present from the whole of the nation to every sailor afloat and every soldier at the front.

“Could there be anything more likely to hearten them in their struggle than a present received straight from home on Christmas Day? Please will you help me?” she had said in a letter.

Overwhelming response

Her appeal was met with an overwhelming response.

The cover of the brass box was decorated with a portrait of Princess Mary, surrounded by a laurel wreath and with an ‘M’ imprinted on both sides.

The words ‘Imperium Britannicum’ are at the top with a sword and scabbard on either side and the bottom of the box bears the words ‘Christmas 1914’. It is surrounded by battleships.

The names of allies — Belgium, Japan, Montenegro and Serbia with France and Russia — are also found on the box.

The box was sent out with a packet of tobacco and cigarettes, a portrait photograph of Princess Mary and Christmas cards from Princess Mary and King George and Queen Mary.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/b5ksyf/article30756173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th05-Mary-gift,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-princess-christmas-gift-now-a-collectors-item/article30756174.ece

244,2020/02/07,Work on houses for Irulas near Tiruvannamalai to be completed in a fortnight,"Construction of houses for the Irula community in Ponnur village near Vandavasi is nearing completion. The work which was started in August last year, is expected to be completed by next fortnight, said sources from Tiruvannamalai district office.

The residents, mainly those from the Irula community, residing in dilapidated houses in Ponnur village of Vandavasi taluk, were the beneficiaries of schemes such as the Chief Minister Housing Scheme and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

Three houses under the Chief Minister Housing Scheme, four under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and 10 houses under the Scheduled Tribe Welfare Fund were sanctioned initially After inspecting the houses constructed in 1987, Tiruvannamalai District Collector K.S. Kandasamy announced the building of 49 houses for the community.

Sources with the rural development department said that before the inspection by the Collector, Ponnur Jagannathapuram had houses that were badly damaged and some residents had to resort to building thatched hutments by themselves. Since the area was close to a tank bund, their houses were also destroyed by the floods frequently.

The entire residential colony had a population of 133 — including 33 school students. These residents will be provided individual houses worth ₹2.10 lakh and toilets constructed at a cost of ₹12,000.

Over and above these expenses, the approach road to the residential colony is being made ready at a cost of ₹10 lakh. Another ₹10 lakh will be spent on relaying streets with concrete.

Mr. Kandasamy said that all basic amenities would be provided to the people and only thing they have to do is to send their children to school. He urged a person from the community to take up the job of a cook who will be paid a monthly salary of ₹3,500. As an initiative to encourage parents to send their wards to school, parents will get a subsidy of ₹400 per month, he said. This subsidy would be credited to the bank account like any other government subsidy, he added.

Though there were some hinderances in construction of these houses due to rain, it will not affect the completion of project in time, said an official attached to the rural development department.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rsnpps/article30756051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TH-VELLOREIRULAHOUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/work-on-houses-for-irulas-near-tiruvannamalai-to-be-completed-in-a-fortnight/article30756052.ece

Participating in a meeting held here on Friday by the Rajyanga Hakkula Parirakshana Vedika (RHPV), Mr. Veerabhadram said that the “decisions taken by the Union government have been dividing people in the country on religious lines and harming the national interest”.

“The steps taken by the government are anti-constitutional. People are facing a constant fear.

Chandrashekar Rao should apologise to the people for the delay and enormous cost to the State exchequer, said former president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) Ponnala Lakshmaiah.

Speaking to reporters here, he alleged that the vested interests of KCR had delayed the execution of Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) project on time. Because of him Telangana is incurring an additional cost of ₹ 4,000 crore for the project as the costs have escalated by over 28%.

Mr. Ponnala reminded how KCR objected to the project and even threatened violence if the project went ahead in front of the Assembly and Sultan Bazar. Project was stalled and the costs went up ultimately affecting the people of Hyderabad and Telangana. “He owes an explanation to the people on this.”

The Congress leader said it was the Congress party that planned and executed the project to give a fillip to the global image Hyderabad had gained due to its thrust on IT sector. Even Shamshabad Airport and Outer Ring Road were planned and completed by the Congress. “All that KCR had done was to stop Metro Rail’s completion on time for his vested interests.”

He said people of Hyderabad realise the contribution of the Congress party to the city’s infrastructure including getting water from Krishna and Godavari rivers.

248,2020/02/07,Senior IAS officer allowed to contest election,"Observing that rejection of nomination of senior IAS officer Jayesh Ranjan for the election to the post of president of Telangana Olympic Association was unsustainable, the Telangana High Court on Friday directed retired judge and Election Officer Chandra Kumar to accept his nomination.

Justice T. Vinod Kumar instructed the Election Officer to undertake the IAS officer’s nomination paper for scrutiny, enabling him to contest the election. The judge, in the order, made it clear that election of the petitioner would be subject to the final outcome of the petition filed by the IAS officer.

In the event of the IAS officer getting elected to the post, he can assume the office only with the prior permission of the Central government. The Election Officer was also instructed to display that the candidature of the IAS officer is subject to final judgment to be delivered by the court in the petition.

Mr. Jayesh Ranjan serving as Principal Secretary, Information Technology and Industries, filed a writ petition challenging rejection of his nomination papers by the Election Officer. The IAS officer stated that he filed nomination for the post of TOA president by virtue of his being a member of the Badminton Association of Telangana’s Executive Committee.

The Election Officer, however, rejected the nomination papers, stating that he attracted disqualification due to All India Service (Conduct) Rules-1968. The petitioner’s counsel Ashok Anand Kumar contended that the said Rules did not bar the IAS officer from contesting the election. The rules only prohibit All India Service officers from holding an elective office without prior permission of the Centre.

To contest the election, the officer should have secured permission of the Head of the Department and Mr. Jayesh Ranjan secured the same from the Chief Secretary (who is HoD), counsel said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/senior-ias-officer-allowed-to-contest-election/article30765481.ece
249,2020/02/07,"Paddy sowing rises, thanks to good rains","Thanks to bountiful rains and brimming irrigation sources as a result, the area covering paddy cultivation has increased manifold during this rabi season in Karimnagar district. There is abundant water in all the 1,376 minor irrigation tanks.

Incidentally, the area of cultivation of crops during the rabi season has also increased due to the easy availability of water from all the sources.

Against the normal area of cultivation for various crops in 56,365 hectares during the rabi season, it has crossed 74,172 hectares this year.

Paddy cultivation area has increased from the normal 39,864 hectares to 62,630 hectares.

Meanwhile, the area for cultivation of maize has come down, from 12,741 to 9,011 hectares, green gram from 250 to 132 hectares, Bengal gram 329 to 189 hectares, and groundnut from 2,065 to 1,984 hectares.

Agricultural officials welcome the news and see a glut of arrivals of paddy to various market yards and IKP centres after the harvest.

The markets would be literally filled with paddy produce and nothing else. Already, rice millers are struggling to remove stocks purchased during the kharif season to make room for fresh arrivals in the rabi season.

However, farmers, who had sold their paddy during the kharif season, are yet to receive their payments. It is over two months that the IKP centres had purchased their stocks, but ryots are yet to be paid.

Rythu Ikya Vedika district president M. Venkat Reddy said that he has sold his paddy at Veenavanka mandal, two months ago. But, the authorities were yet to make the payments, he complained, and added that he had taken loans for rabi cultivation.

At a press conference here TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy said that such ‘irresponsible statements’ from the Prime Minister of India on the floor of Lok Sabha, to score a point in the Delhi Assembly elections, shows how the contributions of our freedom fighters are being undermined for politics.

Mr. Narayana Reddy reminded that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who later formed Jan Sangh and is revered by the BJP, was industries minister in Pandit Nehru’s cabinet. If the Prime Minister himself twists the historical facts in the Lok Sabha then one can imagine what ordinary BJP workers can do outside, he said.

The Congress leader also condemned BJP leadership for not taking any action against its MP Anant Kumar Hegde who called Mahatma Gandhi’s freedom struggle a ‘drama’. Similarly, BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur repeatedly insulted Mahatma Gandhi by praising his killer Nathuram Godse.

On Telangana

Mr. Narayana Reddy also condemned PM Modi’s remarks on the process adopted to pass Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill in Parliament for creation of Telangana. Mr. Modi was not a Member of Parliament in 2013-14 and therefore, he might not be aware of what exactly happened in Parliament.

It was the Congress-led UPA government which created Telangana State while BJP and other parties supported the move. He asked BJP leaders to clarify whether or not they supported formation of Telangana State.

He also took a dig at the Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s remarks on corruption and irregularities during his meeting with municipal commissioners and other officials. Instead of teaching them morals Mr. Rama Rao should clarify why he was not taking action against TRS corporators and other leaders who were indulging in illegal activities.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-condemns-pm-modis-remarks-against-nehru/article30764658.ece

Mr. Narendra Modi in his reply to the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address had said: “Nobody can forget how Telangana was formed during the UPA regime in 2014. Doors were closed, TV cameras were shut, and there was no scope for discussion at all”... And, “Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh did say in the Lok Sabha that democracy was being harmed due to the ongoing protests over the Telangana issue. Atalji created three states in a harmonious way, unlike how Telangana was created.”

Mr. Reddy who was attending a funeral ceremony in Miryalaguda, spoke to media persons and said the Prime Minister’s knowledge on Telangana State creation was incomplete, far from truth, and in the nature of insulting the people of Telangana and its separate Statehood movement.

“The BJP had supported Telangana State creation. As the Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj’s role was crucial in the passage of Telangana Bill. PM’s comments now not only denigrate Telangana, but Sushma Swaraj ji and other BJP MPs also,” he said.

254,2020/02/07,VIP devotees inconvenience other devotees at Telangana's Medaram festival,"The beeline by the public representative, mostly ruling party members, caused inconvenience to the devotees as the queue line was stopped several times to facilitate darshan for VIPs.

The line was stopped for the visit of Governor Tamilisai Soudararajan and Himachal Pradesh Governor Bandaru Dattatreya for an hour and the stoppage was for more than an hour for the visit of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao putting devotees through great ordeal.

The worst came with visit of countless leaders of ruling party — MLAs, MLCs, chairpersons — each of whom came with large numbers of followers and either bulldozed their way or got protocol honours much to displeasure of those standing in endless queues enduring leg pains and dwindling energies. Those carrying children had a tough time dealing with the scenario. Many of the devotees carried large lumps of jaggery over their head to offer to the deities.

Once the VIPs left, the devotees were allowed to enter the temple but there was a lot of pressure with jammed queue lines. Despite the situation, the police managed to bring the situation under control. At a point, the force of the devotees threw down the barricades and some got injured.

On the other hand, public representatives brought their family members and also their followers through the VIP darshan route. They broke the lines to take a short cut to the altar. At the same time, the convoy of vehicles brought by the public representative were halted right in front of the temple throwing the decency and decorum to winds.

The barricades extending to long distances were full and people jostled to move ahead. At the VIP line there was chaos for a while as hundreds broke the line and rushed towards altar from the VVIP route near the watch tower. Police had very tough time controlling the crowds.

Police blocked the flow of devotees and diverted them to other entrances. Some side exits got turned into entrances as police diverted people from the queue line to ease the flow and avoid a stampede. At least 70 lakh devotees attended the Jatara so far, according to officials. There was continuous flow of devotees through the night and day.

Devotees filled either side of the Jampannavagu along its stretch for nearly four kilometres beyond the bathing ghats. To help the devotees, huge shelters were built at various points and they were all over crowded. Temporary settlements could be seen up to over an extent of seven square kilometres.

Traditional attire

There were numerous processions by devotees who were dressed in traditional tribal attire as they arrived at the altar. The devotees who came near the altar hurled coconuts, turmeric and vermilion packets, rice wrapped in towels, new sarees and towels, coins and currency notes in large numbers. The altar got full several times and the endowment staff cleared the offerings and packed them in bags. Of the 534 hundis, nearly 100 were full which were shifted from the altar and new ones were placed inside for devotees offering money.

The officials had a hard time controlling the huge crowds and also maintaining the sanitation. District Collector R V Karnan, IG Y. Nagi Reddy, SP S. S. G. Patil and other officials were seen moving around monitoring the proceedings of the jatara.

Return journey

The lucky ones who had darshan of the deities began returning to their destinations on bullock carts, tractors and buses singing and hailing the goddesses.

261,2020/02/07,Medaram Jatara-bound pilgrims fill Vemulawada temple coffers en route,"RAJANNA-SIRCILLA: The biennial Samakka-Sarakka Jatara in Medaram has come as a boon and collections are up at Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada of Rajanna-Sircilla district.

The Devasthanam had earned a whopping ₹ 14.38 crore during the last one month following the arrival of lakhs of devotees, and through hundi collections (donations by devotees), Arjita Seva tickets, prasadam, and other sources.

A traditional ritual

It may be mentioned here that it is an old ritual for devotees going on a pilgrimage to Samakka-Sarakka jatara in Medaram to first offer prayers at the Vemulawada temple for smooth passage.

Lakhs of pilgrims had visited the temple in the last one month to offer prayers to the presiding deities at Vemulawada and participate in special pujas and ritual of tying an ox (Kode Mokku) as part of a vow. Pilgrims headed to Medaram Jatara had started pouring at the Vemulawada shrine from January first week onwards and it reached its peak till February 4.

Kode Mokku ticket price up

Temple sources said the Devasthanam has earned ₹ 4,91,76,208 cash only through hundi collections. Followed by a record ₹ 3,79,94,861 only through the sale of Kode Mokku ticket sales - whose price has been increased from ₹ 100 to ₹ 200 recently. From prasadam sales , the temple earned ₹ 1,71,18,670. With the devathanam’s inadequate accommodation facilities, the temple could collect only ₹ 33,95,500 in rent.

The adjoining Baddi Pochamma Temple of the Vemulawada Devasthanam earned ₹ 26, 52,890 through the puja ticket sales, and other adjoining temples have collected ₹ 3,35,04,460. Thanks to the Medaram Jatara, the temple netted a whopping ₹ 14,38,42,590 this season. Compare this with ₹ 11.11 crore in 2018. This year, the shrine’s income was up eased by ₹ 3.27 crore. Incidentally, the temple authorities faced the wrath of the pilgrims during the period following poor sanitation and other facilities. Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar had issued a notice to Executive Officer Krishnaveni for this.

Miffed pilgrims

Against the backdrop of the bad experiences during the Medaram pilgrims rush, the temple authorities were instructed to provide adequate arrangements for devotees during the annual Mahasivaratri celebrations, to be held from February 20 to 22, including the main festival on February 21.

Ganga Raju with a firearm, suspected to be an AK- 47. The incident took place on Thursday night. According to sources, both of them had a dispute over a compound wall for the past three months.

Sources said that around 9 p.m. on Thursday, Sadanandam’s weapon went off when he was loading it in his house. Then, he went to Mr Ganga Raju’s house and allegedly fired twice through the window. No one was injured in the firing.

Meanwhile, villagers reported the incident to the police. By the time police reached the spot, Sadanandam had run away, along with his weapon, from the rear side of the house.

While three police teams led by Husnabad ACP Mahender, Siddipet ACP Rameswar and ACP (Traffic) Balaji were formed to arrest Sadanandam, sources said the accused was in police custody.

The police, however, did not confirm it.

The police seized two cell phones, a weapon-wearing belt, and a sword from the house of Sadanandam. They took his two wives and one of his relatives into custody.

It was stated that Sadanandam, native of Koheda, had been underground for about a decade and it was suspected that he was a former naxalite and he might have carried the weapon since then. Some rounds of bullets were still with the weapon, police said.

Police said an AK- 47 and a carbine gun had been been missing from the Husnabad police station since 2016.

263,2020/02/07,‘Meagre’ allocation may delay Kothapalli-Manoharabad rail line,"The ambitious Kothapalli-Manoharabad railway line — the only railway line to connect Karimnagar district headquarters to Secunderabad — is likely to be delayed further if one goes by the meagre allocation in the Railway Budget by the Union government.

Only ₹235 crore was allocated for the project in Budget for 2020-21. With this, the project cost, which was estimated at ₹1,160 crore, has jumped to ₹1,500 crore.

KCR’s ambitious project

It may be recalled that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had proposed the ambitious Kothapalli-Manoharabad railway line connecting the temple towns of Vemulawada and Komuravelli, and Sircilla, Siddipet and Gajwel towns, when he was the Karimnagar MP in 2004.

Following the Chief Minister’s request, the government had allocated ₹10 crore to conduct a survey in 2006. Then, the project cost was estimated at ₹1,160 crore to lay the 151-km line.

Later, the Railways informed that the project was not feasible.

But the Chief Minister assured to bear one-third of the project cost, and give land free of cost to the Railways. When the Railways told him about incurring losses, Mr. KCR consented for annuity payment for the first five years after the completion of the project.

Chugging along

After so many assurances from the State government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the project in August 2016 and the Railways had allocated ₹350 crore in the 2017-18 Budget, and ₹150 crore in 2018-19, ₹200 crore in 2019-20, and ₹235 crore in 2020-21.

The first phase of the railway line measuring 32 km from Manoharabad to Gajwel was completed. The second phase from Gajwel to Siddipet was progressing after completion of land acquisition.

The third phase from Siddipet to Sircilla should be taken up after completion of land acquisition.

Now, in Sircilla town, the Railways needs to construct a huge bridge like the Rajahmundry Bridge across the Godavari on the Mid Manair Dam reservoir following the backwaters touching the textile town.

160 more bridges

The railway line requires another 160 bridges, seven road-over-bridges, 49 road-under-bridges and 13 railway stations. These include Nacharam, Iranagaram, Gajwel, Kodakandla, Lakhadaram, Duddeda, Siddipet, Gurralagondi, Chinnalingapur, Sircilla, Vemulawada, Boinpalli and Vedira.

264,2020/02/07,Jatara — an opportunity to bond with relatives,"The jatara — congregation of people around a temple — is what the hardworking rural folk look forward to all through the year.

The jatara gives them the sought-after break from the monotony of daily grind. The pilgrimage to places like Sammakka-Sarakka jatara at Medaram inculcates them with a sense of devotion and exposes them to a variety of things. Many find their relatives, lost by time and distance, and have a cheerful time.

People from nook and corners of the State came in processions and swarmed the entire Medaram village and surrounding habitations. They pitched temporary tents and made merry before and after praying at the altar. They sacrificed animals, boozed and dozed off in the winter chill in the woods.

Information overload

Unlike other places, the jatara at Medaram offered every kind of education and entertainment. There are huge digital display boards belting out State government welfare programmes and message-oriented films on social evils. There were on display and demo of agricultural implementations by branded companies. There are scores of tribals in their peculiar attire selling herbs, then there are recording dance theatres, giant wheels, camel rides, circus companies, makeshift bar and restaurants and what not?

This is the place where no-holds barred and hence many non-tribals are attracted to this place. They enjoy the wilderness drinking and dancing their time for a while. Of course the increased participation of non-tribals and their little regard for the actual purpose of jatara robbed the rustic charm of the event.

Temporary stalls

On the other side, every inch of this village is auctioned and petty tradesmen and women came from different corners of the country. Hundreds of temporary stalls came up on either side of the narrow pathways leading to the main altar selling food, tea, coconuts, flowers, incense, vermilion, childrens’ toys, cheap clothes and plethora of pilgrims’ souvenirs.

The elderly tribals settled for a drink while the youth went on hunting for entertainment shows. The women restricted themselves mostly to cooking. The women during the day time took a holy dip and invoked goddess onto them. Swathed in turmeric, sporting garlands of flowers, balancing decorated vessels on head and possessed by the spirit, they danced their way to the altar.

Non-tribals

This Jatara is predominantly celebrated by the tribals who revere their clan members Sammakka and Sarakka as Gods who died while fighting the mighty Kakatiya rulers’ centuries ago. Tribals from Odissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and different parts of the State turn up for the event.

265,2020/02/07,Adilabad cotton farmers find bengal gram cultivation rewarding,"One of the prudent things that cotton farmers in the former composite Adilabad district have done was to terminate their kharif crop in November-December last year at the suggestion of Agriculture Department and scientists.

The result of experts’ advice?

The prospect of a good harvest of the bengal gram that they cultivated in rabi after uprooting cotton.

Officials and scientists had suggested that farmers desist from prolonging the life of the cotton crop by irrigating it beyond December to prevent pink bollworm pestilence. The usual practice among farmers is to harvest cotton even in March.

Increased yields

“The area under bengal gram cultivation is 32,000 hectares in Adilabad district alone, an increase of about 10,000 hectares over the normal extent,” disclosed Adilabad Agriculture Officer (Technical) K. Shiva Kumar that more farmers have opted for this crop.

“The yield is likely to be in the range of eight to nine quintals per acre in case of early sowings (October to end-November) and about six quintals for those who went in for sowing in December,” he added.

The government will purchase bengal gram, around five lakh quintals, once harvesting of the crop starts towards the end of February. The minimum support price (MSP) which will be ₹ 4,875 per quintal.

Assured purchase

The Marketing Department has already proposed to purchase red gram through 10 centres. The expected production of red gram in the 24,000 hectare extent in which it has been cultivated in Adilabad is about two lakh quintals.

“The government will purchase about 1.5 lakh quintals of red gram as the remaining 50,000 quintals will be held back by farmers for personal consumption. The farmers stand to benefit through the MSP operations,” Mr. Shiva Kumar added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/c2lkh6/article30755628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07LABOURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adilabad-cotton-farmers-find-bengal-gram-cultivation-rewarding/article30755629.ece
266,2020/02/07,Festive spirit prevails in Karimnagar too,"A festive spirit is prevailing in various parts of integrated Karimnagar district with mini jataras being held on a par with Medaram Jatara in neighbouring Mulugu district.

The vegetable markets, labour addas wore a deserted look.

Following the thin attendance of students, various private educational institutions have declared holiday on Friday (the most important day of the jatara where tribal deities would be sitting on the altars for the pujas). The government schools have declared optional holiday to enable to the students to attend the jatara.

At the jatara venues, the pilgrims are visiting in hordes to offer prayers to the tribal deities. The jaggery and coconut sellers are doing brisk business. The devotees were seen sacrificing cocks and sheep at the altars to appease the tribal goddesses. Some of the devotees were seen participating in ‘Edurukollu’ (flying of cocks in the air) as a ritual.

267,2020/02/07,"In our country, it is necessary to tell the people exactly where we stand: SAI chief","For Sandip Pradhan, who took over as Director General of Sports Authority of India (SAI) last August, the challenges are many: from identifying talent at the grassroots to producing Olympic medallists. In his first media interview, he details the steps being taken to develop a culture of sport and improve competitive performance. He also casts a realistic eye over the state of affairs ahead of the 2020 Olympics, where P.V. Sindhu, Bajrang Punia, Manu Bhaker, and Neeraj Chopra, among others, will be aiming to get on the podium. Excerpts:

Can you begin by sharing your views on Indian sport in general and the Olympics in particular?

At the Olympics, there are two issues — medals and prospects. Also the support to the players. I remember in 2016, the Mission Olympic Committee (MOC) and a fast-track mechanism were set up. By the time it came into existence, it was a little late as far as preparations were concerned. Under the chairmanship of [then DG] Injeti Srinivas, whatever the players wanted was given. Unfortunately, the result [two medals] was not commensurate with India’s potential. We are in the process of getting better.

How do you look at Tokyo 2020?

We want to present a realistic possibility. Because the moment somebody says ‘my expectation is 20 medals’ and it comes from a responsible person, the message that goes out is that we may get 20 medals. Then we say 10 medals, so the public expectation is 10 medals. I think, in our country, it is very necessary to tell the people exactly where we stand. Maybe we should make a conservative estimate and surpass it rather than increase people’s expectations beyond what is probably not achievable in this Olympics.

The other theory which we discuss with the federations [National Sports Federations] is of the probability of a medal. There are sports where on that particular day, even a World No. 1 may not win a medal. We have to make the assessment about what the event is, how much the probability of winning is. In the case of swimming or athletics, if somebody is top-three in the world, there is a high probability of a medal. In a sport like shooting, even if you are number eight, the probability on that day is good while [the probability of] a number 1-2-3 not getting a medal is also high.

What would you say about India’s sporting culture? How can it be developed?

Let’s understand that excellence in the Olympics and a culture of sports are different. Maybe in the long term, a culture of sports will lead to excellence in the Olympics. For example, if people in the country are interested in playing kho-kho, kabaddi, football or cricket, there is a fair amount of culture of sports, but that may not lead to excellence in the Olympics. First you need to fulfil an athlete’s basic needs, then we can talk about culture of sports.

How do you achieve that?

For that you need to make the schools and kids realise that it is important to play for fitness and a good lifestyle. They have to realise that playing can give you a livelihood. And even if there is no livelihood but there is heroism, a kid would want to emulate that. These heroes are made by the media. It cannot be done by the government or media or corporates alone, it will have to be the society’s effort.

Where exactly do the National Sports Federations figure in this process?

We have never had a problem with an NSF’s long-term objectives. The issue is of speed, which may be different. The federations have a larger role in guiding a player — where he can reach, what are the norms of the sport. The High Performance Directors (HPDs) in the NSFs work very closely with TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme). Selection of athletes in MOC is on the recommendation of NSFs or research done by our team.

How do you strike a balance between support for deserving athletes and supporting sports or teams that do not rank high enough? Like the situation with handball at the Asian Games, for instance…

These are two different things. One is long term for the Olympics and the other is participation in specific tournaments. It is the government’s decision to come up with certain norms for participation and whether to give relaxations. Also, if we have to send only the top-six or eight, that doesn’t mean we will not fund other federations. The issue of participation versus medal will always be there. Unless we ensure participation, we won’t get medals in the long term. If we had not funded hockey after finishing 12th in London, it wouldn’t have reached the current position. To clear participation in a multi-discipline competition is a government’s prerogative. In the larger perspective, we cannot say the money needed to fund an elite athlete was diverted to fund the travel of the handball teams. I don’t think that was the case.

Say the SAI talent scouts have identified a 10-year-old. What happens next?

Our Khelo India Talent Development Scheme is where the second-level preparations come in. That’s where you identify young talent and groom them for an average period of eight years. For each discipline, we have made a talent development and talent identification committee. These are not SAI committees; most of their members are Arjuna and Dronacharya awardees with one representative from the federation and maybe one from SAI. We have identified 20 disciplines and prepared a list of talented players. Then we have accredited academies — run by SAI, State governments or private [bodies]. Once a talented kid is identified, we give him an option to join an academy of his choice. The moment he does, we give ₹5 lakh per year to the academy to train that child. Apart from that, we give extra money to individual players in expensive sports like shooting. Around 2,700 athletes have already been identified, out of which about 1,300 are already in accredited academies. It’s a system we are trying to build. The Army Sports Institute, the Gopichand Academy, the P.T. Usha Academy, the JSW Foundation are all accredited. It’s a seamless process.

How do you track them over this period?

We have hired HPDs to track the performance of such athletes. We have also identified very good coaches and performance managers for multiple sports. They visit these academies and have finalised sports science and assessment protocols for every discipline. The assessment will have two parts ? physical and competition. We are also developing the National Sports Repository System, which will have separate player, coach and academy information systems. The player information section will have performance, competition and sports science and fitness. Once it is ready, players in academies will be required to upload their data and can be tracked from anywhere.

What other steps have you introduced?

We are building new hostels, have hired dieticians and chefs, and the general feedback is that the quality of food has improved substantially. Khelo India is now looking at SAI, State government, elite and private academies equally, and as an individual you have the option of which academy to go to. We are requesting private academies to increase their capacity. The Prakash Padukone Academy is coming up with a 150-bed residential hostel by April. If a kid wants to go to a private academy, it is for me or my Regional Director to wake up and try and match the facilities.

How are you protecting your athletes?

We have a call centre for all our SAI training centres and accredited academies, we get a lot of calls and we are also acting on them. Recently, we dismissed a coach. There is zero tolerance for sexual harassment.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/u928ig/article30765844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sandip-pradhan-01s,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/in-our-country-it-is-necessary-to-tell-the-people-exactly-where-we-stand/article30765845.ece

270,2020/02/07,Animation artist Appu VK gives a twist to popular villains in Malayalam cinema with his caricatures,"He grins and says in gay abandon, ‘Shammi heroyaada… hero’. Appu VK enjoyed Fahadh Faasil’s psychotic Shammi in Kumbalangi Nights so much that the animation artist in him wasted no time in caricaturising the character.

“A bat was the first creature that came to mind... It flies, but is not a bird. Shammi too has that dual personality. Also because bats have always been associated with horror in our films, especially now when they are known to transmit so many deadly diseases,” he says with a laugh.

Shammi from ‘Kumbalangi Nights’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

It’s not only Shammi who has been given “stylish caricaturisation” by the artist. He has taken up six more popular villains from Malayalam cinema and has reinterpreted them by associating each role with a particular animal. The re-imagined characters, in their respective costume, are posted on his Facebook page (Appu VK).

The villains in the list are Keerikkadan Jose (Kireedam), Kulappully Appan (Aaram Thamburan), John Honayi (In Harihar Nagar), Appani Ravi (Angamaly Diaries), Rawther (Vietnam Colony), and Swami Amoorthananda (Ekalavyan).

Appu | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

“Each caricature has been developed based on some aspect related to the character. For example, in the case of Keerikkadan Jose (played by Mohan Raj), I took the word ‘keeri’, meaning mongoose, from his name and worked around that. Appani Ravi (Sarath Kumar or Appani Sarath) is associated with pig farms in the film and although he is skinny, in order to bring out the villainy, I connected his image with a wild boar,” explains the 26-year-old.

Rawther from ‘Vietnam Colony’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Telugu actor Vijayaranga Raja, who filled the screen with his massive physique as Rawther, has been sketched as a bear. Swami Amoorthananda (Narendra Prasad), the godman with thick hair and beard, running a drug cartel, reminded Appu of a lion-tailed macaque; John Honayi was easy to imagine like a fox.

Among his favourites is Kulappully Appan, the cunning feudal lord essayed with a flourish by Narendra Prasad, picturised as an alligator. Of course, it has that cut across his right eye as well! “I am scared of alligators. Choosing the animal complemented the final fight sequences shot on a river bank. Keerikkadan, the last one I made, is special because I felt I improved myself by then. However, I feel Shammi and Appani Ravi could’ve been better,” he says.

Keerikkadan Jose from ‘Kireedam’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

One character he couldn’t include was Mundakkal Sekharan from Devasuram. “By that time I felt bored and wanted to move on to something else,” he chuckles.

He points out that the series is like “a warming-up session” to his future experiments in making caricatures. A native of Attingal, Appu is currently on a “forced break” from his job at Fujian in China following the outbreak of Coronavirus. “I started working on this series in China, did some of it while on the flight back home and finished it at home where I am now quarantined,” says Appu, who finished his course in animation from Toonz Animation in Technopark.

After working with the company, he moved to Dreamworks in Bengaluru before moving to China three years ago to work with Base FX, three-time Emmy Award-winning visual effects and animation company.

The first Hollywood project he has worked on, Wish Dragon, is slated to release in a few months’ time. “For me, animation is a stepping stone to cinema.

271,2020/02/07,Once upon a bolster cushion,"An elephant-headed man in a suit. Maharajas riding flying fish. Alexander Gorlizki’s art — which uses Indian miniature painting to depict whimsical, yet contemporary interpretations of everyday things — often gets a double take. But with his latest exhibition at Gallery Ark in Vadodara, the Brooklyn-based artist is looking beyond the picture frames. “I thought about how you can move art away from the wall, almost dripping out of the painting and starting to take over the space around,” Gorlizki, 53, tells me over the phone, in the midst of moving his pieces from his Jaipur studio to Vadodara. Experimenting with forms through furniture and fabric, Otherworldly Interiors explores the personal and protean meanings of ordinary objects. It is “a play on domestic settings in a dream-like way, but that also [hints at] dreaming inwardly”.

Alexander Gorlizki

Incongruity in the everyday

Some of the pieces on display include wallpapers born out of Mughal miniatures — “I’ve taken leaves, waves and other elements to develop patterns around them” — and hammers painted with animal prints. “They are functional objects,” he explains, “but they sort of lose their function because they become hyper-decorated.” Gorlizki explores this tension by elevating objects with the suggestion of a story. Take, for instance, the earthenware pots he collected from around Jaipur. By transposing his designs on to the simple form, he creates a slightly incongruous object (the colour scheme of one pot is inspired by American artist Sol LeWitt’s vibrant minimalist art). “Some pieces look like they may have come from another planet. There’s a sense of ‘What are they? Were they ritual objects?’.”

His fascination with such “props” is not new. The artist pins the beginning of this interest on bolster cushions that he had spotted in the backdrop of an erotic Rajput miniature almost 30 years ago, which had seemed almost animated to his eyes. “I imagined them taking on a dynamic energy and having a life of their own,” he recalls.

A visual approach

Not finding their craft lucrative, he sees a re-imagining of the skill and its visual vocabulary as the key to bringing vitality back to the art form. “Hopefully, it honours and keeps the tradition going,” he says.

Berggruen Hammers

Ironically, he stresses that what he is doing is not particularly original. “It is not important to me if something is original or not; what is important is that it is worth looking at and gives something to people to dream about or ponder.” His vocabulary is inspired by artists like Louise Bourgeois, the French-American feminist whose hard-to-peg works toed the line between surrealism and abstract expressionism; Marcel Broodthaers, the Belgian poet-turned-artist whose surrealist oeuvre has humorous undercurrents; and Austrian Franz West’s playful conceptual art. But he also finds jali work, Islamic geometric patterns and Victorian lace-making just as visually arresting.

He felt that the market, often informed by tourism, encouraged replication of subjects and ideas, and within that context, he began experimenting with form and developing his imagery through the skill of trained miniaturists. “There is so much talent here. The idea was to find ways of experiencing that and maybe redirecting it in a slightly different way,” he says, describing his work as “watching children play” — the way new elements are incorporated to build games. “It has to do with mental agility and going on an adventure, and Otherworldly Interiors is just that, a launchpad to somewhere else,” he concludes.

Otherworldly Interiors is on at Gallery Ark, Vadodara, till March 7.

272,2020/02/07,Maharashtra mulls free power for consumers using upto 100 units,"In the wake of a possible hike in power tariff for users of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MAHADISCOM), the State government on Friday mooted the idea of extending free power to domestic consumers using 100 units.

The move to study the feasibility of waiving of tariff comes without any demand from either a group or organisation representing consumers. Shiv Sena in its manifesto ahead of Assembly elections last year had promised concession of up to 30% to consumers using electricity up to 300 units.

Power minister Dr. Nitin Raut said, “There are three challenges ahead of us. To cut the losses, stop leakage of electricity and to collect pending bills without harming the interests of the people. Once we achieve this, we will move towards the next step of analysing whether we can waive off tariff for consumers using power up to 100 units.”

Dr. Raut added that MAHADISCOM has been asked to submit a proposal to the power department within three months. “We will analyse the proposal and if it satisfies the department officials, we will go ahead with it,” he added.

At present, the power department extends subsidies worth ₹9,000 crore annually to various users including agriculture, powerloom, textile industry and also in regions like Marathwada and Vidarbha. With over 40 lakh consumers falling in 0-00 unit user category, the government is looking at an additional expenditure of ₹150 crore per month.

“Our original demand was for benefits to over one crore consumers using 100-300 units. I see the bid to waive off tariff for users in the 0-100 units bracket is a political move and nothing else,” said Pratap Hogade, president, Maharashtra Power Consumer Association and an expert from the sector. He said those using more than 300 units need not be given benefits.

Mr. Hogade said the State government should ideally concentrate on reducing power tariff for industries, which is 30 to 40% more than many other States.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-mulls-free-power-for-consumers-using-upto-100-units/article30765855.ece
273,2020/02/07,J&K administration extends 2G mobile data services till February 15,"The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Friday announced the extension of 2G mobile data service in the union territory till February 15.

The order to this effect was issued by Principal Secretary, Home Department, Shaleen Kabra, here in the evening. It also increased the whitelisted sites available for mobile data users in the union territory to 481.

The order said Mr. Kabra reviewed the restrictions on mobile data services “with regard to its impact on the security situation and to reports of law enforcement agencies, which have highlighted the usage of the internet for carrying out terror activities at various places, as well as the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for this purpose despite measures taken by the telecom service providers (TSP).”

The order referred to the recent encounter at Ban Toll Plaza in the Nagrota area of Jammu; grenade attack in Pratap Park, Srinagar and a gunfight near Shalteng on Srinagar-Baramulla National Highway.

While three Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists were killed and three overground workers arrested when security forces intercepted a Kashmir-bound truck at Nagrota on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, eight persons, including two CRPF jawans were injured in the grenade attack in Srinagar. Two terrorists were killed and another arrested near Shalteng when they were intercepted by security forces while moving towards Srinagar.

“...The directions or restrictions contained in dated January 31 shall continue to remain operative till February 15, unless modified earlier,” Mr. Kabra said in the order.

The 2G internet facility on mobile phones was restored for a week in Jammu and Kashmir on January 25 after remaining suspended since August 5 last year when the Centre announced nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution applicable to the erstwhile state and also bifurcated it into union territories — Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.

274,2020/02/07,Sheena Bora murder case: Indrani Mukerjea says Rai demanded ₹50 lakh for not testifying against her,"Indrani Mukerjea, a prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, claimed before a trial court in Mumbai on Friday that accused-turned approver Shyamvar Rai had demanded ₹50 lakh from her for not testifying against her.

Indrani Mukerjea made the submission while arguing in person on her bail application before special CBI judge J.C. Jagdale.

While deposing in the court, Shyamvar Rai, her former driver, narrated a different sequence of events, while he had told something else to the Mumbai police (who probed the case initially), she said.

“If he is not going to say [state] important details then what is the role of approver?” she asked.

The sequence of events as presented by the prosecution was not supported by the call data record, Indrani argued.

Before Rai turned approver, he was lodged at Arthur Road Jail, and they used to travel to the court in the same van, she said.

“Before his deposition he had a conversation with me, ‘₹50 lakh dedo kuch nahi bolunga’ (give me ₹50 lakh, I won’t reveal anything),” she alleged.

“He came down to ₹10 lakh and then to ₹5 lakh...but I didn’t budge... if I had to influence him I could have done then. But I didn’t budge and said jo bolna hai bolo [say whatever you want],” Indrani claimed.

Indrani also pointed out the Bombay High Court’s order on Thursday, granting bail to co-accused and her former husband Peter Mukerjea.

“If the high court doesn’t feel that he could influence witnesses, why should this court [should feel that she would],” she asked.

The prosecution had opposed bail for her, stating that she could influence witnesses, especially Rahul, Peter Mukerjea’s son from earlier marriage.

“Peter is more influential, prominent person in society, he is father of Rahul and he is out on bail,” she said.

It is to be noted that Peter Mukerjea is still in jail as the HC stayed the bail order for six weeks.

“It is ridiculous that I committed murder for money thinking that if she [Sheena] gets married to Rahul, Peter will give property to Rahul... 75% of immovable property is in my name and rest is in joint name with me....so logically I should kill Peter,” she added.

This is Indrani’s fifth bail plea.

275,2020/02/07,PM Modi urged to withdraw cases against NDFB leaders,"The Bodoland Territorial Council chief Hagrama Mohilary on Friday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that all criminal cases against the cadres of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) are withdrawn.

Mr. Mohilary, who was himself a militant till 2003, made the request at an official function held in Assam to celebrate the signing of the Bodo Accord.

PM Modi, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Governor Jagdish Mukhi were present at the programme.

“For the NDFB, all cases should be withdrawn. whether they are heinous or non-heinous,” Mr. Mohilary said addressing the gathering in which surrendered leaders of different factions of NDFB were present.

Mr. Modi in his address did not mention anything about withdrawal of the cases.

According to the peace accord, criminal cases against the members of NDFB for non-heinous crimes will be withdrawn by the Assam government as per the law.

Criminal cases registered in connection with heinous crimes will be reviewed case by case according to the existing policy on the subject, the agreement said.

Citing his own past as example, Mr. Mohilary said that all cases against members of the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) were withdrawn after the outfit entered into an agreement with the government in 2003, leading to the creation of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).

The BLT members had formed the Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF), which is in power in BTC and is also an alliance partner of the ruling BJP in the State government.

All the factions of the NDFB along with All Bodo Students Union and United Bodo People’s Organisation had signed the accord with the government on January 27, 2020 which provided political and economic bonanza to the Bodoland region sans a separate State or Union Territory.

Following this, a total 1,615 cadres from all the factions of NDFB laid down their arms on January 30 and deposited their arms and ammunition.

NDFB’s Ranjan Daimary faction had carried out serial bomb blasts across Assam on October 30, 2008 that claimed 88 lives and left more than 500 injured.

Daimary, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the blasts, was released on interim bail on January 25 to participate in the Bodo peace talks with the Centre.

The NDFB(S), another dreaded faction, had killed 43 people, mostly from the minority community, in Baksa and Kokrajhar districts in May 2014.

In more attacks, the outfit killed at least 81 people, including 76 adivasis, in Sonitpur, Kokrajhar, Baksa and Chirang districts in December that year.

During the signing of the agreement, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said over 4,000 lives were lost in the region due to insurgency by the Bodos which had continued for several decades.

Speaking at the function Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma invited ULFA(I) militants to peace talks by abjuring violence for permanent peace in the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/womox9/article30763676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07IN-BODO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pm-modi-urged-to-withdraw-heinous-cases-against-ndfb-leaders/article30763564.ece
276,2020/02/07,Akal Takht mulls over ban on mobile phones inside Golden Temple,"Banning mobile phones inside the Golden Temple complex will have to be “thought over” if visitors continue to click selfies and shoot TikTok videos inside the holiest Sikh shrine, Jathedar [head priest] of the Akal Takht, the top temporal body of Sikhs, Giani Harpreet Singh said on Friday.

“We want all devotees to visit the Golden Temple without any hassle and we are not in favour of imposing any such [mobile] ban but the way the incidents of TikTok are surfacing, I think imposing ban on carrying mobile phones inside [Golden Temple] will have to be pondered in the future,” Mr. Singh told reporters in Amritsar.

The Jathedar also pointed out that some of the devotees even argue with ‘sewadars’ [workers] upon being stopped from clicking photos inside the premises.

“It is a very serious problem,” said the Jathedar, advising devotees to refrain from doing such acts.

Photography and videography in the precincts of the Golden Temple have already been banned by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to avoid any “disturbance” to the spiritual atmosphere.

Notice boards in the marbled periphery of the Sikh shrine, prohibiting devotees to click photos and make videos, have also been installed. However, devotees continue to take selfies with the Golden Temple in the background.

The Jathedar’s statement comes two days after a TikTok video shot inside the Golden Temple by three girls with a Punjabi song playing in the background went viral on social media.

A police complaint was lodged to identify the girls.

It was the second such incident in a short span of time as in January, a police complaint was lodged against a girl for hurting religious sentiments of Sikhs after she shot a dance video inside the Darbar Sahib complex. Later, the girl had to apologise.

Meanwhile, endorsing the views of the Akal Takht Jathedar, SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal said strict action was needed to stop people from making TikTok videos in the precincts of the Golden Temple.

“We will have to take strict action if such incidents do not stop,” said Mr. Longowal.

He said more SGPC workers would be deployed to prevent devotees from making videos inside the Golden Temple complex.

“We will also discuss this issue in the upcoming meeting of the executive committee of the SGPC on February 12,” Mr. Longowal said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/le57t5/article30763193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Golden-Temple,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akal-takht-mulls-over-ban-on-mobile-phones-inside-amritsar-golden-temple/article30763188.ece
277,2020/02/07,Jagdeep Dhankhar reads speech critical of CAA in W.B. Assembly,"West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday stuck to convention in delivering the speech provided by the State’s Trinamool Congress government and included remarks critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While the Governor had earlier hinted that he might omit or add certain portions, he ended up reading the 25-page speech prepared by the State government, without making any alterations to it. Later, Mr. Dhankhar tweeted that his speech was “in the high traditions of (the) Constitution” and expressed the hope that “all will pay due obeisance to the Constitution”.

“This is the only way to serve the people and enhance democratic values. I urge those in authority to desist from methodology not sanctified by Constitution,” the Governor posted on his Twitter account.

Earlier, addressing members of the State’s Assembly Mr. Dhankhar not only “mourned the tragic end of those brave sons of India who lost their lives during protests against the CAA in different parts of the country” but also added that the State government “is strongly against division of people in the name of steps like NPR or NRC or CAA”. The Governor also referred to the resolution passed by the West Bengal Assembly against the NRC on September 6, 2019, and the January 27 resolution urging repeal of the CAA.

There was widespread speculation in political circles on whether the Governor would read the speech prepared by the State government or make any changes to it.

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) Legislature party held a meeting ahead of the Governor’s address. A number of members of the Treasury benches came to the House on Friday wearing head bands bearing slogans protesting the CAA, NPR and NRC. They also wore posters with the preamble of the Constitution written on them. There was no disruption in the House when the Governor read the speech for almost an hour. After finishing his speech the Governor had tea with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the office of the Speaker of the Assembly Biman Banerjee. Later in the evening Mr. Dhankhar summoned the State’s Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, where a discussion was likely on the State Budget scheduled to be presented on February 10.

“There is a general air of intolerance, bigotry and hatred that is straining the variegated thread of unity tying together all the linguistic, religious and ethnic diversities of the country,” Mr. Dhankhar said in his speech, adding that the need of the “moment is a deep introspection and re-dedication to the guiding principles enshrined in our Constitution”.

The State’s Congress party-led Opposition, however, described the development as an understanding between the TMC government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre.

“There is nothing in the Governor’s speech which is critical of the Centre,” Leader of the Opposition and Congress MLA Abdul Mannan, told journalists. “It is a got up game between the State and Centre,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/beudtu/article30763467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHANKAR-MAMATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-governor-averts-showdown-in-assembly-sticks-to-speech-prepared-by-mamata-banerjee-government/article30763019.ece
278,2020/02/07,ABVP fields candidates for Jadavpur University,"In a first, the RSS-affiliated ABVP has fielded candidates for the February 9 students’ union polls in Jadavpur University, known to be a hotbed of Left-wing politics.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has fielded candidates for the central panels of the Engineering and the Arts faculties, its joint secretary Shyamasree Karmakar said.

The central panels have two chairpersons, two general secretaries and four assistant general secretaries.

The ABVP has also fielded candidates for the posts of class representatives. The right-wing outfit and the CPI(M)-backed Student's Federation of India (SFI) are fighting each other for 40 seats in the Arts faculty, and a similar number of seats in the Engineering.

“Jadavpur University doesn’t mean Left citadel. There has been a rise of nationalist forces in the varsity and we are hopeful of doing very well,” said Suvadeep Karmakar, chairperson of the ABVP’s Arts department unit in the JU.

“The general students are peeved with the disruptive policies of gherao and demonstrations by the Left-leaning students and anti-national slogans raised during agitations and are looking for a change,” he added.

The SFI, however, exuded confidence about winning the polls.

“Right-wing forces will not be able to make inroads in the liberal space of JU any time,” said SFI leader Debraj Debnath.

He claimed the spontaneous participation of general students in several anti-CAA protests on the campus showed that the ABVP has no place in the varsity.

280,2020/02/07,Elgaar Parishad case: Pune court order on NIA’s plea on Feb. 14,"A special court dealing with offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on Friday reserved its order on the application filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) seeking transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case materials to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

Following the arguments of counsel for the Pune Police, Additional Sessions Judge (special) S.R. Navandar said he would pronounce the order on February 14.

Earlier, Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar, representing the Pune Police, argued against the case being transferred to the NIA court in Mumbai and submitted that the NIA’s plea was “legally untenable”.

Advocate Pawar noted that the alleged offence had been committed within the jurisdiction of the Pune court and argued that the State had established a special court in Pune that was capable of dealing with the said offences under the NIA Act.

“The investigation authority [the Pune Police] have already completed their probe and have filed the main as well as the supplementary charge sheets in the case,” she said, adding that the city police had collected ample evidence against the nine arrested activists in the case as well as against academic-writer Anand Teltumbde and activist Gautam Navlakha.

On Thursday, counsels for the nine activists arrested in the case told the court that only the Bombay High Court had the power to transfer the case to the NIA court in Mumbai.

The Pune police’s response to the NIA’s application underscored the tug-of-war that has erupted between the Centre and the State governments following the regime change in Maharashtra with the formation of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

While the Pune Police had zealously prosecuted the Elgaar Parishad case and arrested noted intellectuals and activists when the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government was in power in the State, the present now seems to be procrastinating in handing over the case records to the NIA.

Incidentally, the FIR filed by the NIA does not include the sections pertaining to sedition invoked by the Pune Police against the accused activists like sections 121 (waging war against government of India) and 121A (conspiracy to commit offence under 121) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Centre’s decision to abruptly transfer the case to the NIA followed reports of the MVA government mulling the formation of a special investigation team to probe the investigation conducted by the Pune Police in case.

Among those arrested in the case include poet-activist P. Varavara Rao, noted trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, activists Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, advocate Surendra Gadling, Prof. Shoma Sen and writer-publisher Sudhir Dhawale — all of whom are presently lodged in Pune’s Yerwada prison.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a0a6nt/article30762099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELGARPARISHAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/elgaar-parishad-case-pune-court-order-on-nias-plea-on-feb-14/article30762100.ece

The move is aimed at boosting research in sugarcane farming for agriculturists in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions.

“The land in Patharwala village of Ambad taluka in Jalna district has been allotted to Pune-based VSI on 30 years lease as per ready reckoner rates,” an official said on Thursday.

The VSI was established in 1975 by sugarcane growers of the cooperative sugar factories. The institute performs scientific, technical and educational functions relevant to the sugar industry under one umbrella.

NCP president and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar is the chairman of the institute.

When contacted, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope, a member of the VSI governing council, said the decision to allot the land was aimed at boosting research in sugarcane farming in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions.

“It will be a boon to the farmers in these two regions,” he said.

“VSI centre in Jalna district will play a major role in academic, extension and research for sugarcane growers,” he said.

He said the VSI centre will provide sugarcane seeds to farmers and conduct research in breeding various varieties of sugarcane.

284,2020/02/07,Protesting women in Deoband shoo away peace panel members,"Women protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Deoband on Thursday showered bangles on members of the peace committee formed by the district administration to reason with them to give up their protest.

The women are protesting against the CAA and the NRC at the Idgah Maidan in the communally sensitive town of Saharanpur district for the last 11 days.

Local sources said the women didn’t allow members of the committee, which included former MLA Mavia Ali and municipal corporation chairman Jamaluddin Ansari, to utter a single word and raised slogans against the CAA-NRC. “The women were furious that some of the members of the committee never showed up to support them during the protest. We shouted ‘go back’ and threw bangles at them. We will not vacate the place till the CAA is rolled back,” said Salma Ehsan of the Murtahida Khawatin Committee, the banner under which women are protesting.

Mr. Ali said they were pushed by the administration to convince the protesters to return home. “But we came during the day when the speeches were on. We will try to convince them during the night. It has been an unusually cold winter and many of them have fallen ill. I, personally, feel they should take a break and return after some days,” the Samajwadi Party leader told The Hindu.

He said this was also important because the BJP was using these protests to polarise the Delhi Assembly elections.

Describing the CAA as unconstitutional, Mr. Ali said the Prime Minister and the Home Minister should make a statement in Parliament that the NRC would never be implemented.

Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Kumar P. said the administration was only trying to convince the protesters to go home after the government has said in Parliament that an all-India NRC was not being conducted.

‘Creating paranoia’

“There is no point in creating paranoia about something that is not intended by the government. They have registered their protest and they could return in future if they find that the government has gone back on its promise,” said Mr. Kumar.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/99lo0k/article30756601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/protesting-women-in-deoband-shoo-away-peace-panel-members/article30756602.ece
285,2020/02/07,Aurangabad woman set on fire by neighbour dies,"The 50-year old Dalit woman, who was set on fire on Sundayby her 40-year-old neighbour after she resisted his move to enter her house died late on Wednesday night, a doctor said on Thursday.

The woman, who suffered 95% burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil was undergoing treatment at a government medical college and hospital in Aurangabad city.

“She died around 10 p.m. on Wednesday,” the hospital’s medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told PTI.

The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), who knew the woman as he resided in her neighbourhood, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said.

As per the woman’s statement given to police before death, she tried to push Mohite out of her house, but in vain.

This led to a quarrel between them following which Mohite set her ablaze, Sillod (rural) police station’s inspector Kiran Bidve said.

“The victim and the accused knew each other and he used to come to her house. But, on Sunday when he came around midnight, she resisted saying meeting at that hour would defame her,” he said.

However, despite her opposition, Mohite entered her house and they had a fight, he said.

“During the quarrel, Mohite poured kerosene kept nearby on the woman and set her afire,” he added.

He then locked the door from outside and ran away, the police said.

On hearing the woman’s screams, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to her rescue and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government hospital in Aurangabad city.

The accused was earlier booked under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), but will now also be charged under 302 (murder), Mr. Bidve said.

He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the official said.

Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court for ensuring justice to the victim and her family.

The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader said he has demanded in Parliament that hearing be conducted in fast-track court in this case and that of a woman set on fire in Wardha district.

Lecturer stable

Meanwhile, the condition of the 25-year-old lecturer who was set ablaze in Wardha district earlier this week continues to remain “critical but stable”, according to hospital authorities.

In a medical bulletin issued on Thursday, the hospital said, “No setbacks have occurred till now, although her condition remains critical. Her vitals are being maintained with oxygen supply. She is responding to commands. Her condition does remain critical.”

286,2020/02/07,‘Only HC has power to transfer Elgaar Parishad case’,"The respective counsels of the Pune Police and the nine activists arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case told a sessions court here on Thursday that only the Bombay High Court had the power to transfer the case to the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai.

The court was hearing their arguments on an application filed by the NIA seeking transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case materials to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

District government pleader Ujjwala Pawar, representing the Pune police, further said that the city police was capable of conducting the investigations and that there was no need for NIA to take over the Elgaar Parishad probe in its present stage.

Ms. Pawar pointed out that the main charge sheet as well as the supplementary charge sheet had already been filed by the Pune police in the case, stating that there was no need for the NIA to take over the case at this stage.

Additional Sessions Judge (special) S.R. Navandar posted the next hearing for Friday.

The Pune Police’s response to the NIA’s application underscored the tug-of-war between the Centre and State governments following formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

While the police had pursued the case and arrested prominent intellectuals and activists when the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government was in power, it now seems to be procrastinating in handing over the case records.

Incidentally, the FIR filed by the NIA does not include Sections 121 (waging war against government of India) and 121A (conspiracy to commit offence under 121) of the IPC which pertain to sedition.

The Centre’s decision to abruptly transfer the case to the NIA followed reports of the MVA government mulling formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the investigation conducted by the Pune Police into the Elgaar Parishad case.

It was Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar who suggested the constitution of the SIT after he publicly cast aspersions on police investigations.

Last week, a three-member team from the NIA, led by an officer of the superintendent rank, had conferred with authorities from the Pune Police involved in the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon case and had held a review meeting.

The Pune police had informed the NIA team that as documents pertaining to the case were being presented as evidence in court, that they would be handed over to the agency post an order from the Maharashtra Director-General of Police (DGP).

Among those arrested in the case include poet-activist P. Varavara Rao, noted trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, activists Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, advocate Surendra Gadling, Prof. Shoma Sen and writer-publisher Sudhir Dhawale – all of whom are presently lodged in Pune’s Yerwada prison.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/only-hc-has-power-to-transfer-elgaar-parishad-case/article30756138.ece
287,2020/02/07,Bangladesh shot out for 233 by Pakistan on opening day,"Lanky paceman Shaheen Afridi took four wickets to help Pakistan dismiss Bangladesh for a paltry 233 on the opening day of the first Test here on Friday.

Shaheen recorded figures of four for 53 in 21.5 overs and was ably assisted by fellow pacer Mohammad Abbas (two for 19) and spinner Haris Sohail (two for 11) to justify Pakistan’s decision to send Bangladesh in on a greenish-yellow pitch.

Pakistan was due to bat for five overs but bad light forced the umpires to call it a day.

Bangladesh could have been bowled out for inside 200 had it not been for a defiant display of batting from Mohammad Mithun, who top-scored with 63 including seven fours and a six in his 193-minute stand.

Bangladesh was reeling against pace at 161 for six when Mithun added an invaluable 53 runs for the seventh wicket with Taijul Islam who made a resolute 24.

It was Sohail who had Islam caught by Yasir Shah before Pakistan wiped off the tail with the second new ball as 16-year-old Naseem Shah ended Mithun’s resistance, getting him caught behind.

288,2020/02/07,Tare lauds Jadeja and Makwana’s gritty partnership,"Moments after Shams Mulani was presented the Man of the Match award for his all-round performance, and while the Saurashtra Cricket Association was preparing for a team photograph to celebrate its team’s entry into the quarterfinals, Mumbai captain Aditya Tare and senior batsman Siddhesh Lad sat with Bhupen Lalwani, the rookie who dropped an easy chance that probably could have forced a Mumbai win.

Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, whose sitter Lalwani dropped, joined in and said “thank you” to Lalwani. Not to rub salt into Mumbai’s wounds but as a genuine compliment for helping him salvage a draw along with Kamlesh Makwana.

Such was the camaraderie that both sides exchanged pats on each other’s backs. While Tare lauded Jadeja and Makwana’s resistance for 40 overs as a “gritty partnership”, Saurashtra head coach Karsan Ghavri applauded Mumbai’s fighting spirit.

“Had it not been for Surykumar Yadav and Shams Mulani’s outstanding knocks yesterday, it wouldn’t have resulted in a close contest. They set the game up and the spinners and the left-arm pacer (Royston Dias) were exceptional today,” Ghavri told The Hindu.

“But eventually, we are happy and I am proud of the thrilling contest ending in our favour. During tea time, I just told them that it was important for us to save the game and I am glad the boys responded so well. Full credit to them.”

Even on hindsight, Tare felt Mumbai’s delayed declaration didn’t deprive it of a win.

“If it didn’t happen in 74 overs, it wouldn’t have happened in 80. Our plan in the morning was to set a target of 270-280 runs by batting 15 overs in the morning, so we timed the declaration well,” Tare said.

“If you see, the wickets fell till the ball was hard. Once the ball was soft, the bowlers had to rely on variable bounce and both Kamlesh and Dharmendra showed their wealth of experience with gritty knocks.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tare-lauds-jadeja-and-makwanas-gritty-partnership/article30764728.ece
289,2020/02/07,Saurashtra stages a great escape,"Kamlesh Makwana (31, 116b, 5x4) and Dharmendrasinh Jadeja (33, 125b, 5x4) staged a great escape to seal a Ranji Trophy knockouts berth for Saurashtra, thanks to a thrilling draw against Mumbai.

Makwana and Jadeja’s unbroken 75-run stand off 239 balls for the eighth wicket helped Saurashtra pocket three points for the first innings lead. Mumbai’s players, meanwhile, were heartbroken as their quest for regaining the Ranji title will now be prolonged by another year.

But when Saurashtra was reduced to 83 for seven on the final day after setting an improbable target of 290 runs off 74 overs, and with almost 40 overs remaining, Mumbai was gung-ho about keeping its Ranji campaign alive.

Variable bounce

The pitch at SCA stadium offered variable bounce and rare balls that turned sharply — like the one that went through the gate and bowled Arpit Vasavada, Saurashtra’s stand-in captain who was the last recognised batsman.

With the host struggling against an on-song attack — which was missing the injured Tushar Deshpande — Mumbai was favourite to walk away with six points. But Makwana and Jadeja showed their wealth of experience with a blockathon that lasted till the end.

Slice of luck

Both enjoyed a slice of luck even before scoring. While one from Shams Mulani — that kept low — missed Jadeja’s off-stump by a whisker, left-arm pacer Royston Dias — who was exceptional all through the match — squared Makwana up in the next over, the ball kissed the off-stump, the bail went up only to nestle back on to the stumps.

Then on, with the ball having softened, Jadeja and Makwana defended astutely. Despite the Mumbai fielders — with five close-in catchers besides ’keeper-captain Aditya Tare — constantly in their ears for most of the last three hours, Jadeja and Makwana hardly played a false stroke.

The only time Jadeja was enticed into a mistake — his drive resulted in a scoop off Mulani in the 54th over — Bhupen Lalwani at mid-off dropped a dolly.

In the end, the mistake cost Mumbai dear while Saurashtra entered the quarterfinals with a game to spare.

290,2020/02/07,"NZ vs IND ODI: We’ve to be little bit more attacking against Indian spinners, says Martin Guptill","New Zealand opener Martin Guptill on Friday said his team will look to pump up the aggression against Indian spinners during the second ODI in Auckland on Saturday in pursuit of an early series win against the fancied visitors.

The Black Caps chased down their highest-ever total in ODI cricket at Seddon Park on way to their four-wicket win in the first ODI for a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

Guptill said the key to New Zealand’s victory was playing well against the spinners. Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja were taken to the cleaners in Hamilton by Kiwi batsmen and leaked 148 runs in all.

“It’s completely different conditions, isn’t it? You have to be a little bit more attacking here I guess and have the confidence that the ball will probably will not spin past your edge as much. You know the odd one might as it did the other night,” he said.

“I thought the way we handled the Indian spinners in Hamilton was some of the best we have done it in a long time. So we can take confidence from that going forward in the series.”

Guptill also warned his side against complacency, saying it cannot afford to take a world class team like India lightly.

“I don’t think you can count India out. They are a world-class side, they have got match winners batting and bowling. So, we still have to put up a very good performance tomorrow to be get another win under the belt and take the series,” he said.

“Come tomorrow, hopefully we will play well and showcase our skills again.”

The 33-year-old opener also discussed the unique challenge of facing Jasprit Bumrah.

“Don’t know (it ever gets) comfortable facing him (Bumrah). But you certainly get used to him. He has got a unique action, he comes in and he is very good with his skills. I thought we played him well on the other night.

“He bowled very well with the new ball and when the time came to take boundaries off him I thought the guys in the middle did that really well and negated him and (did not allow him) to take early wickets,” he said.

Guptill said the odd dimensions of Eden Park will play a part in the second ODI and he along with his new opening partner Henry Nicholls will look to build the innings just like they did in Hamilton.

“This ground is different, isn’t it? You want to go out and start the way we can and stay as positive as possible. It could be 70 for no loss or it could be 40 for no loss. You just don’t know until we go out there and assess the conditions. Once we get out there tomorrow, we see how we get on,” he said.

“You want to go out there being positive. Unfortunately in the game of cricket if you lose couple of wickets early you have to rebuild. But if Henry (Nicholls) and I can get across the 10-over mark then hopefully take it as deep as possible.”

Guptill also heaped praise on stand-in skipper Tom Latham, who smashed a 48-ball 60 to take the game away from India in Hamilton.

“I thought Tom played brilliantly. He gave himself some time to get in and then flipped the switch when he needed to and took the pressure a little bit off Ross (Taylor). It allowed Ross to settle into his own innings as well,” he said.

“Then between 25 to 40 over mark, they just took the game away from India with that match winning partnership,” Guptill signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/orz1qz/article30761170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Guptill,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-second-odi-in-auckland/article30761171.ece
291,2020/02/07,"Indian fielding on a downward curve, says Sridhar","India’s fielding hasn’t been particularly good in the ongoing series against New Zealand, coach R Sridhar said on Friday but refused to blame tight schedules for the “downward curve” despite conceding that hectic travelling is affecting the side’s practice plans.

Sridhar said India’s fielding has at best average in the last four months. He said fatigue could be a contributing factor to losses during this time period, including the one in the first ODI against New Zealand at Hamilton on Wednesday.

“...the West Indies series at home was somewhere we really dropped. We were average, to say the least. But definitely we have not lived to the standards as we did in the world Cup or even in the build-up to the World Cup in the last couple years,” said Sridhar on the eve of the second ODI in Auckland.

Sridhar said they have accounted for the downturn in fielding standard by a grading system privy to the support staff. He said the team management keeps a sharp eye on the workloads and practice schedules of all players.

‘Each fielder has to be his own captain’

“We keep reminding the players about attention to basic detail...In a T20 game, each fielder has to be his own captain. He need not wait for the captain to move him or the bowler to move him in a certain direction or to a certain position,” he said.

“We try and tell them to think ahead of the game, you as a fielder captain yourself, see which way the breeze is, which way the batsman’s tendencies to hit are, what’s the bowler’s plan and position accordingly.

“So we empower the fielders so that they can become their own captain and they can take decisions on their own because the captain has got too much on his plate at certain times. That’s what we speak about,” he added.

India’s fielding regime has been impacted by the constant travelling on this tour. There was only one full session before the T20 International series whereas the other three sessions have all been optional.

“That’s the nature of the current schedule, we have to take it. We have to play around it but we hardly had a session during the entire T20 schedule. There is not much we can put in in terms of technical work on the ground...,” he pointed out.

“Apart from that, we do have a look at the videos and see what led to an error. It need not always be a technical error every time there is a fumble or a dropped catch. We need to know whether it could be a tactical position error or the mind not being in the right place, so many things that can lead to it,” he explained.

“It is a tight schedule but it is not a complaint and it is not an excuse at all. We need to be better.”

Fitness level of players are so good

Speaking about workload management, Sridhar said the current fitness levels of the players are so good that they are able to adapt pretty quickly

“We do monitor their workloads. We will be lying to ourselves if we say no, they are fresh as a daisy every time they go on to the park. They are not, because they are travelling and playing games,” he said.

“But the current fitness levels of this team is really good, so that in turn helps to recover from the workload and fatigue quickly and be fit on the park. But we do keep that in mind but I don’t blame fatigue for the down curve,” he added.

Talking about the poor moments in the first ODI, the coach said, “Overthrows, I mean, you are talking about Manish (Pandey) — he took a chance. He had to do it, and we needed a wicket at that time.

“You can bargain four runs for a wicket and it was the best player who was there at that time. These things happen, you can’t look too deep into that.”

But Sridhar minced no words in his criticism of Kuldeep Yadav’s dropped catch of centurion Ross Taylor.

“...that catch should have been taken. Probably it was after his first over, maybe he was thinking about his previous over, could be anything. It could not be a technical aspect at all.

“We are trying to get better but we were average. There is no doubt about that. We can get better,” he said.

‘Lot of things to address to players’

Sridhar said players will be spoken with to figure out the problem areas.

“There are a lot of things we need to address. We will actually have dialogues with the player and see what is more important for a player and then go about it in that way,” he said.

“We do the listening more than the talking. We take the feedback from the players and if there is anything to be added, we surely add our perspective and then the best possible decision is taken to get the best out of the player each time he goes out on the park,” he added.

Despite the downturn in fielding form, there have been moments of individual brilliance in every match or series. Virat Kohli has affected two stupendous run outs, one with a nearly blind throw at Wellington (Colin Munro), and then at Hamilton (Henry Nicholls).

“The kind of intensity he brings on to the field, I always say to the younger boys who come, he is a ready-made template for you to copy. Watch him, see what he does,” Sridhar said.

‘Kuldeep not bowling lot of overs is affecting his rhythm’

India fielding coach R Sridhar on Friday dismissed reports raising question marks over Kuldeep Yadav’s fitness, saying the spinner is fully fit but not playing regularly is probably having a negative impact on his bowling.

Yadav has been fairly inconsistent in his international outings of late and conceded 84 runs in his 10 overs and took two wickets in the first ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday. It was his first game of the tour after being left out of the eleven in the five T20 Internationals.

The chinaman was also dropped from the Test squad earlier this week, 12 months after head coach Ravi Shastri called him India’s number one spinner in overseas conditions.

“He is fully fit and he is not carrying any injury. He is totally cleared to play all the games. He has played a lot of ODI cricket, played all three games against Australia. He didn’t play the T20s as Chahal was there. Maybe Kuldeep is the kind of guy who needs a lot of overs under his belt to get his rhythm.

“Typical leg-spinner thing, I would suppose with a lot of overs under the belt. On and off, he is playing the odd one-day game. I think he is a good bowler and he has got all his skills. I think the New Zealand batters played him really well, said Sridhar ahead of the second ODI here on Friday.

India are currently 1-0 down in the three-match series, but can take confidence from the fact that they came back from behind in the last two ODI series against West Indies and Australia to win 2-1.

“...when we come across a situation like this, we embrace it. We want these situations and the leadership group of this team wants to be in a tough situation...it’s always good to be under pressure,” the fielding coach added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bdhx8y/article30761094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sridhar,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-second-odi-in-auckland/article30761095.ece
292,2020/02/07,Tendulkar calls on fans to donate generously during Bushfire Bash,"Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar, who will be coaching Ponting XI in Bushfire Cricket Bash, has urged fans to donate generously to support Australians affected by a “catastrophic” summer.

Since September 2019, Australia has battled a bushfire crisis which has claimed at least 33 human lives and that of millions of animals.

Tendulkar also revealed former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee was the conduit for his involvement in Sunday’s charity game scheduled to be played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne.

“I received a message from Brett Lee,” Tendulkar was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “Brett said that Kevin (Roberts, Cricket Australia’s chief executive) would like to be in touch with you.

“It was a no-brainer. From the moment I was asked, I said, ‘yes I’m more than happy to come here’”, he added.

Tendulkar, one of the greatest batters in cricket history and arguably the most famous figure the game has produced, also said he had been moved by the devastation caused to both people and wildlife by the bushfires in recent months.

“This is an alarming situation, it’s catastrophic — that’s an understatement,” said Tendulkar. “You see the number of lives it has affected, not only humans but also wildlife which sometimes people don’t talk about. That is equally important.

“I’m so happy I’m here in whatever way to support the cause, to raise money,” he added.

Yuvraj Singh, who played 40 Tests and 304 ODIs in an international career that spanned 17 years, will be part of the Gilchrist XI. The flambouyant all-rounder, who famously hit Stuart Broad for six consecutive sixes in 2007 World T20, was asked if he hoped to replicate those feats on Sunday.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to hit one at the moment,” Singh laughed.

“I don’t know how I’m going to play the fast bowlers...I hope (Lee) is not bowling 150kph at this moment... If he’s bowling 150kph, I think I’ll be at the non-striker’s end,” he added.

Phillips smashed nine fours and a six in his 80-ball 65, while Dane Cleaver (46 not out off 115 balls) and skipper Hamish Rutherford (40 off 79 balls) also chipped in with useful contributions after the hosts won the toss and decided to bat.

At the draw of stumps, Daryl Mitchell (36 not out) was giving company to Cleaver at Bert Sutcliffe Oval.

New Zealand A made a good start as openers Rutherford and Will Young (26 off 101 balls) shared a 67-run partnership but Siraj then had the skipper caught behind by Srikar Bharat to strike the first blow.

New man in Rachin Ravindra (12 off 9) blasted three fours before becoming the second victim of Siraj, who cleaned up the batsman in the 28th over.

Phillips then joined Young and the duo took the team past the 100-mark before the opener was foxed by a Nadeem delivery and was stumped in the 34th over.

Phillips and Tim Seifert (30) then added 76 runs to lift the Kiwis to 181.

But New Zealand A lost two quick wickets with Avesh striking twice in quick succession, removing Phillips and Seifert to leave the hosts at 190 for 5 in the 57th over.

New batsmen Cleaver and Mitchell (36 not out) came together to resurrect the New Zealand innings, forging an unfinished 86 run partnership.

While Cleaver struck five hits to the fence, Mitchell set the ball past the boundary line thrice and also hit a six in his unbeaten 97-ball innings.

The opening unofficial Test between the two sides had ended in a draw.

294,2020/02/07,Tendulkar says Marnus Labuschagne reminds him most of himself,"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar on Friday picked Australian Marnus Labuschagne as the player who most reminds him of himself, calling the fast-rising batsman a special talent with impeccable footwork.

Here to coach a side at Sunday’s charity fundraiser for the devastating bushfires in Australia, Tendulkar was asked to name the player who he thinks comes closest to resembling him at his prime.

“I happened to be watching the second Test match at Lord’s between England and Australia. When Steve Smith got injured, I saw Labuschagne’s second innings,” Tendulkar responded.

“I was sitting with my father-in-law. I saw Marnus get hit off the second ball from Jofra Archer and, post that, the 15 minutes he batted, I said, ‘This player looks special’,” he recalled.

“There is something about him. His footwork was precise. Footwork is not physical, it’s mental. If you’re not thinking positively in your mind, then your feet don’t move,” he added.

The 25-year-old Labuschagne became Test cricket’s leading scorer last year with 1,104 runs. He broke into the scene after coming in as a concussion substitute for Steve Smith during the Ashes last August.

Grabbing his chance with both hands, Labuschagne made four consecutive half-centuries to notch up 353 runs at 50.42 in the Ashes.

Tendulkar said Labuschagne’s fine footwork is also a sign that he is a mentally strong player.

”...because if you’re not, your feet will not move. His footwork was incredible,” he said.

Labuschagne has amassed 896 runs this Test summer, notching up four centuries.

‘Let’s not get into comparisons’

Tendulkar, however, refused to be drawn into the debate on who among Virat Kohli and Steve Smith should be considered the better.

“I don’t like getting into comparisons. People have tried comparing me to a number of guys and I’ve said, ‘Just leave us alone’,” said Tendulkar.

“Let’s not get into comparisons and let us enjoy what both those individuals are doing. They are entertaining the entire cricketing world and it’s a joy for us to watch,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n0oanm/article30759696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARNUSKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tendulkar-says-marnus-labuschagne-reminds-him-most-of-himself/article30759697.ece
295,2020/02/07,NZ vs Ind 2nd ODI: Jolted India aim to bounce back against resurgent New Zealand,"Some of their bowling and fielding frailties exposed in the series-opener, India will aim for quick course correction when they take on a resurgent New Zealand in the second ODI here on Saturday.

Flying high after the 5-0 whitewash of New Zealand in the T20 series, India were brought to the ground after the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series with a four-wicket win in the first ODI.

The Black Caps chased down their highest-ever total in ODI cricket at Seddon Park and the toss will be crucial once again at the even shorter Eden Park where the side batting second will have a clear advantage.

New Zealand opted to bat here in both the T20Is, but India chased well in both instances albeit in different circumstances.

India find themselves in a familiar situation after the loss in Hamilton. But the visitors have come from behind against the West Indies and Australia to win their last two ODI series and Virat Kohli’s men will look to do the same here.

Like in Chennai against the West Indies, or in Mumbai against Australia, India’s loss at Hamilton was down to their lack of ability to take wickets in the middle overs.

The opposition batsmen took advantage to hit big and the Indian attack didn’t have any answers.

In the first ODI, skipper Virat Kohli turned to Jasprit Bumrah every time he went searching for a wicket. This over-dependency is something India would want to address in their composition.

India’s fielding too will be under the scanner. In each of those losses at Chennai, Mumbai and Hamilton, it was poor despite flashes of individual brilliance.

The general fielding standards have gone down since the Bangladesh series and there is a need for a collective all-round effort from the visitors to bounce back.

Generally, high catches are tougher in the windy conditions in New Zealand, and the odd lights at Eden Park won’t help either.

At the nets, the Men in Blue on Friday had an optional training session.

Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur both didn’t just bowl, but also batted in the nets.

Thakur was expensive in his outings at Eden Park during the T20Is, and he didn’t impress in the first ODI either and India could think of replacing him with Saini.

The other contemplation will be about Kedar Jadhav’s role in the side. Selected primarily to bring balance to the playing eleven with his part-time spin, Kohli didn’t give him a single over in Hamilton.

Perhaps it was due to the short boundaries. In that light, bowling Jadhav at Eden Park makes even less sense. It could merit giving Shivam Dube a go here, or even playing a full-time batsman in Manish Pandey.

Rest of the batting line-up picks itself with the new opening pair of Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw settling in well in their first outing and the team management will hope the duo can add a few more runs than last time.

For New Zealand, a change in personnel has worked wonders after their T20 whitewash.

Stand-in skipper Tom Latham’s batting in the middle worked for them, and Henry Nicholls confirmed he will continue to open the innings with Martin Guptill.

Ross Taylor has been in rampaging form and he will look to continue the good work on Saturday.

Regular skipper Kane Williamson is still days away from fitness, while Scott Kuggeleijn is ruled out of the second ODI due to illness.

Auckland pacer, the six-foot-eight tall Kyle Jamieson will make his debut on home ground on Saturday, replacing Ish Sodhi in the side.

Teams:

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini.

New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt), Tom Latham (wk), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Jimmy Neesham, Scott Kuggeleijn, Tom Blundell, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Hamish Bennett, Tim Southee, Kyle Jamieson.

296,2020/02/07,Women’s Triangular T20 series: England beat India by four wickets,"Natalie Sciver smashed a strokeful fifty as England beat India by four wickets in the fourth T20 of the women’s triangular series here on Friday.

Sent in to bat, opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with a 40-ball 45 as India struggled to 123 for six. England then returned to overhaul the target, scoring 124 for six with seven balls to spare.

Sciver scored 50 off 38 balls with the help of six fours and a six.

Earlier, Mandhana smashed seven fours and one maximum blow for a six in her innings, but the other batswomen, including Jemimah Rodrigues (23) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (14), failed to capitalise on their starts.

For England, Anya Shrubsole (3/31) took three wickets and Katherine Brunt (2/23) scalped two to derail India’s innings after they were sent in to bat at Junction Oval.

Rajeshwari Gayakwad (3/23) took three wickets, while Radha Yadav (1/24) scalped one for India.

298,2020/02/07,Plea challenges Delhi Police 'request' to turn stadium into temporary prison for anti-CAA protesters,"A plea was moved in the Delhi High Court on Friday challenging the police’s letter seeking permission from the government to turn Jangli Ram Pahalwan Stadium here into a “temporary jail” for anti-CAA protesters on the assembly election day.

The plea by social activist Jafar Ahsan Karimi apprehended that his voting right as well as that of other protesters will be curbed in the wake of Delhi Police’s requisition given to the Principal Secretary (Home) for setting up a temporary jail at the stadium in Kanjhawala for accommodating those who may be detained enmass without any reasonable basis.

The petition was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar and it agreed to list the matter for hearing on February 10.

The petitioner sought direction to the Principal Secretary (Home) to recall the letter or the approval order, if any, for the requisition given by the police on January 29 as it is arbitrary.

The petition, filed through advocates Rahul Yadav, Rashid N. Azam and Mujeeb Ur Rehman, said setting up of a mass detention centre especially during the polls and on the voting day would adversely affect the conduct of free and fair elections.

The plea claimed that the peaceful protests are being carried out for over 50 days and there has been no violence from the side of protesters except a few incidents where people have tried to attack the protesters using fire arms.

“It is alarming in a democracy that the protesters are agitating against a policy decision of framework of citizenship to be granted to foreigners under the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 which is ex facie discriminatory and designed to facilitate certain religious communities while excluding others,” the petition said.

It said the “ire of protesters is mainly against the current government at the Centre which is largely a party also contesting the elections in Delhi.”

It said the establishment of a temporary jail for detention of protesters is against the spirit of Constitution under Article 19 which guarantees the right to organise peaceful protest.

“The temporary jails, if set up, should only be sanctioned after the conduct of elections and voting,” it said, adding that if it is done earlier, every detainee who has a valid vote should be allowed to cast the vote.

The plea said the police requested for approval for setting up of temporary jail at the stadium for detention of warrants.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qxgjox/article30727069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-GRAFFITI-JAMIA-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-challenges-delhi-polices-request-to-turn-stadium-into-temporary-prison-for-anti-caa-protesters/article30764077.ece
299,2020/02/07,"GST official’s premises searched, more under CBI scanner","The CBI on Friday searched the premises of IAS official Udit Prakash Rai, posted as a Special Commissioner in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) division, in connection with a graft case. Several GST officials have also come under its scanner.

The CBI on Thursday arrested Gopal Krishna Madhav, a Andaman and Nicobar Island Civil Service cadre official who worked in the GST division of the Delhi Trade and Taxes Department, and an alleged middleman, Dheeraj Gupta.

Mr. Madhav was also an Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's office.

Mr. Sisodia confirmed through his Twitter handle that the GST Inspector was also posted as an OSD in his office. He said he had got several corruption officials arrested in the past five years and added that the CBI should ensure stringent punishment for the officer.

A CBI official said, “Searches were carried out on the premises linked to Mr. Rai, a 2007 batch IAS official, and some other GST officials.”

The case was registered on the complaint of a transporter alleging that the GST officials had demanded Rs.3.5 lakh to release his two trucks. Subsequently, the middleman was arrested on Wednesday while allegedly receiving Rs.2.26 lakh.

During questioning, Mr. Gupta purportedly disclosed that he worked as a middleman for collecting bribes from transporters on behalf of some GST officials.

300,2020/02/07,Man held for robbing former employer at gunpoint,"A 30-year-old man was arrested in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh for robbing his former employer of ₹5 lakh at gunpoint, the police said on Thursday.

Accused Chandan had a grudge against victim Sanjay Sahdev for firing him two years ago. He planned the robbery with two friends, Ranjit (24) and Jaan Mohammad. The police have arrested Mr. Ranjit. Mr. Mohammad is on the run.

Mr. Sahdev was robbed outside his house at 8.30 p.m. on January 23.

The accused, who wore masks, allegedly fired in the air to threaten Mr. Sahdev and then robbed him of his bag containing cash and other documents before fleeing in their vehicle, said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Additional Commissioner of Police (Central).

A case was registered at D.B. Gupta Road. During investigation, footage of CCTV cameras installed on the route from his shop to his house were analysed, Mr. Randhawa said.

With the help of technical surveillance, Mr. Chandan and Mr. Ranjit were nabbed from their respective houses in Azadpur and Model Town on Wednesday, he added.

A scooter used in the crime, the bag of cash, essential documents of the victim and one mobile phone purchased with the robbed money were recovered, the officer said.

During interrogation, Mr. Chandan disclosed that after he lost his job, he started working in Gaffar Market. He said he had always kept an eye on Mr. Sahdev who owns a shop in the same area. The accused tried to rob the victim several times while he was on the way to his shop from his house, but could not succeed due to huge rush. Then they planned to rob him at his house as Mr. Chandan was aware that the victim makes good money in the winter for the sale of jackets and takes the cash home, he added.

After the incident, the accused distributed the money among themselves. Mr. Chandan deposited ₹40,000 in his bank while Ranjit purchased a costly mobile phone with his share. They spent the rest of the robbed booty on various luxury items, the police said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-held-for-robbing-former-employer-at-gunpoint/article30756663.ece

Ombir Singh, Executive Engineer, MCF Enforcement Wing, said teams of the two departments along with 50 police personnel demolished five structures during the day-long drive. Mr. Singh said the demolition squad verified the documents of the landowners and only those structures were demolished which did not have stay orders from the court.

The MCF had provided labour, equipment and enforcement team for the drive.

Several farmhouses, ashrams, gaushalas and banquet halls have illegally come up on the land notified under the PLPA in Ankheer and Mewla Maharajpur village of Faridabad over the years. These are owned by bureaucrats, judicial officers and politicians, including a former minister.

Carrying a bible and wearing a placard stating his name and his religion, Alexander Fleming, a Catholic, said that there was an attempt to make the protests look like they were “only filled with Muslims”, he said, and that he was here to disprove that.

Jabarjang Singh, a Sikh farmer who says he has been in the city since the police crackdown at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15 has been at Shaheen Bagh since February 1. Dressed as the traditional warrior [Nihang] regalia, along with a spear and two swords, Mr. Singh argued that the CAA would divide the country. “This country has all kinds of religions, languages, even weather..[the Act] was an attempt to uproot [its core values],” he said.

“An environment of hate has been created in Delhi,” said Mohammed Shahbaz, one of the people helping with the event. The message trying to be conveyed was that “everyone live in peace, treating everyone as brother and sister”, he said, going on to state that people here could not be “recognised by their clothes” as stated by the Prime Minister earlier, highlighting that people of all religions were wearing all sorts of clothes. People in skull caps were seen sporting a red tikka on their forehead, while others were wearing turbans, Mr. Shabaz said.

Eminent economist, Professor Jayati Ghosh, said many figures in the budget were wrong and the government was misleading the people of the country.

306,2020/02/07,"PSO held guilty of murder of judge’s wife, son","The District and Sessions Court here on Thursday held the personal security officer (PSO) of a judicial official guilty for murder of the latter’s wife and teenage son in October 2018. The judgment came about a year after framing of charges in January last year.

Pronouncing the verdict, Additional District and Sessions Judge Sudhir Parmar held PSO Mahipal guilty of murder and destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code and for use of arms in contravention of the law under the Arms Act. The accused was present in the court.

Welcoming the verdict, public prosecutor Anurag Hooda said the Gurugram police did a commendable job in evidence collection leading to the conviction in record time. “The then Commissioner of Police, K.K. Rao, constituted a Special Investigation Team soon after the incident leading to the arrest of the accused in less than two hours. The SIT was reconstituted the next day to add more police personnel to expedite the investigation and the collection of evidence,” he said.

Mr. Hooda said the prosecution produced 64 witnesses, including two eyewitnesses, and the CCTV footage and videos of the incident doing rounds on social media were also important evidence.

Besides, the blood group of Dhruv matched with the bloodstains on the uniform of the accused who had also made extra-judicial confession to the deceased’s father additional district and sessions judge Krishant Kant and co-PSO constable Vinay Kumar.

The court has fixed February 7 for arguments on the quantum of sentence in the case. Complainant’s lawyer Vishal Gupta said the prosecution would seek maximum punishment, which is death under Section 302 of the IPC, as the case fell in the category of the rarest of the rare.

Defence lawyer Prem Shankar Sharma said the deaths were caused due to accidental firing during scuffle between Mahipal and Dhruv and the case, at the most, attracted charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He said he would go for further appeal in the case.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/os253a/article30756604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06DELPRIYAGURUGRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pso-held-guilty-of-murder-of-judges-wife-son/article30756605.ece

308,2020/02/07,Questions over ‘mad rush’ to execute Central Vista plan,"The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Thursday invited over 1,200 people who had put forth their objections and suggestions to the proposed Central Vista for a public hearing.

Following changes in the land use by the urban body for the proposed modification of the Central Vista, the DDA had invited the public to register their objections and suggestions.

Those with objections to the proposed plans said that there seemed to be a “mad rush” to implement the plans for the new Central Vista without a “multi-layered consultation” and that it would not help decongest the city.

Architect Swanzal Kak Kapoor, one of those to forward objections to the DDA said, “The primary objection is that the plan deviates from the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 and this cannot happen overnight. There needs to be expert consultation from various fields and cannot happen through internal government decisions. At a time when green spaces are needed desperately, you cannot possibly take away public spaces like this.”

Adding that felling of full grown trees is also likely to take place due to the project, Ms. Kapoor said, “A three-level basement has been proposed. If that happens, there will be no land left for new trees to grow. The real concern is that what will be lost cannot be replaced.”

Environmentalist Chetan Aggarwal who had also forwarded his objections to the DDA said, “Apart from the massive felling of trees which will take place, the other concern is that institutions like the National Archives, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) and others are meant for the public. Converting these into office spaces would mean that spaces meant for public will shrink.”

Stating that the MPD-2021 entails decongesting the Capital, Anil Sood who attended the public hearing said, “You cannot change the land use based only on photos and not a proper blueprint. The MPD-2021 talks of decongesting the city but the same DDA is changing the land use to multiply congestion.”

Ms. Kapoor added, “It took two years for the IGNCA to be designed. How can the plan for something like the Central Vista be finalised within three weeks?

The court also issued a notice to the AAP candidate, Vishesh Ravi, on the plea filed by Yoginder Chandolia, a BJP candidate from the same seat.

‘Criminal case’

Mr. Chandolia, in his plea, alleged that the AAP candidate had wilfully and intentionally concealed material facts and given false statement in poll affidavit, including an alleged pending criminal case against him.

“However, despite the facts that there was substantial defect in the affidavit filed by respondent no. 4 [Ravi], the said objection filed by petitioner [Chandolia] is dismissed by the respondent no. 3 [returning officer] vide order dated January 22 inter alias holding that these defects are not substantial,” the plea said.

310,2020/02/07,AAP distributes Kejriwal’s ‘guarantee card’,"Aam Aadmi Party volunteers on Thursday afternoon were spotted outside their party office near Laxmi Nagar metro station here handing over cards to more than a dozen young men who were sporting the party caps. The card, the party said, was “Kejriwal’s guarantee card”.

The party volunteers, mostly school and college students, then hit a nearby market and started distributing the cards.

A “door-to-door” programme, through which the party claims to have reached lakhs of households in the city, has been one of the main outreach programmes by the party in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly election.

“Iss side mein calender hain, aur iss side mein sarkar kya kaam kiya hai aur kya karegi woh likha hai [This side of the card has a calendar and the other side has the details of the work done by the AAP government and their plans],” 19-year-old Rahul, a polytechnic student, explained as he handed over a card to a shopkeeper. Mr. Rahul was heading the team.

“We had sent 100-150 volunteers, divided into teams of 10 members, across constituencies every day,” said a volunteer who was overseeing the party’s door-to-door campaign.

In December, the AAP had brought Prashant Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) on board to work along with the party for the Delhi Assembly election.

The card in the form of a tabletop calendar bore 10 promises made by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to the people of Delhi printed on one side and a calendar of the current year printed on the other.

“We have trained the volunteers and asked them to talk about three things to the people while distributing the guarantee card — free water we have been giving, 200 units of free electricity and free bus rides for women in city buses,” an I-PAC volunteer told The Hindu.

As Mr. Rahul and his friends visited a number of shop to distribute the cards, some were happy at getting a free calendar, while some refused to take it saying they were BJP supporters.

“When you are free, read this,” Mr. Rahul said as he gave a card to a street vendor.

Nishand (17), a Class XI student of Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Shakarpur Block, said that he has been part of the door-to-door campaign for the past few days. “In Priyadarshini Vihar and Bank Enclave we are a little weak, but in Ramesh Park and Lalita Park area we are really strong,” he said and added that the party would, however, win.

“Barabar takkar hoga AAP aur BJP ka [There will be neck-to-neck competition between AAP and the BJP],” his 18-year-old friend, Abhishek Kumar, a BSE first year student, quipped. “BJP ka banda bhi strong hai [The BJP candidate is also strong],” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2fdx9w/article30756400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07AAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-distributes-kejriwals-guarantee-card/article30756401.ece

The police on Thursday said they will deploy around 80,000 security personnel across the city on Saturday to ensure fair and peaceful elections. They said extra security personnel will be deployed in Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar polling stations as these two areas have been termed “critical”.

The police said there will be 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), 19,000 home guards and 42,000 Delhi police personnel. They also said there will be drones and facial recognition systems to keep watch on potential troublemakers. All district DCPs have already intensified area dominance exercise. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 47 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) were deployed. “A total of 153 entry and exit points to the city from Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurugram that include 43 non-motorable routes and 110 motorable routes to be under strict security cover. Paramilitary personnel will be deployed at borders. We have deployed security personnel at porous routes to keep watch on the movement of any suspicious person,” an officer said.

A senior officer said they have installed door frame metal detectors at entry points of Shaheen Baghfor the security of agitators at the protest site. He also said barricades have been placed on both carriageways outside Jamia Millia Islamia.

“We have taken these steps after the three firing incidents that took place in Shaheen Bagh and Jamia. The security personnel has been instructed to frisk visitors at the protest sites with the help of volunteers,” the officer added.

312,2020/02/07,Kejriwal asks Home Minister not to run away from debate,"AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday called BJP leaders “farzi [fake] Hindus” and referring to a section of the holy book, Bhagavad Gita, he said Home Minister Amit Shah should not run away from a debate.

“I will make all BJP leaders sing Hanuman Chalisa as this way their language will improve. They all are farzi Hindus. They do not know Hanuman Chalisa or Bhagavad Gita. They only know how to abuse,” Mr. Kejriwal said while addressing a press conference.

On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal had sung Hanuman Chalisaduring an interview with a news channel. “I said now that I have sung it, I will make all the BJP people sing it,” he had said. On Thursday, talking about his invitation to Home Minister for a debate on the issues in Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal said, “In Bhagavad Gita, it is written that you should not run away from the field. A true Hindu is brave, he does not run away like this. It doesn’t befit a person like Shah to run away from the field without answering people’s questions and it is not good for democracy as well.”

‘Debate on Shaheen Bagh’

Mr. Kejriwal added that he was even ready to debate on the issue of Shaheen Bagh with Mr. Shah. “I had challenged the BJP to declare their chief ministerial candidate. I had even invited them for an open debate. The people of Delhi are scared that their vote might make someone like Sambit Patra the Chief Minister,” he said.

The AAP chief said: “I want to appeal to the people of Delhi to cast their votes based on the work done by us in the past five years and to strengthen us by giving us their votes. Elect us in all the 70 constituencies in Delhi, so that we can work with greater conviction in our next tenure,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal added that he wants to build a 21st-century nation where there are schools, hospitals, industries, employment, roads and transportation. “This will take the country forward. But by their [BJP’s] Hindu-Muslim rants, the country will go backward by 200 years,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/es8k87/article30756389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-asks-home-minister-not-to-run-away-from-debate/article30756390.ece

The two parties were acting at the behest of RSS with the singular aim of diverting people’s attention away from real issues, he said. “Now that the campaigning has come to a close, the propaganda, lies and abusive language used by both the parties will also hopefully end. The people of Delhi will now have an opportunity to think about the real issues,” Mr. Surjewala said.

Common factor

He added that AAP and PM Narendra Modi (Prime Minister) came to power on the issue of Lokpal. However, Mr. Modi appointed Lokpal after five years, which still does not have office or staff and Arvind Kejriwal (Chief Minister) is yet to appoint a Lokpal, Mr. Surjewala said.

He added that AAP’s “education story is nothing but a drama created by Kejriwal with the help of ads”. He alleged that despite doubling the Budget in education, the pass percentage has come down and nearly 1.32 lakh students have dropped out of schools. He added that under the AAP government, Delhi has become one of the most polluted cities in the world.

“The last five years have been wasted in squabbling, grandstanding and playing out fixed matches between AAP and BJP.

316,2020/02/07,Honesty overrules destiny,"Nala, a great king endowed with excellent graces, handsome looks and, above all, upright character, and Damayanti, the breathtaking princess of Vidarbha kingdom, are well matched in all respects and their love is sparked by divine grace through swans from Brahmaloka. But in the Swayamvara arranged for her by her father, what should have been a straight choice becomes a challenge for both of them when the celestial Indra, Varuna, Yama and Agni, also participate as suitors. Despite the twist and hurdles that crop up, both Nala and Damayanti stand by dharma and their upright character helps them to get united in marriage, pointed out Sri B. Damodhara Dikshitar in a discourse.

The gods, Indra and others first intercept Nala who is on his way to attend the Swayamvara. Though they know him to be a suitor, they make a request that puts him in a tight spot. Nala has to represent their wish to marry her and convince her to choose one among them. Since Nala has already promised to help them, he cannot go back on his word. The gods grant him the divine power to enter the palace without being seen by anyone. In Damayanti’s presence, he introduces himself as Nala, king of Nishada, who has now come as a messenger of the gods and not as a suitor. He conveys their message that she has to choose one among them as her husband.

But Damayanti is determined to marry only Nala and makes this very clear in her reply message to the gods. Even if they take part as suitors, she will garland only Nala. Nala faithfully reports Damayanti’s stance to the gods who are impressed at the candour and true love for each other. Through their grace, Damayanti is able to identify the real Nala from the gods in Nala’s form and garlands him.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/honesty-overrules-destiny/article30765040.ece

318,2020/02/07,Pay ₹5 crore rupees or demolish temple: High Court,"Either pay ₹5 crore or demolish the temple constructed on the land meant for public park in Madhavapuri Hills in Ameenpur of Sanga Reddy district on city outskirts, the Telangana High Court suggested to the temple committee on Friday.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a PIL plea on building temple in Madhavapuri Hills, directed the top officials of the Municipal Administration, Panchayat Raj and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority to appear before it on February 26. Observing that an illegal action could not be justified in the name of god, the bench said everyone had to follow the law.

Expressing concern over the authorities remaining mute spectators to construction of religious structures in public places, the bench remarked that building a temple on a public park land constituted land-grabbing. What would be the situation if temples were constructed for all three crore deities and would any vacant place be available for people, the bench wondered.

In 2018, Human Rights Protection Cell Trust had filed a PIL plea in the High Court on the alleged construction of a temple on 9,866 square yards of land meant for public park in Madhavapuri Hills of Ameenpur. Temple committee counsel told the bench that two Government Orders had been released over State’s policy on use of lands for religious structures.

The bench asked counsel if the government had permitted illegal occupation of park land for construction of religious structures and wanted to see the documents relating to permissions granted by the government in the matter. Explaining that the temple was built in 2014, the lawyer said permission was deemed to have been given if the Panchayat Raj department did not issue any specific orders within 15 days of presenting the application.

But the Supreme Court had ruled earlier that no construction activity shall be taken up on lands meant for public parks, the bench said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pay-5-crore-rupees-or-demolish-temple-high-court/article30765703.ece
319,2020/02/07,JBS-MGBS metro route opens today,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday flagged off the last remaining stretch of Hyderabad Metro Rail between Jubilee Bus Station (JBS)-Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS), Imlibun, for commercial operations and even took a ride accompanied by his Cabinet colleagues and senior officials.

16-minute ride

The 11-km, nine-station service will be available for general public from 6.30 a.m. Saturday onwards. For the inaugural run, the ride between JBS and MGBS was a breeze since it did not halt anywhere, save for a few minutes at Chikkadpally, otherwise it is expected to take 16 minutes from tomorrow.

The Chief Minister, had earlier, unveiled a plaque at JBS station to commemorate the occasion in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister Mehmood Ali, Ministers K.T. Rama Rao, T. Srinivas Yadav, V. Prashant Reddy, chief secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP M. Mahender Reddy, Municipal Administration secretary Arvind Kumar, HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy, Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar, L&T CEO and MD S.N. Subrahmanyan and L&MTRH CEO K.V.B. Reddy.

Then, he came to the platform, waved the green flag and hopped onto the train along with mediapersons and several partymen, including corporators. Mr. N.V.S. Reddy was seen explaining the route details to the Chief Minister, who also halted for a short while at Chikkadpally station, where he waved to the crowd.

Along the route, people were seen on balconies and rooftops to wave to KCR as the train moved through Bhoiguda, Musheerabad, Chikkadpally, Narayanaguda and Sultan Bazar. Unlike the other two corridors, in this Corridor 2 certain sections below has space for traffic movement only on one side near Bade Chowdi and Bhoiguda as road widening was not taken up down.

The Chief Minister was also taken around the MGBS station after which he posed for photographs with the metro teams before getting down at the station to return to his camp office. For the assembled mediapersons, it was a huge disappointment as the expected interaction or announcement of the next metro rail phase did not happen with Mr. Rama Rao and top officials also leaving with the CM.

Hyderabad Metro Rail is touted as the world’s largest public-private partnership project. “It ranks among one of most prestigious projects that we have executed,” said Mr. Subrahmanyan.

‘Extend metro further’

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao underscored the need to prepare a master plan to extend metro rail to all parts of the city to reduce pollution and make Hyderabad a global city, said HMR MD N.VS. Reddy on Friday. “The Chief Minister was overjoyed with the way metro stations were built, latest technologies adopted and observed that JBS and MGBS stations are like modern airports and expected them to buzz with people and activity,” he said.

Mr. Reddy, who was with the CM throughout the JBS-MGBS ride, also stated that KCR was happy about people of twin cities enjoying the metro rail service. “He was in a very jovial mood and kept mentioning local street names while checking the train service from the driver’s cabin,” added Mr. Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ltvmo9/article30765444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07-JBSPARADEGROUND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jbs-mgbs-metro-route-opens-today/article30765423.ece

322,2020/02/07,"Now, TDR Bank to facilitate online transactions","Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao on Thursday officially launched the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) Bank to facilitate online transactions in TDRs.

The TDR Bank application developed by GHMC will help boost sale and usage of TDR certificates, issued in lieu of land acquired for infrastructure projects such as road and nala widening, and lake development.

As per the government orders issued in 2017, 400% TDR is applicable in lieu of the land acquisition for road widening, and 200% for sites affected under conservation and development of lakes, nalas and other water bodies.

The revised TDR policy has given greater strength in negotiating with property owners, thereby reducing huge financial burden on GHMC for speedy acquisition of properties for major projects such as SRDP, link roads and others, as part of infrastructural improvement programme.

There has been a significant increase in the issue of TDRs post the announcement of the policy, with more than 550 certificates being issued so far by GHMC, it said.

Recently, the government has amended the clause pertaining to utilisation of TDRs, by making them applicable anywhere within ORR in HMDA jurisdiction. It is expected to increase the demand for TDRs.

The TDR bank has been developed by GHMC keeping in view the large scale demand. The online application will have all features such as issue, utilisation, and sale of the certificates. It will contain dynamic data of the extent available after utilisation.

The existing certificate holders too will be given an opportunity to create an account and convert their hard copies into digital format. Once it is done, only online transactions will be permitted of TDRs.

As the TDRs can only be realised through construction of an additional floor than is allowed per norms, those wishing to raise structures above the permitted limit may seek to acquire TDRs in open market, for a price. GHMC’s role is limited to providing a platform for transactions, and it does not fix pricing terms.

The online TDR bank application can be viewed at the web page ‘http://tdr.ghmc.telangana.gov.in:8080/’.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wsv1gt/article30755906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07KTRTDR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/now-tdr-bank-to-facilitate-online-transactions/article30755905.ece

Mr. Reddy said that several top BJP leaders constantly targeting Mahatma Gandhi’s image were not even born when he was alive and they were ridiculing the Father of the Nation without realising that they were doing it at the cost of the nation.

He also said that Mahatma Gandhi and his philosophy were relevant even today not just in India but across the world, and several countries in the world revere him and follow his philosophy of non-violence. But BJP leaders like Ananth Kumar Hegde were claiming Nathuram Godse was better than Gandhi, he said.

324,2020/02/07,Customer care centres become first casualty of BSNL’s mass retirement,"Several customer care centres of BSNL have become a casualty of mass retirement of staff under VRS a few days ago, but senior officers of the telecom behemoth did not concede that they were shut down though the centres were visibly closed.

A senior officer of BSNL told The Hindu that about 40 non-remunerative centres were working with reduced staff and limited hours in Hyderabad. There may have been curtailment in shifts of duties of staff resulting in closure of the premises for some hours.

Outsourcing

He said the footfalls at major customer care centres and even the revenue against previous month’s average were normal. As many as 2,800 BSNL employees took retirement under VRS in Hyderabad. The effort was to employ staff on outsourcing basis to put the services back on rails, but it was likely that this will take two to three months.

The BSNL has appointed franchises at some places to execute the services handled by retired staff but they were found wanting in expertise related to landlines. They merely dealt with bill collections and issue of SIMs. Since the BSNL had underground cable network whose links with the telephone exchanges were only in the knowledge of linemen, the franchisees were all at bay in attending to calls of repairs. The territorial jurisdiction of linemen left in service was being widened to attend to repairs.

In Siddipet, for instance, not a single lineman was left on rolls as all of them had opted for VRS. The maintenance of lines had become a major challenge in the town.

A visit to BSNL establishments elsewhere in Hyderabad showed skeletal staff struggling to attend to call of duty. At the Central Telegraph Office at Abids where BSNL bill payments were accepted from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. till the staff were in full strength, the working hours were limited to 9 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. But, the swiping machines for payment by bank debit cards either here or at Gowliguda telephone exchange did not work.

325,2020/02/07,Jagan likely to appear before CBI special court today,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy is likely to fly to Hyderabad on Friday (today) to appear before the CBI Special Court where he is facing a batch of quid pro quo cases registered by CBI.

The special court judge B.R. Madhusudan Rao, according to police sources, would be out of station. Another judge in-charge of the special court is likely to give fresh dates of hearing for the cases listed on Friday.

Central zone police of Hyderabad are making elaborate security arrangements at the special court located in a multi-storied complex on Nampally-MJ Market main road for the AP Chief Minister’s court appearance. Mr. Reddy appeared in the special court for the first time in his capacity as Chief Minister on this January 9. If the in-charge judge confines to call work, Mr. Reddy is unlikely to stay for long in the court like his previous appearance.

Mr. Jagan had already knocked the doors of Telangana High Court by filing 10 writ petitions relating to charge-sheets filed by the CBI in quid pro quo cases seeking exemption from appearing before the special court. When these petitions came up for hearing on this January 28, Justice G. Sridevi of the HC directed the CBI to file counter affidavit and posted the batch of petitions to Thursday (January 6).

The petitions were supposed to be heard on Thursday but were adjourned for a week by the judge as the CBI counsel sought time to file counter affidavit. Mr. Reddy’s counsel S.

326,2020/02/07,Third parties to assess quality of city roads,"Third-party agencies will be selected to assess quality of city roads under private maintenance, as part of the Comprehensive Road Maintenance (CRM) programme.

GHMC will call for tenders within a day or two from agencies for zone-wise third party quality control. The roads in the zones concerned will be randomly assessed by the agencies and reports will be submitted to GHMC, officials informed.

Initially, tenders will be called for two years’ duration, and based on the performance, the contract will be extended for the complete duration of CRM, which is five years. Reputed engineering colleges with good quality infrastructure will be called for tenders, Chief Engineer (Maintenance) Mohd. Ziauddin said.

As per the tender criteria, the college should have at least 10 years’ presence within 10 to 20 kilometres of the city, and should have Civil Engineering as one of the streams. It should have well equipped laboratory to conduct the required number of tests on the city roads.

However, reports by the third party agencies will not be final when it comes to decisions based on the quality.

“Quality check will be done separately by three parties — the contracting agency, GHMC and the third party agency. Based on all the reports, a decision will be taken. Wherever the road is damaged or found not up to the mark, the contractor will have to redo the whole road, and not only the damaged part,” Mr.Ziauddin said.

Where the road quality is found to be compromised, action will also be taken against the engineers who supervised the work, he said.

The Engineering officials at the GHMC headquarters will now focus fully on the quality control aspect of the road maintenance, as the authority to call for tenders for works up to ₹2 crore value has been delegated to Zonal Commissioners.

A total of 709 kilometres of road length in the city has been handed over to private agencies for maintenance, for a duration of five years under the CRM programme. They constitute almost all the major road stretches in the city.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bsmswt/article30755588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/third-parties-to-assess-quality-of-city-roads/article30755589.ece
327,2020/02/07,Kenny Wayne Shepherd’s got the blues,"Blues guitarist, Kenny Wayne Shepherd has been a performer for over two decades. Shepherd who hails from Shreveport, Louisiana, was exposed to music since he was a child. The city has been home to greats like bluesman Leadbelly and country star Hank Williams Jr. The youngster also grew up listening to Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and James Brown, and that shaped his thinking.

Myriad influences

Shepherd, who is performing at the Mahindra Blues Festival this weekend, is also self-taught. “That process was quite tedious, but it helped me develop my own style. There’s a lot of blues, rock and southern music in my songs, with some country and folk influences too,” he says. The festival also features blues great Buddy Guy, the brilliant Keb’ Mo’ and sister duo Larkin Poe. Besides his famous 1997 song ‘Blue On Black’ and other numbers he wrote over the years, Shepherd will be playing songs from his latest album The Traveler. He says, “A lot of people know ‘Blue On Black’. I was wearing a tee with those colours and thus gave the name.” The Traveler, released last May, incorporates various elements from the southern parts of the US. The song ‘Woman Like You’ has become a crowd favourite, and ‘Tailwind’ and ‘Gravity’ have been critically acclaimed. It features his own band including Noah Hunt on vocals. The album also contains versions of Buffalo Springfield’s ‘Mr Soul’ and Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh's ‘Turn To Stone’. Asked why the riff of ‘Mr Soul’ sounds so much like the Rolling Stones hit ‘Satisfaction’, Shepherd laughs, “Ask Neil Young. He wrote the Springfield song.”

Besides his own band, the musician has also played for The Rides with the legendary Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills & Nash and keyboardist Barry Goldberg of Electric Flag. He says, “Stephen is a mentor to me. He’s always been encouraging me to sing more, and I’ve used my voice a few times in the latest album.” Shepherd recollects the time in the 1990s when besides him, other teenagers like Jonny Lang and Joe Bonamasa suddenly made waves. “There was a lot of talent, and senior musicians like B.B. King and Buddy Guy advised us. We all have our own styles. I try to focus more on songwriting in that the lyrics should be relatable and the tunes catchy,” he says.

Racing through

On today’s young blues artistes Christone ‘Kingfish’ Ingram and Quinn Sullivan, Shepherd says, “They remind me of my teenage days. It's great to see youngsters keep the tradition alive. Larkin Poe, part of the Mahindra Blues Festival, are really good.” When the musician isn’t recording or touring, he spends time with his wife Hannah, daughter of Mel Gibson, and their six children. How does he balance music, family and parenthood? He replies, “I've learnt how to manage my schedule, and I give quality time for everything. I'm also a racing fanatic, though I wish I had more time to drive my Dodge Demon at max speed.” His rapidfire guitar solos seem to compensate.

328,2020/02/07,"Tablas, guitars set the tune for kalbelia and kathak","Titi Robin made his first foray into the Indian arts as a young composer in the late 1980s. He was mesmerised by kalbelia dancer Gulabo Sapera and her adaptation of a snake charmer’s dance. Thirty years later, the fascination has evolved into a production titled Khushboo, a curated performance that combines music and dance. It is a quest for artistic conversation, “a collection of old memories, renewed afresh” he says.

For this show, Robin has worked with Sapera and her percussionist son, Dino Banjara, as well as long-time friend and collaborator, sarangi artist Murad Ali Khan. Robin’s guitar and buzuk compositions bring together instruments like the sarangi and alternative percussion, with dance forms like kathak and the Rajasthani kalbelia. “For the first time, kathak exponent Mahua Shankarji is part of the performance. In fact, it’s the first time I’m collaborating with a kathak artiste,” he tells us. Add tabla by Amaan Ali Khan and Shuheb Hasan’s Hindustani vocals to the mix, and you have what seems like a cross-cultural mashup — but they all have a unifying factor. “In essence, these varied styles meet through my original repertoire,” he explains.

Kalbelia dancer Gulabo Sapera

Bridging the gap

Khushboo premièred in Delhi’s Alliance Francaise almost a year ago, and is currently making its way across the country — shows in Bengaluru, Pune, Ahmedabad and Pune preceded their visit to Chennai. Each iteration, says Robin, is an evolution of past performances, crediting the shows’ aesthetic presentation to Khan’s talent. This isn’t the pair’s first time in the city, having presented Laal Aasman in a quartet a few years back. Robin says, “Murad urged this reunion of old friends. I had complete confidence in his understanding of my original aesthetic.” Working together for a decade can foster that kind of understanding. “Titi and I joined hands ten years ago for the recording of our CD, Laal Aasman. A bunch of tours and concerts later... Well, we never stopped,” Khan laughs.

Robin’s approach to the stage is indicative of his simplicity, and the pride he takes in what different cultures have to offer. “All of my projects are branches of the same tree, you see. Perhaps the compositions are mine, but once we take the stage, I am simply an active participant,” he beams. It is an extension of his feelings for the other artists — he encourages them to improvise for receptive audiences. In the moment, Khan can’t help but join in, saying, “Robin’s compositions and my understanding of them are no more than the result of a certain harmony we aim to reach between our common cultures. As artists, that’s all we strive for.”

329,2020/02/07,With a larger focus on young blood,"Shilparamam transformed into a destination for everything Thyagaraja to the delight of connoisseurs and musicians in the fifth edition of Sanskriti Foundation’s Hyderabad Thyagaraja Aradhana Music Festival, hosted over a five-day span last week. From felicitations of veterans to solo concerts of instrumentalists to that of the vocalists, there was ample diversity on offer in musical styles, celebrating the 18th century born vaggeyakara’s contributions in full glory.

While it’s true that the Aradhanas unify young and established names like no other event through the year, the challenge for musicians remain in putting their best foot forward in the limited time that’s on offer. If ace violinist Annavarapu Ramaswamy’s presence anchored the first day of the event, it was the young N C Kousik Kalyan’s simplicity and tenderness in his singing that did the balancing act. Approaching kritis like Anyayamu Seyaku Raa and Evarunnaru Brova with an honesty you wouldn’t associate with an emerging vocalist, he had rasikas rooting for him.

However, other popular names like the TK sisters (Saroja and Sujatha) in addition to the experienced duo of Indira Kameswara Rao-Neti Sarala disappointed with their efforts. The former’s rendition of unique kritis like Maa Paala Velasika, Sandehamunu Deerpumayya was fine in terms of technique but seemed strung together sans bhava. The Indira Kameswara Rao-Neti Sarala concert, in contrast, was an attempt to be soulful, yes, yet their shaky voice-quality barely matched their sincerity.

The second day was a marked improvement in terms of the musical quality on offer, the icing on the cake being Annavarapu Ramaswamy’s violin concert. Hyderabad-based K Shyam Kumar utilised the platform to his advantage, where there was an old-school charm in his non-showy singing of the alapanas. The Maruvadhanyasi ragam explored through Mrudubhashana was his best effort for the day, as he also touched upon kritis like Nee Chittamu and Atu Karadani Balka.

Veteran’s memorable outing

N Rama Murthy’s precision and consistency in his concerts, backed by a dense voice, was a genuine value addition to the evening. The focus on the Ganamurthi ragam with Ganamurthe and Nanu Kanna Talli (in Trayi ragam) helped him shine, before Annavarapu Ramaswamy’s deft bowing on the violin across several sthayis won the attention of the audiences.

Sujana Jeevana, Chakkani Raja, Brova Bharama among many proved a cakewalk with his experience. More than his concert, it was the anecdotes about his guru Parupalli Ramakrishna Panthulu and Balamuralikrishna that stayed with the crowds. The Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram piece to end the evening was a relevant choice to remember one of Mahatma Gandhi’s fondest bhajans on his death anniversary.

Chaganti Ramya Kiranmayi’s second concert in Hyderabad in as many weeks proved fruitful for the listener on day three, on which another vocalist Mruduravali stole the honours with the panache in her rendition, empowered by an unusual self-assurance for her age. The flourishes of ragams like Jhankara Dhwani, Simhendra Madhyamam and Mukhari got a rare push on the concert stage. The no-frills singing across works like Needu Charanamule, Karu Baru was followed by the multi-faceted Manda Anantha Krishna’s concert on the flute.

The flautist adhered to the concert-structure for the major part of his renditions, dwelling upon the ragam as much as the composition. The healing quality of ragam Kapi came through in Intha Sowkhyamani, reminding the rasika about the tryst with the same ragam in Jo Achyutananda too. The pacier version of Niravadi Sukhada was worth the wait for being the last number for the day, with the presence of the morsing bringing in diversity to the musical result.

Imprint of youngsters

The following day began with a local touch and a dash of young blood, where students of many music schools in addition to their gurus impressed with their collaborative efforts. The evening was a dedication to Modumudi Sudhakar in many ways. Besides his solo concert, his daughter Sruthi Ranjani and disciple U Venkata Mohana Vamsi (both vocalists) had performed in two exclusive recitals, consolidating the Vijayawada-based musician’s reputation as a guru.

The imprint of the veteran was visible in both of his shishyas precisely for their selfless approach to the craft, the melodic twist to the singing, finding the right balance between grammar and popular appeal. Mohana Vamsi’s brief context to every composition rung in a personal touch to his concert and Sruthi Ranjani’s honey-soaked voice in Rama Ninne Namminanu left the audiences asking for more. Modumudi’s concert rung in completeness to the day, and his comfort with the haunting numbers like Entha Muddo Entha Sogaso goes without saying.

The Pancharatna seva on the final day got its deserved artsy twist with the presence of artist Kuchi. Stalwarts like Yella Venkateswara Rao, Hyderabad Sisters (Lalitha and Hari Priya), Ayyagari Syamasundaram in addition to Sudhakar Modumudi, Popuri Gowrinath lead a group of at least 400 musician rendition of the kritis, as Kuchi simultaneously wrapped a painting of Thyagaraja.

Although a Sunday evening to the grand finale merited bigger names, the organisers opted to let the emerging lot gain precedence. The veena concert by an unnerved Padmaja Varanasi was like a popular bunch of kritis rolled into a single unit, with Tulasidalamulache and Bantureeti Koluvu standing tall among the rest.

One of the key architects behind the event, violinist DVK Vasudevan dug into the depths of the Chandrajyothi ragam under the moonlit skies of the amphitheatre (which is as literal as it could get) with Bagayanayya besides reminding rasikas of the largely-ignored Balahamsa ragam through Dandamu Pettenura.

Composer, vocalist Popuri Gowrinath’s finishing touch accompanied by his better half Gayatri Gowrinath was memorable, retaining the original flavour of the compositions like Santhamu Leka Soukhyamu Ledu, (besides discussing the vritta anuprasa in) Rama Kodanda Rama. But it was his experiment to begin Jagadananda Karaka with its anupallavi ‘Gaganadhipa Satkulaja’ that took many by surprise.

Doing away with the usage of plastic at the venue by partnering with the NGO Bartan and ensuring a high-quality web streaming of the events were other important takeaways from the series. Though the event was inclusive of all the must-haves expected of a Thyagaraja aradhana, it could have worked more on making the vaggeyakara relevant for the times.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/unix9e/article30762315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf07Kousik-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30762323.ece
330,2020/02/07,Sonu Nigam: An undeterred focus on the present,"He may have been performing on stage for decades now, but for Sonu Nigam, every concert is deserving of his respect and concern. The artiste who has sung in numerous Indian languages says he tries to accommodate every audience request at his concert. “It doesn’t matter where I’m on tour, if a lone voice calls out for a Kannada song, everyone present — whether Punjabi, Gujarati or Malayali — will have to listen to at least one Kannada number after that,” he says.

When it comes to singing in South Indian languages, Sonu says he does not find them too hard. “Many times I've noticed the translators are unsure of how the words sound. But if they are well-versed in the language and are able to guide you well, then no dialect is too hard.”

Talking about the relevance of live concerts in an age when almost all manner of entertainment is available on streaming platforms, Sonu says concerts are the ultimate test of an artiste’s prowess. “Concerts are the litmus test of an artiste’s caliber,” he says, adding that if there is a medium between the artiste and the end audience, then there is a measure of uncertainty. “How proficient a singer, athlete or musician is, is demonstrated when they are directly in the eye of the audience. There is no room for doubt or duplicity then.”

“Besides, if you have built up a reputation for your work like the masters Yesudas, SP Balasubrahmanyam and Zakir Husain, then definitely people will flock to wherever you are, to get a glimpse of something special and they won’t mind paying for it either. A chance to witness brilliance is what draws people.” Apart from stage presence, Sonu believes a true artiste always strives to keep learning and staying in tune with their craft. “They give out a vibe which is conveyed in their work.”

When asked about what’s next, Sonu has an refreshingly, unexpected answer. “I live a very satisfied life with no aspiration or ambition. I have been enjoying this state of mind for the last couple of years. I had decided that I wouldn’t do anything I wasn’t convinced about,” says the singer who no longer feels driven to record songs as he doesn’t enjoy them as much as he used to. “I have reached a point where the present is the most important thing. I don’t worry about the future. I have a beautiful life and things keep happening on their own. Whatever has to come my way, does so.”

As testament to this, Sonu shares how two of his non-film songs became hits on social media last year. “One was a Shiv Shankara bhajan that I began the year with and the other was an English song I recorded with Polish singer Natalia Lesz at the end of the year. So good things keep happening if you just go with the flow.”

331,2020/02/07,Where technique and soul found a meeting ground,"Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram’s monthly concert series hosted at Saptaparni has been instrumental in casting light on the unexplored local musical talents over the years. The previous week’s concert was a significant step forward for its effort to foster female presence among classical musicians in Hyderabad. Vocalist Bhamidipati Lalitha Madhav took centre stage at the event where her co-musicians Radhika Srinivasan on the violin and Veenadhari on the mridangam chipped in with their impressive enthusiasm. A 10-year-old youngster Siva Teja’s presence on the kanjira rung in vibrancy to the musical evening.

Lalitha Madhav’s refined voice culture opened audiences to her ease with vocal modulation, needless to say, her clear diction. She displayed her skill within the scope of a composition and cut any possible indulgences short. Setting a strong emotional foundation to a number with her elaborate-yet-effective ragalapanas, bringing the texture and the niceties of the raga in impressive depth, the concert was as educative as it was soulful. The only issue was with its limited audience to appreciate the same.

She ticked most boxes right with her composition choices, making space for the classical trinity in addition to vaggeyakaras like G N Balasubramaniam, Mysore Vasudevachar and Mutthaiah Bhagavatar in addition to the quintessential Narayana Theertha for a tarangam. Devotion laced with a dose of philosophy is a good combination to savour and this concert had it aplenty.

Maathe Malayadhwaja, the Mutthaiah Bhagavatar varnam in Khamas ragam, an ode to Goddess Meenakshi was just the right popular piece to ease a rasika into a concert (apt also for a women-led event) before heading towards to the lesser-explored works of other musicians. Vara Vallabha Ramana’s inherent pleasantness in Hamsadhwani ragam radiated in her next piece, but the experience of listening to a vivadi ragam like Nasikabhushani brought intrigue to the concert. Only utilised by a handful of vaggeyakaras, its candour during the rendition of Thyagaraja’s Maaravairi Ramani felt like a piece of history being revisited.

Dvaithamu Sukhama in Reethigowla ragam (known to evoke the karuna and bhakti rasas), structured more like a question from Thyagaraja directed to the Almighty about the right path to salvation and his idea about oneness, is a work where the vocalist’s understanding of its subtext is integral to the singing. Lalitha Madhav made sure the experience was as elevating and extended this idea to another number ably, Annamacharya’s Naguvulu Nijamani in Yamuna Kalyani ragam.

The technically resounding Kaasi Visalakshi of Dikshitar in Purvikalyani ragam was aimed more at the musically aware connoisseur with the innovative swara kalpana and ragalapana, whose emotional core could have been stronger. Her swift transition between the brisk gamakas to the varied swara phrases, the assertiveness of the mridangam artiste went a long way in making a memorable main item out of Thyagaraja’s Chakkani raja in Kharaharapriya ragam.

It was a happy sign to see the Tarangam inch its way back to recitals after a lull, the choice of Narayana Theertha’s Kalyana Gopalam describing the resplendence of Krishna as a bridegroom in Sindhu Bhairavi ragam made for a pleasant hearing. It was hard to be unmoved by Syama Sastri’s leisurely-structured Nannu Brovu Lalitha in a composition bearing the ragam name in its initial lines (Lalitha).

In a concert dominated by slow-paced, melody centric works, the presence of the riveting Neekela Dayaradu Ramachandra (in Kadanakutuhala ragam) was indeed invigorating. The contrast of an empowering ragam set to a lyric that talks of the Almighty’s lack of acknowledgement to a sincere devotee makes this Mysore Vasudevachar work all the more interesting.

The climactic Thillana in Rageswari ragam, a work of Lagudi Jayaraman was no less pulsating. The accompanists got a deserving platform to present their skill through the evening. Near perfect with the musical appeal and technical finesse, Lalitha Madhav could have afforded a better balance between the familiar and rare compositions for a far-reaching impact.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/yh4jo4/article30761798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf07Lalitha1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-friday-review-telangana/article30761801.ece
332,2020/02/07,Behind the high walls of Visakhapatnam’s All India Radio,"For 47-year-old P Kanaka, her tiny transistor is a constant companion. “With the radio beside me, I do not need a clock. When the first news bulletin comes on air, at 6.40 am, I know, it is time for me to start preparing the breakfast. The afternoon bulletin of 1.20 pm is my cue to sit down for lunch,” she laughs.

Kanaka has been listening to All India Radio since her childhood. “My mother was a tailor and she loved working as she listened to the songs on the radio. She timed her chores around the programmes aired and that is a habit I picked up from her. Though several other radio stations have come up in the past decade, I stuck to AIR because I like their old-school ways and it is much more than just songs, they have news, educational programmes and interviews. It keeps me updated,” she adds.

Just a kilometre away from Kanaka’s house is All India Radio where assistant director of the program wing, K Satyanarayana Murthy sits. “All the programmes are planned at least three months ahead of the broadcast. This ensures we have ample time to produce high-quality content. Each programme is thoroughly researched and edited,” he says. There are programmes for women about healthcare, for students on coping with exam stress, and tips on preparing to write them, short stories, plays and music...“We recently wrapped up an 18-episode show called Gahe Tava Jaya-Gatha that traced the history of India from the first war of independence right up to 1947. It was a huge hit among the listeners as we received at least 15 to 20 letters every week appreciating the show,” he adds. Satyanarayan recalls that a show titled Sound track was one of the most popular ones in his career. Every Sunday, the sound track of a film was condensed into one hour and played on the radio. “It was hugely popular as most of the movies were classics of that era. The show was stopped almost a decade ago after running for over 20 years,” he says.

Did you know? AIR is one of the largest broadcasting organisations in the world. Its motto is 'Bahujan Hitaya: Bahujan Sukhaya'

AIR’s home service comprises 479 stations

It reaches nearly 92% of the country’s area and 99.19% of the total population

AIR creates programmes in 23 languages and over 140 dialects

Programmes of the External Services Division are broadcast in 11 Indian and 16 foreign languages reaching out to more than 100 countries

Over 44 Regional News Units originate 469 daily news bulletins in 75 languages

Andhra Pradesh has nine full-fledged stations and five relay stations covering 99% of the area and reaching to 99.5% of the population.

One of the popular shows, currently, is the Telugu version of the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat that is broadcast right after the original one in Hindi.

Flashback

The radio station in Visakhapatnam was set up on August 4, 1963, at Kurmannapalem, over 20 kilometres away from the city. The station started with a 10-kilowatt transmitter. However, this was upgraded to a 100kW transmitter in May 1976 as several surrounding districts of Srikakulam and East Godavari remained out of coverage with the earlier transmitter.

“In earlier days, the anchor would have to carry magnetic tapes to the studio for their respective programmes. Hence the songs to be played were largely pre-determined. These days the anchors have two or three computers, they can immediately change the song list or talk about new topics during the show,” says Ramakrishna Prasad of the engineering wing.

AIR shifted its base from Kurmannapalem to Siripuram in 1986. With connectivity up to 250 to 300 kilometres, the radio signals reached the fishermen far out in the sea and also the tribal people in Araku and Paderu. “We have employees who travel to the remote tribal areas and get bytes from there about their problems and demands. At AIR, we broadcast about schemes and initiatives that have been launched for them. Frequent weather updates are given on the radio to keep fishermen updated on the weather conditions,” says Satyanarayan.

Radio in times of calamity

When the cyclonic storm HudHud devasted the city, the modern modes of communication broke down. It was only through hourly updates on the radio that the government was able to communicate with the masses. “We were broadcasting round the clock. We educated the people about the rehabilitation initiatives, and roped in concerned officials to talk about schemes and activities for those affected,” says Satyanarayan. The radio station stood tall and worked and broadcast 24 hours at a stretch during Cyclone Fani and Cyclone Titli.

“In 2004 when Tsunami hit the east coast, I was working as a correspondent for AIR. With communication lines down, radio was the only means of reaching out to the public. Since there was no Internet in those days, I would come back to the station every two hours and update the news. We also broadcast interviews with fishermen who were devastated by the calamity,” says M S Mahesh, assistant director of News wing.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/osj48n/article30760553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VZAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/behind-the-high-walls-of-visakhapatnams-all-india-radioalways-in-touch/article30760558.ece
333,2020/02/07,The politics of consent,"The word itself might refer to the very edges of our experiences, where ideas and notions acquire a lucid and distinctive clarity, but the play Extremities, written by William Mastrosimone and recently staged in Mumbai by director Hidayat Sami, achieves the blurring of lines that, unwittingly perhaps, appears to obfuscate the issues at hand. First performed in 1982, this meditation on rape appears dated and problematic although coming at a time the #metoo movement (and its resolute taking of sides) continues to pepper the airwaves, one might understand why theatremakers would want to revisit it — it is inexplicably an amatueur theatre staple in the West.

Discomfiting watch

The play is no Rashomon — the central event in which a stranger (Gagan Riar) assaults a woman, Marjorie (Aditi Puthran), who’s alone in her apartment is not shrouded in any kind of ambiguity. There is violence, coercion, the explicit lack of consent, even premeditation. International productions of the play make a meal of it, milking the ‘drama’ for all it’s worth, so much so that the play has acquired a reputation of frequent injuries during rehearsals. Sami has his perpetrator simply pin Marjorie down belligerently, but it is still a discomfiting watch, perhaps more sensational than introspective, and no doubt troubling for survivors who might be in the audience. Staging sexual assault doesn’t really stray from the literal, but even in so-called realistic settings, an unexpected portrayal might well prove more compelling or gut-wrenching. When Marjorie overpowers the man, blinds him with bug-spray, ties him up and then binds him to a fireplace fender, most of the action is implied in a long fade-out. However, that a rape needs to be ‘seen’ in order for us to believe the victim, and perhaps to eliminate any subjectivity in the eye of the viewer of what actually happened, is reductive and retrograde.

There is also a strange kind of morality brimming under the surface, creating an equivalence between the man’s transgressions with Marjorie’s vindictiveness that comes as a consequence of it. Here, the debate is not about legal remedies, but egregious personal retribution that supposedly dwarfs the act – committed by a family man who found a woman’s attire provocative enough to stalk her for weeks before moving in for a kill. Riar is even allowed a redemption speech in the end, and he plays up his ‘charming cad’ spiel somewhat disingenuously, and those in attendance titter helplessly along. Marjorie’s roommates, Terry (Saloni Shukla) and Patricia (Fatima Arif), who arrive at the scene almost appear to buy in more easily to his sob-story rather than her version of events. Puthran’s coldness of demeanour doesn’t make her a credible witness even for them and while they are compelled to support her in feminine solidarity, there is little sympathy lost. Victim-blaming is part of this turf with revealing clothes taking a knock yet again, and antiquated rape laws and invasive legal procedures are talked of as deterrents to due process — but where the play could’ve brought out the ironies and contradictions in these very conversations powerfully it simply reinforces the status quo.

Raw power

By contrast, a short play that deals with the lack of consent within a relationship — Rapunzel 2.0 by Tanvi Lehr Sonigra — forces us to engage with a similar turf far more convincingly. Its title refers to the fairy-tale from the Brothers Grimm collection, in which a princess lets down her long golden hair to let her keepers climb up to her, which is already an intrusion even if, like Sleeping Beauty’s kiss, it has been looked at almost benignly. In her self-devised piece, Sonigra has her hair cut short, almost in protest, as she attempts to straddle the dualities of gender that promise to become a path to deliverance from a past fraught with abuse and debilitating self-doubt. It is a piece in which Sonigra doesn’t shy away from nudity, and that gives the performance both its moments of striking vulnerability and raw power. The piece then becomes a site for catharsis.

334,2020/02/07,Chutti artiste Margi Raveendran Nair’s make-up transforms Kathakali actors into characters,"Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Margi Raveendran Nair’s hands are rock steady as he carefully draws thin white stripes on a black background. Eyebrows furrowed and lips pursed, he is a picture of concentration as each white line is added to complete the chutti (make-up) of Sadanam Vishnuprasad playing the role of the villainous Nivathakavachan in Kalakeyavadham Kathakali for a play at Margi Natyagriham in the city.

With hardly discernible but fluid circular movements of his wrist, he applies the white-coloured rice paste as slim ridges on the actor’s face. A thin, pencil-like wooden stick is dabbed into a container filled with the white paste and then applied as dots, stripes and curves on the black base.

“The black is lamp black that we make ourselves. The white paste is obtained by grinding rice to the required consistency and mixing with lime in the right proportion. Even today, the right way to make the colours — green, yellow, black, blue and white — is from natural ingredients. Stones, herbal powders and natural powders are mixed with sesame oil or coconut oil. The dried seeds of the chunda poo (Solanum indica with light violet flowers) is used to redden the eyes. It takes about three to four hours for the chutti,” explains Raveendran.

The green room of the heritage Margi Natyagriham at East Fort resembles an artist’s studio. Under the glare of a lamp-holder with several bulbs, two chutti artistes apply the intricate make-up of two of the villains of the play. With his head on the lap of the chutti artiste, the actor playing the demon Kalakeya is in the midst of a power nap during his make-up, quite oblivious to the artwork coming alive on his face. Vishnuprasad silently observes the coming and going of people while he is in the midst of his make-up. Arjuna, the hero of the play, is putting the finishing touches to his predominantly green make-up (pacha or green indicates heroic characters). Tiny pots of coloured pastes, rags, wooden sticks, eerkkil (midrib of the coconut palm) and more are scattered on the floor while a traditional lamp has been lit in a corner of the room.

Learning from titans

Kathi, as the character of terrible villains are known in Kathakali, are the most difficult to work on, says the 59-year-old chutti artiste and manager of Margi, a cultural organisation in Thiruvananthapuram promoting and teaching traditional art forms of Kerala.

Since 1979, he has been applying the distinctive, elaborate make-up of Kathakali characters that identifies them on stage as hero, heroine, sage, comic, villain and so on. “I had trained to be a Kathakali actor from the age of 11, as my father, Krishna Pillai, was a huge fan of the art form. Since my arangettam (maiden performance on stage), I have shared the stage with several titans of the art form such as Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair aashaan, Mankulam aashaan, Chennithala Ramakrishan Pillai aashaan, Madavoor aashaan… In 1979, I became a part of Margi and began learning the art of chutti and vesham (costuming) from RLV Somnath, who was the then in-charge at Margi. Mankulam Vishnu Namboodiri aashaan, then a faculty member in Margi, gave me ample opportunities to learn both chutti and vesham,” he recalls.

Colour coded The chutti of Kathakali artistes has many stages. First is the valayam pidikkal, when the artist, using rice paste and gum, demarcates a space from one ear to the other. This marks the borders for the chutti artiste to work on.

Next comes theppu wherein the actor himself, barring, perhaps, the very senior ones, applies the basic colours on his face. And then the chutti artiste does his work on the face. Finally, the white paper ridges extending from one cheek to the other (adjacent to the ears) and covering the chin are stuck with the help of rice paste and gum.

Kathi, kari and thaadi characters have a lot of defining artwork for their make-up. After the make-up, they step into their elaborate costumes. Then they wear the headgear.

A yellow stone called manayola is ground to obtain the yellow pigment while red is from the mineral cinnabar. Green is made by grinding China blue and blending it with manayola. Adding more of blue to the manayola gives a deep blue used for the chutti of tribes woman and so on.

In addition to learning how to make the colours and apply them, he had to master ornamentation of the crown and the right way of donning costumes. After completing the two-year course in chutti and vesham, he began working on the make-up of a galaxy of actors who became household names in Kathakali. The visage of greats such as Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, Padmanabhan Nair, Kalmandalam Ramankutty Nair, Kalamandalam Gopi, Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair… became his canvas as he transformed them into epic heroes, nymphs, kings, queens, warriors, blackguards, demons and more. At the recently concluded Nishagandhi festival too, Raveendran Nair was there, applying the colours for the leading men.

“Although certain things have not changed much when it comes to the make-up of Kathakali, there have been some significant changes. I have heard that in the olden days, the white chutti, extending from one cheek to the other, was made of rice flour. Now, it is made of paper. Moreover, resin of raw banana was used as a kind of gum. Now, we all use spirit gum on the face,” he adds. All set to retire from work next year, the veteran plans to spend his time watching plays and carrying on his work as a chutti artiste.

Does he regret not making it big as an actor? “No,” he asserts. Raveendran Nair is all smiles when he says that as part of Margi, he has seen the world. “It has been a colourful journey,” he adds.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/e8l966/article30761879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvmmargiraveendrannair2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/in-conversation-with-kathakali-make-up-artiste-margi-raveendran-nair-about-his-three-decade-long-journey/article30761880.ece
335,2020/02/07,An evening of theatre,"This Sunday, a team of newly trained theatre enthusiasts will take to the stage to present two plays — Hindi one-act comic play Bahut Bada Sawal written by Mohan Rakesh and the Telugu play Evvaniche Janinchu set in a rural backdrop, written by Divakar Babu. Both the plays of 50-minute duration each will mark the culmination of a two-month long theatre workshop conducted by Samahaara theatre group.

At the helm of this workshop is theatre director and acting trainer Pejjai Nagaraju. During the workshop in which he trained enthusiasts in acting, theatre production and stage craft, he had observed that some of them were comfortable speaking in Hindi but were not conversant in Telugu while it was the other way around for a few others. “So I chose a Hindi as well as a Telugu play that would give everyone in the team a chance to present their work,” says Nagaraju.

Many of the participants, as in the case of Samahaara’s previous workshops, informs Nagaraju, are employees of IT firms and participate in the workshop driven by the urge to do something creative. “Some of them are truly keen on theatre, and a few others look at it as a stepping stone to cinema. In fact, some of the actors trained by Samahaara are in the Telugu film industry, but until one makes it big, it’s a tough call to survive only on theatre and small film acting assignments,” says Nagaraju.

The cast rehearsing for Bahut Bada Sawaal

Talking about his choice of the plays, Nagaraju states that both Bahut Bada Sawal and Evvaniche Janinchu are relevant in contemporary scenario. Bahut Bada Sawal is a satire that looks at the seemingly never-ending circle of conducting meetings and discussions for clarifications and proposals, which often lead nowhere. One such meeting is in focus and the lack of interest and seriousness among the participants triggers a chain of comic exchanges. This one-act play, Nagaraju hopes, will entertain the audience with its witty lines.

Divakar Babu’s Telugu play Evvaniche Janinchu, on the other hand, takes a hard look at how superstitions are driven in the name of religion in a rural set-up where simple folk who look up to higher forces get exploited by cunning people. “This play is dialogue-heavy and the actors speak a North Andhra dialect with a Godavari slant. The actors trained to fine-tune their diction and show their prowess. This is a play where the actors get ample time on stage and can make an impact,” says Nagaraju, who adds that the play was written nearly 40 years ago, and it holds relevance today, “We still have situations where we deal with superstitions and it’s the poor that bears the brunt, since conducting rituals involve money.”

Evvaniche Janinchu is pitched a social satire and emphasises on the importance of social revolution, and questions the blind belief system.

336,2020/02/07,Ikat goes international: Rina Singh’s latest collection at Lakme Fashion Week is inspired by Little Women’s Jo March,"When designer Rina Singh of Eka travels to visit her parents at a village in Kurukshetra, Haryana, she refuses to accept store-bought gifts from relatives. “My mother, grandmother and aunts would sit out in the afternoon, and hand-embroider home linen, rajai covers, and craft lace. They feel ashamed to gift them to me, but I tell them how I would buy them at an antique market if they did not pass them on.” In fact, her latest Autumn-Winter 2020 collection — to be showcased at Lakme Fashion Week’s Sustainability Day On February 13 — features hand-painted and embroidered floral and geometric motifs inspired by these heirloom designs.

Going international

Taking off from her show in Telangana last year, she says the new collection is a second run with the State’s handloom clusters. “I have put an international perspective to the textiles and motifs since we will be selling them in Paris and New York,” says the designer, who launched The Kurta Collection for Japanese retailer Uniqlo’s India launch last year.

Loosely-shaped diaphanous dresses, pleated skirts, boxy jackets and oversized pea coats in contemporary shades feature in the collection inspired by Little Women’s Jo March. “I’m a huge fan of the series and Saoirse Ronan (who plays March in Greta Gerwig’s film adaptation of the novel),” says Singh, talking about how the outfits transform with March’s character: from being tomboyish (voluminous pants with shorter jackets) to feminine (embroidered tear dresses, wool layering). She has given typical shades like bright fuchsia, blue, mustard etc., a miss, as they “usually appeal [only] to the Indian diaspora”. She explains how artisans tend to use these vibrant colours as it is what they see around them. “To cater to the international market, I have worked with a palette of blues, washed-down browns and mints, translating the craft to make abstract and modern silhouettes that don’t reflect traditional ikat patterns,” says Singh, adding that Eka is India’s first design house to have worked with The Wool Lab and Italy’s Rami Riccardo Studio to put together the 2021 forecast book and seasonal sourcing guide.

Yarn it

As for fabrics, Singh has worked with the double and single ikat clusters of Kovalguddam, thigh-reeled Tussar silk from the Mahadevpur cluster, and cotton textiles from Narayanpet. Owing to Telangana’s dry climate, she says silk cotton is the primary fabric they work with. “The artisans use only spun silk which makes the fabric thick. This is not ideal for the international market, as for dresses and skirts, you need fabrics that drape well.” Which is why she felt it was important to change the basic content and yarn. Singh went on to develop silk and cotton blends, changed the yarn construction to make it lighter, and also twisted the yarn before dyeing it.

Rooting for sustainable

In a market scattered with ‘sustainable’ brands, and issues surrounding fast fashion and greenwashing, how does Singh foresee the future? “Sustainability is not just for yesterday and today, it has to be forever. No matter which industry you belong to, you cannot shy away from issues and a hardcore dialogue is necessary. We need to understand there are limited resources and start living frugally. As for the fashion industry, clothes are one of the biggest polluters, so why get people to buy into your created trends that will be out the next season? Instead, we simply need to reinvent our outfits every season,” says Singh. (₹22,000 onwards)

The celebrated Noida-based textile design house brings a story of crochet in their spring-inspired collection, Crafted in Crochet. Design director and founder, Mandeep Nagi, explains how it took her around six months to conceptualise and create the line of angrakhas, A-line kurtas, pyjamas, dupattas, and delicate saris. “Crafted in summer fabrics like silk cotton, soft organdy and tissue, it features over 5,000 metres of lace and 50,000 crochet flowers made by women in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district,” says Nagi, adding that the lace features on the collars, cuffs, necklines and borders. “Lace crochet flowers and pom poms also make for charming additions. In many pieces, the lace has been embellished with zari and glistening mukaish, traditional silver work from Lucknow.”

This year, the ace designer has partnered with Austrian fiber brand, Lenzing Ecovero to create outfits in viscose fiber that depict tribal and contemporary Indian art forms. Titled Nature’s Origami, the AW’20 collection is a culmination of four stories: Mrinalini Mukherjee’s exhibit at the MET, Neo Origami, Flora & Fauna, and Sundarvan. “The capsule encompasses fabric manipulation and the revival of age-old textile techniques. At the crossroads where modern chevron meets classic florals, you see laces and layering surfaces in Neo Origami. Festive felicity meets pleats and burnout velvet, and the abundance of la dolce vita in the potpourri of Sundarvan,” says Kumar, whose collection features vegetable dyes in shades of deep burgundy, faded ochre, violets and greens, lace work and layering surfaces. Speaking on her collaboration with Lenzing Ecovero, the designer says “it is a good initiative to be able to source a fabric that gives a rich look that their viscose fabrics does; the top end fabrics almost look like silk. I think it is a necessity to have something which doesn’t have to be polyester”.

From Ashdeen’s collection

Nostalgia @ Ashdeen

Textile designer, author and curator Ashdeen Lilaowala has delved into his own past for inspiration in this new collection, Memories on Cloth. “Looking at my childhood photographs, I had very fond memories of being dressed up in embroidered jhablas. Then there were the fancy dress parties to which my sister would be dressed as a Parsi man and my mum would dress me in a traditional sari,” he chuckles. He has reimagined these outfits for grown ups, as kaftans and blouses, with embellishments like oversized bows. “We’re also combining different techniques and patterns: in some, there are polka dots, others use the crane, and few pieces have all the motifs. This has been done on silks, organza, chiffon... We are creating the look of lace using embroidery,” adds Lilaowala. ₹28,000 for separates and ₹1 lakh for saris.

A House of Three creation

Kolams on jamdani @ House of Three

Continuing their format of integrating two states into each collection, the Bengaluru-based label picked Tamil Nadu and Bengal for this showcase — not least because designers Anu Shyamsundar and Sounak Sen are from these states. “The Kumarikandam collection is inspired by the ancient city that was discovered under the Indian Ocean, and is considered the birthplace of human civilisation. This is where Tamil culture came from,” explains Sen. They worked with master weaver Rajib Debnath to create muslin jamdani and Sathya and Santhanam from Kanchipuram and Kumbakonam respectively for Kanjivaram silk. “You’ll see typically jamdani patterns on Kanjivaram and kolam motifs on the muslins,” says Sen. ₹6,000 to ₹25,000 for pret.

337,2020/02/07,Book fair scripts a success story,"The 10-day ‘Nellai Book Fair 2020’, which commenced at VOC Stadium in Palayamkottai on February 1, has become a roaring hit as booksellers and publishers are quite happy with the sale crossing ₹1.50 crore in the first seven days.

When similar fair was organised in 2018, ₹2.10 crore worth books were sold in ten days.

As booksellers and publishers have displayed their books in over 110 stalls in the expo, people from various parts of Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts visit the fair with great deal of zeal to buy books. Over 1,27,938 visitors came to the book fair and purchased ₹30 lakh worth books in the first three days itself and the number crossed ₹1.50 crore with over 3.50 lakh persons visiting the fair, the organisers say.

“Since 10% discount is being given for all books and good number of publishers and the booksellers are giving ‘buy one get one free’ offer, reception for this expo is excellent. So far, ₹1.50 crore-worth books have been sold,” says Sub-Collector (Training) Sivaguru Prabhakaran, a member of the organising committee.

While most of the schools in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts are bringing their students to the book fair in the forenoon to buy books and also to participate in the cultural and literary competitions being organised on the sidelines of the expo, the public in large number visit the stalls in the evening with their children. Lectures by invited speakers, ‘pattimantram’ and other special programmes attract huge crowd in the evening. Unlike other functions, the special guests are being honoured strictly with khadi shawls as proposed by District Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish and not with other costly shawls.

Whenever aged or physically challenged visitors come, student volunteers of Sadakkathullah Appa College rush to them with wheelchairs and patiently take them around the book fair.

The Tirunelveli Corporation, which has opened a stall to explain to the people about the ‘Smart City’ programme, has sold over a tonne vericompost prepared in its micro compost centres created in various parts of the city as part of its solid waste management programme. “We’re selling one kilogram of vermicompost for ₹5 and we could sell over a tonne vermicompost in the first two days itself,” the staff manning the stall say.

The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project’s stall attracts huge crowd as visitors, particularly students, are keen on enriching their knowledge about nuclear energy and busting the myths associated with it by raising various questions. Students of engineering can be seen enquiring about qualifying themselves for the examinations being conducted by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited to select personnel to work in its nuclear reactors. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s Propulsion Research Complex at Mahendragiri in the district will open its stall on Saturday (February 8) and it will be open for visitors till Monday, the last day of the fair.

The most striking feature of the book fair is that students have started an attempt to create record by reading books continuously right from the start to the end of the book fair on February 10. The objective of this effort is to create awareness among the younger generation about the need for reading good books as the habit is waning fast in the digital era.

Another interesting feature is that the organisers have created an exclusive area for receiving from the public old books from all fields, especially books useful for poor students pursuing engineering, medicine, law, agriculture and other branches of arts and science and books that play a vital role in preparing for competitive examinations. These old books would be given to deserving students.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/t9alzx/article30765530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA08BOOKSTVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/book-fair-scripts-a-success-story/article30765531.ece
338,2020/02/07,Woman killed in road accident,"Josephine Mary, 70, a retired teacher, was killed and her husband, Gnanaraj, 75, sustained injuries when the car in which they were travelling collided with a container lorry on Aruppukottai-Thoothukudi highway here on Friday.

The police said that Gnanaraj, a retired professor, from Madurai, was driving the car towards Thoothukudi. When the car was speeding near the Palayampatti junction, he lost control of the vehicle and it jumped over the median on the four-lane highway and the car crashed into the opposite lane. A truck coming on the lane hit the car.

The couple was injured. Though Josephine walked out of the car and both of them were rushed to the Government Hospital here, she succumbed to her injuries. Air bags in the car did not open probably because the truck hit the car on its side.

However, a police source said that the accident was caused by the barricades that were put across the carriage way ahead of the junction. The driver could not identify whether the barricade kept on the left or right side on the road was the first one. “Only after coming closer, he realised that he was about to hit the barricade and applied sudden brake that led to the speeding car jump the median,” he said.

However, Aruppukottai Deputy Superintendent of Police, G. Venkatesan, denied this. “The very purpose of the barricades is to slow down the vehicles while crossing the junction where frequent accidents are reported. If the driver is confused, he should have only slowed down the vehicle and not tried to pass it at a high speed,” he said.

He also said only because of the barricades kept on the opposite lane, the container truck had come slower. Otherwise, the impact of the accident could have been worse.

Speaking on the occasion, she said that it was heartening to learn from the principals that over 90% of the students had passed out successfully from the district, which has ITIs at Theni, Bodinayakkanur and Andipatti respectively.

The State government has been allocating huge funds for education and students should make use of the opportunity. By equipping themselves with knowledge, the students can change the society more effectively, she added.

For their part, the district administration provided loans to neo-entrepreneurs to start their own ventures. The government gave subsidies and also the rates were very competitive.

The Collector said that apart from focusing on the syllabus, the government also imparted skill development to students. This gave them the confidence to handle the challenges in future as an employee or employer.

For the benefit of the students aspiring to go abroad and work, the government had its own overseas manpower corporation, which gives guidance. Instead of opting to go to private agents, who sometimes indulge in malpractice, the aspirants can utilise the services available with the government, Ms. Pallavi Baldev said and urged every student to give their best to the society.

The government, through the Department of Training, engaged resource persons, who in turn identified the skills in the students and gave them the right exposure. This has been a big success for students, who appeared for interviews in their campuses, the Collector said and wished the students good luck.

Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan, said that the isolation wards are ready in the three towns.

“Rajapalayam being the big town bordering Kerala State, we have set up one in Rajapapalayam and since lot of business travellers from Sivakasi travel to lot of countries, one more has been set up in Sivakasi,” he said.

Joint Secretary, Department of Public Health, A.

341,2020/02/07,Aadhar cards of dead residents of Srivilliputtur taluk to be collated,"For the first time in the country, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) will collate the Aadhar details of the dead residents of Srivilliputtur Taluk of Virudhunagar district in order to prevent misuse of those Aadhar numbers.

Deputy Director General of UIDAI, Bengaluru, R.S. Gopalan, held a meeting with the officials of Virudhunagar district, chaired by Collector R. Kannan, with regard to implementation of the pilot project.

Mr. Gopalan said that the data of UIDAI has been linked only with the birth register. “So far, it has not been linked with the death register,” he said.

Stating that any Aadhar number would not be repeated or re-assigned for 100 years, he said collation of Aadhar numbers of the dead residents had not been done so far. “Once, this process of collation of Aadhar numbers of the dead residents is done, we will prohibit those numbers from authentication,” he said.

The Virudhunagar Collector said that Srivilliputtur Tahsildar will be the nodal officer for the exercise and would be assisted by the District Adi Dravida Welfare Officer.

“In the first step, list of dead persons since 2014 will be collected from all villages of Srivilliputtur Taluk. Then, it will be verified whether the dead residents had any Aadhar card or not. In the third step, these details would be sent to UIDAI for verification with its data,” Mr. Kannan said.

After UIDAI verification is done, a field verification would be carried out and finally the Aadhar numbers of the dead persons would be prohibited from authentication, thereby preventing its misuse.

Mr. Gopalan said that a total of 128 crore people of the country have been issued Aadhar cards in the last 10 years. He added that most of those who have not got their Aadhar numbers are children. Aadhar kits have been given to Integrated Child Development Scheme and Department of School Education.

Children should update their Aadhar cards after 5 years of age and 15 years of age by providing their biometrics like finger prints and iris scan.

The 55 Aadhar centres set up at the schools in Virudhunagar district are meant only for school students to process their applications seeking aadhar cards. The awareness on the importance of Aadhar is being propagated through the children and short messaging service and social media.

Mr. Gopalan said that anyone of the 25 proof of identity can be submitted for incorporating changes in the Aadhar cards.

Instead of giving Aadhar card numbers, people can generate a 16-digit virtual number through UIDAI website and submit them. People should not give their Aadhar card copy to anyone.

Whenever there is a need to give Aadhar number, they can hide the first 8 digits of Aadhar number and give it.

343,2020/02/07,Police arrest over 200 youth partying at a private farm in upper Kodai hills,"In a major midnight operation conducted at a private farm in Gundupatti in the upper Kodai hills, the police detained around 250 youth, who were found to be in an inebriated condition and suspected to have consumed prohibited drugs sourced from international markets, as well as foreign liquor.

Following a specific input, a large contingent comprising three DSPs and over 125 police personnel cordoned the private farm situated on an isolated hillock on Thursday night.

The operation, which went on till the early hours of Friday, indicated that the guests were from many parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The guests, mostly, in the age group of 18 to 25 years, were either studying (second/third year) in colleges or had just joined private software companies.

A DSP told The Hindu that a group of men, who identified themselves as working for a private event management firm, had circulated invitations to the youth through the internet, and after getting their confirmation/acceptance, they had procured drugs such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana among others. Based on the choice of the guests, they were served liquor as well in the farm, the officer added.

While some of the young people, who claimed to be “first time” visitors were let off after a warning, some others were detained for interrogation. “We are on the look out for the private farm owner,” the officer said. Based on the confessions, the police team also found that the event management firm had not obtained any licence to hold such a party. The police have seized some banned drugs and several liquor bottles from the premises.

Preliminary inquiries with some of the guests indicated that the organisers had allegedly collected online amounts between ₹5000 and ₹10,000 per pair. Further investigations are on.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/qiao38/article30760209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07FEBTH-Kodaijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/police-arrest-over-200-youth-partying-at-a-private-farm-in-upper-kodai-hills/article30760210.ece
344,2020/02/07,HC seeks series of reports on revival of waterbodies,"In a bid to restore waterbodies in the city, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has sought a series of reports from the State on measures taken to treat sewage being let into waterbodies, particularly the Vaigai, and removal of encroachments from waterbodies.

Hearing a batch of petitions filed from across southern districts to restore waterbodies, a Division Bench of Justices T. Raja and B. Pugalendhi passed a set of directions and sought reports from the State on the steps taken to restore waterbodies. The cases were adjourned till February 11 for filing reports.

Senior Counsel Veera Kathiravan, the amicus curiae in the case, who carried out an inspection of the Vaigai, submitted that sewage was being let into the river and this had not only resulted in pollution of drinking water but also increased the spread of contagious diseases in the city.

He pointed out that it was not known as to whether any precautionary steps were taken to treat the water before they were let into the Vaigai river, be it in Madurai or in other districts through which the river flowed. The number of sewage treatment plants in the city were not sufficient, he added.

The standing counsel for Madurai Corporation R. Murali submitted that the government had accepted the recommendations of the Corporation on widening the scope of the Smart Cities Mission scheme and a drainage system on the north of Vaigai river would be developed as a permanent solution to the problem.

With respect to encroachments on Vaigai river in the city it was submitted that 153 encroachers were identified, including commercial establishments, and steps were being taken to remove them. No encroachment removal drive was initiated as the encroachers had agreed to vacate.

All the encroachers, who were identified and issued notices, were prepared to leave. They have sought time till the completion of the academic year so that their children can complete their school examinations. They will be provided alternate sites in Rajakkoor, the State submitted.

The District Administration comprising the Public Works Department, Madurai Corporation, Police Department and the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board shall ensure the removal of encroachments and the encroachers are given time till March 31.

Other waterbodies

The court directed the district administration to remove the encroachments by March 31. The court further directed the Corporation to undertake similar exercise to remove encroachment on Kiruthumal river and Uthangudi kanmoi and to desilt the Kiruthumal river.

Special Government Pleader V.R. Shanmuganathan submitted that the Chief Secretary had directed the authorities concerned to undertake enumeration work of waterbodies and also conduct a survey, demarcate and fix boundary stones on waterbodies.

Taking cognisance of the submission, the court sought a report on digitisation of records on waterbodies which was to be maintained through a web-enabled software programme to ensure greater accountability.

After it was submitted that a part of the Vaigai river was heavily contaminated due to the mixing of the drainage water from the Panthalkudi channel, the Corporation submitted that work has started to install a modular Sewage Treatment Plant (Modular STP).

The problem will be addressed by obtaining Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds of ₹ 2.50 crore from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and ₹65 lakh from the corporation funds.

The problem which had persisted for over 20 years would be solved through this project, the Corporation submitted.

Further, it was submitted that following the direction of the court, water was filled in the Vandiyur Teppakulam. The Corporation said that a survey would be conducted and similar tanks would be identified both inside and outside the city for revival.

In order to ascertain the situation in other districts, the State was directed to take instructions from the respective Collectors. Revenue Divisional Officers shall carry out inspection of the waterbodies in their respective districts, the court directed.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/w8d5qn/article30756817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MACITY-TEPPAKULAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-seeks-series-of-reports-on-revival-of-waterbodies/article30756818.ece
345,2020/02/07,ABVP must continue campaign for CAA: Ashwath Narayan,"Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education and Medical Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday called upon the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad to continue its campaign in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Inaugurating the 39th State-level conference of the ABVP here, Mr. Narayan said the ABVP has been campaigning in favour of the CAA and dispelling myths about its connection with the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“You need to continue it for many more weeks and months. We are here to provide all possible support for your campaign,” he said.

Mr. Narayan said the CAA was enacted to provide citizenship to minority communities who have settled in India following religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.

The same groups that had made this demand earlier are now opposing this amendment. They are also unnecessarily linking this with the NPR and NRC exercise and attempting to create a state of disorder in the country.

He said campaigns in favour of CAA should be held in educational institutions and universities.

ABVP national general secretary Ashish Chauhan said the ABVP was prepared to take on forces that are trying to create unrest in country in the guise of anti-CAA protests.

“Earlier they were making statements and going away. We are now confronting such people within the education campuses and outside,” he said.

As these protesters were changing strategy by displaying the national flag and holding the Constitution, the ABVP is vigilant of this change and trying to move a step ahead in unmasking the alleged Maoist, the Popular Front of India, and the Congress supporters who are behind these protests.

Former Nagaland Governor and ABVP president P.B. Acharya said ABVP should stand strong in favour of CAA. “The CAA is not a political issue, but a national issue. ABVP should stand strong and assert aggressively in favour of CAA to make the country strong,” he said.

Mangalore University Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya also spoke.

346,2020/02/07,"Approval sought for sand removal from Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority, says Deputy Commissioner","G. Jagadeesha, Deputy Commissioner, said on Friday that the district administration had sought approval from the Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority (KSCZMA) for removing another 4 lakh tonnes of sand from the rivers in Udupi district.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Jagadeesha said that the approval from the KSCZMA was expected within a couple of weeks. Then, the process of distribution of permits to remove sand will start, he said.

To a query, Mr. Jagadeesha said that already 4 lakh tonnes had been removed from the sand blocks in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas and this process of removal had been completed a few days back in the district.

The administration had not allowed any sand to be transported out of the district. But it wanted to check if all the sand removed had been distributed to the people in the district.

There was a possibility that some of this sand might have been stored illegally. Hence, he had directed the officers to raid places where sand might have been illegally stored and register criminal cases against those doing it.

“We are collecting the GPS details as this will give a clear idea of the places where the trucks had transported the sand from the sand stock yard. We will take stern action against the illegal hoarders of sand,” he said.

To another query, Mr. Jagadeesha said that Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. had started the work on the construction of the flyover in Kundapur and road widening at Padubidri.

“Though, we had given them a deadline of March 31 to complete their work, the company has sought an extension by a month to complete all the work in the district,” he said.

To another query, Mr. Jagadeesha said that the Debt Relief Act was not being enforced in the State as there was a stay order from the court on it.

No organisation should collect money from members of women self-help groups under the pretext that they were fighting to get them benefit under the Debt Relief Act, he added.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/approval-sought-for-sand-removal-from-ksczma-dc/article30764053.ece

Sriramulu on Thursday said that he will wait for the party to take a decision to make him the Deputy Chief Minister.

Mr. Sriramulu, who was at the district party office to distribute invitation cards for his daughter’s marriage, told reporters that there was no case of neglect of Coastal Karnataka or any region in the Cabinet expansion. “We cannot ignore Coastal Karnataka which has been our bastion. The party will give necessary positions to those elected from Coastal Karnataka,” he said.

348,2020/02/07,New autorickshaw fares to become effective on April 1,"Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesh said on Thursday that the minimum fare for autorickshaws in Udupi district had been revised from ₹25 to ₹30. The revised fares would come into effect on April 1.

He was chairing a meeting on revision of autorickshaw fares held at the District Offices Complex, here.

Earlier, the leaders of various autorickshaw unions pointed out that the autorickshaw fares in the district were last revised in 2014. Since then, vehicle insurance and cost of spares had all increased. Hence, the fares of autorickshaws should be increased, they urged.

Mr. Jagadeesh agreed to hike the minimum fare to ₹ 30 and the running fare to ₹ 17 per km. But the autorickshaw operators should compulsorily install flag meters and charge the passengers based on the reading on the flag metres, he said.

It was incumbent on the part of the autorickshaw operators to behave courteously with the passengers. They should compulsorily follow all traffic rules.

They should not drive their autorickshaws in the opposite direction on the highways. They should not carry more passengers than specified by the rules, he said. They should compulsorily follow all rules regarding safety while ferrying schoolchildren. Another meeting would be called to clear the confusion with regard to different autorickshaw zones, Mr. Jagadeesh said.

349,2020/02/07,ASI says metal barricade around Sulthan Bathery should go,"The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has decided to get the metal barricade put around the historic Sulthan Bathery in the city removed. Earlier, the Union Culture Ministry’s National Monument Authority had erected the metal barricade around monument.

ASI Bengaluru Circle’s Superintending Archaeologist Shivkant Bajpai, who visited the monument here on Tuesday, following a report appearing in these columns on December 30, 2019, said that he would write to the authority to get the barricade removed.

“We were not consulted at all by the authority before it carried out the work,” Mr. Bajpai told The Hindu.

Sulthan Bathery, said to have been built on the banks of the Phalguni by Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan in 1784, is one among the two Centrally-protected ancient monuments in Mangaluru; the other being the Mangaladevi Temple. Besides acting as a post to keep watch on those entering the region through the Arabian Sea, the bathery also served as an arms and ammunition depot.

Though ASI intends to get the metal barricade removed, the monument needs protection, Mr. Bajpai said. ASI would design one that suits the monument and the landscape, he said.

Inspecting the monument along with ASI’s Junior Conservation Assistant, Karkala, K. Gokul Praveen, Mr. Bajpai said that the metal barricade did not gel with the structure. The barricade was in place by the time he took over office about four months ago, he said. ASI would design a protection mechanism that syncs with the monument and its surroundings, Mr. Bajpai said.

He said that the bathery was built in such a location that in the event of a fire accident involving ammunition, water from the adjacent river could be used to mitigate it.

Asked whether ASI has any plans to give a facelift to the monument, the officer said that it was properly maintained and there was no need for any facelift. Yet, the district administration may plan to develop its surroundings to attract more visitors, he said.

Conservationists as well as local residents were aghast over the barricade that completely destroyed the beauty of the structure in the background of the Phalguni, they said.

Architect Niren Jain had then felt that the authorities concerned should have worked in collaboration while ensuring protection to the monument. Barricades or enclosures should appropriately be designed in sync with landscape, he had said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/8qbllh/article30756151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MNSULTHANBATHERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/asi-says-metal-barricade-around-sulthan-bathery-should-go/article30756153.ece
350,2020/02/07,University College celebrates 150th anniversary,"Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari D. Veerendra Heggade on Thursday said that for the overall development of every student’s personality, educational institutions should become centres disseminating knowledge and not just be information centres.

He was speaking after inaugurating the 150th anniversary celebrations of University College, Mangaluru, which was established in 1868. Mr. Heggade said the college, and a few other government colleges in the State, has been able to do away with misconceptions about the quality of education in government institutions.

There was a time when government colleges were called “doddi” (cattle shed), but these colleges produced some of the finest cows and bulls, he remarked. “I’m also a product of a government college,” Mr. Heggade said.

In his introductory address, UCM principal M.A. Uday Kumar recalled the history of the institution, including its teachers and students. The college, which was on the verge of closure, was revived following the efforts of its old student, the then Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily, and became a constituent college of Mangalore University in 1993, he said.

Mr. Moily said UCM played a vital role in moulding his personality and career. Earlier in the day, the dignitaries inaugurated an exhibition narrating the history of UCM. A special postal cover and a souvenir were also released.

MLA U.T. Khader, MLC Ivan D’Souza, Mangalore University Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya, Chief Post Master General Charles Lobo, and others were present.

Exhibition

The exhibition, organised to commemorate 150 years of UCM at Ravindra Kala Bhavan, had several exhibits depicting the rich heritage of Tulu Nadu.

351,2020/02/07,"Government mulls enhancing audit independence, accountability","The government has proposed significant amendments to existing regulations to enhance independence and accountability of auditors.

Against the backdrop of instances of many auditors and auditing entities coming under the regulatory lens for alleged misdoings, the government has come out with a consultation paper on proposed legal changes regarding audit.

The paper has suggestions for curbing five “threats” for the independence of auditors. The threats pertain to self-interest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity and intimidation.

A significant topic in the paper is about economic concentration of the “Big Four” audit firms and the need to build the capacity of home-grown Indian firms that may need to be at par with global organisations in terms of audit procedures and manpower capacity, among other factors.

PWC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG are generally referred to as the ‘Big Four’, which operate in India through a network of local chartered accountants firms.

The paper has sought comments on whether the number of audits under one audit firm or auditor needs to be reduced. Inspection of audit engagements and developing a ‘Composite Audit Quality Index’ to improve accountability of auditors and audit firms are among other proposals.

Suggestions sought

“... suggestions are invited on what qualitative and quantitative parameters should be included in such an index, how they should be measured, and which companies should be mandated for,” as per the paper.

The deadline for submitting comments on the paper to “examine the existing provisions of law and make suitable amendments therein to enhance audit independence and accountability” is February 28.

The RBI move is aimed at providing cheaper money to banks at the repo rate and, thus, improving liquidity in the banking system.

355,2020/02/07,Finance ministry expects at least 80% of taxpayers to move to new tax regime,"The finance ministry expects at least 80% of the taxpayers to move to the new income tax regime, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said on Friday.

The budget 2020-21 has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments.

“We feel at least 80% of the people will come to the new scheme,” Mr. Pandey said during an interaction with opinion makers in Mumbai.

He said the government did an analysis of 5.78 crore taxpayers before the budget and found that 69% of them would save on tax payouts under the new system, while 11% were found to be favouring the old regime.

Of the remaining 20% taxpayers, there will be people who want to avoid the hassle of paperwork and may wish to switch over to the new regime, he said.

The government was in a catch-22 situation because it wanted to lower tax outgoes for the people and ensure that it eases the process of tax, but did not want to disturb the system due to which it made a beginning by giving people options, he said.

He noted that corporates were also given similar option when the taxes were reduced in September, and that 90% of corporates have embraced the exemption-free approach for lower tax rate now.

A large majority of people will find the new regime advantageous, Mr. Pandey said.

The government introduced new tax slabs with reduced rates for an annual income of up to ₹15 lakh for those foregoing exemptions and deductions under a simplified tax regime. The new income tax system is optional and a taxpayer can choose to remain in the existing regime with exemptions and deductions.

Those earning up to ₹5 lakh will not pay any tax either in the old regime or in the new regime.

“The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers. An individual who is currently availing more deductions and exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in the old regime,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharmam said in the budget speech, adding the proposal will entail a revenue sacrifice of ₹40,000 crore per annum.

Observing that there are about 100 tax exemptions and deductions, she said 70 of them are being removed in the new simplified tax regime, while the remaining will be reviewed and examined in due course.

Many analysts said the move will deter individuals from investing in almost all asset classes like home, mutual funds and also even taking a medical insurance. Analysts also expect majority to continue with the old slabs as that get them additional deductions.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/4d5zzb/article29620722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BUAJAYBHUSHANPANDEY1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/finance-ministry-expects-at-least-80-of-taxpayers-to-move-to-new-tax-regime/article30761993.ece

360,2020/02/07,Complicating the tax regime further,"As the country waited with bated breath for any signs of demand stimulation in this year’s Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered the longest Budget speech in the history of independent India. Her weakest punch was reserved for the last round, at which point we were just happy to exhale.

Three quarters of the way into her speech, Ms. Sitharaman announced what she claimed was a move to provide significant relief to individual taxpayers by simplifying the income tax law. The relief, she said, will be in the form of lower tax rates for which individuals will have to give up on the exemptions they enjoy under the existing regime. The simplification of the income tax law, the Finance Minister said, will benefit both the assessees and the assessors.

In essence, the government decided to give a small section of taxpayers an opportunity to pocket more money, in the process hoping that they will give up on their savings instruments such as the Public Provident Fund and various life insurance products, and also abandon their investment in what in India is viewed as a safe haven asset — real estate.

The question that arises here is: Does the new tax regime really put more money into the hands of taxpayers? Taking the case of a typical taxpayer who is not a homeowner — considering that the new regime does not provide any exemption on interest on home loans — it is clear that in a majority of cases, the regime will leave the individual poorer. That said, there may be a few cases, as in the case of salaried personnel without any exposure to standard investments, where the new system might be of some benefit.

Left worse on both counts

The second part of Ms. Sitharaman’s value proposition was that the new system would provide relief to taxpayers who, she said, have struggled with a cumbersome process, with more than 100 exemptions. The Minister’s claims would have held true had the older system been discontinued altogether. Instead, what she delivered leaves taxpayers with double the amount of work — they now also have to compare the two systems and make a decision on which one is more favourable for them. Another factor complicating the taxpayers’ filing process is that it isn’t clear now which exemption will be scrapped in the near term and which one will continue in the long term. The new system, therefore, leaves taxpayers worse on both counts.

The more concerning issue with the new tax system has two elements. One, it marks a departure from a scenario where the state used direct taxes and exemptions to incentivise investment in key sectors; this the new regime does without providing an equally effective mechanism on the indirect taxation front. An example of the latter would have been an exemption on the purchase of electric vehicles, with the goal of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Similarly, an increase in incentive for home ownership would have provided a sagging real estate sector with some much needed fillip. It is ironic that the government, while disincentivising investment in insurance on the one hand, is also attempting to publicly sell stakes in India’s largest insurance provider on the other hand.

The second important issue with the new tax system is that it removes all incentives to save in an economy that is already seeing a steady decline in our household savings rate, fuelled by unemployment. Nobel-winning behavioural economist Richard Thaler, a favourite of Narendra Modi and who applauded the Prime Minister for his work on Swachh Bharat, has worked extensively on encouraging Americans to save for retirement. It was his research that persuaded American lawmakers to reform the retirement scheme. This change encouraged employers to enrol workers automatically for the retirement savings plan, increasing participation rates among young American workers. Our government seems to be encouraging the young taxpayers to do the opposite.

Finally, it was disappointing that the Budget gave such a disproportionate emphasis on tax reform, considering the fact that taxpayers constitute hardly 2.5% of the population. With 60% of the population engaged in agriculture and allied activities, any real demand stimulation would have had to begin with the rural sector. Hence, the low allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and PM-KISAN was unfortunate.

361,2020/02/07,Reducing custodial deaths,"On October 13, 2019, Pradeep Tomar, a security guard, rushed with his 10-year-old son to Pilkhua police station in Hapur district in Uttar Pradesh. He had been summoned for interrogation in connection with a murder case. The son later said that his father was brutally tortured by the policemen in front of him for hours. When Tomar’s condition deteriorated he was rushed to hospital, where he died. An FIR was registered against four policemen after the National Human Rights Commission took note of the case.

Earlier last year, a Delhi court sentenced five U.P. policemen to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for torturing a man to death in custody in 2006. The five policeman had abducted the victim on suspicion of his involvement in a car robbery and tortured him in custody. Later, after he died, they manipulated records to obliterate all evidence of custodial death and closed it as a case of suicide. The case was transferred from a court in Gautam Buddh Nagar to Delhi by the Supreme Court on the grounds that a fair trial would not be possible within the State.

Pronouncing the verdict, the additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar Malhotra said, “The police play a major role in the administration of criminal justice. One of the reasons for custodial death is that the police feel that they have a power to manipulate evidence as the investigation is their prerogative and with such manipulated evidence, they can bury the truth.” He added, “They are confident that they will not be held accountable even if the victim dies in custody and even if the truth is revealed.”

Acting with impunity

These incidents have brought into sharp focus the way Indian policemen torture and interrogate suspects in their custody leading to death in several cases. As a result, policemen all over the country have been severely criticised and condemned. Strictures passed against policemen from time to time by learned judges of various courts notwithstanding, the police continue to brazenly torture suspects in their custody.

The Central Bureau of Investigation too uses torture as a method of investigation. In September 2016, B.K. Bansal, Director General of Corporate Affairs, and his son Yogesh committed suicide. In their suicide note, the two men listed the names of officers who had tortured their family in connection with a case of disproportionate assets. Bansal’s wife and daughter too had committed suicide two months earlier. On the directions of the National Human Rights Commission, an inquiry was held by the CBI. Expectedly, the agency exonerated all the accused. Taking cognisance of the matter, the Central Vigilance Commission published a standard operating procedure laying down guidelines for interrogation of accused officials.

Custodial deaths have been on the increase in recent years. They increased by 9% from 92 in 2016 to 100 in 2017, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Since policemen responsible for custodial deaths rarely get punished, they feel emboldened to continue using torture as the tool to get to the truth. In 2015, for instance, the police registered cases against fellow police officers in only 33 of the 97 custodial deaths.

A historic order

The Supreme Court delivered a historic order in 2006 on police reforms. It stated, among other things, that every State should have a Police Complaints Authority where any citizen can lodge a complaint against policemen for any act of misdemeanour. However, only a few States such as Kerala, Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra have implemented the order. Others have not taken the matter seriously.

Until exemplary punishment is meted out to policemen who are responsible for custodial deaths after proper judicial inquiry, not much can be expected to ameliorate the situation. Proper interrogation techniques coupled with use of scientific methods to extract the truth from suspects can go a long way in reducing custodial deaths.

362,2020/02/07,Parley: Does the Budget do enough in providing a stimulus to growth?,"Presenting the Union Budget for 2020-21 to Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke of this being the Budget to boost common people’s incomes and enhance their purchasing power. In a discussion moderated by Suresh Seshadri, Ananth Narayan (Professor of Finance, S.P. Jain Institute for Management Research) and veteran banker V. Srinivasan look at whether the proposed changes in direct taxes and other measures are likely to help spur consumption and investment in the economy. Edited excerpts:

The Economic Survey stressed wealth creation as a central theme. Do the Budget proposals address this? If so, to what extent?

Ananth Narayan: What you have to look at from this particular Budget is what does it do by way of stimulus, which is, does it actually spur consumption or investment or get some money going through into the system? And second, does it lay a road map for any kind of deeper structural reforms? If both of them come together in the right ingredients, then wealth creation, which is indicated in the Economic Survey, should follow through.

The Budget gave a lot of good background. The three themes — aspirational India, economic development, caring society — nobody can have an argument with that. But there were severe constraints when it came to actually giving any kind of a stimulus. Frankly, Finance Minister Sitharaman had very, very little space to announce any further stimulus. Really, what you have to be thankful for is that she didn’t cut down on spending. She continued with the stimulus, which has been ongoing for the last three, four Budgets now. In fact, government spending is what is holding up GDP growth.

I think what has been disappointing is the second part, on structural reforms. There are a lot of good things which have been spoken about on agriculture, irrigation, start-ups and so on. But some of the real elephants in the room [are]: the health of the financial services ecosystems — banks and NBFCs; and structural issues in sectors such as power, telecom, airline and shipping, real estate, construction. And third, most importantly, getting in foreign direct investment into manufacturing or grabbing some of the top supply chains coming out of China. On all these three structural fronts, personally, I was disappointed by the lack of direction in the Budget.

So, to answer your question, wealth creation: it’s not constricted, the government has not cut down on spending because of fiscal constraints, and there are deep fiscal constraints. On structural reforms, the Budget document itself was disappointing. The good news, of course, is that reforms don’t have to happen only in the Budget, they can happen separately as well. But as things stand, I don’t see enough being done for wealth creation or for the reigniting of the investment cycle.

Would the various direct tax changes give a boost to incomes and thereby lift consumption spending?

V. Srinivasan: India first needs to have a capex investment cycle going, create more jobs and thereby increase consumption. I think relying on consumption alone and putting money in the hands of people to consume and therefore stimulate the economy is something which can help in the short term, but in the long term can lead to some disastrous results. And clearly, the measures in the Budget have attempted to spur consumption. But I think if you look at the direct tax changes on the personal income tax side, I think it is [at] best status quo. I think more likely than not people would be in the same place where they are, not opting for the exemptions and staying with it at least as of now, till they get more clarity on how exactly these things work and for how long you’ll have the option rather than try to sort of give up on the investments and not take exemptions and live with a lower tax. That’s the thing that you really need to wait and watch. But as of now, if you look anecdotally since that’s the only social security and kitty which people build for their later years, I think it’s more likely that people will continue the exemptions. We need to wait and watch in terms of how the capex cycle comes through, which I think would possibly trigger a much more sustainable consumption cycle than trying to just put money in the hands of people and trying to stimulate the economy.

Could the new opt-in tax regime end up impacting savings? Household savings have after all been a significant contributor to another pillar of GDP, gross fixed capital formation.

Ananth Narayan: Not directly by the measures which have been announced. Sure, at the margins for certain tax slabs, it is possible that financial investments and savings, which were otherwise encouraged, might no longer make sense. But that’s a very small number in my opinion. I don’t think the changes incorporate a big change in the behaviour of savings per se. But the broader point you make is quite valid. The savings rate, the financial savings rate for households has been dropping quite sharply over the years. And this is a 10, 15 years kind of a trend, which is a sign of worry.

Frankly, when we worry about things like savings rate and growth and consumption, the starting point paradoxically has to be investment. India tends to earn more and save more when there is investment going through. We saw that, for instance, when the golden quadrilateral was being built 20 years ago; 30 years ago, when the markets were opened up and money came in, poured into various kinds of infrastructure investments.

We saw what happened 10 years ago, when we saw a lot of banking money go into infrastructure investments, which unfortunately didn’t end well, we saw again growth and consumption that time. So, savings and investments or savings and overall income is structurally I think linked to investments, which is why the structural reforms required for spurring back an investment cycle is what we were all, at least I was, looking for very eagerly. There are lots of small things happening. And I have to acknowledge that, for instance, labour laws are being changed quietly. Likewise, you know, the corporate tax rate cut is very welcome for investments. But it seems a little too little at this point in time. To get back savings, to get back healthy macroeconomic variables, I think we need the investment climate coming back again, and a lot, lot needs to be done on the structural side before that happens.

The Finance Minister has said the government is keen not to splurge to end the slowdown and will instead focus on creating public assets. As an approach, how relevant is it to the current economic logjam?

V. Srinivasan: It comes back to what we’ve been grappling with and what in the media’s and regulators’ talk is ‘transmission’. And clearly, resources are limited. Understand that both the RBI and the government are trying to sort of do all that they can to spur investment, increase the flow of money. And ‘transmission’, meaning irrespective of how much liquidity you put in, rates are not going lower, banks are not lending; the system is, to some extent, broken. So, whatever the Budget does or any sort of policy measure which is taken is hitting a wall till we sort out some of the systemic issues and try and clean the deck and then start from there. And I think that’s something which was a hope, at least in terms of, whether in the Budget or outside it, trying to make sure that if someone has to take a hit, we need to take the hit.

If the government has to step in to provide some support, at least clean the deck and then confidence will be back and people can sort of look ahead with reasonable comfort that they are not going to be blindsided by something which they didn’t expect. That phase continues and that irrespective of whether you splurge, don’t splurge, if you do whatever you’re doing, I think it’s not helping.

So, I think the biggest thing is whether it’s real estate, whether it’s NBFCs, we need to clean the deck and make sure people are comfortable with the future. When you’re not comfortable with the future outlook, and it’s sort of filled with uncertainty, I think you hold back on anything you want to do, and that’s the phase we are going through. The Budget, I was hoping, would trigger some animal spirits by bringing some certainty in terms of putting some of these things behind us. [That has] not happened. So, I think we will have to muddle along till we sort out some of the problems ourselves, or something happens which forces us to do that.

Does the Budget help keep the economy on track to reach the government’s $5 trillion goal?

Ananth Narayan: At the moment, I don’t think we are on track to reaching this $5 trillion mark by 2024. The good news, though, is that there is no reason why we can’t start to improve our growth dramatically. I think our potential remains pretty high. If we start to address some of the structural issues, I do think given our demographics, given the resources that we have, it’s quite within our reach to bring in foreign direct investment, as well as to have our own investment cycle restarted, so as to get us to higher rates of growth. But for that, we have to make a fundamental departure.

One quick point on NBFCs etc., I think where the government is stalled right now is twofold. One is they see a moral hazard and I sympathise with that. ‘Why should the government bail out private entities?’, and that’s a good point. Second, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a lovely piece of legislation. It’s starting to hopefully settle down, it will work for the future. So, therefore, their bet is things will solve themselves and ‘we should not get involved trying to bail out individuals’. I sympathise with the thinking, but I think the size of the problem is just too large. And, therefore, a one-time solution is required alongside making sure there’s accountability. And there are structural reforms so that the cycle does not repeat. Unless we take steps like this, and not just in the banks and NBFCs, but the other sectors, and the ease of doing business on manufacturing, I think the realisation of that $5 trillion potential will remain a bridge too far.

What do you think are the biggest positives of the Budget?

V. Srinivasan: Clearly, we have not moved back thanks to the Budget. Whatever investment needs to happen, whatever risk capital needs to come into the country, primarily it is coming from offshore through foreign investors because domestic investors and institutions as of now, whether banks, mutual funds and to a large extent insurance companies, lack the risk appetite in terms of putting money, risk capital to work in the current context. And the only people who are willing to do that seem to be offshore investors. So, the Budget recognises that and to some extent offers a much cleaner, easier environment, from a tax perspective, and from an incentive perspective, for foreign investors to access local markets and provide risk capital. And I think that’s one of the big positives in the Budget.

363,2020/02/07,Journalism in the time of an outbreak,"A virus is a formidable foe for humans who are periodically affected, often in swathes, but more so for health journalists. In unimaginable ways, a public health emergency sometimes blindfolds a journalist, disallowing proper employment of the tools and techniques of the trade. There is no press pass that bacteria recognise, no calling card that will impress a virus enough to stay away. Sometimes, just doing one’s job could land one in the deep end.

Reporting is about ‘being there’ as news breaks, as events happen, in the epicentre. It is often about rushing in where angels fear to tread. With a bit of excessive enthusiasm, the reporter could land up with a more intimate experience than she had bargained for.

The modern world, nearly seamless and borderless, has begun to regularly afflict us with outbreaks. Often, in the initial stages, everyone just feels around in the dark. The light eventually slips in through the cracks, and if we are lucky, a cure too. But in the initial feeling around phase, it is possible that an enthusiastic health reporter has a higher degree of risk of contracting whatever contagion is ruling the roost than the general population, just shades less than the healthcare worker.

A basic prevention protocol automatically kicks in these days, and the masks are deployed early on, but there was seldom such clarity in the past. Health workers with meagre resources would try to overcome outbreaks with sheer will and sacks of chlorine powder. Cholera and acute diarrhoeal diseases in north Chennai were a common occurrence up until a decade ago. Those sent out to the area to do a spot story would have to figure out what to drink or eat locally, besides being careful about what to touch, in order not to be visited upon by a virulent vibrio cholerae.

Who knew what protection to take while walking into the wards of government hospitals brimming over with patients, the corners fertile with bodily fluids, and the air heavy with the stench of cheap disinfectant? If mortuary trips became a necessity, as they did during the tsunami, a handkerchief or dupatta would offer protection. The N95 masks were unheard of then. As for gloves, even mortuary workers used them only for special occasions.

Wandering on the dark sands of the tsunami-ravaged Nagapattinam and Cuddalore coast without the right footwear left its mark on journalists too. Red, itchy patches evolved into dark splotches on the legs. It was contact dermatitis that doctors found in the local survivors of the big wave as well. Galoshes were not on our mind, as we grappled to report the unprecedented ramifications of the tragedy.

And how do you protect yourself from the female anopheles mosquito carrying the deadly plasmodium vector, in cities that continue to be endemic to malaria? This is a problem especially when a visit to an affected area is the way your story can unfold, naturally putting you in harm’s way. In the first wave of chikungunya in the south, in 2006, unsuspecting journalists stumbled right into dens of Aedes mosquitoes, even before it became clear what was making people double up in agony.

Experiential journalism adds value, but in retrospect, these were experiences that were perhaps not necessary.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k8scvi/article30693579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/journalism-in-the-time-of-an-outbreak/article30755370.ece
364,2020/02/07,On the front foot: On RBI holding rates,"The humble onion almost halted the onward march of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its endeavour to bring down financial costs in the economy. Almost, because the RBI, despite finding its hands tied by rising inflation thanks to onion prices, found other means to drive down interest rates in the market, and in the system, in its monetary policy announcement on Thursday. At the press conference after the announcement, Governor Shaktikanta Das declared, only half in jest, that the proceedings of the Monetary Policy Committee, which decided to hold rates, had already been discounted by the market. “But don’t discount the RBI,” he warned, pointing out that the central bank had at its disposal various instruments. True to the statement, the RBI unleashed several measures that had an electric effect on the markets, driving down bond yields by 10-20 basis points in a matter of a minutes. The exemption to banks from providing for cash reserve ratio on fresh retail loans disbursed after January 31 to purchase automobiles and residential houses, and to MSMEs, will help banks shave off a part of their costs. The hope is that they will pass on at least a part of that saving to borrowers as lower rates. Second, the introduction of one- and three-year term repos at policy rate of 5.15% for a total of ₹1 lakh crore is also aimed at prodding rates downward as banks now pay 6%-6.5% on deposits. Third, the RBI has fine-tuned its liquidity management process in a manner designed to help banks manage their interest costs better.

Whether banks really do what the RBI has signalled to them — transmit lower rates to borrowers — depends on various factors, not the least of which is demand for credit. The RBI’s statement that it would maintain an accommodative stance “as long as necessary to revive growth” clearly signals its commitment to growth. By explicitly saying that there is “policy space available for future action”, the RBI has signalled that there could be at least one more cut in the months ahead in this rate-easing cycle. The decision to extend the one-time restructuring of MSME loans, linking pricing of loans to medium enterprises to an external benchmark, and the nod for permitting extension of date of commencement of commercial operations for loans to commercial real estate are all welcome measures that raise questions of excessive forbearance but will certainly help the industry. The inflation projection — 6.5% in the current quarter and 5.4%-5.0% in the first half of 2020-21 — reflects the current realities. The projected GDP growth of 6% for 2020-21 appears achievable, assuming that the nascent signs of recovery sustain. The RBI has gone on the front foot to boost growth in this policy after the conservative Budget presented last week. It is to be hoped that these steps will change the sentiment in the economy.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-front-foot-the-hindu-editorial-on-rbi-holding-rates/article30755065.ece
365,2020/02/07,For a data firewall: On need for a data protection law,"The report by a German cybersecurity firm that medical details of millions of Indian patients were leaked and are freely available on the Internet is worrying. The firm listed 1.02 million studies of Indian patients and 121 million medical images, including CT Scans, MRIs and even photos of the patients, as being available. Such information has the potential to be mined for deeper data analysis and for creating profiles that could be used for social engineering, phishing and online identity theft, among other practices that thrive on the availability of such data on the Darknet — restricted computer networks which exchange information using means such as peer-to-peer file sharing. The reason for the availability of this data is the absence of any security in the Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) servers used by medical professionals and which seem to have been connected to the public Internet without protection. Public data leaks have been quite common in India — from government websites enabling the download of Aadhaar numbers to electoral data rolls being downloaded in bulk, among others. Unlike the data protection regulations in place in the European Union and in the U.S., India still lacks a comprehensive legal framework to protect data privacy. The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 is still to be tabled but could enable protection of privacy.

The draft Bill follows up on the provisions submitted by a committee of experts chaired by Justice B.N. Srikrishna to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in 2018. The committee sought to codify the relationship between individuals and firms/state institutions as one between “data principals” (whose information is collected) and “data fiduciaries” (those processing the data) so that privacy is safeguarded by design. While the 2019 version of the Bill seeks to retain the intent and many of the recommendations of the Justice Srikrishna committee, it has also diluted a few provisions. For example, while the Bill tasks the fiduciary to seek the consent in a free, informed, specific, clear form (and which is capable of being withdrawn later) from the principal, it has removed the proviso from the 2018 version of the Bill that said selling or transferring sensitive personal data by the fiduciary to a third party is an offence. There are other substantive issues with the Bill pertaining to the situations when state institutions are granted exemption from seeking consent from principals to process or obtain their information. Yet, considering the manner in which public data are being stored and used by both the state and private entities, a comprehensive Data Protection Act is the need of the hour.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-data-firewall-the-hindu-editorial-on-need-for-a-data-protection-law/article30755070.ece

374,2020/02/07,"After 15-year delay, work on bridge at Kundrathur gets under way","A 15-year wait for a high-level bridge at Kundrathur, on the Kodambakkam-Sriperumbudur Road, is finally over, with the Highways Department starting work on constructing the four-lane facility.

The bridge is a necessity for residents of at least 10 localities, since they require it to cross a channel from the Chembarambakkam lake, running over the road. Residents of areas like Nandambakkam, Sirukalathur, Amaramedu, Nanmangalam, Poonthandalam and Nadurpattu have to cross the stretch to reach the city.

“We have lost count of the number of petitions submitted and the protests staged for the bridge. Every monsoon, the sluice gates of the lake are opened to let out excess water, and the road gets submerged. It remains that way for over a month, and motorists have to take a circuitous route to reach their destinations. We are happy that the construction has begun. We would be even happier if the work is completed before this year’s monsoon,” said Kundrathur resident M. Elango.

A retired official of the Highways Department recalls that the work was passed around from one wing to another of the Department.

“Soil tests were conducted a few years ago, but work could not be started at the time,” he said.

Official sources in the Department said that the bridge would have 10 spans and be 500-m long. Since the road is four-lanes wide, the bridge too would be of a similar width.

“We plan to complete the work in eight months,” the official said.

Construction of the bridge is being taken up as part of the widening of the 15-km-long road, running from Kundrathur to Sriperumbudur via Nandambakkam. The total cost of the project is ₹117 crore, and the road work will be completed in about three months.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sfaw62/article30756567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THKUNDRATHUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/after-15-year-delay-work-on-bridge-at-kundrathur-gets-under-way/article30756568.ece

The initiative involves mechanised cleaning of lake floor bed, strengthening of bunds, among others. It also includes beautification by laying pathway, fencing with grill or wall structures and plantation around the waterbody.

The CII had signed memorandum of understanding with the State government focusing on Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts, with support from the Grater Chennai Corporation and the district administrations.

“One of the key challenges was clearing encroachments in these waterbodies. But we have managed to restore seven lakes,” said Ravi Sam, chairman, CSR & Affirmative Action Sub-Committee, CII Southern Region and MD, Adwaith Lakshmi Industries Ltd.

According to the CII, the restoration of Gangaiammankulam at Injambakkam was supported by Grundfos Pumps India Pvt Ltd, which covered an area of 3.8 acres. The storage capacity of the waterbody increased to 50 lakh litres following the rejuvenation.

The restoration work at Thamaraikulam at Oragadam was supported by Danfoss Industries which is spread across 1.7 acres and now serves as the agriculture farm pond for the 10-acre farmland around the waterbody.

The work at Karunmanchavadikulam at Karapakkam, Rettakuttai at Madipakkam and Uthukulam at Perumbakkam was supported by Gmmco Ltd.

The total area covered for restoration of the three waterbodies was 4.6 acres and they now serve as recreation parks for the local community. The water table around these waterbodies have now increased to 40% from its original state.

376,2020/02/07,Poor upkeep leaves subway desolate,"A pedestrian subway, located below railway tracks near the Tambaram railway station, remains desolate, with only few venturing into it due to poor security and unhygienic conditions. The subway, constructed just a year ago adjacent to the vehicular subway and situated under the Tambaram flyover, links Velachery Main Road with the GST Road.

While the vehicular subway remains busy, one hardly finds any pedestrian taking this facility even during the day. The subway, that belongs to the Southern Railway, suffers from poor lighting, a leaky floor and foul smell. At night, the poorly-lit subway turns into a den for anti-social elements, claim commuters.

Deepak Kumar, a resident of Tambaram, complained about the poor maintenance of the subway, full of burnt garbage and empty liquor bottles.

T. Dinesh Kumar, a resident of East Tambaram, said the pedestrian subway could be converted into a subway for two-wheeler users, as then people would start using the facility regularly.

Residents also pointed out that railway authorities should post security personnel on both sides and install more streetlights.

A senior Southern Railway official, citing the problem of poor lighting, said streetlights were being stolen regularly. A security staff will be posted at the subway soon, he added.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar directed the officials to ensure that “the entire Loop Road is kept free from encroachments and a 24x7 vigil is maintained to ensure that nobody is allowed to sit or squat on the loop road or the landside footpath of the said Loop Road for selling fish, etc., so as to allow free flow of traffic.”

The judges also went on to state: “We have indicated to the learned Additional Advocate General (S.R. Rajagopal) that the Loop Road on the Marina beach is now becoming increasingly non-motorable and no free flow of traffic is allowed, particularly after 3 p.m., and till late evening, every day, due to fishermen selling fish there.”

“There are also reports of people encroaching on the landside of the footpath on the Loop Road by raising constructions, while the seaside footpath is yet to be created, for which necessary approvals are in the process of being taken by the Corporation... All encroachments on the Loop Road should be identified and removed immediately,” they added.

381,2020/02/07,Forest Minister gets tribal boy to take off his slippers,"Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan sparked outrage on Thursday, after he instructed a tribal boy at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) to remove his slippers so that he could enter a shrine at the camp.

Later in the evening, the boy submitted a complaint to the police, who however, did not register an FIR at the time of filing this report.

Mr. Sreenivasan, who arrived at the camp to inaugurate the annual rejuvenation camp for captive elephants, called to one of two boys from the Kurumba tribal community, aged 14.

The Minister was standing outside a shrine at the elephant camp and asked the youth to unbuckle his slippers.

When the boy began unbuckling Mr. Sreenivasan’s slippers, waiting photographers tried to take pictures, but were chided by the Minister, who asked them to stop. Coonoor MLA ‘Shanthi’ A. Ramu blocked photographers from clicking clear photographs of the incident.

After Mr. Sreenivasan entered the shrine, another member of his entourage asked the boy to pick up the slippers and leave them at the entrance of the shrine.

After the incident sparked outrage, Mr. Sreenivasan expressed his “regret” at the incident. “I saw two small boys playing near me, so I asked one of them to help me take off my slippers… the little boy is like my grandson, if anyone’s feelings were hurt, they are a source of regret,” he told journalists.

‘Apology sought’

However, C. Chikbomman, village headman of Theppakadu, urged the Minister to apologise to the community.

“We see the incident as an insult to the community at large and a reflection of the attitude of politicians towards tribal groups,” said Mr. Chikbomman.

He added that after consultations with other village heads, the community plans to stage protests against the Minister. Senthil Kumar, general secretary of the Mudumalai Pazhangudiyinar Nala Sangam, also issued a statement condemning the Minister’s actions. “It is deeply regrettable that the Minister, tasked with protecting the interests of the forests and the people that depend on them, has acted in such an insensitive manner,” he said. “Such an act was done in full view of forest officials and the District Collector, reflecting the inhuman mentality of the Minister and the officials, who insulted the youth and the indigenous communities at large,” he added. Mr. Senthil Kumar added that the Minister has committed an offense under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

In the evening, the boy submitted a complaint stating that he felt “humiliated” by the episode, and said that he went home straight after the incident “in tears”. The boy urged the police to register a case against Mr. Sreenivasan, under relevant sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

In the complaint, he said that the Minister and the officials were aware that he belonged to an indigenous tribal community, and that he felt pressured and “afraid” to do as the Minister said. The Masinagudi police accepted his complaint, but said that no FIR has been registered so far.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8asuue/article30752830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Minister-tribalboyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/forest-minister-gets-tribal-boy-to-take-off-his-slippers/article30756504.ece

384,2020/02/07,"Water, sewer connections no longer a pipe dream in added areas","Piped water supply and sewer connections remain a dream for many residents in areas added to Greater Chennai Corporation.

Many merged areas in the south and west that are heavily dependent on private water suppliers will finally have their own network in a few months as Chennai Metrowater has accelerated the process of ensuring supply. But, residents have their own concerns.

The areas that are next in line to get their network include Karapakkam, Sholinganallur, Ullagaram Puzhuthivakkam, Pallikaranai, Kottivakkam, Perungudi and Mugalivakkam. In a bid to speed up the process to cover the added areas with a water supply and sewerage network, Metrowater has sought funds from World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It recently presented its proposals for a city water plan and also identifying water sources to improve supply to merged areas.

Officials of the Metrowater said water supply schemes are undergoing a trial run at Sholinganallur and Karapakkam and sewer infrastructure is ready in both the localities and house service connections would soon be effected.

While the sewage treatment plant of 18 million litres capacity has been commissioned in Sholinganallur, the 54-mld STP in Sholinganallur would also be ready in June and serve many areas, including Semmencheri, Injambakkam, Okkiam Thoraipakkam and Neelankarai, for which a detailed project report is being prepared.

Residents of Sholinganallur noted that they have been waiting for a comprehensive network for a decade after paying deposit and some of the streets have been left out.

Harsha Koda, coordinator of Federation of OMR Residents Association said, “Our Wipro Street is one of the areas that have been left out of the scheme. Instead of waiting for the network, several association members have started recycling sewage and also harnessing rainwater to become self-reliant.”

While it had evoked awareness on water conservation in apartment complexes along OMR, execution of the projects would reduce the burden on expenditure, residents said.

Residents of Ullagaram-Puzhuthivakkam are glad that the pipeline network may soon be functional and have started opting for connections. V. Rajalakshmi, a resident, said consumers in multi-storeyed buildings and gated communities too must be provided the option to pay connection charges in 10 instalments under ‘Azhaithal Inaippu’ scheme.

The absence of a sewerage network in Neelankarai and Semmencheri has led to pollution of waterways, including the south Buckingham Canal.

Ambattur zone

Ambattur is among the areas that has witnessed long delays. Metrowater has taken up work to complete the sewerage project in four packages by June. However, residents note that many are reluctant to avail connections as the charges come to a minimum of ₹15,000, especially for flat owners.

L. Gurunathan of Venkatapuram suggested that Metrowater relax the tariff for consumers in flats measuring 1,000-1,200 sq.ft. in added areas. Officials said about ₹224 crore has been sought to effect 1.11 lakh sewer connections in added areas where infrastructure is ready and mitigate pollution in waterways.

There was a delay in executing the project in Ullagaram-Puzhuthivakkam as properties were not assessed. “We plan to extend dial for sewer connections and pay in instalments schemes to multi-storeyed complexes. If residents have building plan approval, they need not pay further road cut charges,” said an official. Sewerage projects in Edayanchavadi, Sadayankuppam and Kadapakkam would be taken up after 2021, officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vi2tn4/article30756448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07schemecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-sewer-connections-no-longer-a-pipe-dream-in-added-areas/article30756449.ece
385,2020/02/07,Avadi residents’ 10-year wait set to end,"Avadi has grown in stature from a municipality to municipal corporation. The decade-long wait for residents for a comprehensive water supply and underground drainage network is set to come to an end in a few months’ time.

As Avadi waits for piped water supply, the demand has steadily grown over the years. While the Corporation is supplying 17.01 million litres a day (mld) now, the demand has increased to 46.85 mld.

The Corporation is looking forward to the initial volume of 41.85 mld assured by Chennai Metrowater to fulfill drinking water needs.

Overhead tanks

Officials of the Avadi Corporation said that of the eight overhead tanks, five are expected to be handed over in February.

These tanks are located in areas such as Muthapudupet, Nagammai Nagar and Sekkadu.

“We are waiting for Metrowater to sanction bulk supply of 10 mld in the first phase to provide piped water supply. Left out areas too will be covered soon,” said an official.

Similarly, Avadi was sanctioned an underground sewer network in 2009. But, this too faced delay due to issues with contractors and disputes over sites of sewage pumping stations.

The four-mld capacity sewage treatment plant in Muthapudupet was taken over by the Corporation for operation a few days ago and about 1,900 sewer connections have been given so far.

Continuing expenses

T. Sadagopan, a resident of Pattabiram, said many people paid ₹20,000 for water supply and sewer connections in 2011.

But, they continue to incur expenses on cleaning septic tanks.

However, officials said both the projects would be executed in phases this year.

“We will begin to provide sewer connections in phases. The 36-mld plant in Paruthipattu has also been partially commissioned. Nearly 9 mld collected from the locality through the network would be treated. The process is on to link more households to the network,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/avadi-residents-10-year-wait-set-to-end/article30756433.ece
386,2020/02/07,Murugadoss moves HC seeking police protection,"Film director A.R. Murugadoss has approached the Madras High Court, seeking police protection for himself. He has claimed that a few distributors of the recent Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar are constantly intimidating, insulting and annoying him at his residence, as well as office, by claiming to have suffered losses due to a bad run of the movie in the box office.

Justice P. Rajamanickam on Thursday directed Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz to obtain instructions from the Chennai Commissioner of Police, as well as inspectors of police stations in Teynampet and Virugambakkam, where the director’s office and residence are respectively located. He adjourned the case to Monday for further hearing.

In the direction petition filed through his counsel Vijayan Subramanian, the director said that he had commenced his career as an assistant director in 1993, and had become a director in 2001, with Ajith-starrer Dheena.

This was followed by his second directorial venture Ramana, starring Vijayakant, in which he created social awareness on corruption, red tapism and inefficiency.

After listing out his other blockbuster movies such as Ghajini (2005), the Hindi remake of Ghajini (2008), Ezham Arivu (2011), Thuppaki (2012), its Hindi version Holiday, Kathi (2014), Hindi movie Akira (2016), Spyder (2017) and Sarkar (2018), the petitioner claimed to be a unique director, who not just entertains, but also delivers a strong social message.

Being intimidated

Stating that he got the opportunity to direct Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar last year, he said his work in the movie was limited to the creative part of it, whereas the entire business of the movies was handled only by Lyca Productions. Despite knowing it well, some of the distributors were unnecessarily intimidating him, the petitioner complained.

He claimed that the distributors tresspassed into his office and threatened his staff. They also gathered outside his residence, at a posh apartment complex in Saligramam, within Virugambakkam police station limits, and started abusing him with foul language, he alleged, and urged the court to order police protection to his office as well as residence.

He further insisted on deputing a personal security officer “to safeguard his life.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/itf3nf/article30756393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THARMURUGADOSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/murugadoss-moves-hc-seeking-police-protection/article30756394.ece

388,2020/02/07,CB-CID to form SIT to probe scams in TNPSC recruitment,"The Crime Branch-CID (CB-CID) of the Tamil Nadu police will form a special investigation team to look into the multiple scams in various recruitments conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).

With new cases of fraud being reported each day, the agency decided to form the SIT for a more focused probe, involving a dedicated team of investigators, sources in the CB-CID told The Hindu on Thursday.

While the police are making arrests of candidates who passed the Group-IIA (2017) and Group-IV Services (2019) examinations by fraudulent means, answer scripts of the suspects are being referred for forensic analysis, sources said.

Investigators are perusing allegations of foul play in the Combined Engineering Services examination for the recruitment of Junior Engineer (Architects) held last year.

The input is that 28 of the 33 candidates chosen for appointment cleared the examination from one centre.

“The examination was held at 32 centres, and about 77% of candidates who passed, wrote the examination from Chennai. We are looking into suspicion of fraud,” a TNPSC official said.

Fresh scam

A fresh scam has hit the TNPSC, with the CB-CID arresting a village administrative officer (VAO) for paying money and passing the examination held in 2016.

A source in the investigating agency told The Hindu on Thursday that evidence had surfaced, pointing to at least five VAOs who adopted fraudulent means to clear the exam.

The exam was held on February 14, 2016, to fill up 813 vacancies of VAOs in the Tamil Nadu Ministerial Service.

The objective-type examination was held covering General Studies, Basics in Village Administration, Aptitude & Mental Ability Test and General Tamil/ English, in centres across the State.

“We have arrested a suspect (a serving VAO), who admitted to have paid money to pass the exam. Special teams are on the lookout for four others,” a senior investigator said.

“There is a possibility that many other candidates (VAOs) would have passed the exam with the help of middlemen,” they added.

14-day remand

The prime suspect in the recruitment scam, S. Jayakumar of Mogappair, who remained elusive, surrendered in a city court on Thursday.

Jayakumar was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

Sources in the CB-CID said that a petition would be filed to take custody of the suspect for interrogation.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tnpsc-scam-cb-cid-to-form-sit-to-probe-scams/article30756278.ece
389,2020/02/07,Listening to the call of the informal,"A week after the Budget, it is clear that successive policies of the government over the years have left the informal sector stigmatised. The government and its policy advisers want to dress the sector up to their preferred versions of formality. However, in the process, they could dampen its growth potential, as two recent papers reveal.

In the first paper, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, economist Seema Jayachandran argues that there is no strong evidence from studies conducted in many developing countries that formalisation improves business outcomes. In the second article, a background paper for the International Labour Organisation (ILO), economist Santosh Mehrotra calls formalisation an evolutionary process during which small, informal enterprises learn the capabilities required to operate in a more formal, global economy. He says they cannot be forced to formalise.

The formalisation trap

All firms, even so-called ‘informal’ firms, have a form which suits them. The state finds it easier to monitor and to tax the firms that adopt its version of formality. An imposed formality can reduce the last-mile costs for banks also. However an imposition of forms for the convenience of the state (and other powerful actors) can harm societies and produce adverse outcomes as anthropologist James C. Scott explains in Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.

In India, which currently faces an unemployment problem, the informal sector provides the vast majority of opportunities both for its youth and for people coming off the farm to earn incomes. Hence, India’s policymakers need to look at the demerits of formalisation from the perspective of informal sector enterprises.

Ms. Jayachandran’s study reveals that most of the formalities imposed from above, while making it easier for the state and the formal sector to do business with the informal sector, add to the costs of the firms that outweigh the benefits of inappropriate formalisation.

She also finds that informal firms are able to improve their ability to do business in various other ways. For example, small entrepreneurs gain from forming effective associations with their peers. They also benefit greatly from ‘mentoring’. And, skills of small entrepreneurs and their employees are best developed on-the-job. This is because they cannot afford the loss of income by taking time off for training. Soft skills to form associations and manage enterprises, matter as much for the success of the enterprises as ‘hard’ resources of finance and facilities.

There is a desire to connect small firms in India more firmly with global supply chains. Mr. Mehrotra points out that the primary motivation of multinational companies for expanding their global supply chains is to tap into lower cost sources of supply. Supply chains compete with each other. When wages and costs increase in their source countries, they look for other lower cost sources. The lowest labour cost firms at the end of supply chains are generally informal. Thus, the push by the state to formalise firms is countered by the supply chain’s drive to lower its costs.

The thrust of the Indian government’s policies should not be to reduce the size of the informal sector. Rather, it must be to improve working conditions for the citizens who earn incomes in the sector. Their safety at work, their dignity, and their fair treatment by employers must be the thrust of any reform. Indeed, even in developed industrial countries, the informal sector is growing with advances in technologies, emergence of new business models, and growth of the gig economy. There too, policymakers are struggling to invent new systems to protect the rights of workers while maintaining the dynamism of an entrepreneurial economy.

Reorienting policies

India’s jobs, incomes, and growth challenge necessitates a reorientation of policies towards the informal sector.

First, the government and its policy advisers must stop denigrating the informal sector and trying to reduce its size. The development of an economy, from agriculture to the production of more complex products in industry, is a process of learning. Informal enterprises provide the transition space for people who have insufficient skills and assets to join the formal sector.

Second, policymakers must learn to support informal enterprises on their own terms. And they should not impose their own versions of formality on them for their own convenience. Merely making it easy for MNCs and large companies to invest will not increase growth of the economy if enterprises and incomes at the bottom of the pyramid do not grow. Therefore, voices of tiny entrepreneurs in the rural heartlands and on the fringes of Indian cities must be listened to while developing policies for ‘ease of doing business’.

Third, policymakers must learn how to speed up the process of learning within informal enterprises by developing their ‘soft’ skills. Large schemes to provide enterprises with hard resources such as money and buildings, which the government finds easier to organise, are necessary but inadequate for the growth of small enterprises.

Fourth, networks and clusters of small enterprises must be strengthened. They improve the efficiency of small firms by enabling sharing of resources; they give them more clout to improve the terms of trade in their favour within supply chains; and they reduce the ‘last mile costs’ for agencies and providers of finance and other inputs to reach scattered and tiny enterprises.

Fifth, the drumbeat for labour reforms must be changed. A vocal crowd has been harping on the need for bold reforms to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers. They advocate the raising of the size of enterprises (in terms of numbers of employees) to which laws should apply. These hire and fire laws are already not applicable to the small sector, where the vast majority of enterprises employ less than 10 persons. Hence, there is an urgent need for labour reforms in other ways. The laws should be simplified, and their administration improved. And, their thrust should be to improve the conditions of workers.

Finally, the social security framework for all citizens must be strengthened, especially for those who have to scramble for work in the informal sector. Health insurance and availability of health services must be improved, and disability benefits and old-age pensions must be enhanced. The purpose of ‘labour reforms’ must be changed to provide safety nets, rather than make the workers’ lives even more precarious with misdirected attempts to increase flexibility.

390,2020/02/07,Safe drinking water,"In an ideal country in which the government provides safe and secure drinking water to all its citizens, there will be no need for the inefficient reverse osmosis (RO) water purification technology. Unfortunately, we are living in a country which is far from ideal as far as quality and quantity of drinking water supply are concerned. Consequently, concerned citizens install RO-based water purifiers, in spite of the high capital and maintenance costs, perhaps erring on the side of health and safety. But realising the wastage involved, ecosensitive citizens have started using waste water from RO for cleaning, washing and gardening, among other purposes. The government can educate people about the productive uses of waste water from RO. Besides, it can fund research and development of other affordable and efficient water-purifying technologies so that RO technology is not required. Above all, the government can ensure safe drinking water for every citizen. Under the prevailing situation, any proposal to bar domestic users from installing and utilising RO systems cannot be considered an ingredient in good water management policy (Editorial, “Purifying water,” Feb. 6).

391,2020/02/07,An opaque system,"I share James Chau’s concern about rumours relating to the nCoV outbreak expressed in the article “A time for solidarity, not stigma” (Feb. 6). At the same time, we should also focus our attention on the grave lapses on the part of the Chinese authorities in the fight against the deadly virus. When an ophthalmologist in Wuhan posted a message online in December about some people diagnosed with SARS-like symptoms, Wuhan police reprimanded him for spreading rumours. China initiated the fight against the virus only after the infection started killing people after mid-January. The authorities misconstrued reality as rumour and allowed the virus to spread, giving it more than half a month. China has had the history and experience of SARS caused by a virus in the corona family. That virus also originated in the wet markets of China and yet, no action was taken against wildlife trade. And nCoV also originated from the notorious wet market in Wuhan and it has killed more than 500 people so far. To be blamed here is Chinese system, which lacks transparency and silences whistleblowers.

The decision of the Aam Aadmi Party to fight the election on the basis of performance, and on a secular plan, is a welcome gesture. While running a non-BJP government by itself is difficult, the ordeal would have been greater in Delhi. The bitter experience with the Centre seems to have made Mr. Kejriwal a seasoned politician. However, his comments that nothing extraordinary happened in the past 70 years in Delhi are unacceptable. Former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was the architect of changing the face of Delhi with Metro and flyovers.

393,2020/02/07,A macabre theatre,"Nothing divides India more than its elections. Even going by this maxim, the cleavage has never been as distinct as it is in the poll-bound Delhi. The back-to-back attacks on unarmed protesters from the minority community by Hindu radicals in the capital city aptly mark the growing fault-line. A rising crescendo of calumny against the Shaheen Bagh protests has been on view. Some were branded as traitors. The Prime Minister has insinuated publicly that the protests are a “conspiracy” of dubious intent. The Election Commission seems to dawdle and indulge the habitual lawbreakers. The half-hearted reprimands and the tepidness of such measures and the reluctance with which the EC gently raps the guilty leaders further emboldens them to dig in their heels and stick to the communal refrain. The series of events that played out in the past, encapsulates the mind of the saffron party and what the BJP hopes to achieve through this orchestrated campaign of intimidation. From all indications, the Delhi poll campaign will be remembered as one of the most reckless communal campaigns launched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), since ascending to power at the Centre in 2014. In creating such a macabre political theatre, the BJP hopes to dent the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s well-entrenched credibility among the people of Delhi — with the hate campaign standing in for the desperate means of a desperate party.

In their desperate attempt to win an election they appear to be losing, the BJP leaders are trying to turn Indians against Indians. It is, of course, a deplorable ploy, rooted in misinformation, canards and toxic slogans. But, it is also pitiable. The 2014 talk of vikas has long since been dumped. Communal polarisation is what solely interests the BJP now and occupies all of its attention. From Bengal’s BJP state president Dilip Ghosh to Union minister Anurag Thakur, BJP party leaders are talking only of guns and bullets. For a nation, the biggest traitor is a leader who incites others to dispense mob justice, resort to violence and turn against fellow citizens. By weaponising his followers, this toxic leader takes advantage of their trust, and commits the crime of misusing them for ulterior objectives.

In a democracy, elections are won and lost. But, at stake in Delhi is much more than power. In the cauldron of hate and desperation, the BJP is boiling a toxic potion that will encourage vulnerable victims like the self-proclaimed “Rambhakt”, who fired at protesters at Jamia Millia. All of which makes the Delhi elections a test of how far popular opinion and social taste may or may not have moved over the last five years of Narendra Modi’s rule. Will the hate-filled, polarising communal blitzkrieg wash out from the electoral mind all considerations of actual performance, as it did in the last Lok Sabha elections after Pulwama, or will the electorate hold fast to facts on the ground? Fingers crossed.

394,2020/02/07,‘Jaanu’ movie review: Sharwanand is outstanding in this Telugu remake of ‘96’,"The beauty of storytelling, of cinema, lies in its ability to draw us into a story that we may not completely believe in. Practically speaking, if someone holds onto the memories of his Class X crush and stays single even after 17 years, and stores clothes and photographs in an old trunk that becomes a treasure chest of memories, I’d gently suggest counselling. But writer-director C Prem Kumar draws us skilfully into the world of his protagonist Ram (Sharwanand), a romantic and a loner who prefers to live with nostalgic memories of his Janaki or Jaanu (Samantha).

The Tamil original 96 (the 1996 school batch) is a much-loved film, just like the Malayalam film Premam. Such films are tough to remake. The deliberately languid pacing and poignant storytelling that works for an audience of one region, stands the risk of falling flat elsewhere. Yet, the universal idea of love that binds such stories together, can find resonance anywhere.

Prem Kumar takes up the challenge of remaking his own film in Telugu. Sharwanand and Samantha step into the shoes of Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha. Most of the scenes and dialogues remain the same. Instead of 1996, the school batch here is from 2004, to fit the slightly younger protagonists.

The film begins with a ‘thanks to nature’ note and the opening song introduces us to Ram, a travel photographer who’s exploring Maasai Mara. He sports a beard, is unkempt and his eyes have a lost look. The nomadic lifestyle and photography define Ram. A little later when he trains photography students, he tells them about freezing a moment forever. He, too, has remained that way.

Memories come rushing back when during a long drive, a detour takes him to his school. The watchman (Raghubabu) hasn’t changed. The building and the classroom, too, seem frozen in time.

Jaanu Cast: Sharwanand, Samantha, Vennela Kishore

Direction: C Prem Kumar

Music: Govind Vasantha

The loner feels the need to talk to his schoolmates. It’s a nice stretch that shows friends reconnecting on Whatsapp and planning a reunion. Vennela Kishore, Sharanya Pradeep and Thagubotu Ramesh (for a change he’s not inebriated) come into the picture. The friends and the witty lines step up the momentum, ably offsetting Ram’s serious demeanour. Sharanya is a hoot and between her and Vennela Kishore (yet another film where he adds value and shows why he’s so sought after) lies the weight of the Ram and Janaki reunion.

In the school portions, the setting and conversations feel so real. Gouri G Kishan as the teenage Samantha is brilliant and Sai Kiran Kumar who plays young Sharwanand (there’s an uncanny resemblance too) is spot on. Ram and Janaki share an easy rapport until the former realises that he’s fallen in love with her. He withdraws and is too shy to speak up. He is enamoured by her, her music. True to her name, she sings S Janaki’s songs like a dream. Ilaiyaraaja melodies from the 80s and 90s play out in all beauty.

The happy buzz of the past is shaken when the grown up Jaanu makes her entry, accompanied by a lilting background score. Composer-vocalist Govind Vasantha and Chinmayi (who has rendered many of the songs and is the voice of Samantha) are the behind-the-scenes stars of this film, along with cinematographer Mahendiran Jayaraju, elevating the narrative. Where words take a break, Govind Vasantha’s music does the honours.

Soon, the fun lines are replaced with moments of silence and conversations between Ram and Janaki who have so much to share after destiny put them on different paths. Like he says, he has remained at the point where he left her. But she had to comply with family expectations and have a family of her own. She’s at peace, she says, when asked if she’s happy.

Jaanu is a complex character. She’s prim and proper unlike the rugged Ram, outspoken of the two, acknowledges that she has a good husband and a daughter, and yet feels the pain of long-lost love.

How much we buy into the later half depends on whether we connect with the actors. Sharwanand surrenders himself to the world of Ram and presents a nuanced portrayal from the beginning. He’s superb and this is, by far, his best act. Samantha comes into her own gradually, after the hotel room scene where she breaks down; the conversations that follow give her, and Ram, a sense of closure of the past. Jaanu is another feather in her cap, but there are portions where she seems to struggle, as though a tad weighed down by the part.

The later half is also where the film feels bloated and could have done with some trimming. The piece de resistance is Jaanu singing ‘Yamuna thatilo’ from Thalapathy and Ram fumbling for a lamp, to see her and treasure the moment forever.

Jaanu, like 96, is poetic.

395,2020/02/07,Memories of good old-fashioned Malayali food come alive,"If your exposure to Malayali cuisine has been limited to banana chips, parotta and mutton stew and the yearly Onasadya, then a visit to Kappa Chakka Kandhari should be on your bucket list.

Kappa (tapioca), chakka (jackfruit) and kandhari (bird’s eye chilli) are an integral part of Kerala cuisine and the 11-page menu inclusive of drinks and dessert, gives one ample chance to savour all three ingredients.

While trying to decide on the choices for your meal, sip on innovative variations or buttermilk, lemon juice or tender coconut water. They will serve as a sampler of what is to follow.

Perhaps one of the best things about Kappa Chakka is the range of dishes curated by Chef Regi Mathew that most people may not have thought about. Like the vazhappoo cutlet made from banana flowers and served with beetroot sauce or the avoli nellika masala fry — fried fish marinated with sundried gooseberries.

Then, there are unusual combinations here like the pazham pori, which is batter-coated, deep-fried sweet banana fritters and meat curry (yes, served together!) unearthed from a tea shop on the suburbs of Kochi.

Idlis are a staple in most south Indian homes, but it would still be nice to try the Ramassery idly with chutney powder and sambar. Ramassery is a small village near Palakkad and while the idli here looks like a cross between a set dosa and an idli that has been flattened out, it still is unbelievably soft and goes well with any non-vegetarian curry.

Tubers like Chinese potatoes and colocasia that are given a wide berth at home, courtesy the cumbersome process involved in making them edible, can be relished here without a second thought.

Try the prawn kizhi (prawn and shredded coconut steamed in banana leaves), the mutton coconut fry or the chatti meen curry (fish curry cooked in an earthern pot) or the muringakka (drumstick) curry, rich in in subtle spices and coconut milk-based which would go well with rice, appam or pathiri. All these dishes are redolent of Kerala and all its culinary goodness.

Dishes like the chakka vevichathu (jackfruit cooked in coconut masala) or the pineapple nendram masala will appeal to those who appreciate a hint of sweetness along with their meals.

No matter how full you may be at the end of your meal, make sure you try the cloud pudding made from tender coconut or the kandhari icecream, even if it means sharing it with someone.

396,2020/02/07,Why biryani’s place is in the heart,"Now that the biryani is in the news — with some sections trying to turn it into a symbol of divisive politics — I must pen an ode to the dish that is so close to my heart. Regular readers will know that I never say no to biryani. And while I love them all — Awadhi, Kolkata, Moplah or Tamil biryani — I think the crown goes to Hyderabad's kachchi biryani.

That is why I was somewhat intrigued when I got a call from a young representative of a Hyderabadi food delivery outlet known as Go! Biryani. No prizes for guessing what’s on the menu: There is biryani, of course, but what interested me was that it also sells haleem (and a host of other dishes).

The man behind Go! Biryani is a software engineer called Ahmed Khan, who came to Delhi following a dream and the aroma of spices, after working in Dubai for a while. Ahmed is from Hyderabad, and I am told he was inspired by his mother, who ran a catering business. He trained the chefs at the outlet, and introduced them to the intricacies of Hyderabadi cuisine. The outcome is the kind of food that you relish.

On the menu are various kinds of biryani dishes such as Chicken 65 Biryani, Egg Dum Biryani, and Keema Dum Biryani. It also offers Chicken Korma, Chicken 65, Nargisi Kebab, Paneer 65, Soya 65, Potato 65 and Vegetable Chowgra (a dish of mixed veggies and cottage cheese).

Right now, the outlet (at Ganga shopping complex, Sector 29, Noida; from 11:30 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.; 8010755755) delivers only to Indirapuram and Noida, but plans to expand to other areas.

I tried out the Chicken Zafrani Biryani (₹319) and the Mutton Zafrani Biryani (₹289). Both the rice dishes were well cooked, with juicy pieces of meat nestling in the aromatic grains of rice. The mutton biryani had boneless pieces of meat, deliciously tender and spicy. It had been cooked on dum – on slow heat in a sealed container – and came with raita and salan. I enjoyed the salan, too, which was mildly spicy. The vegetable dum biryani (₹229) is cooked with beans, carrot, cauliflower and peas.

I loved the Golconda Signature Haleem (₹219). This meat-and-lentil dish was creamy and smooth, and had just the right proportion of spices. The ingredients had been mashed just right, too. The addition of coriander leaves to the haleem gave it a nice colour and twist. What they call the Stuffed Chicken Shami Kebab (₹269 for four pieces) is a bit like Shikampuri Kebab, I thought, but with a small core of fresh cottage cheese, green chillies and coriander leaves adding to the taste.

I ended my meal with just a spoonful of Shahi Tukda (₹129). This dessert of fried bread soaked in sugar syrup and topped with nuts was just the right way to end what turned out to be a very nice meal, indeed. I am glad that young Ahmed followed in his mother’s footsteps – and realised his dream.

397,2020/02/07,Dine like the Nawabs at this Awadhi Food Festival in Visakhapatnam,"“It is not what spices go into the food but the way they are used to attain the flavours that make Awadhi cusinie stand out,” says chef Luqman Farooq firmly as he walks me through the Awadhi Food Festival at WelcomHotel Grandbay’s Oceanic restaurant. Luqman is a true-blue Lucknowi and a chef at Kebabs and Kurries, ITC Gardenia, Bengaluru.

His father was a chef too and food was an integral part of his childhood. He learnt the nuances of Awadhi fare from his Dad. “Awadhi food is all about slow cooking so that the vegetables and meat absorb the flavours of the spices. Since it is the cuisine of Nawabs, there is both richness and delicacy in it. Lots of spices and dry fruits are used yet the flavours are subtle. Ghee and saffron are used in abundance in the dishes,” he adds.

Smell the food before you put the food in your mouth, advises Executive chef of the hotel, Jayesh Karande. “The dum-style cooking of Awadhi food makes aroma significant to the cuisine,” he explains.

I follow his advice and breath in the subtle spicy flavour of the Murgh Zafrani Pasanday that is served with chilled mint chutney. The grilled chicken, marinated in garlic and chilli powder, I learn, is so tender that I can slice through it like a hot knife through butter. I come to appreciate the texture of the food as well as I get a crunch of cashew filling hidden in the Nimona tikki, a green peas patty. However, one needs to coat the tikka in the pudina chutney, otherwise it can be a tad bland.

For the main course I am served Methi Panner, Gosht Nihari and Dum ki Machili along with Khamiri Roti and Sheermal. As I dig into the Dum ki Machili, I am treated with a perfectly-spiced boneless Kingfish that is served dipped in smooth and creamy gravy. It makes a great combo with Sheermal, a flatbread made with refined flour, ghee and milk. Sheermal was also a perfect accompaniment to the spiced cubes of cottage cheese in Methi Paneer. The taste of methi lingered long after the course.

Nihari traditionally means slow-cooked mutton stew. In olden days, the mutton was cooked overnight with spices like cardamom, cinnamon, chillies and bay leaves to pack the meat with flavour. Chef Luqman has cooked the stew for over two hours. It is a riot of flavours as I bite into a piece of the mutton that is served in a pool of dark brown stew peppered with caramalised onions and sliced ginger. The juicy meat of the mutton goes well with the soft and chewy Khamiri roti.

There is more meat as the Gosht Dum Biriyani arrives, redolent with the flavours of basmati rice and spices with a special smokiness to it. Thankfully it is not smothered in too much masala.

398,2020/02/07,Kapil Wadhawan remanded in judicial custody till February 18,"A special court on Friday remanded Kapil Wadhawan, chairman and MD of Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) who is accused of having dealings with dead gangster Iqbal Mirchi in the past, in judicial custody.

Wadhawan (46) was arrested on January 27 by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

He was produced before special PMLA judge P Rajvaidya at the end of his ED custody. The court sent him in judicial custody till February 18.

According to the ED, Wadhawan was instrumental in laundering of huge amounts of money as part of an illegal deal with Mirchi.

The agency claimed that in 2010, Wadhawan executed a deal with Mirchi to purchase the gangster’s three properties in central Mumbai.

A sum of ₹12,773 crore was siphoned off from DHFL on the pretext of providing loans to one lakh fictitious customers, the ED said.

A part of this loan was used to make payments to Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, it said.

Mirchi’s Mumbai properties were sold to Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited, a company linked to the Wadhawan brothers, Kapil and Dheeraj, the Central agency said.

The agency has alleged Kapil Wadhawan “diverted” funds from DHFL to shell companies and later these dubious entities got amalgamated with Sunblink to “cover” alleged diversion of loans acquired from the housing finance firm.

Mirchi was allegedly the right hand man of gangster Dawood Ibrahim in the latter’s drug trafficking and extortion businesses.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9x8ip9/article30707469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMDHFLKAPILWADHAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kapil-wadhawan-remanded-in-judicial-custody-till-february-18/article30764405.ece
399,2020/02/07,"BJP slams State govt., NCP says land on rent, not sold","The BJP on Thursday criticised the State’s decision to allot 51 hectares land in Jalna to a sugarcane research institute led by NCP president Sharad Pawar at “throwaway rates”. State BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari also alleged that government lands are “gifted” to institutes led by Mr. Pawar or people close to him whenever his party is in power.

However, NCP leader Nawab Malik clarified the land has only been rented out to the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI), led by Mr. Pawar, to carry out research work in the interest of farmers and “not sold”.

Mr. Malik said former BJP chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had approved a file relating to the allotment of the land in question before it came up for discussion at the State Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

He asked the opposition party whether Mr. Fadnavis was “wrong” in doing so.

“The institutes and people close to Mr. Pawar are gifted government lands whenever his party is in power...there was no need to give land to the institute at throwaway rates as it has lot of money to buy land even at commercial rates,” Mr. Bhandari said.

“The VSI also has lands. Hence, it is condemnable to allot the land (in Jalna) to the institute in such a case,” he added.

Hitting back, Malik, also the NCP’s national spokesperson, asserted that no irregularity was committed while taking the decision.

He said the VSI works in the interest of farmers and has received grant from the government in the past.

The minority affairs minister said even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited the institute in the past and praised its work.

The VSI’s branch in Jalna, central Maharashtra, will work in the interest of farmers in Marathwada, where the crop sugarcane is being cultivated in a big way now, Mr. Malik said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-slams-state-govt-ncp-says-land-on-rent-not-sold/article30759022.ece

It was expected that the Ram temple issue will not be politicised, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.

Elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly will be held on Saturday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced the formation of a 15-member autonomous trust to construct the temple at Ayodhya.

“Modi gave the slogan of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ just four days ahead of polling for the Delhi Assembly. Will be happy if (the number) goes up by two-four seats with the help of Shri Ram,” the Sena said.

“It was expected that the issue of Ram temple will not be politicised, but its ‘foundation’ was laid for the Delhi Assembly (election) and will be completed on the occasion of 2024 Lok Sabha (polls).” It is expected that ‘Ram Rajya’ (welfare state) will be realised in a true sense in the country by then, it said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sena-takes-dig-at-modi-over-ram-temple-trust/article30759011.ece

403,2020/02/07,"Consider your guru as foremost, that’s what music is about: Pandit Jasraj","Last week, Pandit Jasraj, living legend of the Mewati gharana, turned 90. A gharana like Pandit Jasraj’s comes into existence when at least three generations of family perform the same style of music. To keep the tradition alive, musicians must pass on their legacy to the next generation.

The Padma Vibhushan-awardee vocalist, who has performed all over the world at most music festivals, is renowned for ‘kann ki gayaki’ (music of grace-notes). The maestro passionately believes every musician should consider their musical notes as god and pay close attention while presenting a raga.

Mewati gharana is known for its refined aesthetics and inclination towards spirituality. “The gayaki (style) of my gharana has touched people from across the world and has made Indian classical music more popular among them,” said Jasraj, who is famous for his rendition of haveli sangeet, an ancient form of Indian classical music performed in temples to invoke god.

With young musicians like Swar Sharma and Ankita Joshi, Pandit Jasraj believes his gharana has a bright future. “Though there are many students learning under my gharana in various parts of the world, these two are the ones I am banking on for the future of Mewati gharana,” said the maestro, reminiscing a recent performance by vocalist Aditya Shah from the Pandit Jasraj Music Foundation, Florida, that deeply moved him.

Durga Jasraj, the maestro’s daughter, believes her father has made an unrivalled contribution to Indian classical music across the world. He is the first Asian under whose name the Queen’s University in North America awards scholarships. “There are hundreds of students the world over who are learning at various music schools named after Pandit Jasraj. There is also an auditorium named after him in New York,” said Durga, who believes that the schools in her father’s name are ambassadors of Hindustani music and are taking the legacy forward. For instance, there are more than five Mewati music schools in Kerala alone, where over 300 students graduate every year. “You may think there should be a domination of Carnatic music in Kerala, but it’s the gayaki of this gharana that has made Hindustani music popular even in the Southern part of the country,” said Pandit Jasraj.

Durga said bapuji (her father) has always believed in vidya daan, where students come and stay with him to learn music. Pandit Jasraj recalled how as a nine-year-old, Ms. Joshi approached him to be her guru. “I was invited to perform at the Sawai Gandharva music festival in Pune by Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. No one was allowed to enter the green room. Suddenly, a girl came up to me and asked me if I would be her guru,” said Pandit Jasraj. “I was taken aback to see how she entered the green room with security guards around, and asked her that. The little girl had travelled 200 km to Pune. How could a green room keep her out?” He believes that this type of determination towards music makes an artiste big. “She has been here with me ever since,” said Pandit Jasraj, who also had a piece of advice for budding musicians. “Consider your guru as foremost; that is what music is all about.”

Pandit Jasraj is the only musician to have performed in all continents including Antartica: at the Oceanus Lounge on board the Sea Spirit Cruise in 2012. A notable achievement is of having a minor planet named after him. The International Astronomical Union has named minor planet 2006 VP32, discovered on November 11, 2006 as ‘Panditjasraj’, which traverses the cosmos between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ikvvnf/article30756241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMPANDITJASRAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/consider-your-guru-as-foremost-thats-what-music-is-about/article30756242.ece
404,2020/02/07,Mumbai taxi driver takes poet to police station for phone call on protests,"Little would have Jaipur-based poet Bappadittya Sarkar imagined that his mention of the word ‘protest’ during a phone conversation while travelling in Mumbai could land him at a police station.

Mr. Sarkar was returning to Kurla from Juhu in an Uber cab on Wednesday, when he called a friend to discuss the ongoing protests in the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). However, unknown to him, the driver was not only overhearing Mr. Sarkar’s side of the conversation but also reacting to it. And instead of taking the passenger to the destination, he drove the poet to the Santacruz police station.

In a series of messages, which were later shared on Twitter by activist Kavita Krishnan, Mr. Sarkar narrated his ordeal.

“I was at Silver Beach, Juhu, last night, and booked a cab around 10:30-10:45 to go back to Kurla, where I’m staying. As I got in the cab, I called a friend of mine and we were talking about protest cultures in different cities, what happened at Shaheen Bagh yesterday, people’s discomfort with ‘Laal Salaam’ and how we could make Jaipur’s protests more effective. Some 10-20 minutes into the conversation, my Uber driver stopped and asked if he could use the ATM. I agreed. Minutes later, he came back with two policemen and that’s when I realised he had gotten me to a police station,” Mr. Sarkar tweeted.

Questioned by police

He went on to recall how the policemen started quizzing him, and that he had to explain that he was carrying a dafli (a hand drum) because he was at the Mumbai Bagh protest earlier in the day.

At this point, the driver allegedly said, “Sir aap isko andar lo, ye desh jalane ki baat kar raha hai, bol raha hai main communist hoon, hum Mumbai mein Shaheen Bagh bana deinge, mere pass poori recording hai. (Sir, please put him behind the bars. He was talking about setting fire to the country, saying he is a communist and talking about making a Shaheen Bagh in Mumbai. I have the entire recording).”

Mr Sarkar told the policemen to listen to the recording and arrest him if they find him saying he would will burn the or anything that is inciting or can be perceived as anti-national. He also asked the Uber driver what he had taken offence to.

“He responded ‘Tum desh barbaad kardoge aur hum dekhtye raheinge? Main kahin aur le jaa sakta tha tujhe, shukr mana police station laaya hun.’ (Will we just stand by and watch while you destroy the country? I could have taken you anywhere. Be thankful I only brought you to the police station) It was at that moment that I felt unsettled, some sense of fear set in and stayed throughout the night,” Mr Sarkar said in his messages.

Mr. Sarkar said he was ultimately released after being told not to wear a red scarf or carry a dafli, given “the times that we live in”.

An Uber spokesperson said the company was “reviewing the matter”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hb2u9k/article30756190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BM-Sarkar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/poets-taxi-ride-ends-at-mumbai-police-station/article30756191.ece

Called the Maharashtra Police International Marathon (MPIM), the run will extend from Gateway of India to the Bandra end of the Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link. Police personnel, members of the armed forces and civilians will take part.

“The marathon is not an event but a movement. The police will run shoulder to shoulder with citizens, this time not to chase someone but to become a catalyst of change for a fitter India,” said Special Inspector General of Police (Administration) Krishna Prakash, Maharashtra Police. Mr. Prakash was addressing a press conference to discuss details of the event at the Bombay Yacht Club in Colaba on Thursday. “The MPIM is a step forward towards building a rapport between the police and the public, since the police should also motivate people to be healthy and physically sound,” he said.

The participants include 700 full marathoners and 3,250 half marathoners. The race will have four categories of 5 km, 12 km, 21 km and 42 km. The age limit for the 5 km category is a minimum of 12 years while for the other three it is 18. The winners of the full marathon will win ₹3 lakh each, while those who win the half marathon will get ₹2 lakh each in the male and female categories.

The marathon will also see around 50 top Indian male and female athletes and about 10 international athletes vying for the top honours, with actors Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn too participating in the event.

“There will be 21 ambulances along the route and police personnel will be deployed every 250 m. There will be medical aid centres to administer first aid to runners with minor bruises or cramps and help them complete the run. Doctors, nurses and paramedics will also be on standy for emergencies,” said sports medicine expert Ashish Contractor.

The MPIM has tied up with India Cares Foundation as a philanthropy partner. The foundation has set up treadmills in Gold’s Gym centres in 10 cities in Maharashtra, where ₹100 is donated to charity for every kilometre achieved by a runner on the treadmill.“The Tread For Change initiative has been operational since Monday and we are planning to set up similar treadmills on Saturday, if space permits,” said Meena Dave, chief executive of India Cares.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oarn50/article30756143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMMARATHON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/over-17000-to-run-in-police-marathon/article30756144.ece
406,2020/02/07,Body of Thane man found in duffel bag in Dombivli dump,"The Vishnu Nagar police have initiated investigations into the murder of a 56-year-old Thane resident whose body was found stuffed in a duffel bag in Dombivli on Thursday.

The bag was spotted by a resident of Baawan Chawl in Dombivli (West) around 9.30 a.m.. The bag was discarded at a garbage dump next to the Railway Ground, and the smell emanating from it made people suspicious. A police team opened the bag and found the body.

The body was taken to a hospital where the victim was declared dead before admission. The police obtained information about missing persons’ complaints and learned that a Thane resident named Umesh Patil had been reported missing to the Kopri police on Tuesday.

“We contacted Patil’s sons who identified the body as their father’s. They told us that he had left his residence on Tuesday morning and never returned, after which they lodged a complaint,” senior police inspector R.N. Munagekar, Vishnu Nagar police station, said.

Mr. Munagekar said an analysis of CCTV camera footage and inquiries at Thane and Dombivli railways stations established that Patil had boarded a Badlapur-bound train at Thane on Tuesday morning and got off at Dombivli. The police are now mapping his movements through cellular location mapping and other CCTV cameras around Dombivli railway station.

A stenographer by profession, Patil had retired from the Thane sessions court around five years ago and had been staying with his two sons in Thane since then.

“We have registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons and are awaiting a cause of death from doctors who conducted the autopsy. No clear external injuries were visible on the body and it had started to decompose by the time it was found. Based on the level of decomposition and the current cold temperature, the body is believed to have been dumped around 24 hours before it was found,” Mr. Munagekar said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/body-of-thane-man-found-in-duffel-bag-in-dombivli-dump/article30756125.ece
407,2020/02/07,Photographer manhandled by police,"The Mumbai Police, who have enjoyed a relatively positive image over their handling of the CAA and NRC protests so far, came under fire on Thursday after a video of some personnel assaulting photojournalist Ashish Raje went viral on social media.

Mr. Raje, who works with a city-based tabloid, was near the barricades at the entrance of Mumbai Bagh, where entrants were being screened, when the incident occurred.

“The personnel on duty asked me for my ID card. Since the spot was congested, I stepped a bit forward to let some ladies behind me pass. In the process, I ended up crossing the barricade, which angered the police. They pushed me and pulled my bag. I told them that I was only trying to reach for my ID but they dragged me further beyond and assaulted me,” Mr. Raje said.

408,2020/02/07,Three-party govt. takes toll on babus,"A three-party government in power has brought with it a fresh challenge for the State administration and bureaucrats — juggling a series of review meetings with different leaders and handling recommendations from members of all three allies.

After the Maha Vikas Aghadi took over the reigns of the State, the government announced a review of all the departments to assess their performance in the five years of the previous government. However, the reviews seem to be unending, with each department meeting at least two leaders with files and data.

While Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is reviewing department performance, Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar is also holding meetings with every department ahead of the budget session. Besides, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Pawar, whose efforts led to the formation of the government, is also meeting bureaucrats along with ministers from his party and the Congress.

“Apart from these independent reviews, there are letters, recommendations and phone requests from leaders. As an obligation to the alliance partners, ministers now have to endorse or give remarks on letters sent by workers from different parties. Not only has the number of people coming to Mantralaya increased, but officials are also bombarded with letters and recommendations,” a senior official in the secretariat said, on the condition of anonymity.

Multiple reviews

Departments that have undergone multiple reviews include Social Justice, Education, Women and Child Welfare, Urban Development, and Housing.

The Social Justice Department is led by NCP minister Dhananjay Munde. Last month, Mr. Thackeray took stock of the department, which was followed by a meeting between the officials and the Finance Minister. A week ago, the NCP chief met Mr. Munde.

Both Pawars had called for independent meetings with the Urban Development Department, held by Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde who directly reports to Mr. Thackeray.

The Congress’s Varsha Gaikwad, the Minister for School Education, has had meetings with the CM and Deputy CM, as has Women and Child Welfare Minister Yashomati Thakur.

409,2020/02/07,Maharashtra to book gutkha manufacturers under MCOCA,"The Maharashtra government will now book manufacturers of gutkha under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Minister for Food and Drug Administration Rajendra Shingne said here on Thursday.

He said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was serious on effective implementation of the gutkha ban in the State and that it would book anyone found involved in supply, manufacture, storage, distribution, transport and sale of gutkha under the provisions of the MCOCA.

“We are contemplating this move as the ban has not been effective in the State from 2012 onwards. The existing laws are not strict and the accused get away easily by paying some fines. We will come down hard on those involved in illegal smuggling and production of gutkha,” the Minister said.

Not blanket action

Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh clarified that the MCOCA will not be imposed in a blanket manner but only if a gang/cartel was found involved in smuggling, storage and sale. “This will be on a case to case basis and only when we find evidence of some sort of organised crime taking place. It will not be a blanket action under the MCOCA,” he said. Since the announcement of ban in 2012, Maharashtra has seized gutkha worth ₹171 crore. The State has filed 3,727 FIRs and 4,600 court cases are pending in court.

Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting to review the effectiveness of the ban this week.

He warned officials of action if gutkha was found stored in their area of jurisdiction. Action would also be taken against companies who are promoting liquor and tobacco with other subsidiary products in advertisements.

Maharashtra’s tobacco ban has been in place since 2012 but was not being implemented owing to pressure from a powerful gutkha lobby, and smuggling from neighbouring States. Maharashtra imposes a jail term of six months on sale of tobacco, while selling it is a bailable offence under the existing laws.

The punishment was raised to three years in prison, and the offence made non-bailable, the government had announced in Assembly in 2018.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3gn5f/article30756077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMGUTKHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-to-book-gutkha-manufacturers-under-mcoca/article30756078.ece
410,2020/02/07,Civil engineer caught red-handed while breaking open ATM in Uran,"A civil engineer was arrested after he was caught red-handed while trying to break open an ATM in Uran in the early hours of Thursday.

Constables Santosh Jagdale and Ratan Rathod of Uran police station were on patrol duty when they saw suspicious activity inside an Bank of India ATM booth with the shutter half down. When the constables tried to enter, the person inside resisted and did not allow them to open the door. The constables then called for more police personnel.

Assistant police inspector Vrushali Pawar and his team nabbed the man who was identified as Vikrant Mokal (22), a resident of Ranjanpada in Uran.

“He is a civil engineer and works in a private company. He had brought a grinder machine from his company to pry open the ATM. By the time we reached, only the area where the cash is kept was to be cut,” senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni, Uran police station, said.

Ms. Pawar said he had initially lied that he did not have parents, but they found out about his family.

“He earns around ₹20,000 per month. Till now we have not found anything concrete for which he decided to commit the crime. There seems to be no criminal record of the accused as of now, but we are investigating,” she said.

He was arrested under Sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence), and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code. The accused has been remanded in police custody till February 10.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9couj2/article30756093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMATM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/civil-engineer-caught-red-handed-while-breaking-open-atm-in-uran/article30756076.ece
411,2020/02/07,Metro 3 gets 87 applications for station naming rights,"The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) has received 87 applications for its Metro 3 station naming rights project, for which it had floated an expression of interest last month.

The most sought-after station was Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), which received 12 applications from various companies. In all, 28 organisations participated in the process, with several showing interest in multiple stations.

After BKC, Dadar and Airport Terminal 2 received the second highest applications — nine each — followed by Airport Terminal 1 and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus with seven each.

The organisations that have shown interest in the initiative include public sector undertakings like LIC and Indian Oil; banking and financial institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, UTI, Kotak, IDFC First and HSBC; airlines like IndiGo and SpiceJet, corporates like JSW, Glaxo Smith Kline, TimesGroup, Blackstone and Phoenix Mills; and real estate companies like Piramal, Oberoi and DB Realty.

The initiative is among the major focus areas for MMRC to ramp up its non-fare revenue stream before Metro 3 operations begin. Sources said the corporation aims to generate around ₹100 crore per annum through the non-fare bracket, where it also plans to have initiatives like direct access to stations and advertising rights.

“Non-fare revenue is critical for sustainable operations of any transportation network, which helps keep passenger tariffs under check. Station naming rights are a critical source contributing significantly to overall non-fare revenue. The response from various organisations to the expressions if interest has been encouraging,” Ranjit Singh Deol, managing director, MMRC, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ju9vzv/article30756048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMMUMBAIMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/metro-3-gets-87-applications-for-station-naming-rights/article30756049.ece
412,2020/02/07,Tushar Gandhi lends support to Mumbai Bagh protesters,"Tushar Gandhi, the great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, joined the Mumbai Bagh protest on Thursday, even as political parties who were earlier aligned with it withdrew their support.

The protest, which is being conducted on the lines of the Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, started on the night of January 26 and has been going strong. Political leaders, including Naseem Siddiqui of the Nationalist Congress Party, had on Monday held a meeting with State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, and decided to call off the protest by 5 p.m. on Thursday. However, the protesters, mostly women, have decided to stay put.

Mr. Gandhi, who reached Mumbai Bagh around 4 p.m., expressed full support to the protest. “No revolution ever began with legal permission. This is a movement of the women of the city, and it will continue if they want it to. They are fighting not just for Maharashtra but for the country. If the authorities use force against them, they will have to use force against me as well,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Siddiqui had reiterated his stand at a press conference at Sahil Hotel in Mumbai Central. “Every protest is time bound. There remains no reason to continue the protest when its objective has been achieved. Mr. Deshmukh assured the us in writing that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens will not be implemented in Maharashtra. Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has stated the same, saying that these laws will not only affect the Muslims, but also the Hindus of the country,” he said, adding that the convening committee will distance itself from the protest after 5 p.m.

Several protesters, however, did not even consider the meeting to be valid. Gitika Lohani (26), a former student of Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “The meeting with Mr. Deshmukh was dominated by local politicians and women did not get proper representation. We can not rely on something written on a piece of paper along with the Minister’s signature. The State needs to take a firm step like Kerala and Punjab have.”

Jennifer Mirza (57), wife of filmmaker Saeed Mirza, said, “Despite all the allegations, you can tell that these are not women of any political party. They are upset women and even if they don’t understand the letters ‘CAA’, we all know it’s anti-minority. A BJP member said the protests are exploiting innocent and ignorant women, but this is not true. They are well-informed. It’s violence to call a woman ignorant just because she doesn’t have a degree.”

The protesters were also unwilling to shift to Jhula Maidan in Byculla, which was one of the venues suggested by Mr. Siddiqui. “Jhula Maidan is a playground and we do not wish to take away the children’s play area,” Juveriya Khan said.

Activist and student leader Umar Khalid, too, was present at the protest. “No one has the right to bargain on your behalf. Some other leaders going to the government and calling it off is not fair. This is a people’s movement. Also, there should be a clear directive from the State on the NPR. Till that happens, this protest will continue,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/77xyi6/article30756040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMTUSHARGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tushar-gandhi-lends-support-to-mumbai-bagh-protesters/article30756041.ece
413,2020/02/07,State opens up goodie bag to builders to push slum rehab,"From raising slum Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in Mumbai to undertaking drone surveys of slums to mark boundaries, Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad on Thursday said the government is ready to extend all possible help to builders to ensure real estate projects are completed speedily, making more homes available to the needy.

The minister also announced that the area of houses under slum rehabilitation schemes in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will be increased to 300 sq.ft. from 269 sq.ft. These schemes will now be implemented in all seven municipal corporations and seven municipal councils in the MMR. In Mumbai, the limit of use of slum TDR has been increased from 20% to 30%. “This is will attract more developers in slum redevelopment and our aim to make the city slum-free,” said Mr. Awhad.

Marking the completion of a month in office, Mr. Awhad announced a numbers of steps for Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to ease the process for builders. “We have decided to conduct drone surveys of all the slums to demarcate boundaries. Every month, a report will be sent to the SRA and in case of increase in slum area, the local police station will have to answer,” Mr. Awhad said.

He said a decision has been taken, according to which only a person living in a hutment will be eligible for a house in the SRA project. “There are instances where the owner rents out huts to others and in case of redevelopment, the owner gets a flat. The person living there goes to some other slum. From now on, the person who is living will be eligible for the flat in the SRA scheme,” he said.

“We have also decided to welcome foreign direct investment in government housing schemes with an arrangement of 20% equity to either MHADA or SRA. This is not for a particular project; the investor can choose a project of their choice,” he said. Asked about the interest shown by a Dubai-based firm in the Dharavi redevelopment project, Mr. Awhad said certain rules have not been followed and a committee headed by the chief secretary will give its report on the matter in eight days.

Among the measures taken to benefit builders are: taking only 20% premium at the time of issuing commencement certificate and remaining 80% at the time of issuing occupation certificate (OC) in an attempt to attract more developers for redevelopment of MHADA colonies. OCs will be issued in proportion to the premium paid. MHADA is now bound to inform the developer its final decision on the proposal within 45 days. MHADA redevelopment permissions will be given through the single window system. In an attempt to make affordable houses available on a large scale, a proposal each in Mumbai and the suburbs for cluster development of MHADA colonies will be submitted.

The structural audit fee of ₹10 per sq.ft. charged to developers has been abolished.

However, the developer will have to hand over project-affected persons’ tenements within one month of issuing the OC to the rehabilitation building.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fqd3vq/article30755988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMSLUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-opens-up-goodie-bag-to-builders-to-push-slum-rehab/article30755989.ece
414,2020/02/07,One injured in explosion in Bhayander,"One person was injured in an explosion in a commercial-cum-residential building in Bhayander in the early hours of Thursday.

According to the Bhayander police, the explosion occurred at Eatalios Restaurant in Vishal Building opposite Maxus Banquet Hall around 12.30 a.m..

The intensity of the explosion damaged two cars parked outside and also caused windowpanes on the building’s first and second floor to shatter.

The watchman of the building, Rishikumar Tripathi, sustained minor injuries. The police and the fire brigade rushed to the spot and the resultant fire was brought under control within an hour.

As a matter of procedure, the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad was called in, and after a thorough examination, no signs of foul play were noticed. The hotel and a salon next to it have taken most of the damage.

“Inquiries till now indicate that the blast occurred due to leakage of liquefied petroleum gas from a cylinder in the restaurant after it shut shop for the day,” police inspector Chandrakant Patil, Bhayander police station, said.

The police have registered an incident report and are conducting inquiries to check whether there are any ground for registering a case of endangering life due to negligence against the restaurant management.

Statements are being recorded from employees regarding fire safety precautions.

415,2020/02/07,Metro worker dies as girder falls on him,"A Metro worker died after a 2.8 tonne steel girder fell on him while it was being launched on Metro Line 2A at Kandivali (West).

The victim, Jagjit Singh (28), had been working on the site as a rigger for the last two years.

“The incident occurred on January 16. While they were launching the girder, the belt that was holding it up snapped, and the victim was under it. It was a case of negligence,” Vitthal Shinde, senior police inspector of Charkop police station, said.

According to police officials, the incident occurred around 1.30 a.m. near Shiv Shrushti building on New Link Road, where Metro Line 2A is being constructed. “The girder fell on the victim’s head and he was rushed to Shatabdi Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The body was sent to Bhagwati Hospital for post-mortem,” a police official said.

Another worker had received minor injuries in the accident, the police said.

The post-mortem centre attached to Bhagwati Hospital in Borivali received the body at 2.30 a.m. on January 16. According to Dr. Sanjay Jadhav, who conducted the procedure, the deceased had a severe head injury, which led to his death.

416,2020/02/07,Woman’s suicide: minor among 5 neighbours booked in Panvel,"The Panvel taluka police have booked five people, including a minor girl, for abetment to suicide of a 55-year-old woman in the neighbourhood. Sharda Govind Mali was found dead at her residence in Dundre village in Panvel on Tuesday afternoon when her daughter-in-law had gone to call her for lunch. Her son Vishwas (29) lodged a police complaint against the five neighbours.

As per the complaint, Mali on Monday had purchased a new mangalsutra worth ₹29,000 and was showing it to her neighbouring women where the minor girl was present. After some time, Mali could not find the gold ornament and asked the minor if she had taken it.

Taking offence to it, the girl’s mother, who was also present there, started abusing the woman. Later at night, along with the girl’s mother and father, other neighbours, including Vanabai Arjun Davane and Hanuman Bhagwan Patil, went to Mali’s house and abused the family and asked them to come to a temple to take a pledge.

The complaint said Mali’s family and the neighbours reached the temple and took a pledge that the one who stole the mangalsutra would die the next day.

On Tuesday morning, again the minor girl’s mother and Ms. Davane abused the victim and told her that god would take her life. Mali’s son stays opposite her house where she used to go for lunch. On Tuesday, when his wife Roshni went to call Mali for lunch she found her dead.

Meanwhile, Mali’s relative Prakash Mali has alleged foul play. “She wasn’t wearing saree and was in her blouse and petticoat when found dead. Some of her hair was burnt and also there were burn injuries on her neck and shoulders. Her body was also drenched in water. It looked as if someone tried to set her on fire and then doused it. If she had to commit suicide she would have directly killed herself. The house was closed from inside but the back door was open,” he said.

Senior police inspector Ashok Rajput from Panvel taluka police station said prima facie it looked suicide and they had registered a case of abetment to suicide. “Further investigations are on.”

The minor girl along with her parents, Ms. Davane, and Mr. Patil have been booked for abetment to suicide.

418,2020/02/07,Housing segment was hoping for more,"Expectations ahead of the Union Budget are always high and the housing segment too had pinned high hopes on some positive announcements that could revive its sagging fortunes. But the Budget had nothing significant to offer; there was no bailout package or any news on how the crisis would be addressed. The real estate segment is reeling under liquidity crisis and low demand from home buyers.

The government, though, retained its focus on affordable housing by extending the tax holiday for builders developing houses under this project. The project approval deadline has been extended from March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021, to claim the benefit.

The buyers under affordable housing will continue to get additional rebate on the interest component of the loan up to ₹1.50 lakh (₹2 lakh plus ₹1.50 lakh). Borrowers under this project will continue to get rebate of ₹3.50 lakh for houses priced below ₹45 lakh.

Would these two sops, one for builders and the other for home buyers, revive the segment? Unlikely. The Budget by and large failed to invigorate the real estate segment.

In a surprising announcement the government has created two options for individuals to choose for being taxed on the income. Under the first option, individuals can opt for deductions under the usual Income Tax sections such as Sec 80C and 24 for claiming tax benefits including principal component of up to ₹1.50 lakh and interest component of ₹2 lakh respectively (₹3.50 lakh under affordable housing). Under the second and newly introduced option individuals can forego all the tax benefits available under all Sections of the Income Tax Act and just pay taxes.

Worrisome

The second option is worrisome for the real estate segment because it may discourage home buyers since one of the major benefits for individuals was to get tax benefits that also had significant impact on the demand side for houses. Time will tell how individuals would understand these two options of taxation and which one would they choose. Further, the RBI presented its post-Budget monetary policy this week wherein the think-tank of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to hold the repo rate at 5.15%. This is the rate at which banks borrow funds from RBI to meet short-term fund shortages.

Considering the huge spike in inflation levels in the last couple of months and subdued economic growth, the announcement was on expected lines. The RBI continues to be ‘accommodative’, raising hopes of rate cut possibilities in the coming months.

The RBI also decided to infuse more liquidity into the banking system thereby enabling lenders to be able to lend freely. With better liquidity the home loan rates would continue to be at the present levels or may even be reduced for the benefit of borrowers. Once the economy gets into the path of recovery, the rates would resume their downward journey, but such recovery may not happen anytime soon.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/qlah9o/article30765337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGPHOUSEING922505788,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/housing-segment-was-hoping-for-more/article30765338.ece
419,2020/02/07,Onion prices crash in Tiruchi market,"The price of onions, which had hit the roof in December, is on downtrend following a glut in the market now.

Wholesale traders at the Tiruchi All Perishables Commission Mandis Commercial Complex, a major onion trade centre in the region, reported a fall in the prices of both the bigger Bellary variety, procured from other States, and the locally grown small onions. The price of both varieties had touched a peak of ₹150 a kg in December.

The smaller variety sambar onions ruled at ₹20 to 30 a kg, depending on quality, at the wholesale market on Friday. Bellary onions were selling at ₹15 to 25 a kg. “Depending on their quality, the Bellary onions were sold in three categories of ₹10, ₹17 to 18 and ₹24 a kg. The best quality in small onions is being sold at ₹30 a kg,” said A.Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association. The retail prices normally rule higher by ₹5 a kg.

Attributing the fall in prices to heavy arrivals of both varieties, he said though the wholesale market in Tiruchi was getting about 300 tonnes each of sambar onions and the Bellary variety every day, the offtake from the market was lower. “We are getting 300 tonnes of Bellary onions from Maharashtra, but we are able to sell only 150 to 200 tonnnes. Even the transport cost will work out to ₹ 7 to 8 a kg; what will the farmers get then? This has been the situation over the past 10 days. Similarly, we are getting 250 to 300 tonnes of sambar onions from villages in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts every day but the demand is lower,” he said.

Affordable alternatives

So, small traders in places such as Kumbakonam, Thanjavur and other small towns, who normally procure their requirement from the Tiruchi market, are able to purchase the Bellary onions from Maharashtra directly as a lorry load of the onions is affordable to them now, traders here said. “The quantum of sales (about 100 tonnes a day) at the market here now represents only the demand of Tiruchi city,” he said.

Traders rue that the government, which intervenes whenever price of onions was on the upswing, does not bother when the prices go down. “If the downtrend continues, farmers may suffer heavy losses and may not go for next crop. It will trigger a price rise later. Interests of both farmers and consumers can be protected only if the price of onions rules steady at around ₹40 a kg,” he said and suggested that the State government should persuade the Centre to allow export of small onions. “ Small onions can be exported to Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. If exports are allowed, it will arrest the slide in the price,” he said.

Farmers bear the brunt

Though consumers are happy, traders say that farmers would be hit. A section of farmers say that they would not stand to gain much even if exports are allowed. R.Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, argues against allowing exports on the grounds that it would not benefit farmers. “It is the middlemen who will benefit,” he observed.

Instead, he wants the government to focus on taking steps to check diseases in the crops. Citing heavy losses suffered by small onion growers due to a root rotting disease in the crop early this season, he said this is the reason why farmers have started selling their stocks (stored and preserved in traditional structures of wooden planks and coconut thatches, known as vengaya pattarai) as the disease hit small onions were showing signs of rotting.

He suspected that the new diseases were being caused by the use of same batch of seeds for long. The government should fix an expiry date for seeds and once they are past the date, the seeds should be destroyed, he demanded.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cculso/article30767757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY08ONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/onion-prices-crash-in-tiruchi-market/article30764743.ece

421,2020/02/07,Commissioner of Railway Safety begins two-day inspection of electrified stretches,"Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru K.A. Manoharan began a two-day statutory inspection of the second electrified portion of the main line section from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai via Chidambaram on Friday following completion of overhead electrification work.

The officer will also inspect a separate electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur.

Accompanied by senior officers of the Tiruchi Railway Division and the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Mr. Manoharan started the detailed exercise from Cuddalore Port Junction travelling on board a special train.

The RVNL, a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, has been entrusted with the task of electrifying the 228 km main line section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore,Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam and a separate stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur via Peralam and Nannilam (23 km).

The RVNL has already electrified the first portion of the main line section from Villupuram to Cuddalore Port Junction with trains being hauled by electric locomotives after the Commissioner of Railway Safety accorded mandatory clearance post inspection.

Railway sources said Mr. Manoharan would inspect the electrical installations established as part of the project from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai besides inspecting the signalling and engineering works during the day-long exercise. He would inspect the electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur on Saturday and conclude the exercise by conducting a speed trial in the special train that would be hauled by a electric locomotive in the evening from Tiruvarur to Cuddalore Port Junction (113 km).

The sources said the speed trial would be between 90 and 100 kilometres per hour. Ahead of inviting the Commissioner of Railway Safety for inspection, the RVNL officials had conducted a trial run of an electric locomotive from Tiruvarur to Cuddalore via Mayiladuthurai.

Passenger and freight trains hauled by electric locomotive would be operated in the electrified stretches from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai and from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur after obtaining mandatory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety.

Presently, passenger and freight trains were being hauled by diesel locomotives on both stretches.

The last leg of the ongoing overhead electrification project in the remaining 70-km stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur via Kumbakonam is apace with foundation work underway currently. The RVNL has targeted to complete the electrification works up to Thanjavur Junction by June. The entire project is being executed at a cost around Rs. 300 crore. The completion of the project would enable operation of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains from Villupuram to Thanjavur.

The main line section is another important stretch falling under the vast jurisdiction of the Tiruchi Railway Division after the chord line section from Villupuram to Tiruchi via Vriddhachalam, Ariyalur and Srirangam. The double line stretch from Villupuram to Tiruchi has already been energised with trains being hauled by electric locomotives.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rrqazh/article30760381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07FEBTH-Inspectionjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/commissioner-of-railway-safety-begins-two-day-inspection-of-electrified-stretches/article30760383.ece

423,2020/02/07,Coronavirus: another patient under observation,"Another patient has been kept under observation at the isolation ward at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital after he complained of fever and a sore throat, both symptoms of novel coronavirus. However, he is asymptomatic, doctors said. The man, a 26-year-old working in Ningbo city, south of Shanghai had returned to India via Tiruchi on January 31.

He returned to his hometown in Viralimalai taluk, Pudukottai, after thermal screening for the infection was conducted at the airport.

“Doctors continued to keep a close watch on him. On Monday, he complained of fever and was brought to the isolation ward at the MGMGH. His condition is stable,” said K. Vanitha, Dean, MGMGH.

425,2020/02/07,Citizen Perception Survey begins in city,"The Citizen Perception Survey conducted as part of the Ease of Living Index 2019 has begun in the city.

The survey is aimed at validating whether the experience of the citizens with service delivery is in consonance with the findings of the index. It has three main heads such as the quality of life, economic ability and sustainability. The survey will record perception of residents on 49 parameters such as education, health, cleanliness, governance, water supply, safety and security, environment, recreation, transportation, availability of affordable housing, environment, public service, lifestyle and others.

The Central government initiated the Ease of Living Index in 2018. It assesses the ease of living standards in over 100 cities in the country. This is the second year of the survey in which Tiruchi is being evaluated. The survey plays a vital role in deciding the outcome of the Ease of Living Index as the citizen perception of the role of public administration and their assessment of public services is crucial. It enables the civic body or competent government agencies to take remedial services to improve service delivery and governance of cities.

A senior official said that the residents of Tiruchi had to participate in the city online. They had to scan the QR code of the Ease of Living Index Survey-2019 and answer the questions on various parameters. All questions are on objective type basis. For each question, there will be three options. The residents have to choose an answer based on their experience on cleanliness, governance, water supply, availability of affordable housing and others. “We are devoting our attention to the citizen perception survey. We will get to know the reaction of the people on various services. The feedback will help us to take steps to improve our services,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi City Corporation, told The Hindu. He said that the core indicators of the survey would measure the standing of the city. There were supporting indicators to measure adoption of innovative practices, which will help the administration take steps to improve the ease of living.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/citizen-perception-survey-begins-in-city/article30756685.ece
426,2020/02/07,Convincing win for Gokulam,"Having already qualified for the Hero Indian Women’s League (IWL) football tournament semifinals, Gokulam Kerala wrapped up its final Group ‘B’ fixture with a convincing 5-0 win over Bidesh XI here on Friday. Bidesh XI ended its group stage campaign without a point.

In another match, Odisha Police was held to a 1-1 draw by Sreebhumi FC. Odisha Police’s Tikina Samal, who played the first three games as a goalkeeper, scored her third goal of the tournament. Both sides failed to make it to the knockout round.

The results: Gokulam Kerala 5 (Kamala Devi 4, Scindia Saundatikar 57-og, Sabitra Bhandari 63, Umapati Devi 82, Karishma Shirvoikar 86) bt Bidesh XI 0; Odisha Police 1 (Tikina Samal 26) drew with Sreebhumi FC 1 (Poonam 78).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/convincing-win-for-gokulam/article30764386.ece
427,2020/02/07,Inconsistent Gokulam takes on confident Kashmir,"Gokulam Kerala is easily one of the stronger sides in the I-League, but it has not quite been able to translate that reputation into performance. Take for instance its match against TRAU last weekend; it had to settle for a draw despite taking an early lead and dominating the match.

The host will have to come up with a better show if it has to return to winning ways in its match on Saturday. Its rival Real Kashmir is no pushover.

It is not just one of the most inspiring stories coming out of Indian sport in recent times, it is quite a formidable side, too. It is placed sixth in table with 12 points. Gokulam has 14 points and is fourth but has played a match more.

Fernando Santiago Valera’s boys have to show more consistency if they want to mount a serious challenge for the title. After beating East Bengal 3-1 — perhaps their best win yet of the season — they lost 1-3 to Punjab, defeated Churchill Brothers 1-0 and drew 1-1 with TRAU.

Boost

Real Kashmir will start in a more confident frame of mind, having won both its last matches. It had scored identical 2-0 wins over Indian Arrows and Aizawl, both away encounters. The addition to the squad of striker Robin Singh and defender Rena Salton — both loaned from ISL side Hyderabad FC — is a boost.

Kashmir’s coach David Robertson said Gokulam was a tough rival. “They were built up as one of the favourites for the title this season,” he told The Hindu. “But they have had ups and downs this season, like us.”

Gokulam must be hoping that Saturday’s match will be one of the ups. For that to happen, Marcus Joseph and Henry Kisekka, the two imports who have formed one of the most lethal combinations up front in the I-League, may have to continue with their scoring spree. Together they have netted 10 of their team’s 12 goals.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/inconsistent-gokulam-takes-on-confident-kashmir/article30763544.ece
428,2020/02/07,Barca dumped out of Copa del Rey by last-gasp Athletic strike,"Record 30-times winners Barcelona were sent crashing out of the Copa del Rey in a 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday after a stoppage-time header from Inaki Williams.

Spanish striker Williams glanced a cross into the bottom corner to spark jubilant scenes at a rocking San Mames stadium and recalled Aritz Aduriz's added-time goal in Athletic's 1-0 win at home to Barca on the first day of the Liga season.

They join Real Sociedad, Granada and second-tier Mirandes in Friday's semi-final draw, which will not include Real Madrid, Barca and Atletico Madrid for the first time in 17 years.

Coach Quique Setien said he was hurt by the elimination but was pleased with his side's performance.

“Today everything went well apart from the result,” he said. “We took a step forward in our play and I'm pleased with many things we did, I'm not only looking at the result.”

Barca captain Lionel Messi spurned a glorious late opportunity for the visitors when he could only shoot at the legs of Athletic keeper Unai Simon while his fellow striker Antoine Griezmann also came close in the second half.

The game looked to be heading into extra time when Williams missed a gilt-edged chance inside the area but he made amends by getting the slightest of touches on a cross from Ibai Gomez in the third minute of added time.

“I'm lost for words, you should never lose faith,” Williams told reporters. “The fans deserved this moment after the way they supported us and I now hope we can go on and fulfil the dream that we all have by going on to win it.”

The victory must have also felt like redemption for Athletic, who were knocked out of the Cup by Barca in 2017 and 2016 and lost to them in the final in 2009, 2012 and 2015.

The Catalans have appeared in the last six finals but they join Real Madrid in being knocked out after Zinedine Zidane's side were beaten 4-3 at home to Real Sociedad earlier on Thursday.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fnkeg0/article30757984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THATHLETICOBILBAO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/barca-dumped-out-of-copa-del-rey-by-last-gasp-athletic-strike/article30757987.ece
429,2020/02/07,Real Madrid crash out of Copa del Rey,"Real Madrid were knocked out of the Copa del Rey on Thursday as Martin Odegaard put on a creative masterclass against his parent club to lead Real Sociedad to a thrilling 4-3 victory.

Madrid conceded as many goals in 69 minutes as they had in their last 11 matches, torn apart at the Santiago Bernabeu by an electric La Real side, who deservedly advanced to the semi-finals.

Odegaard, on loan from Real Madrid but allowed to face his own club, scored the opener before the superb Alexander Isak hit two to give Real Sociedad a remarkable 3-0 lead.

Marcelo and Rodrygo both scored late in the second half and while Mikel Merino also added a fourth for the visitors, a Nacho Fernandez header set up a pulsating final three minutes, in which Andoni Gorosabel was also sent off.

Ten-man Real Sociedad held on for a sensational win to progress to the last four while Madrid's run without success in Spain's domestic cup extends to six years.

The only consolation might have been the display of the 21-year-old Odegaard, who is beginning to live up to the hype after signing for Madrid aged 15.

On loan at Sociedad, the plan was for Odegaard to stay one more year at Anoeta but this glittering display, that earned him a standing ovation from the home fans when he went off, may well persuade Madrid to recall him early.

Their 21-game unbeaten streak comes to an end after an uncharacteristically careless performance in which a rotated side highlighted the importance of the likes of Casemiro, Raphael Varane and Thibaut Courtois.

Courtois' replacement Alphonse Areola was at fault for at least one of the goals while Marcelo was typically unpredictable at left-back, a position the more dependable Ferland Mendy has made his own in recent weeks.

Eden Hazard is training again but the wait for his return goes on while Gareth Bale was again left out of the squad completely.

Yet Zinedine Zidane's changes should take nothing away from Real Sociedad, who showed why they were pushing for a place in La Liga's top four earlier this season, before a dip in form has seen them slip to eighth.

Warning signs

There were early warnings as Isak sped in behind but his shot was blocked by the diving Eder Militao and from the resulting corner, the Swede was picked out with a driven cross only to skew his finish.

Isak was involved in the opener too after 22 minutes, as his effort was saved by Areola, who then failed to readjust in time to prevent Odegaard firing through his legs.

Ander Barrenetxea had only come on at half-time but nine minutes into the second half, he had set up a second.

It was the first of two goals in as many minutes as the 18-year-old's floated cross was met brilliantly by the acrobatic Isak, who then made it three shortly after, rifling in at the near post after the ball had deflected to his feet.

Marcelo had been the defender beaten but a wild five minutes saw the Brazilian make amends as he caught Alex Remiro off guard, also at the near post, with a driven shot from the angle.

Madrid had the momentum but remained two behind with 10 minutes left after Merino tapped in for La Real before Rodrygo kept hopes of a comeback alive by finishing off a Vinicius pull-back.

Even in injury-time, victory was not safe. Nacho headed in Karim Benzema's cross with three of the six allotted minuets left before Gorosabel was shown a second yellow card.

Sergio Ramos might even have made it 4-4 but headed straight into the hands of Remiro.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hvtdna/article30756692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THMARTINODEGAARD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/real-madrid-crash-out-of-copa-del-rey/article30756693.ece

Mr. Kishore, the whole-time director of VSPL, the first BOT operator of Visakhapatnam Port Trust, said hitherto the tax at the rate of 20% was deducted on the dividends distributed by the companies.

“Now, the tax is payable by the investors and shareholders who receive it subject to the threshold limits applicable for them in their individual capacity. The move will help increase the reserves in companies that can be used to meet operational expenditure or debt servicing or for any other welfare activity. It will boost the financial health of the companies,” opined Mr. Kishore.

Mr. Kishore said the reduction of corporate tax from 25% to 23% would help save substantial amounts for the companies that could be spent on alternative propositions.

Further, fixing of corporate tax for new manufacturing industries is a welcome initiative, he said, adding that it would encourage investments in industries and help create employment opportunities.

437,2020/02/07,Campaign launched to make Vizag nutrition product capital,"Biovalley Incubation Council has launched a ‘Nutrify India’ campaign to promote Visakhapatnam as the ‘nutraceutical capital of India’.

Nutrition products from India, despite being the source of several ingredients exported to the United States, Europe and other overseas markets, account for just US$200 million whereas the estimated global trade has been put at $80 billion.

The campaign, in its first phase, will have a session in New Delhi next month and subsequently in other cities, which will culminate in the ‘Nutrify India Summit’ in the city in June. The summit will be organised in collaboration with the Nutraingredients-Asia in which global heads of several nutrition product manufacturing firms will take part.

“The initiative is significant as it signals launching of a mission to encourage innovation to produce more nutritious products indigenously,” K.V. Ram Babu, Managing Director of Hyderabad-based Pulse Pharmaceuticals told The Hindu.

“We are determined to achieve a bigger vision to make Vizag the nutraceutical capital of India,” said Biovalley CEO Amit Srivastava.

Explaining about the objective at AP MedTech Zone, he said with India’s mission to be USD 10 trillion dollar economy by 2030, there is an immense load expected on the population to deliver to reach to the visionary numbers. This is in turn expected to show up on medical bills as currently 640 million Indians are calorific sufficient but malnourished, while 340 million are acutely malnourished. Any stress on this population will trigger a chain of stress leading to lifestyle diseases.

Biovalley is supported by Department of Biotechnology and Niti Aayog to create the required ecosystem and nurture hubs for nutraceuticals.

439,2020/02/07,"At 111, woman born in what is now Bangaldesh is Delhi’s oldest voter","At 111, Kalitara Mandal has lost all her teeth but definitely not her appetite for fish and the will to participate in elections as this oldest voter in Delhi is still excited to get her wrinkled finger inked on February 8.

Born in undivided India in 1908, Ms. Mandal has seen the subcontinent go through turbulent phases many times, including two partitions, and lived “twice as a refugee” in India along with her family before finding a home in the national capital.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, Ms. Mandal, who has seen and participated in nearly all elections in India in the last century, fondly recalls the time when ballot boxes were used to vote. “Yes, I remember, they (polling officials) would take my thumb impression and then the ballot paper would be folded and put into boxes. I have voted with big machines (EVMs) too,” she said.

The centenarian is the eldest of four generations of Mandals who live in C.R. Park, a Bengali enclave set up in the national capital after the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War that led to the creation of Bangladesh.

While Ms. Mandal was born in Barisal (now in Bangladesh) three years after the 1905 Bengal partition, the youngest in the family, her seven-month-old great-grandson Jiyansh, was born in 2019 after the Lok Sabha elections.

“She is quite eager to take part in the elections as a voter. Last year too she voted in the Lok Sabha polls... This time also she is eager to get her finger inked,” said her son Sukh Ranjan.

A senior poll official said the Mandal family had applied for postal ballot facility for her at home, but the duration for that was over. “We are providing a special vehicle for her and her family in C.R. Park on Saturday,” the poll official told PTI.

Ms. Mandal’s grandson Suraj, 30, said she is willing to go to the polling station to exercise her franchise and the family will go together to vote.

Asked what her message is to people, especially those who don’t go to vote out of apathy or laziness, Ms. Mandal said, “Go out and vote. Democracy thrives on people and people must participate as each vote counts”.

As many as 132 centenarian voters — 68 men and 64 women — are eligible to exercise their franchise in the February 8 election and they will be treated “as VIPs” on polling day, officials said.

Bachchan Singh, 111, the oldest voter in the city in the 2019 elections who used to reside in Tilak Nagar, died in December 2019.

Mr. Sukh Ranjan, in his early 50s, says his mother will turn 112 years old in April but still has good memory of her life’s journey.

A few years before the 1971 war, Ms. Mandal along with her husband and children migrated to India from then East Pakistan to seek shelter after communal disturbance. They took shelter as refugees along with some others in Andhra Pradesh. That’s where Mr. Sukh Ranjan, Ms. Mandal’s youngest son, was born.

After the situation became normal, the family went back. But they returned after the 1971 war and took refuge at a place in Madhya Pradesh, which now comes under Chhattisgarh. “So, my family lived in refugee camps twice,” Mr. Sukh Ranjan said.

Ms. Mandal’s husband Jnanendra died when they lived in M.P. In the early 80s, her two elder sons came to Delhi to do odd jobs for a living. After a few years, the family settled in C.R. Park.

“Earlier we were living in DDA flats. Now we have our own home,” Mr. Sukh Ranjan said.

Of Ms. Mandal’s seven children — four sons and three daughters — five have passed away. While Mr. Sukh Ranjan is her only remaining son, she has one surviving daughter who lives in Bangladesh and had recently visited the family in Delhi.

Asked about her favourite things, the 111-year-old who speaks only Bengali, said, “Maach (fish), paan”.

“She doesn’t have any teeth left, but she eats fish, especially hilsa with great delight. Paan is also her favourite,” says Mr. Suraj, as her grandmother reaches out for the paan box, always kept by her bedside.

He said the family matriarch still manages to walk a little with the help of a stick and her eyesight is so good that she sometimes threads a needle.

Mr. Kejriwal was given till 5 p.m. on Saturday, when polling for the Delhi Assembly elections will take place, to respond to the notice. The EC action was based on a complaint by the BJP about a video of a public speech tweeted by Mr. Kejriwal’s official account on Monday.

As per the transcript of Mr. Kejriwal’s speech included with the notice, he had said that other parties and the media were talking about “Hindu, Musalman” and “mandir, masjid”, while he was discussing health, education and other services for Delhiites in his election campaign.

The EC said that by making the statement, Mr. Kejriwal had violated two Model Code of Conduct provisions against the use of unverified claims to criticise candidates and parties and appeals to caste and communal feelings.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/akfmdp/article30763890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kejriwal-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/ec-notice-to-kejriwal-for-hindu-musalman-comment/article30763880.ece
441,2020/02/07,"Delhi gears up for Assembly polls; extra vigil in Shaheen Bagh, other sensitive areas","Nearly 1.47 crore people are eligible to cast their ballot for the Delhi Assembly elections on Saturday for which election officials have prepared 13,0000 polling stations across the city.

For the first time, at least 11 booths will be accepting QR code-based voter slips, senior officials said. These will be scanned using a “Booth App” run by polling staff at the booths. Also, polling officials have also been asked to come to the station a day in advance. Senior officials siad that this had been done to avoid issues on the day of polling with many having to wake up very early and travel long distances.

While about 2600 people, including senior citizens and Persons with Disabilities have already cast their vote through postal ballots, election officials have also made pick and drop facilities for persons under these categories. Among these include about two lakh people who are above the age of 80 and XX number of PWD persons. There are also at least 150 people who are above the age of 100, who will be eligible to cast their vote in the present elections. Apart from this there are about 2.32 young voters between the ages of 18 and 19, and in total there are about 81 lakh male voters, 66 lakh female voters and 869 third gender voters.

At least 70 model polling booths have also been set up, one in each constituency, with all infrastructure facilities, election officials said. A total of 3704 polling booths at 516 locations have been identified as critical, including up to 5 polling stations in the Shaheen Bagh area. Special provisions such as live we casting and additional seccurity have been made at such polling stations to ensure smooth polling.

The previous assembly elections held in 2015 had seen a record turnout of 67.08%. In a bid to encourage voters Election officials have als been carrying out a large scale voter awareness and encouragement campaign, which has included music concerts at various locations, bike rallys, rangoli competitions, school level campaigns as well as social media outreach, advertisements, and regular jingles on FM radio channels to encourage voters. Various special campaigns alos focused on improving voter turnouts from areas seen to traditionally have low turnouts, officials said. Polling officials have also appealed to peal to avoid going on vacations on Saturday and ensure that they cast their ballot so as ensure a good turnout this time as well.

Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan, had earlier said 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will be deployed as part of the security measures.

This is nearly four times the number of CAPF personnel deployed during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he added.

There are 13,750 polling booths, besides one auxiliary booth, located at 2,689 locations across Delhi.

“As far as critical polling stations are concerned, there are 516 locations and 3,704 booths in that category,” Mr. Singh said.

Besides police security, polling stations falling in the “critical category” get paramilitary cover. Activities will be monitored through webcasting, he said.

Police and election machinery are on “extra vigil” and assessing the situation all the time across the national capital, he added.

Security personnel kept guard at strong rooms storing EVMs. Election staff carried EVMs and other polling material to booths under tight supervision in all constituencies.

Shaheen Bagh falls in the Okhla assembly constituency. The area has become the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the national capital and the agitation has been thrust by political parties into a poll issue.

Hundreds of people, including women and children, have been protesting since December 15 at Shaheen Bagh against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens.

Poll authorities had met protesters recently and encouraged them to vote on the polling day.

“The 2020 Delhi polls will be tech-driven with greater use of technology elements like mobile apps, QR codes, social media interface, seeking to enhance the experience of all categories of voters, before polling or on the voting day. And we are trying to make the best use of it,” he said.

Electors can carry smartphones at polling stations in 11 assembly constituencies for accessing QR codes from the voters’ helpline app in case they have not brought the voters’ slip to the booth.

Delhi has 70 Assembly constituencies and one constituency in each of the 11 districts will have this tech-driven facility.

The 11 are Sultanpur Majra, Seelampur, Ballimaran, Bijwasan, Trilokpuri, Shakur Basti, Nee Delhi, Rohtas Nagar, Chhatarpur, Rajouri Garden and Jangpura.

According to Singh, focussed campaigns were carried by his office to reach out to different sections of voters, aiming to break the “urban apathy” of the electorate.

Special campaigns were carried out in 30 constituencies which had seen lower turnout in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Singh hoped that the twin-edged strategy of more thrust on use of technology complemented with massive campaigns in the run-up, will lead to a greater turnout than in 2015.

A mega, multi-domain outdoor campaign is being carried out by the Delhi CEO Office to bring large number of electorate to the polling booths, besides jingles on all major FM stations.

The ruling AAP is going into the Delhi election with the hope to repeat its stellar performance in the last assembly polls, while the BJP, which bagged all seven seats here in the Lok Sabha election, will be aiming at expanding its vote share in the national capital.

The Aam Aadmi Party had got 54.3 per cent votes in the 2015 Assembly polls, while the Bharatiya Janata Party got a vote share of 32 per cent and the Congress managed to bag just 9.6 per cent of the total votes polled.

The AAP will fight the polls on a depleted strength of 60 MLAs as it had to concede one seat to the BJP in the subsequent bypoll, while six of the lawmakers were disqualified over joining other parties.

442,2020/02/07,Shiv Sena praises Kejriwal a day before Delhi polls,"A day before the Delhi Assembly elections, the Shiv Sena on Friday praised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and hit out hard at the BJP for allegedly calling him a terrorist.

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena took a hard look at the Delhi Assembly election.

“PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are pulling out all stops for the Delhi elections after losing Maharashtra and Jharkhand. But despite doing all this, one Kejriwal is turning out to be a challenge for BJP. Despite having limited power and the Centre’s hindrances in his work, Kejriwal government has done ideal work in the field of education, health, civic services. Modi government should in fact have adopted this model in other States but forget that, the level of campaigning this election has stooped so low that now, they are just trying to prove Kejriwal wrong. In Delhi (at the Centre), BJP is ruling and also in Delhi municipal corporation. Despite all this, it is important to note that this government has managed to work and become an ideal one. Our rulers will try to replicate international standards in India but why can’t they appreciate the education given in Delhi schools? Mohalla clinics are working well, electricity, water bills have been waived, whatever Kejriwal had promised has been done. In fact, PM Modi’s Central government should have felicitated him. Instead, BJP is busy doing Hindu Muslim. BJP did not even like Kejriwal reciting Hanuman Chalisa and they are calling it drama,” says the editorial.

The piece hit out at the BJP as senior its leader Prakash Javadekar allegedly called Mr Kejriwal a terrorist recently.

“BJP also called him (Kejriwal) a terrorist. If he is one, why doesn’t BJP arrest him? Is BJP trying to say that in 2014, 70% Delhi voters voted for a terrorist? The PM’s campaign speeches are only focused on Batla House and Section 370. BJP should not bring the PM down to this level. PM Modi said in his speech to punish those who asked for a proof of surgical strikes. So does that mean those who do not vote for BJP will be considered traitors and the new government will be suspended? The country’s PM should not get into all this muck.. The CM of Jharkhand had supported surgical strike but still lost, which means the issues affecting people are different, you should address those. Kejriwal is asking for votes based on his performance in past five years. This model should be appreciated beyond political differences,”the editorial says.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nbfgbv/article30598842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19ARVINDKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/shiv-sena-praises-kejriwal-for-aap-governments-ideal-work-in-delhi/article30759878.ece
443,2020/02/07,"Francesca Cartier Brickell pieces together the rise of Cartier, the iconic jewellery brand, in her book","“When Jacques Cartier came for the Delhi Durbar in 1911 (to mark the coronation of King George V as King-Emperor of India), he had bought several gems, tiaras, jewellery and unique pieces. My grandfather Jean-Jacques Cartier, Jacques’s son, used to tell us that what surprised his father and, in some ways disappointed him, was that it was the men who was doing all the buying and for themselves! The men’s silver pocket watch was much in demand as the men from royal families wanted to be in fashion,” says Francesca Cartier Brickell, laughing as she narrates the incident.

It is anecdotal gems like this that make her book The Cartiers: The Untold Story of the Family Behind the Jewellery Empire, which was released in India in January, a captivating read. Speaking to MetroPlus on the sidelines of the Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters in the city, Francesca talked about how the book came about.

Francesca’s great-grandfather was the youngest of the three brothers who made Cartier a synonym for high-end jewellery. To write about her family's history, she had to travel the paths her ancestor had covered nearly a 100 years ago and piece together the glittering success story of the brothers as they bought diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, pearls and more from all over the world.

“My grandad was not in the habit of throwing things out. So when we were talking about the past, I told him there must have been letters. He told me there were letters but they were all lost when he moved from UK to France after selling the business in 1970,” narrates the author. That is when serendipity gifted her an heirloom.

Watch it One of the most famous and enduring innovation of Cartier was a wrist watch for men. “In those days, women wore wrist watches. Elizabeth I had one. But men wore pocket watches. They had to change that attitude of of men towards wrist watches. So they did something clever. They made a wrist watch for Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont. He wore the wrist watch designed by Louis Cartier and became a kind of brand ambassador for the men’s wrist watch,” Francesca narrates.

During her grandfather’s 90th birthday celebration at his house in France, Francesca was sent to the cellar to get a bottle of Champagne. Instead, what she stumbled upon was a treasure trove of memories in a battered trunk. “It was truly fortuitous because grandad was still alive. If I had discovered it later, I would not have been able to go through the letters with him. In this case, he was there to fill the gaps, to explain. It had letters written by my grandfather and his brothers. In a way, those epistles traced the growth of Cartier from a small shop in Paris into one of the most famous jewellery dealers in the world,” she explains.

The letters, telegrams, sketches and so on were the correspondence of four generations of her family and went back a 100 years. Francesca points out that It was the third generation that really made the firm a global presence. The three sons of Alfred Cartie were specialised in different fields: one was a creative genius, one was a bold entrepreneur and the youngest an expert in gems. “The letters are really moving. When they are really young, they are talking about building a business empire and then missives through the next decade is about how they made that dream come true. They are very human and depict the brothers’ affection for their father and for each other. When you read the letters, you read their thoughts. They had arguments, got excited and annoyed like any other people. Thanks to the letters, they came alive for me,” explains the author.

Talking about the link between the Cartiers and India, she says that since her grandfather’s father was the one who came to India, his house was full of Indian artefacts. In addition to precious gems from India, he also brought back rugs, tables, statues and more. “Our branch of the family has always had a close bond with India. I grew up hearing anecdotes about the Maharajas. For instance, the Nawab of Nawanagar (Jamnagar) was a client who became a close friend of grandpa’s (her great grandfather). He was part of the family and used to stay with them when he used to come to the UK and my great grandparents used to stay in his palace when they visited India. He had a big estate in Ireland because he loved fishing. My grandpa remembers going there,” she recounts.

Indian connection

The evidence of the deep bond between India and Cartier lay in the precious tiaras, neck pieces and jewellery they designed for the royal houses. In fact, it is estimated that the Indian connection ensured that the jewellery dealer was not hit by the wars and political turbulence in Europe or the Great Depression in the United States. He travelled to India several times during the years from 1910 to 1939.

Two years ago she travelled to India and traced Jacques footsteps as he visited royal households in Baroda, Kapurthala, Patiala and so on. “It was surreal. When I went to Baroda, it was the same palace I had seen in photographs. I met the descendants and their families, showed them the snaps that Jacques had taken and they showed me pictures of the jewels he was talking to about. I also met descendant of jewellery dealers. While we can count four generations in the family business, here in India, it is like 10 and 14. It is amazing how their businesses stay in the family,” she says.

At the height of their fame, the Cartiers counted amongst their clients members of royal families, fashion divas, reigning stars and newly-minted millionaires. However, Francesca points out that while they had had a close relationship with their clients, her grandfather pointed out that “they never forgot they were salesmen. They never got too big for their boots. But it was a lot of work to be a good salesman. They kept a close watch on the social columns to find out what party was happening where, who was marrying who and who was having an affair. You had to know that the man had bought a piece of jewellery for his mistress and so you could not tell his wife, you had to be extremely discreet about it,” she elaborates.

For the author, it was also an opportunity to meet the craftsmen who made the famous pieces and interact with them. They told her about the hours of work that had gone into each piece and the hours that they had spent in training, with apprenticeship ranging from five to six years. “They had such pride and respect for their work. They felt honoured to work for the business. It was like an extended family,” she recalls.

She says she considers herself blessed to have got the opportunity to write about the family and the business. “I studied literature but went into finance. So I feel the stars were all aligned for me to write this book,” she muses.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/eym3js/article30761205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvmFrancescaCartierBrickell,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/francesca-cartier-brickell-writes-about-the-growth-of-cartier-into-one-of-the-most-famous-jewellery-dealers/article30761206.ece
444,2020/02/07,How to handle the pressure of Valentine’s Day,"Humans crave variety. All these religions, so many languages, even ways to cook rice! Strange then, in spite of all this variety that we crave, we are still content having just one word to describe love. Which is why, for centuries, we have found ways to enhance this shortcoming. It leaves a lot to the imagination, many, many ways to express and convey love, even if that definition morphs over time. Now Valentine’s Day may not be a new concept, but now, we have a corporate day dedicated to celebrating an emotion. It sounds wholistic, but, in fact, is so profitable that I am sure Hallmark has an internal celebration called ‘Bonus Day’.

So, on the 14th of every February, people the world over experience a mental eclipse. It is when the heart moves straight into a direct line between reason and sanity, casting a shadow which lasts about 24 hours. Side effects include an inability to calculate cost-to-value ratio which can lead to relentless spending. It peaks around 8 pm. It is quite apocalyptic and zombie-like; therefore, in many circles, it is called the ‘Diá de Los Idiots’.

Now why celebrate catatonia... aren’t Monday noons at office bad enough? But hey, if we can have a Day for singles (November 11), losers (June 9) or worse still, vegans (November 1), why not one for a day when the heart spews out more sickening love bile than Rupi Kaur.

In case you have big plans this year to celebrate this aka ‘Gift a Pre-Nup’ Day, then you may stop reading here and go back to the galaxy you came from. But if you haven’t decided how to surprise your partner to get ‘Awwwws’ against the usual ‘Aw, man, why?’, here is some gifting advice.

Lower the bar

Spend the weeks, nay, months preceding the aka ‘Evening of Eventualities’ telling your partner how you (a) are low on funds, (b) been too busy to plan something concrete or (c) always found items you wanted out of stock…Small, niggling but excusable sequiturs which will generally serve to subconsciously lower expectations. Just be careful to time it right, too long and said partner might just see this as a sign to pack bags and leave.

Book/cover rule

Most gifts get judged by their cover so never put together a pretty parcel. Keep it sloppy — dirty, greasy, random bits of glue and tape — and that’s just you while trying to wrap the gift. People will immediately expect a substandard gift from the look of the package so whatever follows should be a spirit-raiser; which is more than I can say for aka ‘Instagram-filters for Real Emotions’ day.

Resolutions

If you were smart, you possibly instilled a resolution at the beginning of the year to not belittle your relationship with petty materialism involving gifts. The 14th day of the second month of the year is too early to give up on resolutions. That should see you sail through. Only downside is if your birthday happens to fall in-between.

Clime of the times

Climate change, right wing world leaders, CAA/NPR, rising oceans, rising cost of living, sinking savings, sunk future prospects — how can anyone celebrate this aka ‘More Fantasy than Disney’ Day at ease? Surely, considering gifts in such sombre times would be inappropriate.

And remember, don’t fret if you, secretly but noticeably, push the envelope of ‘No Gifts’ too hard and things go pear-shaped because, February 17 is ‘Random Act of Kindness’ Day which gives you a fighting chance and some hope to revive that flame. To sum up, this year, for ‘Chaos Over Logic’ Day, be content with the simpler joys. If your lover grows a rose and gifts you the plant, be happy. Or scrambled eggs in bed. Maybe a rendition of your favourite Queen song. Eschew materialism. But in the back of your head also remember that if you don’t get a gift in that iconic Tiffany Blue (although to me it is green) box, then it surely went to someone else.

445,2020/02/07,Indian leopards suffered 75% to 90% population decline: paper,"India’s leopard population may be only a tenth of what it was a little over a century ago, experiencing catastrophic declines due to human pressures. Given the threats the animal faces today–ranging from conflicts with humans, poaching, habitat loss to availability of prey–a group of scientists with new insights on loss of leopard abundance say that an initiative similar to ‘Project Tiger’ is required for the cat.

The leopard population, perceived to be stable due to broad geographic distribution, suffered a possibly human-induced population decline of 75% to 90% between 120 and 200 years ago, the scientists propose, in a research paper titled, ‘Genetic analyses reveal population structure and recent decline in leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) across the Indian subcontinent.’ The research findings were published in the journal PeerJ – Life and Environment on Friday.

Scientists from the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS India) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) used genetic data from leopards from across the Indian subcontinent to investigate population structure and patterns of decline. They investigated the demographic history of each identified sub-population and compared genetic decline analyses with countrywide local extinction probabilities, a press release said.

The study authors argue that the population decline in a species seen as wide-ranging and locally abundant suggest that leopards demand conservation attention just like tigers. “While we are unable to corroborate these population decline patterns with leopard census data, our results suggest that it will be important to generate such ecological abundance estimates for leopard populations in the near future,” they say.

According to the paper, many large carnivores, which maintain the stability and functioning of ecosystems, face declining population sizes due to natural and human pressures. The leopard, probably the most widely distributed and highly adaptable large felid (a member of the cat family) globally, is still persisting in most of its historic range, but there is a lack of sub-species-level population data on country or regional scale.

Authors Supriya Bhatt, Suvankar Biswas, Bivash Pandav and Samrat Mondol from WII, and Krithi K. Karanth from CWS India, collected faecal samples from the Terai-Arc landscape of northern India and identified 56 unique individuals using a panel of 13 microsatellite markers, and merged this data with those of 143 other leopard individuals.

Four sub-populations

They investigated the demographic history of sub-populations and compared genetic decline analyses with countrywide local extinction probabilities. “Our genetic analyses revealed four distinct sub-populations corresponding to Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau-Semi Arid, Shivalik and Terai region of the north Indian landscape, each with high genetic variation. Coalescent simulations with microsatellite loci revealed a possibly human-induced 75% to 90% population decline between 120–200 years ago across India,” the paper contends.

Detailed, landscape-level ecological studies on leopard populations are needed for future conservation efforts, it suggests.

For genetic studies, faecal samples from both tigers and leopards were collected from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from 2016-2018 and 56 of them were identified as distinct individuals.

“The Deccan Plateau-Semi Arid, Shivalik and Terai sub-populations show 90%, 90% and 88% decline in population size, respectively, whereas the Western Ghats sub-population shows relatively less (75%) decline in population size,” the researchers say.

Unlike the tiger census held once in four years, there is no dedicated census for the leopard. However, a leopard count accompanying the tiger census of 2014 estimated its population to be 12,000-14,000 with about 8,000 in the vicinity of tiger habitat.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/j95cmc/article30762222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEOPARD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/scientists-find-75-90-decline-in-leopard-population-in-india/article30762223.ece
446,2020/02/07,Most cities in India turning into “urban heat islands”: study,"A team of researchers from IIT Kharagpur has found that most cities in the country are turning into “urban heat islands” in all seasons during both day and night, officials said.

In their study, researchers from Centre for Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere and Land Sciences (CORAL) of IIT-KGP and its Architecture and Regional Planning department showed that most big cities in the country with a population of more than one million recorded a rise in mercury level during daytime and showed an increasing trend in the night hours.

The study, ‘Anthropogenic forcing exacerbating the urban heat islands in India’, noted that the relatively warmer temperatures in urban areas, compared to the suburbs, have potential health hazards due to heat waves apart from pollution, an IIT-KGP statement said on February 7.

“Our research is a detailed and careful analysis of urban heat islands of India, which is the difference between urban and surrounding rural land surface temperatures, across all seasons in 44 major cities from 2001 to 2017,” Professor Arun Chakraborty, one of the researchers, said.

He further said, “For the first time, we have found evidence of mean daytime temperature of Surface Urban Heat Island (UHI Intensity) going up to 2C for most cities, as analysed from satellite temperature measurements in monsoon and post-monsoon periods.”

In Kolkata, Pune and Guwahati where the urban areas are surrounded by large green cover in suburban regions, there is “an enhanced cooling effect on surface” in suburban areas during daytime as against cities in arid regions, the researchers said.

“Evidence from our study suggests that more green spaces within the city and its boundary could reduce temperature within the city and its neighbourhood,” co-author of the paper Prof. Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath said.

Conservation of water bodies and expansion of green areas in and around cities could be an effective strategy to curb the effects of urban heat islands, he said.

Construction of buildings and infrastructure with eco-friendly materials could also prove to be crucial to mitigate the effects of heat islands, he added.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/iej2j8/article30760170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/URBANHEAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/most-cities-in-india-turning-into-urban-heat-islands-study/article30760171.ece

This is germ warfare. The biggest labs in China are in Wuhan. They are secretly experimenting with different viruses. Oh, so you’re laughing? You won’t think it is funny when you’re dead in bed with something Made in China — and it is not even fake. But really, why would a country start a germ war by first killing off their own people? Don’t argue, it is all political stuff, beyond your understanding. Just forward this one about avoiding all things Made-in-China on your own Made-in-China phones.

Wear your masks both ways. White out if you’re sick, green out if you’re not. Or is it vice versa? Oh, you get blue ones? Send your kid to school with a white mask if he’s sick. Wait, if he’s sick, just don’t send him, right? He’s going to push up that mask and share his friend’s bottle or muffin. Don’t send sick kids, even if you’re sick — of their whining at home. Grow up, Mum and Dad.

3

There is no cure. It lies silently incubating in your blood for four weeks, then shows up, by which time you’re already too sick to cure. So don’t go to hospital. The sickest people are found in hospitals, you will get sicker. Besides, the best cures are found online. Life-saving forwards like this.

4

Cure the most serious virus-infected by this doctor-guaranteed forward. (Quoted doctor may not exist or may deny it, but let that not stop you). Imbibe garlic juice/cow dung/papaya pulp/tea brewed with these 11 ingredients. And you will be cured immediately of the Coronavirus and cancer and any annoying colleagues too — who, after a blast of your garlic-juice breath, will stay far. Natural quarantine thrown in.

5

Don’t travel by air, train, bus — or even walk out — who knows who is waiting to infect you? Don’t breathe. Don’t eat. Don’t touch anything. Someone who fell down an escalator because she refused to touch the handrail ended up with a broken spine — which is better! Avoid eye contact. Stay home, drinking garlic juice till all is safe. Or the next virus comes around.

All you can really do to save yourself is to forward virus forwards on social media as rapidly as possible. Spread the news, fake or flaky; do your bit to spread panic and alarm. Social media forwards, after all, are the fastest spreading virus known today.

448,2020/02/07,Centre persists with ‘toothless’ pharma codes,"Despite several instances of breach of the voluntary Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) by pharma companies, and the demand from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and doctors to make it mandatory, the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), which comes under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, has yet again “requested companies to abide by UCPMP” — in a written communication on February 4 — after the announcement of two more planned events.

In its letter, the Department has noted that it has “received a grievance alleging that pharma companies arrange hotels, accommodation in five star hotels, local sight-seeing, etc. in conferences conducted by doctors. Similar annual national conference of Indian Psychiatric Society 2020 will be conducted in Kolkata and in 2021 at Vishakhapatnam”.

“Pharma associations are requested to make sure that the pharma accompanies adhere to the provisions of UCPMP and no unethical promotion of pharma products be done during the conference,” concludes the letter.

Speaking about the move, health research and member of the All India Drug Action Network Malini Aisola noted that rather than taking steps towards instituting statutory regulation of unethical marketing and promotion, the DoP is still requesting companies to abide by a toothless, unenforceable UCPMP.

“Given that all stakeholders, now including various industry associations, the IMA and doctors bodies, civil society and patients groups are in agreement about bringing in a regulation, we cannot understand why the DoP is refusing to make compliance under the UCPMP compulsory,” she added.

Unethical marketing

Experts working in the area have long demanded that in the context of unethical marketing and promotion, the DoP should immediately implement a mandatory mechanism for company disclosures of payments towards doctors and professional bodies, including via third parties. The disclosures, which should be made at intervals and put in the public domain, should include the amount spent, individual or entity to which payment was made, and the reason for payment, including any services rendered.

The Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare (ADEH) has also demanded this.

“It is unfortunate that even after five years, the code remains voluntary. This is despite the fact that several medical organisations have demanded this repeatedly from the government. The global experience also shows that voluntary code does not work,”’ said ADEH member K.V. Babu.

According to Clause 7.2 of the UCPMP “companies or their associations/ representatives shall not extend any hospitality like hotel accommodation to healthcare practitioners and their family members under any pretext”.

“The implied meaning of this is that even extending benefits to the doctors through associations is unethical. But this is being flouted with impunity,” Mr. Babu added.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ixqzz9/article30755289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THLTPHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/centre-persists-with-toothless-pharma-codes/article30755290.ece
449,2020/02/07,‘Women’s hockey undergoing positive change’,"The Indian women’s hockey team returned from New Zealand with mixed results — two wins and losses each — but the spotlight was on captain Rani Rampal, named Athlete of the Year at the World Games and awarded the Padma Shri during this period. In an exclusive chat with The Hindu, she spoke about the importance of the tour and how awards are more a recognition of the sport itself than any individual achievement. Excerpts:

How important was this tour for the team?

Very important. The team has got a lot of confidence from this tour. We missed a few chances and our defensive structure was a concern early on. We worked on it and the result was visible in the later games. We will now look at all the games and I feel we still need to improve a lot.

We need to try and implement our plans in matches. We also tried some new things and the good thing is that the entire team has been very quick to adjust, adopt and adapt to new plans and structure.

Any specific areas you need to work on?

We need to work on our counter control. We should use our improved fitness for quick counter-attacks but also need to concentrate on counter-control so that when the opposition attempts counters, we are prepared.

How does getting something like the World Games award or the Padma Shri affect a player?

You feel happy that your efforts and struggles have been recognised. There is added responsibility but then, I have always been responsible ever since I made the team. With something like the World Games, it recognises the worth of women’s hockey.

Do you believe it will raise the profile of women’s hockey in India?

Yes. A lot of people supported me through this, including our Sports Minister, which shows they love the sport and people are now supporting women’s hockey also. I don’t think people vote randomly for anyone, they do so only when they can relate to a sport and the sportsperson. I am proud that women’s hockey is undergoing a positive change in the country and I am part of it.",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/2h354x/article30764369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th08rani,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/womens-hockey-undergoing-positive-change/article30764370.ece
450,2020/02/07,FIH Pro League | Confident India face stiff test against world champions Belgium,"They are confident after a stupendous debut at the FIH Pro League but India have their task cut out when they host world champions Belgium in their second round of the tournament, starting in Bhubaneswar on Saturday.

After skipping the first edition of the tournament in 2019, India made a dream debut at the League, collecting five points from the opening tie against the Netherlands.

World number five India thrashed Netherlands 5-2 in the opening match of the two-leg tie before beating the Dutchmen 3-1 in shoot-out after both the teams were locked 3-3 at the end of regulation time in the second match last month.

But since then, the Manpreet Singh-led side has not featured in the league so far, thus slipping to the number five in points table.

Belgium are currently leading the standings with 11 points from four games, while Netherlands are placed second with seven points from as many matches.

Australia are placed third with six points from six points from four games, followed by Germany and India.

But irrespective of the confident start, the Indians are expected to face a tough outing against Belgium at the Kalinga Stadium, a venue where the Red Lions won their maiden FIH World Cup in 2018.

Belgium, who recently replaced Australia in the coveted top position in the world rankings, are brimming with confidence after wins over Australia and New Zealand.

But the visiting team skipper Thomas Briels has no qualms in admitting that they are expecting a tough fight from the hosts India in the upcoming matches.

Briels believes India will be a totally differently opponent, especially after their morale-boosting win over Netherlands.

“India are looking really sharp and they have been playing well which is something we saw in their initial two matches against the Dutch,” Briels had said after arriving here.

“We expect a tough couple of matches, and it’s going to be a good fight for us as well. Of course, we are wary of the threat that they (India) possess, but we are really excited to play a tough opponent like India so we can improve further before the Olympics,” he said.

Even though India are the hosts, Belgium are taking confidence from the fact that the venue Kalinga Stadium has been a happy hunting ground for them.

“It feels really good to be back in the city where we became the world champions. We have some amazing memories of playing here, and it is always a great spectacle when we step foot onto the turf at the Kalinga Hockey Stadium.”

India and Belgium have played 10 times here with the visitors coming out on top on eight occasions while two games ended in draws.

But having said that, the Indians looked a completely transformed outfit against the Dutchmen and if they continue in the same vein, there are no reasons why the hosts can’t upstage Belgium over the weekend.

The FIH Pro League also serves all the major hockey playing nations a vital platform to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics and the Graham Reid-coached Indian team is desperate to make the most of the opportunities.

After Belgium, India will host Australia here on February 21 and 22 before embarking on away matches against Germany (on April 25 and 26), Great Britain (May 2 and 3), Argentina (June 5 and 6) and Spain (June 13 and 14).",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/u5s7ib/article30761912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIANHOCKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/fih-pro-league-confident-india-face-stiff-test-against-world-champions-belgium/article30761913.ece
