5,2020/01/04,ATP Cup | Djokovic survives Anderson test,"Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic kick-started their build-up to the Australian Open with straight-set wins at the ATP Cup on Saturday, but World No. 4 Dominic Thiem slumped to defeat.

Top-ranked Nadal had little trouble with Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili, racing to a 6-3, 7-5 victory, while long-time rival Djokovic was given more of a test by South Africa's Kevin Anderson before overcoming him 7-6(5), 7-6(6).

Their wins ensured Spain and Serbia clinched their ties at the inaugural 24-nation team event, where the countries are split into six groups across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

France, Argentina, Croatia and Japan also began their tournament in style, winning their ties to join day one victors Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Norway, Russia and Australia.

“I'm super, super happy to be here in Perth for first time in my life. It's an amazing arena and a great crowd,” said Nadal. “It was tough first match of the season, not an easy start. But I think I played a great game.”

Earlier, his teammate Roberto Bautista Agut crushed a hapless Aleksandre Metreveli 6-0, 6-0.

Serbian superstar Djokovic needed to produce some of his best tennis to see off the big-serving Anderson, admitting it was a testing encounter.

His teammate Dusan Lajovic outlasted Lloyd Harris 3-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.

Austria's Thiem forecast this week that 2020 would be the year that the vice-like hold of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer on Grand Slam titles would come to an end.

Thiem, who won five titles last year, had six break points in the third set against Croatia's Borna Coric, but failed to convert any of them.

“It's really nice to beat him because at the end of last season I was not playing well and this will give me a lot of confidence,” said Coric, ranked 28 and who suffered six losses in a row in late 2019.

Fellow Croat Marin Cilic, a finalist at the 2018 Australian Open, used his experience to down Austria's Dennis Novak 6-7(4), 6-4, 6-4, and ensure Croatia won the tie in Sydney.

The most dominant win of the day came courtesy of Japan, who are without the injured Kei Nishikori but crushed Uruguay 3-0 in Perth, dropping just 15 games across their two singles and one doubles rubbers.

Yoshihito Nishioka routed higher-ranked Pablo Cuevas 6-0, 6-1 and veteran Go Soeda thrashed Martin Cuevas, Pablo's younger brother, 6-1, 6-3 before a tighter doubles encounter.

French duo Gael Monfils and Benoit Paire, both in the top 25, led their country to a 2-1 Group A win over Chile, while Argentina scraped past Poland by the same score.

But it was a struggle for the South Americans with Polish number one Hubert Hurkacz upsetting world number 14 Diego Schwartzman in three sets.

Guido Pella won the other singles before Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni teamed to down Hurkacz and two-time Grand Slam winner Lukasz Kubot in the deciding doubles.

The results:

In Sydney: Group E: Argentina 2 bt Poland 1 [Guido Pella bt Kamil Majchrzak 6-2, 2-6, 6-2; bt Diego Schwartzman lost to Hubert Hurkacz 4-6, 6-2, 6-3; Maximo Gonzalez & Andres Molteni bt Hurkacz & Lubasz Kubot 6-2, 6-4.

In Brisbane: Group A: France 2 bt Chile 1 [Benoit Paire bt Nicolas Jarry 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-3; Gael Monfils bt Cristian Garin 6-3, 7-5; Nicolas Mahut & Edouard Roger-Vasselin bt Jarry & Garin 7-5, 6-2.

Serbia 3 bt South Africa 0 [Dusan Lajovic bt Lloyd Harris 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-3; Novak Djokovic bt Kevin Anderson 7-6(5), 7-6(6); Nikola Cacic & Viktor Troicki bt Raven Klaasen & Ruan Roelofse 6-3, 6-2.

In Perth: Group B: Japan 3 bt Uruguay 0 [Go Soeda bt Martin Cuevas 6-1, 6-3; Yoshihito Nishioka bt Pablo Cuevas 6-0, 6-1; Toshihide Matsui & Ben McLachlan bt Cuevas & Ariel Behar 7-6(5), 6-4].

Spain 3 bt Georgia 0 [Roberto Bautista Agut bt Aleksandre Metreveli 6-0, 6-0; Rafael Nadal bt Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 7-5; Pablo Carreno Busta & Feliciano Lopez bt Aleksandre Bakshi & George Tsivadze 6-3, 6-4.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/lx22cc/article30480391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05ATP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/atp-cup-djokovic-survives-anderson-test/article30480393.ece

7,2020/01/04,ITF tournament | Ankita Raina gears up for season in Australia,"Ankita Raina is off to Australia, to compete in the $25,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament in Bendigo, and prepare well for the Australian Open in Melbourne.

The country’s No. 1 woman singles player, the 26-year-old Ankita, ranked 180 in singles and 170 in doubles, is keen to lift the profile of Indian tennis.

“I hope in future, we take tennis to the next level the way our badminton players have done,” she said, when contacted.

It may take some doing and a lot of time to match the spread and progress of Indian badminton, but Ankita is focused on her job, to improve upon the last season.

“I am very happy with what I could do last season. I think it has been one of the best years so far, even though winning the Asian Games medal in 2018 was very special. Last year had its own highlights. I think, playing all the four Grand Slams and winning against Grand Slam champion and finalist, Samantha Stosur and Sabine Lisicki is still fresh in my memory,” said Ankita.

She has simple goals for the season.

“The goal this year is to play the main draw of all the four Grand Slams and eventually break into the top 100 in WTA rankings,” she said.

Support team

To that end, Ankita has been able to strengthen her team. Yes, she will have a team for the Australian Open.

“I have a good support team this time at the Australian Open. I am grateful that after all these years of struggle of travelling alone, I can finally travel with my team. Coach Hemant sir and Ketan sir, hitting partner, are travelling with me,” she said.

Hemant Bendrey has been guiding Ankita for many years while Ketan Dhumal will ensure that she is well prepared for her matches.

Even as she is thankful for the support and guidance, Ankita believes that she needs to believe in herself and her game to get to the next level.

She had closed the season nicely in the professional circuit by winning the singles title in the $25,000 event in Solapur.

Staying positive

“Honestly, in the last couple of weeks, I am feeling that it is very close and everything just needs to come together, to click in any of the big events. Now that I have gained all the experience in the pro circuit, I feel one just needs to stay positive regardless of the results and keep working,” she said.

Ankita is understandably elated about Sania Mirza returning to the professional circuit after the birth of her son, and into the Indian Fed Cup team.

“Our chances of qualifying in the Fed Cup this time look very high, considering the doubles will be stronger with Sania’s come back. She comes with the aura. Everyone is inspired by her. So, her presence will give us an added advantage. Last couple of times, it wasn’t easy for us when we were not able to clinch the decider doubles,” Ankita recalled.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/888dwl/article30486983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05ANKITA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/itf-tournament-ankita-raina-gears-up-for-season-in-australia/article30479108.ece
8,2020/01/04,"After Tesla car, Elon Musk could send a ‘Cybertruck’ to Mars","SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again hinted that his company might once again team up to send the latest ‘Cybertruck’ into space and could be headed to the Red Planet.

When Twitter user @C3LT_Games had asked whether Starship would have a Cybertruck on board during the 2022 cargo mission to Mars, Musk wittingly replied with a smiling face with sunglasses emoji.

This is not the first time that Multi-billionaire tech mogul Musk has shown his willingness for the same.

Last month, in another conversation on Twitter, he gave the same signal when a Twitter user asked Musk if the next Falcon Heavy would carry a Cybertruck, to which the Tesla CEO responded “Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity...”

According to Teslarati, the Cybertruck has also been likened to NASA’s Mars Concept Rover unveiled in 2017. If the Cybertruck has been designed to play another role, it is not a far possibility since these electric vehicles can run on Mars as they don’t need oxygen-like internal combustion engines.

In February 2018, SpaceX launched its reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle — Falcon Heavy — for the first time along with a cherry-red Tesla Roadster with a mannequin called ‘Starman’ behind the wheel.

The Cybertruck is inspired by the ‘Lotus Esprit S1’ from the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. The truck will come in three versions, with 250 miles, 300 miles and 500 miles of range respectively.

The base version of the truck will start at $39,900, while the prices for the top-end Tri Motor All-Wheel-Drive version of the Cybertruck start at $69,900.

The most expensive version of the truck, the Tri Motor AWDrive, will be able to carry 3,500 pounds, tow up to 14,000 pounds and go from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds.

It comes with six seats and features armoured glass and ultra-strong panels that are made of the same alloys found on spacecraft.

Additionally, using an adaptive air-suspension system, drivers will also be able to adjust the ride height of the truck, for when they are on the highway or off-road.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/l5wbin/article30477320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04NETCYBERTRUCK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/after-tesla-car-elon-musk-could-send-a-cybertruck-to-mars/article30477321.ece
9,2020/01/04,"Tim Cook took home $125 mn in 2019, less than in 2018","Apple CEO Tim Cook took home $125 million as his pay package in 2019, slightly lower (nearly 8%) than $136 million that he received in total compensation in 2018.

According to an SEC filing, Cook received $3 million as base salary in 2019 but his bonus slid to $7.67 million from $12 million, reports Seeking Alpha.

“Cook’s total pay fell last year as the company failed to top its financial targets by as much as in 2018, but Cook still amassed $125 million in total compensation,” the report said on Friday.

APPLE’s board set less ambitious goals for 2019, lowering its sales target by 3% from 2018 to $256.6 million and its profit target by 15% (YoY) to $60.1 billion.

Cook, 59, earned about $11.56 million in non-equity compensation for 2019 — a 26% decline compared to 2018 when he earned nearly $15.7 million.

“In 2019, Apple’s performance exceeded the target performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a total payout of 128% of the target payout opportunity for each named executive officer,” Apple said in the SEC filing.

Apple shares hit $300 for the first time in late December and closed at $297.43 on Friday.

Apple shares hit a new all-time high of $300 on Thursday, marking significant growth over the course of the last year.

In early January 2019, Apple shares were at $144.

10,2020/01/04,Smartphones may become passe: Li,"Chinese internet search giant Baidu is very much looking forward to working with Indian institutions in the current decade, its co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer Robin Li said.

“India is one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world and it is a very large developing country next to China. Both countries have seen fast growth in the last few decades and over the next decade, there will be more opportunities for us,” he said at IIT Madras’ tech fest, Shaastra 2020.

Mr. Li was speaking on the topic “Innovation in the age of AI.”

He termed the decade, which had just gone by, as an internet economy, while the coming decade will be an ‘intelligent economy’ powered by AI.

Mr. Li also predicted that in the next 10 years, people would be less and less dependent on mobile phones.

“Because, wherever you go, there will be surrounding sensor infrastructure that can answer your question and that can serve you. So, you don’t have to pull out your mobile phone,” he pointed out.

This will be in contrast to the previous decade where people were more dependent on mobile phones for everything right from payments, food delivery, retail to ride-hailing, Mr. Li said.

AI as virtual assistant

He also highlighted various use cases for AI as a virtual assistant across sectors.

“Banks find it difficult to open branches. They can use virtual assistance to help customers open accounts. Even people are more comfortable dealing with virtual person than real person,” Mr. Li said.

AI is transforming banking and insurance, customer services, education and pharma industry, among others, he said.

For instance, Mr. Li said AI can help customers choose a suitable tariff plan in telecom services, which would be difficult for a real person to suggest in quick time. AI is enabling pharma industry accelerate drug development, he said.

According to Mr. Li, AI is also transforming transportation and reducing traffic delays by 20-30% in China and also can help reduce accidents.

It has also helped in finding missing people and already 9,000 missing people had been found, he said.

Mr. Li also pointed out that AI can make one immortal

14,2020/01/04,Missiles hit Green Zone and Iraq base housing US troops: security sources,"Two mortar rounds hit the Iraqi capital's Green Zone Saturday and two rockets slammed into a base housing U.S. troops, security sources said, a day after a deadly American strike.

The precision drone strike outside the Baghdad airport on Friday killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, top Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and a clutch of other Iranian and Iraqi figures.

In Baghdad, mortar rounds on Saturday evening hit the Green Zone, the high-security enclave where the US embassy is based, security sources said.

The Iraqi military said that one projectile hit inside the zone, while another landed close to the enclave.

Sirens rang out at the U.S. compound, sources there told AFP.

A pair of Katyusha rockets then hit the Balad airbase north of Baghdad, where American troops are based, security sources and the Iraqi military said.

Security sources there reported blaring sirens and said surveillance drones were sent above the base to locate the source of the rockets.

The U.S. embassy in Baghdad as well as the 5,200 American troops stationed across the country have faced a spate of rocket attacks in recent months that Washington has blamed on Iran and its allies in Iraq.

One attack last month killed a U.S. contractor working in northern Iraq, prompting retaliatory American air strikes that killed 25 hardline fighters close to Iran.

Facing sustained anger for his handling of the months-long crisis, Mr. Morrison sought to get on the front foot on Saturday, announcing increased military assistance to beleaguered volunteer firefighters.

In a string of media appearances, he vowed every resource would be provided to help ease a disaster that has killed 23 people and burned swathes of the country, announcing more funding for water-bombing planes. But he found himself in fresh scandal late on Saturday after tweeting a video heralding his announcements about the military, and his Liberal Party made a similar post linking to the party website.

17,2020/01/04,Indian-origin MP to bid for Labour leadership,"Indian -origin British MP Lisa Nandy has formally launched her bid to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, urging the party members to “change course” to avoid becoming “irrelevant” in the wake of the party’s worst defeat in over 70 years in the last month’s general election.

In articles written in The Guardian and the Wigan Post, the Ms. Nandy, 40, said she wanted to “bring Labour home” to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.

Ms. Nandy, who served as the Shadow Energy Secretary from 2015 to 2016, said she was “heartbroken” to see so many working class constituencies had chosen the Conservatives over Labour at the last general election.

18,2020/01/04,Lebanon banks close over clients’ demands,"Banks in a region of northern Lebanon were closed until further notice on Saturday, the National News Agency said, after lenders balked at customer anger over a liquidity crisis.

Since September banks have arbitrarily capped the amount of dollars that can be withdrawn or transferred abroad, sparking fury among customers who accuse lenders of holding their money hostage. There is also a limit on Lebanese pound withdrawals.

Clients wanting dollars often have to stand in queues for hours to make withdrawals, only to be told bills have run out once they reach the counter.

On Saturday, all banks in the northern region of Akkar were closed, the NNA said, following a call from the Association of Banks for them to shut their doors “until further notice”.

On Friday, citizens entered a bank branch in the town of Halba to protest about customers being unable to withdraw enough dollars or their salaries in Lebanese pounds in full, NNA reported.

They said they would not leave until a customer — who suffered an unspecified health complaint while waiting — was given a guarantee that he would be paid in full. The 10-hour standoff — which included security forces firing tear-gas inside the building — ended with the man being taken to hospital and management promising to pay him in full.

The Association of Banks the same day called for lenders in the area to close over the incident, which it described as an “attack” and “a threat to the lives and safety of employees”. Unprecedented anti-government protests have gripped Lebanon since October 17, in part to decry a lack of action over the deepening economic crisis.

The Lebanese pound has been pegged to the dollar for more than two decades at 1,507 to the greenback, and both currencies are used in everyday interactions.

But with banks limiting dollar withdrawals, the rate on the unofficial market has topped 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar and the cost of living has increased.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3ymq8c/article30480686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05-LEBANON-PROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-banks-close-over-clients-demands/article30480687.ece
19,2020/01/04,‘No network’ in times of crisis,"Bangladesh shut telecom networks along the border on December 29 apparently to forestall any inflow of undocumented migrants in the aftermath of India’s new citizenship law. Just two days later, regulators reversed the ban, saying the restriction was temporary.

Telecom outage was expected to hit 10 million people living within 1 km of border areas. The worst was soon averted as the ban was quickly lifted, but it illustrates a growing trend of shutting telecom and Internet networks by governments in South Asia and beyond.

“It is impossible to thwart any illegal border crossing by shutting down mobile networks,” said Abu Saeed Khan, a senior policy fellow at LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based ICT policy think-tank. “The movement of human beings across the border is unstoppable unless you erect a wall the way Israel did or whatever Mr. [Donald] Trump is contemplating,” Mr. Khan said. “If a group decides to cross the border, they will cross the border at any cost. There may be a debate on the motivation of such migration, but the fact remains that it’s happening and it will keep on happening.”

Key challenge

Authorities may reduce or stop the flow in some hotspots, but the huge border with India is a key challenge. “If you stop at one place, they will find out another,” Mr. Khan said, referring to a fertile frontier of more than 4,000 km that the two countries share.

With the focus cast on the frontier, Major General Shafeenul Islam, Director General of Border Guard Bangladesh, provided some clarity on illegal border crossings. Bangladesh arrested about 1,000 people for illegal crossings in and out of India in 2019, with 445 of them returning home in two months: November and December, Mr. Islam said at a media briefing in Dhaka on January 2.

After the Upper House of the Indian Parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in December, it sparked fears of illegal crossings into Bangladesh. Mr. Islam, however, did not link the arrests to the fallout of India’s new law. He said those migrant workers, all identified as Bangladesh nationals, crossed into India in search of jobs. Jhenaidah and Satkhira emerged as the two major illicit migratory routes.

Risks of illicit crossings across the frontier deepened after all residents of the State of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors had lived in India since 1971. About 2 million of Assam’s population of 33 million — a mix of Hindus and Muslims — failed the test. They now run the risk of becoming stateless.

As the protests over the new law spread, India shut down the Internet in Assam and some other areas. The Internet shutdown in Kashmir is now the longest-ever imposed in a democracy, according to Access Now, an international advocacy group that tracks internet suspensions.

Mr. Khan calls it counterproductive. “In doing so, India is antagonising its own people. And telecom carriers are losing money,” he said.

The shutdowns of mobile and internet networks have unintended consequences and take a toll on economic life in both urban and rural areas. In Bangladesh, for example, mobile phones are the fastest way for people to transfer money in outlying border areas, where conventional banking is almost non-existent.

That means the network suspension is akin to shutting down a large part of business activity in remote areas. Millions of Bangladeshis living alongside the frontier are largely engaged in cross-border trade of medicines, agricultural commodities, milk and livestock. “More and more society migrates into digital payment systems, the Internet becomes more important simultaneously. It’s like oxygen in life.”

Bangladesh has a history of shutting down or slowing the Internet over security concerns. During a road safety campaign by students in 2018, regulators briefly blocked 3G and 4G mobile Internet services to quell protests, leaving users in the lurch.

“I find no reason to shut down the Internet to thwart civil protests because people communicate despite the shutdown. These are not political decisions, but bureaucratic decisions. The bureaucracy has taken over the politicians’ space and their over-adventurism is the prime driver of this hegemony,” Mr. Khan said.

The regulator’s latest decision to shut the frontier mobile networks and retract it shortly afterwards reflect a lack of coordination between government agencies and weakness of the regulator itself, according to Mr. Khan.

20,2020/01/04,Return of the Green Shirts,"On December 24, when most people in the world’s biggest Catholic country were preparing for the Christmas Eve family dinners and prayers, two men appeared at the office of Porta dos Fundo (Back Door), a well-known production company in Rio de Janeiro that makes content for television and online platforms, and flung a couple of Molotov cocktails at its front door. As the office entrance was blasted away and a blaze erupted inside, the attackers fled on a motorbike. The news of attack on Back Door productions, which currently has been streaming a comedy series on the life of Jesus Christ, spread like wildfire across Brazil. As it was a holiday, the office was closed and nobody was hurt in the attack.

In a country, where popular television shows and top stand-ups routinely make fun of everyone — from football icons to the President and the Pope — the bomb attack on the production company, run by some of the most-celebrated comic writers and actors, in the middle of Christmas holidays jolted Brazil.

As the police investigated the attack, there was more shock in store. On New Year eve, it was revealed that one of the main suspects was the local businessman Eduardo Fauzi who was a member of a group linked with the Brazilian Integralist Front (FIB), an organisation inspired by fascism and with a history of spreading violence, fear and lies. “We are not left or right or centre. We seek good ideas, wherever they come from. We are not interested in the ways of progressivism or liberalism. Nationalism is the only way!!!” says the group’s description on Facebook.

Mr. Fauzi has run away to Moscow and the FIB has distanced itself from the attack, but a fear has gripped the Brazilian streets — the Integralists are back. Integralism emerged in Brazil after the end of the First World War. The far-right movement was founded in 1932 under the name of Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, the party’s logo given in picture) by Plínio Salgado, a journalist who articulated his ideas in a document called the “October Manifesto”. In the 1974 book, Integralismo, Brazilian writer Hélgio Trindade explained how Integralism borrowed its concepts from fascism but tried to be original by claiming to be “spiritualist”. “Their thinking was that the basic principles of fascism must be adapted to the local conditions to create an original political doctrine,” wrote Mr. Trindade in his book.

During the 1930s, when Brazil had a robust communist movement that was becoming increasingly popular among the working class, the AIB cadres — all White — began to hold their meetings and marches in public squares with the message of “God, motherland and family”. From Sao Paulo, the biggest city in the country, to small towns in the north and south, such marches have begun to take place in recent months. Dressed in long-sleeved green shirts with a buttoned collar and cuffs and trousers, the Integralist cadre stand in a military-style formation, wave blue flags with the symbol of sigma, the Greek letter that identifies Integralism, raise their right arm in a Nazi-like salute and shout “God, motherland and family!” after the leaders.

‘Ghosts of our past’

“When I saw them doing a march in downtown Sao Paulo, I was amused and scared at the same time. They looked like clowns but it appeared as ghosts of our past have come back to haunt us,” says Marcos Silva, 22, a university student who was approached by a man in a green shirt to join the group. “I used to think they were history.”

To the young, the Integralists might look like relics of Brazil’s past, but those who follow the country’s history know that the Green Shirts never went away. They were always lurking around, having embedded themselves in the establishment and political parties. Daniel Hunt, a writer and music producer, points out that Miguel Reale, an Integralist leader in the 1930s, was not only involved in the U.S.-backed military coup of 1964 but he also drafted a notorious law, AI-5, which was used to arrest and torture leftist activists during the darkest days of dictatorship that lasted 21 years. “His son Miguel Reale Jr drafted (President) Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment, thus ending 14 years of Workers’ Party rule in the country,” says Mr. Hunt.

It was during Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment that Jair Bolsonaro positioned himself as a potential candidate for President. Today, Mr. Bolsonaro is Brazil’s President. More than a week has gone but his government has so far not condemned the bomb attack in Rio. No wonder, the Integralists are feeling emboldened to march the streets of Brazil.

21,2020/01/04,New law but old problems,"The Pakistan government brought about changes to the country’s accountability law — the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 — through a presidential ordinance promulgated on December 27. Under the new ordinance, the powers of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-corruption watchdog, were curtailed and its jurisdiction limited.

The NAB has been under severe criticism from the Opposition parties ever since the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government came to power in 2018. Both the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) allege that the cases against their members under the NAB law were politically motivated. PML-N leaders, including Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz, have faced action under the NAB. Former President and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, too, was remanded in NAB custody in a corruption case last year.

Both parties had demanded changes in the NAB law.

According to the amendment, the NAB will now take up cases involving corruption exceeding an amount of 500 million Pakistani rupees, and no action will be taken against government employees in case of departmental deficiencies. The watchdog is also barred from confiscating property of any public office holder without approval of the scrutiny committee.

The Opposition parties, however, are critical of the changes, saying the new law was promulgated to benefit the leaders of the ruling party.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said the law was brought into effect bypassing the entire parliamentary legislative process. “The Opposition is clearly the chief stakeholder in this process. The ordinance is not a reform document but is actually tailored to benefit Imran Khan and his cronies.”

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Aurangzeb said not much has changed with the new ordinance. Various provisions such as the remand period, burden of proof resting on the accused, rules on bail, and the trial period remain unchanged. “The observations by the High Courts and the Supreme Court say a lot about the truth regarding these issues but they have not been addressed.”

According to Ms. Aurangzeb, the PML-N started a consultative process for proper reformation of the accountability system in 2016. “But because the PTI had already planned to use the NAB as a tool for political victimisation, it stalled that process.”

Parliament route

The PML-N spokesperson believes that the only logical way to move towards an effective system is to scrap the NAB and formulate a new system of accountability through parliamentary consensus after debate.

“This ordinance benefits only bureaucrats and businessmen; politicians remain the NAB’s target for political coercion, manipulation, and engineering. Prime Minister Imran Khan had said the ordinance would grant insulation to the business community from the scrutiny of the NAB,” she added.

“This ordinance is an NRO for the corruption committed by the PTI,” she said referring to the National Reconciliation Ordinance, which was issued by former dictator General Pervez Musharraf. The NRO, which had granted amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2009.

Senator Quratulain Marri of the PPP said the NAB law was made with the intention to victimise people. “In principle, we are against the NAB law. It’s a black law.”

On the amendments, Senator Marri said the government has now basically realised what President Zardari said a while back — that the economy and the NAB can’t go together because the NAB is harassing people intending to invest in our economy.

The PTI’s Maleeka Bokhari, however, said the criticism of the Opposition lacks merit or substance. “The PTI government inherited the NAB accountability system and other institutions as part of the governance framework of Pakistan. The NAB Ordinance, 1999 was enacted by previous governments and the Chairman of the NAB was appointed by the Leader of House (PML-N) and the Leader of Opposition (PPP).”

Ms. Bokhari told The Hindu that both these Opposition parties also used the NAB as a tool of political victimisation against each other in the past.

“The PTI government came to power with a long-standing commitment towards eradication of deep-rooted corruption,” added Ms. Bokhari.

22,2020/01/04,When Conservatives and Greens join hands,"With the start of 2020, it became clear that a new government was going to come to power in Vienna soon. For the first time in Austria’s history, a coalition formed by the Conservatives and the Greens will rule the country. Elections took place last year after the previous government, consisting of the conservative People’s Party and the far-right Freedom Party, collapsed after a corruption scandal.

Before New Year’s eve, both the People’s Party and the Austrian Green Party agreed to form a new government. According to initial reports, 11 Ministries will go to the Conservatives, while members of the Green Party will take over four departments. In the September election, more than 37% of the electorate voted for the Conservatives, while around 13% voted for the Greens.

It was clear even before the election that the People’s Party’s leader, Sebastian Kurz, was going to become the Chancellor again. The 33-year-old Mr. Kurz, who was the youngest head of government last year, was leading in most opinion polls.

The “Ibizagate”, the corruption scandal that brought down the government, mainly damaged the Freedom Party. The crisis hit the coalition when Heinz Christian-Strache, the then Vice-Chancellor and leader of the Freedom Party, was filmed while offering lucrative government contracts to an alleged Russian oligarch. However, Mr. Kurz played an impressive political game in the aftermath of the scandal. He ended the coalition and sought a fresh mandate. In the September election, the Freedom Party suffered a setback as its vote share fell by 9.8 percentage points to 16.2%.

“Sebastian Kurz is taking over again. In his last term, he normalised the far-right and he even copied large parts of their political programme. I think he is just adapting to everything that might help him keep power. This time, it’s the Green Party,” said Thomas Wurzacher, 27, a teacher from Innsbruck. “Everyone is talking about Greta Thunberg, climate change and all these issues, and he [Kurz] even made it possible to benefit from that,” he underlined.

‘Islamophobic agenda’

“We chose a new path,” Mr. Kurz said on January 2 when he formally announced the coalition. “It was a challenge for both sides, because the differences between the two sides are big.” Werner Kogler, the Greens leader, who will become Vice-Chancellor, added: “We were elected for different things.”

The Conservatives are set to take over key Ministries. Klaudia Tanner, a senior member of the People’s Party, is expected to become the country’s first woman Defence Minister.

The Conservatives will also keep the Department of Integration, which has raised criticism. Rusen Timur Aksak, a spokesman of the Islamic Faith Community, described the decision as a “remarkable sign for the bad gambling of the Greens”, on his social media account. He also hinted that anti-Muslim activists might be happy about the decision.

“During his last term as Chancellor, Kurz pushed an Islamophic agenda. He justified the hijab ban and regularly tried to use Muslim-related topics to fish for right-wing votes. It’s obvious that he will continue doing that,” said Mohammad Shakil, 23, an Austrian Muslim rights activist from Innsbruck.

He pointed out Mr. Kurz’s anti-migrant policies might continue as well. “During his chancellorship, apprentices from Afghanistan and other countries were deported although they had work or school agreements. Who can guarantee that such things will not happen again?” he asked.

According to the coalition agreement, the hijab ban and deportation centres for unsuccessful asylum seekers will continue while the government will introduce a carbon tax on airline tickets and set a target to make Austria carbon neutral by 2040.

The Ministries of Justice, Social Affairs, Culture and Environment will be run by the Greens.

Many European media outlets reacted positively about the new government. According to German conservative daily Die Welt, many people in Germany “dream about what is happening in the neighboring country”. Italian newspaper Il Messagero wrote about a “new chapter” in Austria’s history. “The Greens are leaving their traditional role as an Opposition party and are now moving as a coalition partner of the young and charismatic leader of the People’s Party”, the newspaper wrote.

Meanwhile, Mr. Strache, who left politics and was expelled by his Freedom Party, is planning to make a comeback. He says he still wants to shape Austria’s politics.

23,2020/01/04,"US asked for proportionate response to general’s killing, says Iran","Washington asked Tehran to respond “in proportion” after U.S. forces killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards said.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed Soleimani, the commander of its Quds Force foreign operations arm, had been killed on Friday in a US air strike near Baghdad airport.

After the attack, the Americans “resorted to diplomatic measures... on Friday morning”, Rear-Admiral Ali Fadavi told state television that night.

Also Read Thousands in Baghdad mourn Iranian general killed by U.S.

They “even said that if you want to get revenge, get revenge in proportion to what we did”, he said, quoted on the broadcaster’s website.

Mr. Fadavi did not say how Iran received the message from its arch-enemy, even though Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations for four decades.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in separate television interview on Friday night that “Switzerland’s envoy transmitted a foolish message from the Americans this morning”.

The Swiss official “was summoned in the evening and received a decisive response in writing... to the Americans’ audacious letter,” Mr. Zarif added.

Switzerland’s embassy in Tehran has represented U.S. interests in the Islamic republic since ties were cut in 1980.

But Mr. Fadavi said the United States was not in a position “to determine” Iran’s response.

“The Americans must await severe revenge. This revenge will not be limited to Iran,” he said.

24,2020/01/04,Nawaz Sharif’s blood platelet count remains unstable; soon to undergo cardiac procedure,"Ailing former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif, under treatment in London, will be hospitalised soon for a cardiac procedure as the doctors have failed to determine the real cause for his low blood platelet count, according to a media report.

The 69-year-old PML(N) supremo had left for London on November 19 in an air ambulance to seek medical treatment, a month after he was released on bail from a seven-year prison sentence for corruption.

Mr. Sharif is undergoing treatment of multiple diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD). The CAD is the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to which the heart does not receive the blood it needs, leading to acute chest pain and, in some cases, a fatal heart attack.

Mr. Sharif will be admitted to a hospital in London soon for a heart procedure, The News newspaper quoted a source at the UK’s Royal Brompton Hospital as saying on Friday.

The cardiologists have advised Mr. Sharif that he must have a heart procedure.

Mr. Sharif has been advised that it will be determined within a week whether he will need a heart operation, bypass, or a heart stent, the report said.

For about two months Mr. Sharif has been in London, but the issue of his blood platelets remains unresolved and his blood platelets remain unstable, it said.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Sharif’s personal physician Adnan Khan had said that doctors were going through the whole medical history of the former Prime Minister and have recommended that he requires a cardiac intervention.

Last month, Simon Redwood, a cardiovascular interventionist at the London Bridge Hospital, had said Sharif should be admitted in a hospital for heart procedure.

It is understood that the real cause of low platelet count of Mr. Sharif is still not determined, the report said.

Last week, doctors at the Royal Brompton Hospital told Sharif that his cardiac Positron-emission tomography (PET) scan suggested ischemic myocardium, partial or complete blockage of a coronary artery by a buildup of plaques, and blood supply to heart was deficient which is a risk for heart attack and also a cause of his ongoing angina, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.

Mr. Khan was not available for comment on the report of Mr. Sharif’s possible hospitalisation, the report said.

Mr. Sharif was shifted from jail to the Services hospital in Lahore in October after his health condition deteriorated. Doctors then recommended him to get treatment abroad.

The Pakistan government allowed Mr. Sharif’s travel for medical reasons but put the condition that he submit an indemnity bond as a guarantee that he would return to the country after getting treatment. He, however, rejected the condition and challenged it in courts.

Mr. Sharif was granted bail by the Islamabad High Court on humanitarian grounds in the Al Azizia case and by the Lahore High Court in the ongoing Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, in which he is a suspect.

In November, he was allowed by the Lahore High Court to travel abroad for treatment without any bond.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/au12ym/article30478012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAWAZSHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nawaz-sharifs-blood-platelet-count-remains-unstable-soon-to-undergo-cardiac-procedure/article30478013.ece
25,2020/01/04,Authorities warn Australian bushfires developing their own weather systems,"The bushfires ravaging Australia are generating so much heat that they are creating their own weather systems including dry lighting storms and fire tornadoes.

On Saturday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) warned that a fire on the coast was generating its own weather system 287 km south of Sydney.

“A fire-generated thunderstorm has formed over the Currowan fire on the northern edge of the fire near Nowra. This is a very dangerous situation. Monitor the conditions around you and take appropriate action,” the RFS said on social media.

The weather conditions are the results of the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds. They have been recorded all over the world but as the global climate changes, they may become a more frequent occurrence for Australians, the country's Climate Council said in a 2019 report.

A RFS firefighter was killed on Monday by a fire tornado caused by the collapse of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation that rolled over the fire truck he was in.

Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW RFS commissioner, pointed to that death when asked about the fire-induced weather patterns.

“That extraordinary event resulted in cyclonic-type base flipping over a 10-tonne truck. That is the volatility and danger that exists,” he said.

The pyrocumulonimbus clouds are essentially a thunderstorm that forms from the smoke plume of a fire as intense heat from the fire causes air to rise rapidly, drawing in cooler air, according to information from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

As the cloud climbs and then cools in the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere, the collisions of ice particles in the higher parts of the cloud build up an electrical charge, which can be released as lightning.

These can cause dangerous and unpredictable changes in fire behaviour, making them harder to fight as well as causing lightning strikes that could ignite new fires.

The rising air also spurs intense updrafts that suck in so much air that strong winds develop, causing a fire to burn hotter and spread further.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yh48ca/article30477483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/authorities-warn-australian-bushfires-developing-their-own-weather-systems/article30477484.ece
26,2020/01/04,Iraq crowds mourn Qasem Soleimani’s death,"Tens of thousands of Iraqis, many chanting “Death to America”, on Saturday mourned a top Iranian commander and others killed in a U.S. drone attack that sparked fears of a regional proxy war between Washington and Tehran.

The killing of Iran’s Major General Qassem Soleimani on Friday was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the United States, which pledged to send thousands more troops to the region.

Iraqi political leaders and clerics attended the mass ceremony to honour Soleimani and the other nine victim of the pre-dawn attack on Baghdad international airport.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he had decided to “terminate” Iran’s military mastermind to prevent an “imminent” attack on US diplomats and troops. “We took action last night to stop a war,” he insisted. “We did not take action to start a war.” But a furious Iran has vowed revenge for the killing of Soleimani, the chief architect of its military operations across West Asia. “The response for a military action is a military action,” Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi told CNN, calling the strike an “act of war”. “By whom, by when, where? That is for the future to witness.”

In the hours after the strike, the U.S. reached out to Iran, with which it has had no direct diplomatic ties for decades.

Zarif speaks to Wang

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, who argued that “the dangerous U.S. military operation violates the basic norms of international relations and will aggravate regional tensions and turbulence,” according to Chinese media. The strike killed a total of five Iranian Guards and five members of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, whose members have close ties to Tehran.

Among the dead was the Hashed’s deputy Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was a top adviser and personal friend to Soleimani. Mass ceremonies started in Baghdad on Saturday for the dead, with Iraq’s caretaker Premier Adel Abdel Mahdi and top pro-Iran figures in large crowds accompanying the coffins. They were first brought to a revered Shia shrine in northern Baghdad, where thousands of mourners chanted “Death to America!”

Dressed in black, they waved white Hashed flags and massive portraits of Iranian and Iraqi leaders, furiously calling for “revenge”. The remains were then moved to the shrine city of Karbala and would ultimately end up in Najaf, where the Iraqis will be buried. The Guards’ remains would be flown to Iran, which has declared three days of mourning and religious rituals.

A lethal foe of U.S.

As head of the Guards’ foreign operations arm, the Quds Force, Soleimani was a powerful figure domestically and oversaw Iran's wide-ranging interventions in regional power struggles.

He had long been considered a lethal foe by Washington, with Mr. Trump saying he should have been killed “many years ago”.

Tehran has already named Soleimani’s deputy, Esmail Qaani, to replace him.

His first order of business was made clear on Friday when Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised “severe revenge” for Soleimani’s death.

Iraqis worry the U.S. strike could unleash a new wave of destabilisation for Iraq, which only two years ago announced it had defeated the Islamic State group.

Amid the tensions, the Pentagon said up to 3,500 additional U.S. troops would be dispatched to Iraq’s neighbour Kuwait, to boost some 14,000 reinforcements already deployed to the region last year. About 5,200 U.S. troops are stationed across Iraq to help fight IS.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cg1eow/article30480875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thousands-in-baghdad-mourn-iranian-general-killed-by-us/article30477405.ece
27,2020/01/04,Soleimani contributed to 'terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London': Trump,"United States President Donald Trump on Friday defended the killing of top Iranian commander in a U.S. strike in Baghdad's international airport on Friday, saying the “reign of terror is over” and claiming that Qasem Soleimani had contributed to “terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London.”

Analysis | The importance of Qasem Soleimani

General Soleimani was the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

“The recent attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani,” Mr. Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

“Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today we remember and honour the victims of Soleimani’s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over,” he said.

Mr. Trump alleged that Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilise the Middle East for the last 20 years.

“What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just recently Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than 1,000 innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government,” he said.

Amidst escalation of tension with Iran, Mr. Trump claimed Soleimani’s killing would not lead to war.

“We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change,” Mr. Trump said.

“However, the Iranian regime’s aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilise its neighbours, must end and it must end now. The future belongs to the people of Iran, those who seek peaceful co-existence and cooperation, not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad,” he said.

Mr. Trump said that at his direction, the military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the “number one terrorist” anywhere in the world.

“Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” he said.

“Under my leadership, America’s policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American. We will find you. We will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans and our allies,” he said.

“For years the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force under Soleimani’s leadership has targeted, injured and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen,” he said.

The U.S. has the best military in the world. “We have the best intelligence in the world. If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. And that in particular refers to Iran,” he said.

28,2020/01/04,Hong Kong steps up response to mystery disease from China,"Hong Kong authorities activated a newly created serious response level Saturday as fears spread about a mysterious infectious disease that may have been brought back by visitors to a mainland Chinese city.

Five possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan, an inland city west of Shanghai and about 900 km north of Hong Kong.

The outbreak, which emerged last month, has revived memories of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

The serious response level indicates a moderate impact on Hong Kong’s population of 7.5 million people. It is the second highest in a three-tier system that is part of a new government plan launched Saturday to respond to infectious diseases of unknown cause.

The city’s health department added an additional thermal imaging system at Hong Kong’s airport on Friday to check the body temperature of arriving passengers. More staff have been assigned for temperature checks at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland.

City leader Carrie Lam, on a visit to the train station Friday to review the health surveillance measures, urged any travelers who develop respiratory symptoms to wear surgical masks, seek medical attention and let doctors know where they have been.

The Wuhan health commission said 11 of the 44 people diagnosed with the pneumonia were in critical condition as of Friday. All were being treated in isolation and 121 others who had been in close contact with them were under observation.

Most of the cases have been traced to the South China Seafood City food market in the suburbs of sprawling Wuhan, where offerings reportedly include wild animals that can carry viruses dangerous to humans. The commission said the market has been disinfected.

The most common symptom has been fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections in a small number of cases, the commission said, There have been no clear indications of human-to-human transmission of the disease.

The latest cases in Hong Kong are two women, aged 12 and 41, who had been to Wuhan in the past 14 days but did not appear to have visited the food market, the Hospital Authority said. They were in stable condition and being treated in isolation at Princess Margaret Hospital.

Besides SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, Hong Kong has also been hit by bird flu in 1997 and swine flu in 2009.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7g0ilm/article30477068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HONGKONGCHINAMYSTERYILLNESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-steps-up-response-to-mystery-disease-from-china/article30477069.ece
29,2020/01/04,Europe helps secure release of 11 N.Korean defectors held in Vietnam: activists,"A group of 11 North Koreans who were detained in Vietnam while seeking to defect to South Korea have been released thanks to the help of European institutions, a Seoul-based activist group said on Saturday.

The eight women and three men were caught by border guards in northern Vietnam in late November after crossing from China, and had been held in the northeastern border city of Lang Son.

Peter Jung, who heads the group helping the refugees, Justice for North Korea, said they were freed and on their way to South Korea last month.

Multiple European organisations played a key role, he said. He declined to identify them due to the diplomatic sensitivity but said they included a non-government group.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that U.S. officials, including diplomats engaged in denuclearisation talks with North Korea, intervened to secure the defectors' release, citing unidentified sources.

But Mr. Jung said he was unaware of any U.S. contribution.

South Korea's foreign ministry said the government made immediate efforts to prevent the defectors from being forcibly repatriated, but refused to elaborate.

“The European institutions acted after we published a video of the refugees making desperate appeals for freedom,” Mr. Jung said. “The South's foreign ministry got also involved later.”

Mr. Jung had distributed a video of some of the 11 protesting against deportation before appearing to faint.

About 33,000 North Koreans have resettled in the affluent, democratic South. Most risked their lives to cross the border in a journey that may entail persecution and slave labour, if caught and repatriated.

As living examples of some of Pyongyang's worst abuses, defectors have long been the public face of campaigns to pressure Pyongyang to change its ways.

But South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been criticised by groups like Jung's for not helping defectors enough and ignoring human rights issues as promotes rapprochement with the North.

In November, after brief questioning, South Korea expelled two North Korean fishermen calling them criminals who murdered 16 colleagues before crossing the border into the South.

A coalition of defector groups issued a joint statement criticising the decision, saying the men should have been tried in the South because they would likely face torture, and possibly execution back home.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/66fior/article25016636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th23-South%20Korea%20flag,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/europe-helps-secure-release-of-11-nkorean-defectors-held-in-vietnam-activists/article30477024.ece
30,2020/01/04,"Jakarta floods: death toll rises to 53; nearly 1,75,000 displaced","Nearly 1,75,000 people remain displaced in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta and nearby towns, after flash floods and landslides killed at least 53 people, amid some of the heaviest rain since records began, authorities said on Saturday.

“The death toll has risen to 53 people, with one person missing,” disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.

Data from the disaster mitigation agency showed 1,73,064 residents remain evacuated from their homes on Saturday, after the deadliest flooding in years caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia’s biggest city, with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas.

Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Years Day.

The deluge at the start of 2020 was “one of the most extreme rainfall” events since records began in 1866, the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said on Friday.

The agency said climate change had increased the risk of extreme weather and warned that heavy rainfall could last until mid-February, with Jan. 11-15 an expected peak.

Television footage showed flood waters inundating parts of Jakarta and mud-covered cars, some piled on top of each other.

31,2020/01/04,"One fatally stabbed, three hurt in morning attack in Austin in Texas","A man stabbed two people, one fatally, inside a restaurant during a violent string of attacks Friday at a shopping plaza in Texas’ capital city that began with an assault at a coffee shop and ended with the suspect leaping off a roof, police said.

The attacks on a busy downtown avenue of restaurants and apartments just south of the Texas Capitol terrified customers stopping for their morning coffee on the way to work. It was the city of Austin’s first homicide of 2020.

It began when the alleged attacker, who police only identified as a 27-year-old male, struck a person inside the coffee shop “for no apparent reason,” according to Austin police. He then fled a few doors down to Freebirds World Burrito, where he stabbed two people before escaping to the roof and jumping.

By Friday night, police said the wounded person was in stable but serious condition, and the suspect was in critical condition.

""This guy out of nowhere just hit him in the back of the head with something,” said Stacy Romine (33), who was getting her drink at Bennu Coffee when she saw the attack at a table full of regulars. “People tried to restrain him and stop him from leaving the store after it happened. But he could not be apprehended by three men, including a police officer.”

Authorities said both stabbing victims worked at the restaurant. Emergency responders described the person who died as a man in his 20s.

Last year, Austin relaxed ordinances on public camping, a move that made homelessness more visible downtown. Abbott has previously shared videos that he claims captures the dangers of the new policy, but they include videos criticised as misleading, including one of a man whose attorney later said wasn’t homeless and suffered from mental illness.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Friday night he didn’t know the stabbing suspect’s housing situation but called the governor’s tweet disappointing, saying it suggested that the homeless are dangerous.

""It’s harmful to a community when we demonize a people like that falsely, misleading. There’s a real price,” Mr. Adler said.

Mr. Shringla met Mr. Pompeo during a farewell call on Friday before leaving for New Delhi to take up his next assignment as India’s next foreign secretary, succeeding Vijay Gokhale who will retire later this month.

They discussed further strengthening of the partnership between India and the U.S. building on the excellent progress made in 2019, the Indian Embassy said in a tweet on Friday.

Given the importance Mr. Pompeo attaches to the India-U.S. relationship, he met Mr. Shringla despite a hectic schedule on a day of Iranian crisis following the killing of Iran’s top commander Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.

The move is considered unusual for a U.S. Secretary of State to meet an outgoing envoy from any country.

33,2020/01/04,Rumbling Alaska volcano sends ash plume 5 miles into the air,"One of Alaskas most active volcanoes, a towering ice-covered cone in the Aleutian Islands, shot a cloud of ash more than 5 miles (8 km) high on Friday, triggering a warning to aviators and putting on a show that was captured in satellite imagery.

The ash burst from Shishaldin Volcano, about 670 miles (1,080 km) southwest of Anchorage, was part of an on-and-off, mostly low-level series of eruptions that began in July with a stream of lava from the crater at the peak of the 9,373-foot-tall (2,869-meter) mountain.

The ash plume was spotted by a pilot and was visible in satellite images captured from space. It drifted over the sea at least 75 miles (120 km) southeast of the volcano, the Alaska Volcano Observatory reported.

No communities were affected by ashfall or were otherwise in danger as of Friday morning, said David Fee of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, a coordinating scientist with the observatory.

“This is a remote volcano,” he said.

The National Weather Service issued an alert, and air traffic was advised to steer clear of Shishaldin, though aviators were already avoiding the volcano well before Friday because of earlier activity, Mr. Fee said.

While Fridays cloud, the largest yet of the series, was considered moderate, conditions at Shishaldin could worsen quickly.

Shishadin remains at a heightened level of unrest, and explosions may occur with little warning, the observatory warned in a public statement. Friday's explosion lasted about an hour to 90 minutes, U.S. Geological Survey scientist Matt Haney said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hisid7/article30476653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ALASKA-VOLCANO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rumbling-alaska-volcano-sends-ash-plume-5-miles-into-the-air/article30476654.ece
34,2020/01/04,How Ex-Nissan chief jumped $14 million bail to escape to Lebanon,"Charter flights that spirited ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn from Japan to Istanbul and from there to Beirut, security camera footage reportedly showing he simply walked out of his Tokyo home: details emerged on Friday of the bizarre path to freedom that allowed Ghosn to jump $14 million bail, seemingly under the noses of Japanese authorities, and evade charges of financial misconduct that could carry a jail sentence of up to 15 years.

The improbable weekend escape has confounded and embarrassed Japanese authorities, even setting off wild speculation that Ghosn was carted off inside a musical instrument case from his home, which was under 24-hour surveillance.

But on Friday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV cited investigative sources as saying security footage showed he simply walked out of the house alone around noon on Sunday. Details also emerged about the route the fallen auto industry executive took to Lebanon, where he grew up and is considered something of a national hero.

Turkish airline company MNG Jet said that two of its planes were used illegally in Ghosn’s escape, first flying him from Osaka, Japan, to Istanbul, and then on to Beirut, where he arrived Monday and has not been seen since.

It said a company employee had admitted to falsifying flight records so that Ghosn’s name did not appear on them, adding that he acted “in his individual capacity” without MNG Jet’s knowledge.

The company said it launched an investigation after learning from media reports that the planes were for Ghosn and not the officially declared passengers.

“The two leases were seemingly not connected to each other. The name of Mr. Ghosn did not appear in the official documentation of any of the flights,” the company said in a statement. It did not say who the jets were leased to or identify the employee it said aided Ghosn’s escape.

Lebanese authorities have said Ghosn entered the country legally on a French passport, though he had been required to surrender all three of his passports to his lawyers under terms of his bail. He also has Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship.

Interpol issued a wanted notice on Thursday for Ghosn, but Japan has no extradition treaty with Lebanon and it appeared unlikely he would be handed over.

The plane carrying Ghosn landed at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, which is closed to commercial flights and used only for cargo and private flights, the Interior Ministry said. “A transfer occurred in the cargo section,” of the airport, spokesperson Ismail Catakli said. “In this way, Turkey was used as a transit point.”

A cargo company employee was aboard the flight to Beirut and immediately returned to Istanbul aboard the same jet, Turkey’s Hurriyet newspaper said. The employee was one of seven people detained by Turkish authorities investigating how Ghosn passed through Turkey. Two were released Friday while the five others were ordered arrested, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.

Lebanese Justice Minister Albert Serhan told in an interview that Lebanon “will carry out its duties,” suggesting for the first time that the automotive titan may be brought in for questioning. But he added that Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport and appeared to cast doubt on the possibility Lebanon would hand Ghosn over to Japan.

On Thursday, Ghosn issued a statement - his second this week - seeking to distance his Lebanese wife and family from any role in his escape.

""The allegations in the media that my wife Carole and other members of my family played a role in my departure from Japan are false and misleading. I alone organized my departure. My family played no role,” he said.

Ghosn was set to go on trial in Japan in April. In a statement Tuesday, he said he fled to avoid “political persecution” by a “rigged Japanese justice system.” He has promised to speak with reporters next week.

Ghosn, who grew up in Beirut and frequently visited, has close ties to senior politicians and business stakes in a number of companies in Lebanon. People take special pride in the auto industry executive, who is credited with leading a spectacular turnaround at Nissan beginning in the late 1990s and rescuing the automaker from near bankruptcy.

Ghosn, who is charged in Japan with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust, has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up charges to prevent a possible fuller merger between Nissan Motor Co. and Renault.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y5uomm/article30476578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1141426876THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/how-ex-nissan-chief-jumped-14-million-bail-to-escape-to-lebanon/article30476583.ece
35,2020/01/04,"Ten dead in Cambodia building collapse, more trapped","At least 10 people were killed and 23 injured after a building in Cambodia collapsed, trapping workers under rubble, officials said on Saturday.

The seven-storey concrete building collapsed on Friday in the coastal town of Kep, about 160 km southwest of the capital Phnom Penh.

It came a year after another construction site collapsed, killing 28 people in Preah Sihanouk province.

“There are five dead that we have already pulled out and there are other five people dead that we saw and we haven't been able to pull out from the collapsed building yet,” Kep governor Ken Satha told Reuters.

An unknown number of workers remained trapped, Mr. Satha said, adding that authorities had detained a Cambodian couple, the owners of the building, for questioning.

The couple had intended to build a guesthouse, Mr. Satha said.

Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Saturday that rescuers were still struggling to reach those missing in the rubble.

36,2020/01/04,Australian PM calls up reservists as fire threats escalate,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called up about 3,000 reservists as the threat of wildfires escalated Saturday in at least three states.

Mr. Morrison says, “In recent times, particularly over the course of the balance of this week, we have seen this disaster escalate to an entirely new level.”

Mr. Morrison also confirmed that his scheduled visits to India and Japan later this month have been postponed. He was due to visit India from Jan. 13-16 and Japan immediately afterwards.

Two people died on Saturday as Australia braced for one of the worst days in its wildfire crisis, with strong winds and high temperatures forecast to bring flames to more populated areas, including the suburbs of Sydney.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state is facing “another terrible day” and called on people in areas threatened by the fires to leave while they can.

“I’m pleased to say that we’ve never been as prepared as we are today for the onslaught we’re likely to face,” Ms. Berejiklian told reporters at a news conference Saturday morning. “All of the major road networks are still open but we can’t guarantee that beyond the next few hours. So there are still windows for people to get out.”

Two people were confirmed dead in a blaze on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, bringing the overall nationwide death toll this summer to at least 21.

The fire broke containment lines Friday and was described as “virtually unstoppable” as it destroyed buildings and burned through more than 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of Flinders Chase National Park. While the warning level for the fire was reduced Saturday, the Country Fire Service said it was still a risk to lives and property.

New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers warned the fires could move “frighteningly quick.” Embers carried by the wind had the potential to spark new fires or enlarge existing blazes.

“We are unfortunately very likely to lose homes but we will be very happy and call it a success if no lives are lost,” he said.

Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fizsimmons said the 264,000-hectare (652,000-acre) Green Wattle Creek fire in a national park west of Sydney had the potential to spread into Sydney’s western suburbs.

“There is potential for the fire to break out, cross the (Warragamba) dam and move into the western suburbs of Sydney,” he said. “That fire is burning. It has the potential to come out into more populated areas this afternoon.”

Fitzsimmons called on residents and tourists in the path of the fires to evacuate as soon as possible.

“Our message has been to make sure you leave yesterday,” he said. “Leaving it until today is cutting it fine. The sooner you make that decision the better and I would say do it now. Don’t leave it any longer because the window will shrink and will shrink very quickly.”

More than 130 fires are burning in New South Wales and at least half of those are out of control. Temperatures in parts of the state are expected to soar in the mid-40s Celsius (about 113 Fahrenheit) amid strong winds and low humidity.

A total of 48 fires were burning across almost 320,000 hectares (791,000 acres) in Victoria state and conditions are expected to worsen with a southerly wind change.

“We still have those dynamic and dangerous conditions, the low humidity, the strong winds and, what underpins that, the state is tinder dry,” Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.

Thousands have already fled fire-threatened areas in Victoria and Crisp urged more people to leave.

“If you might be thinking about I can get out on a particular road close to you, well there’s every chance that a fire could hit that particular road and you can’t get out,” he said.

Victoria police reported heavy traffic flows on major roads and praised motorists for their patient and orderly behavior.

The early and devastating start to Australia’s summer wildfires has already burned about 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land and destroyed more than 1,400 homes.

37,2020/01/04,"Methodists propose split in gay marriage, clergy impasse","United Methodist Church leaders from around the world and across ideological divides unveiled a plan Friday for a new conservative denomination that would split from the church in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute over gay marriage and gay clergy.

The proposal, called ‘A Protocol of Reconciliation & Grace Through Separation’, envisions an amicable separation in which conservative churches forming a new denomination would retain their assets. The new denomination also would receive $25 million.

The proposal was signed in December by a 16-member panel, who worked with a mediator and began meeting in October. The panel was formed after it became clear the impasse over LGBTQ issues was irreconcilable. The next step could come at the church’s General Conference in May.

Methodist Bishop Karen Oliveto, the denomination’s first openly gay bishop, said the United Methodist Church leadership “was clearly at a point in which we couldn’t agree to disagree” over same-sex relationships.

“I’m actually really sad that we couldn’t build a bridge that could have provided a witness to the world of what unity amid diversity and disagreement could look like,” she said.

Oliveto was challenged by the denomination’s highest court, the Judicial Council, in 2017 when it declared that the bishop’s consecration “was incompatible with church law.”

However, Oliveto was allowed to remain as the resident bishop of the Mountain Sky Conference, which includes United Methodist churches in Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and a section of Idaho. Asked what a post-separation world looks like for the church to move forward, Oliveto said, “We are no longer using LGBTQ people as scapegoats.”

Backstory

Members of the 13-million-person denomination have been at odds for years over the issue, with members in the United States leading the call for full inclusion for LGBTQ people.

The rift widened last year when delegates meeting in St. Louis voted 438-384 for a proposal called the Traditional Plan, which affirmed bans on LGBTQ-inclusive practices. A majority of U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan but were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.

Methodists in favour of allowing gay clergy and gay marriage vowed to continue fighting. Meanwhile the Wesleyan Covenant Association, representing traditional Methodist practice, had already been preparing for a possible separation.

Concern over the future of the church pushed members, led by Bishop John Yambasu of Sierra Leone, to convene a group to share ideas across the theological spectrum.

New York Bishop Thomas Bickerton said that turned into the final panel, made up of moderates, progressives and traditionalists from Africa, Europe, the Philippines and the United States.

Bickerton, who heads 438 Methodist churches in New York, said while he thinks it is an amicable solution, “there is a degree of heartbreak within me because I never thought we would reach this point. However, we are at this point. The differences are irreconcilable. This is inevitable.” .

The Rev. Keith Boyette, president of the Wesleyan Covenant Association and one of 16 people on the mediation team that developed and signed the separation proposal, said he is “very hopeful” the plan will be approved.

This is the first time that “respected leaders of groups from every constituency” have come together to form a plan, he said. “And this is the first time that bishops of the church have signed on to an agreement like this.”

While other mainline Protestant denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the United Methodist Church has not, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBTQ clergy have multiplied. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit.

Texas Bishop Scott J. Jones praised the panel for its contribution to the ongoing discussions about human sexuality but “it should be emphasised that a statement by 16 leaders does not necessarily mean that its provisions will be adopted.”

“The Protocol itself says it was developed in service to the General Conference delegates who will decide on its adoption or amendment. Other plans may well be considered as alternatives,” he said in a statement. “Significant questions remain to be answered about the Protocol’s implementation. The Judicial Council will need to rule on its constitutionality. The feasibility of its financial provisions must also be evaluated.”

Bickerton said it is unclear how many members will be lost if the proposal moves forward. “I am sure we will lose a certain percentage. We anticipate that,” he said. “It’s time for us to get back to the ministry and mission of the church.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cu2nag/article30476481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKMETHODISTSLESBIANBISHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/methodists-propose-split-in-gay-marriage-clergy-impasse/article30476482.ece
38,2020/01/04,Climate strike but no cake for Greta Thunberg as she turns 17,"“I'm not the kind of person who celebrates birthdays,” Greta Thunberg said as she turned 17 on Friday, marking the occasion in inimitable style — with a seven-hour protest outside the Swedish parliament.

The climate activist braved winter conditions in her native Stockholm to continue the weekly ‘Friday School Strike for the Climate’ campaign that helped catapult her to international fame.

“I stand here striking from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m. as usual... then I'll go home,” Ms. Thunberg, Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, told Reuters. “I won't have a birthday cake but we'll have a dinner.”

It's been a busy 12 months for Ms. Thunberg, who criss-crossed the globe by car, train and boat — but not plane — to demand action on climate change.

Mr. Khan shared the video on his Twitter handle claiming that it was of police violence targeting Muslims in UP. He captioned it — “Indian police’s pogrom against Muslims in UP”.

Twitterati soon called out the Pakistan Prime Minister for tweeting fake news to target India. Later, the tweeted videos were deleted from his account.

40,2020/01/04,Gurdwara Nankana Sahib ‘untouched and undamaged’: Pakistan govt,"Pakistan on Friday rejected reports that Gurdwara Nanakana Sahib near Lahore was desecrated by certain groups.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as the Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is the site where the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born. It is regarded as one of the holiest Sikh sites.

Foreign Office in a midnight statement said the provincial authorities in the Punjab province have informed that there was a scuffle in the city of Nankana Sahib on Friday between two Muslim groups.

The altercation happened on a minor incident at a tea-stall and the District Administration immediately intervened and arrested the accused.

“Attempts to paint this incident as a communal issue are patently motivated. Most importantly, the Gurdwara remains untouched and undamaged. All insinuations to the contrary, particularly the claims of acts of ‘desecration and destruction’ and desecration of the holy place, are not only false but also mischievous, said the FO.

It said the Government of Pakistan was committed to upholding law and order and providing security and protection to the people, especially the minorities.

The opening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor is a manifestation of Pakistan’s special care extended to the minorities, in line with the vision of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it said.

According to some Indian media reports, a mob attack took place at the shrine. The reports suggested that hundreds of angry residents at Nankana Sahib pelted the Sikh pilgrims with stones on Friday.

India’s External Affairs Ministry said members of the minority Sikh community in Pakistan have been subjected to acts of violence at the holy city of Nankana Sahib.

“India strongly condemns these wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place. We call upon the government of Pakistan to take immediate steps to ensure safety, security, and welfare of the members of the Sikh community,” the MEA said in a statement.

“Strong action must be taken against the miscreants who indulged in desecration of the holy Gurdwara and attacked members of the minority Sikh community,” it said.

The MEA said the reprehensible actions followed the forcible abduction and conversion of a Sikh girl who was kidnapped from her home in the city of Nankana Sahib in August last year.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) also expressed concern over reports of the mob attack on the Nankana Sahib gurdwara.

In a tweet, Mr. Singh appealed to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure that the devotees stranded at the gurdwara are rescued from the mob.

41,2020/01/04,"U.S. Democratic contenders condemn Iran strike, warn of war","Democratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trump's decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East.

“President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,” said former Vice President Joe Biden. His campaign released a 30-second online ad that portrayed Mr. Biden as “tested and trusted around the world” against Mr. Trump's “erratic, unstable” presidency.

“We're on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East,” said liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. “We're not here by accident. We're here because a reckless president, his allies and his administration have spent years pushing us here.”

The overnight killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran, was a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies.

A protracted conflict could reshape an election that has so far been dominated by domestic issues, such as healthcare and money in politics, strategists said. While that could be a plus for the leading Democratic candidates such as Mr. Biden, who has stressed his foreign policy experience and credentials, lesser-known contenders could have a harder time being heard.

“The ultimate beneficiary in the Democratic race could be the four candidates in front,” said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf, referring to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

“Nobody behind them will have a chance to reset the race or change things,” said Elmendorf, a Mr. Buttigieg supporter who served as chief of staff for former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.

The Democratic contenders are set to face voters for the first time in a month, when Iowa kicks off the state-by-state nominating battle on Feb. 3.

Public opinion polls show Americans in general are opposed to U.S. military interventions overseas. A survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found only 27% of Americans believe military interventions make the United States safer, and nearly half said they make the country less safe.

“There are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences,” said Mr. Buttigieg, a former Navy Reserve officer who served in Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump said the strike aimed to disrupt “imminent and sinister attacks” on Americans. His fellow Republicans praised the president for restoring American strength and leadership.

“At a time when the president is under impeachment by the Democrats, there's nothing wrong with him showing strength and resolve in the face of a foreign threat,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who is close to the White House.

While the Democrats were united in condemning Mr. Trump's decision, there were some distinctions in their responses. Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg indicated they viewed Soleimani as a security threat who had sowed chaos in the region, whereas Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren referred to him more neutrally and called his killing an ”assassination.”

Mr. Sanders, who has consistently opposed U.S. military intervention overseas, contrasted the strike with his own domestic priorities of universal healthcare, improved infrastructure and steps to combat climate change.

“We must invest in the needs of the American people, not spend trillions more on endless wars,” Mr. Sanders said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa.

Mr. Sanders also mentioned his 2002 vote against authorizing war in Iraq, which he frequently uses as a contrast to Mr. Biden, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who backed the war.

Tulsi Gabbard, a House member and Army National Guard veteran of the Iraq war who also has opposed U.S. military interventions, said the strike showed “we need to get out of Iraq and Syria now.”

“That is the only way that we're going to prevent ourselves from being dragged into this quagmire, deeper and deeper into a war with Iran,” she wrote on Twitter, using the hashtag #WWIII.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qr3ncn/article30475774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-democratic-contenders-condemn-iran-strike-warn-of-war/article30475775.ece
42,2020/01/04,Iraq official says air strike targets Iran-backed militia,"An Iraqi official says an air strike has hit two cars carrying Iran-backed militia north of Baghdad, one day after U.S. attack on top Iranian general Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The official said five members of the militia were killed. The official said the identity of those killed was not immediately known. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

Analysis | The importance of Qasem Soleimani

Iran promised to seek revenge for a U.S. air strike near Baghdad’s airport that killed the mastermind of its interventions across the Middle East, and the U.S. said Friday it was sending thousands more troops to the region as tensions soared in the wake of the targeted killing.

The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, marks a major escalation in the stand off between Washington and Iran, which has careened from one crisis to another since President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions.

Also read: Who was General Qasem Soleimani and why was he so popular?

The targeted strike, and any retaliation by Iran, could ignite a conflict that engulfs the whole region, endangering U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Over the last two decades, Soleimani had assembled a network of heavily armed allies stretching all the way to southern Lebanon, on Israel’s doorstep.

""We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over,” Mr. Trump said of Soleimani.

Still, the United States said it was sending nearly 3,000 more Army troops to the Middle East, reflecting concern about potential Iranian retaliation for the killing. The U.S. also urged American citizens to leave Iraq “immediately” following the early morning airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport that Iran’s state TV said killed Soleimani and nine others. The State Department said the embassy in Baghdad, which was attacked by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters earlier this week, is closed and all consular services have been suspended.

More troops sent in

Around 5,200 American troops are based in Iraq to train Iraqi forces and help in the fight against Islamic State group militants. Defense officials who discussed the new troop movements spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet announced by the Pentagon. A Pentagon official who was not authorized to be identified said the U.S. also had placed an Army brigade on alert to fly into Lebanon to protect the American Embassy. U.S. embassies also issued a security alert for Americans in Bahrain, Kuwait and Nigeria.

The U.S. announcement about sending more troops came as Mr. Trump said Soleimani’s killing was not an effort to begin a conflict with Iran. “We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he does not seek regime change in Iran.

Reactions pour in

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “harsh retaliation” after the air strike, calling Soleimani the “international face of resistance.” Khamenei declared three days of public mourning and appointed Maj. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, Soleimani’s deputy, to replace him as head of the Quds Force.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the killing a “heinous crime” and said his country would “take revenge.” Iran twice summoned the Swiss envoy, the first time delivering a letter to pass onto Washington.

Iranian Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the U.S. attack a “cowardly terrorist action” and said Iran has the right to respond “in any method and any time.”

Thousands in Tehran took to the streets after Friday prayers to condemn the killing, waving posters of Soleimani and chanting “Death to deceitful America.”

The killing promised to further strain relations with Iraq’s government, which is allied with both Washington and Tehran and has been deeply worried about becoming a battleground in their rivalry. Iraqi politicians close to Iran called for the country to order U.S. forces out.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y47uou/article30475939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PICTURESOFTHEWEEKPHOTOGALLERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraq-official-says-air-strike-targets-iran-backed-militia/article30475940.ece
43,2020/01/04,Flights suspended in Libya’s capital as violence intensifies,"Flights were suspended at the only functioning airport in Libya’s capital Tripoli on Friday because of rocket fire and shelling, as people in eastern Libya protested Turkish military support for their rivals.

Turkey’s parliament voted on Thursday to allow troops to be sent to support the internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, deepening fears of more fighting, though analysts and officials said Ankara was unlikely to immediately put boots on the ground.

The GNA has sought Turkey’s support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar’s forces, which control the east and swept through southern Libya in early 2019.

Mr. Haftar’s forces said they had carried out air strikes in several places on Friday, including south of the city of Sirte and in Tripoli. Sirte lies in the centre of Libya’s coastline, on the dividing line between the warring factions.

An increase in air strikes and shelling in and around Tripoli has caused the deaths of at least 11 civilians since early December and shut down health facilities and schools, the U.N. mission in Libya said.

Mr. Haftar’s Tripoli offensive quickly stalled in the outskirts of the city, but led to increased international involvement in the conflict. Turkey has backed the GNA while Mr. Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.

Russian military contractors have also been deployed with Mr. Haftar’s Libyan National Army for several months, diplomats and analysts said.

There were protests in several cities and towns in eastern Libya against the Turkish parliament’s decision.

In Benghazi, where about 3,000 people took to the streets, protesters said they had turned out to oppose a Turkish ”invasion” of Libya, which was part of the Ottoman Empire before coming under Italian occupation.

Mr. Haftar later gave a televised speech in which he announced a ”call to arms and mass mobilisation ... to defend our land and our honour”.

Three subsidiaries of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) which operate in areas under Mr. Haftar’s control - Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, Sirte Oil Co and Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) - said they would boycott Turkish companies.

An engineer from Ras Lanuf said one Turkish company had been doing contracting work at Ras Lanuf port since 2017. It was unclear what immediate impact the companies’ statements would have.

Mitiga airport has been repeatedly closed and reopened in recent years because of risks from shelling and air strikes, reopening most recently on Dec. 12 after a closure of nearly 3-1/2 months. It closed early on Friday because of rocket fire nearby, reopened briefly and then shut again because of shelling, airport and airline officials said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jj0zib/article30475698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LIBYA-TURKEY-POLITICS-CONFLICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/flights-suspended-in-libyas-capital-as-violence-intensifies/article30475699.ece
44,2020/01/04,U.S. government limits exports of artificial intelligence software,"The Trump administration took measures on Friday to crimp exports of artificial intelligence software as part of a bid to keep sensitive technologies out of the hands of rival powers like China.

Under a new rule which goes into effect on Monday, companies that export certain types of geospatial imagery software from the United States must apply for a license to send it overseas except when it is being shipped to Canada.

“They want to keep American companies from helping the Chinese make better AI products that can help their military,” said James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.

The rule will likely be welcomed by industry, Mr. Lewis said, because it had feared a much broader crackdown on exports of most artificial intelligence hardware and software

The measure covers software that could be used by sensors, drones, and satellites to automate the process of identifying targets for both military and civilian ends, Mr. Lewis said, noting it was a boon for industry, which feared a much broader crackdown on exports of AI hardware and software.

The measure is the first to be finalized by the Commerce Department under a mandate from a 2018 law, which tasked the agency with writing rules to boost oversight of exports of sensitive technology to adversaries like China, for economic and security reasons.

That the agency was finalizing a set of narrow rules to limit such exports in a boon to U.S. industry that feared a much tougher crackdown on sales abroad.

The rule will go into effect in the United States alone, but U.S. authorities could later submit it to international bodies to try to create a level playing field globally.

It comes amid growing frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the slow roll-out of rules toughening up export controls, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, urging the Commerce Department to speed up the process.

“While the government believes that it is in the national security interests of the United States to immediately implement these controls, it also wants to provide the interested public with an opportunity to comment on the control of new items,” the rule release said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-government-limits-exports-of-artificial-intelligence-software/article30475360.ece
45,2020/01/04,U.S. deportations of Guatemalans doubled over past decade,"U.S. President Donald Trump's administration stepped up deportations of Guatemalans in 2019, doubling the number of migrants sent back from the United States a decade earlier, data from the Central American country showed on Friday.

Mr. Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a major policy focus and has continued to press the issue in the run-up to the November U.S. presidential election.

Last year, the United States deported 54,547 people to Guatemala on 486 flights, the highest since at least 2007, according to data from the Guatemalan Institute of Migration. In 2009, the year Mr. Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama took office, there were 27,222 deportations.

“We associate the increase with migration policies of the United States,” Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan Institute of Migration, told Reuters. She said she expected 2020 to follow a similar pattern.

There were more than 400,000 deportations to Guatemala during the decade through 2019, the institute's data show.

Deportations increased steadily in the first half-dozen year's of Mr. Obama's two terms as president, peaking at 51,157 in 2014, and then fell sharply the following year.

In 2017, the year Mr. Trump took office, 32,833 Guatemalans were deported from the United States. The next year deportations increased to 51,376.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said deportations were one of several steps the Trump administration was taking “to address the crisis” on the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We will make every effort to reduce illegal immigration to the United States,” the official said.

In July, the Trump administration brokered an agreement with the Guatemalan government, allowing U.S. immigration officials to send migrants requesting asylum at the U.S.-Mexican border to apply for asylum in Guatemala instead.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary, Ken Cuccinelli, said the agreement could also apply to Mexicans and other nationalities.

Under the program, 40 asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras have so far been sent to Guatemala.

Most of the people caught trying to enter the United States illegally come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

As of 2017, an estimated 1.4 million people of Guatemalan origin were living in the United States, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/spvkfe/article30475293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GUATEMALA-US-MIGRATION-DEPORTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-deportations-of-guatemalans-doubled-over-past-decade/article30475236.ece
46,2020/01/04,Southeast Australia faces another dangerous day for bushfires,"Australian firefighters were set for a dangerous day on Saturday as fires in New South Wales and Victoria states were expected to burn uncontrollably due to temperatures above 40C (104F) and shifting, strong winds that will fan and spread the flames.

Authorities have said conditions could be worse than on Tuesday, when out-of-control fires forced thousands of residents and summer holidaymakers to seek refuge on beaches as the flames burnt massive tracts of bushland.

“It's going to be a long and difficult day for everybody,” NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters.

More than 100 fires were burning in NSW on Saturday and more than half were not contained, Fitzsimmons said, adding winds that will shift throughout the day will spread the blazes.

“We know the fires we've got already ... but what we need to be vigilant about today as well is the prospect of any new fires that might start under these hot, dry, windy conditions,” he said.

In Victoria, where a state of disaster has been declared, there were evacuation recommendations for six fires, emergency warnings for another six, and dozens of others still burning.

There have been 10 deaths from the fires in NSW and Victoria so far this week, about half the total toll for the current fire season, and authorities have said the focus on Saturday is preventing more loss of life.

To that end, national parks have been closed and people strongly urged earlier this week to evacuate large parts of NSW's south coast and Victoria's north eastern regions.

“Today is all about saving lives,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, who has declared a week-long state of emergency.

“All of the major road networks in NSW are still open, but we can't guarantee that beyond the next few hours. So, there are still windows for people it get out if they wish to do so.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/um52sf/article30475197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXAUSTRALIAWILDFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/southeast-australia-faces-another-dangerous-day-for-bushfires/article30475198.ece
47,2020/01/04,"Ghosn used our jets illegally in escape from Japan, Turkish company says","A Turkish private jet operator said on Friday that ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents.

MNG Jet said it had filed a criminal complaint over the incident, a day after Turkish police detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Mr. Ghosn's passage through Istanbul en route to Lebanon.

Mr. Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ”rigged” justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes.

Lebanon on Thursday received an Interpol arrest warrant for Mr. Ghosn, whose surprise escape from his home in Tokyo to a separate home in Beirut has not been fully explained.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the diminutive Ghosn slipped out of Japan aboard a private jet hidden in a large black case typically used to carry audio gear. He was accompanied by a pair of men with names matching those of American security contractors, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with Turkey's probe into the escape.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing investigative sources, said a surveillance camera captured the former Nissan Motor Co chairman leaving his Tokyo residence alone shortly before his escape.

The security footage was taken by a camera installed at his house in central Tokyo around noon on Sunday, and the camera did not show him returning home, NHK said.

By early Monday, he had touched down in Istanbul.

MNG Jet said in its statement it leased two jets to two different clients in agreements that “were seemingly not connected to each other.” One plane flew from Osaka to Istanbul, the other from Istanbul to Beirut.

“The name of Mr. Ghosn did not appear in the official documentation of any of the flights,” it said.

“After having learnt through the media that the leasing was benefiting Mr. Ghosn and not the officially declared passengers, MNG Jet launched an internal inquiry and filed a criminal complaint in Turkey,” it added.

An employee admitted to falsifying the records and confirmed he “acted in his individual capacity,” the company said.

The pilots and other detainees, including two airport ground staff and one cargo worker, were sent to court on Friday after giving statements to police, according to a Reuters witness.

Late on Friday the court ruled to formally arrest five of the suspects, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported. The other two suspects were released from custody, according to media reports.

Turkish interior ministry spokesman Ismail Catakli told reporters earlier on Friday that Mr. Ghosn was believed to have been transferred through the cargo section of the airport in Istanbul, but did not provide further details.

Mr. Ghosn has said he will speak publicly about his escape on Jan. 8.

Some Lebanese media, in reports similar to the Wall Street Journal, have floated a Houdini-like account of Mr. Ghosn being packed in a wooden container for musical instruments after a private concert in his home, but his wife has called the account ”fiction”.

NHK said police suspected Mr. Ghosn may have left his home to meet up with someone before heading to an airport. Under the terms of his bail, Mr. Ghosn was required to have security cameras installed at the entrance of his house.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o2zfo1/article30474569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NISSAN-GHOSN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ghosn-used-our-jets-illegally-in-escape-from-japan-turkish-company-says/article30474570.ece
48,2020/01/04,Iranian commander Soleimani had been in Pompeo’s sights for years,"Long before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went on television and Twitter on Friday to make the case for the U.S. decision to kill top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, he had the powerful military commander squarely in his sights.

Back in 2015, when Mr. Pompeo was a congressman for Kansas advocating regime charge in Iran while the Obama administration pursued engagement, he accused Mr. Soleimani, considered the second most powerful person in Iran, of having “the blood of hundreds of American service members on his hands,” a refrain he repeated on Friday after the U.S. air strike in Baghdad.

In July 2017, by which time he had become director of President Donald Trump’s Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Pompeo’s stance on regime change may have been less overt, but when asked at the Aspen Security Forum whether regime change in Iran was a realistic or viable option, he replied:

“The folks who are causing the mischief - Qassem Soleimani and his gang - weren’t elected. Those are the folks that we are deadly focused on making sure don’t continue to maintain capacity and power.”

Later that year, Mr. Pompeo announced he had sent a letter to Mr. Soleimani and other Iranian leaders over Iran’s increasingly threatening behavior in Iraq, warning the United States would hold both them “accountable for any attacks on American interests in Iraq by forces that are under their control.”

“We wanted to make sure he and the leadership in Iran understood that in a way that was crystal clear,” Mr. Pompeo told the Reagan National Defense Forum in Southern California.

After hearing via Iranian media that Mr. Soleimani refused to open the letter, Mr. Pompeo added: “Didn’t break my heart to be honest with you.”

As secretary of state, a position he took up in the first part of 2018, Mr. Pompeo pursued a notably more hawkish approach to Iran than his predecessors and frequently named Mr. Soleimani in speeches and interviews.

When Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, negotiated by the Obama administration, Mr. Pompeo was one of the most vocal proponents of the “maximum pressure campaign” that saw the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018.

U.S. officials said Friday’s “decisive action” had been threatened since Sept. 11 of 2018, when the White House put out a statement after attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq.

A senior administration official said statements from both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo in the past year and a half, including one from Mr. Pompeo on Dec. 13, had warned that if Iran or its proxies conducted armed attacks that hurt U.S. personnel or interests, there would be such decisive action.

“They met the condition, and so then we then fulfilled the consequence,” the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Pompeo said on Friday the strike that killed Mr. Soleimani in Baghdad was aimed at disrupting an “imminent attack” that would have endangered Americans in the Middle East.

In interviews on Fox News and CNN, Mr. Pompeo declined to discuss details of the alleged threat but said there was “an intelligence based assessment” that Mr. Soleimani was plotting action in the Middle East region “that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk.”

In a tweet, Mr. Trump said Mr. Soleimani had “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1xh9zx/article30474552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-IRAN-IRAQ-POLITICS-UNREST-POMPEO-SOLEIMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iranian-commander-soleimani-had-been-in-pompeos-sights-for-years/article30474553.ece
49,2020/01/04,Trump declares an Iranian’s general’s ‘reign of terror’ over,"President Donald Trump declared Friday that a “reign of terror is over” as he marked the death of an Iranian general killed in a U.S. strike and as the Pentagon scrambled to reinforce the American military presence in the Middle East in preparation for reprisals.

Gen. Qassem Soleimani “made the death of innocent people his sick passion,” Mr. Trump said from his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, adding “a lot of lives would have been saved” if he’d been hunted down years ago.

The United States is sending nearly 3,000 more Army troops to the Mideast in the volatile aftermath of the killing ordered by Mr. Trump, defence officials said.

Also Friday, the Pentagon placed an Army brigade in Italy on alert to fly into Lebanon if needed to protect the American Embassy there, part of a series of military moves to protect U.S. interests in the Middle East. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official said the U.S. could send 130 to more than 700 troops to Beirut from Italy. The official was not authorized to be identified.

Reinforcements were ordered as U.S. officials said they had compelling intelligence that Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force who was killed in the U.S. strike, was planning a significant campaign of violence against the United States.

Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet announced by the Pentagon, said the new contingent of troops is from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They are in addition to about 700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne who deployed to Kuwait earlier this week after the storming of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters.

Mr. Trump said of Mr Soleimani- “We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.”

But the dispatching of extra troops reflects concern about potential Iranian retaliatory action for the killing. It also runs counter to Mr. Trump’s repeated push to extract the United States from Mideast conflicts. Prior to this week’s troop deployments, the administration had sent 14,000 additional troops to the Mideast since May, when it first publicly claimed Iran was planning attacks on U.S. interests.

The reinforcements took shape as Mr. Trump gave his first comments on the strike, declaring that he ordered the killing of Mr. Soleimani because he had killed and wounded many Americans over the years and was plotting to kill many more. “He should have been taken out many years ago,” he added.

The strike marked a major escalation in the conflict between Washington and Iran, as Iran vowed “harsh retaliation” for the killing of the senior military leader. The two nations have faced repeated crises since Mr. Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions.

The United States urged its citizens to leave Iraq “immediately” as fears mounted that the strike and any retaliation by Iran could ignite a conflict that engulfs the region.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the strike as “wholly lawful,” saying that Mr. Soleimani posed an “imminent” threat against the U.S. and its interests in the region.

“There was an imminent attack,” Mr. Pompeo told Fox News. “The orchestrator, the primary motivator for the attack, was Qassem Soleimani.”

The White House did not inform lawmakers before the strike. It was expected to give classified briefings to members of Congress and staff in the afternoon. Defense Secretary Mark Esper notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the strike shortly before the Pentagon confirmed it publicly.

Mr. Pompeo called world leaders Friday to explain and defend Mr. Trump’s decision to order the air strike that has sparked fears of an explosion of anti-American protests as well as more violence in the already unstable Middle East.

The State Department said Mr. Pompeo had spoken Friday with top officials in Afghanistan, Britain, China, France, Germany and Pakistan.

In his calls with the British and German foreign ministers as well as China’s state councilor, Mr. Pompeo stressed that Mr. Trump acted to counter an imminent threat to U.S. lives in the region but also that the U.S. is committed to “de-escalation” of tensions, according to the department’s summaries of the conversations.

De-escalation was not mentioned in the department’s summary of his call with the French foreign minister, nor in his calls with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani or the Pakistani military chief of staff. In those calls Mr. Pompeo “underscored the Iranian regime’s destabilizing actions through the region and the Trump Administration’s resolve in protecting American interests, personnel, facilities and partners,” the department said.

Mr. Trump opted not to play a round of golf on Friday, and he was not expected to be seen publicly until he travels to Miami for an afternoon event for his re-election campaign.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xam2yb/article30474548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPUSIRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-declares-an-iranians-generals-reign-of-terror-over/article30474549.ece
50,2020/01/04,Trump’s cash-rich campaign faces money competition from Democratic rivals,"Democratic presidential hopefuls started 2020 by reporting sizable cash fundraising totals, suggesting that Republican President Donald Trump’s growing campaign war chest may face some serious competition from his rivals.

Six of the top Democratic candidates have already reported raising more than $131 million in the final three months of 2019. Trump raised $46 million for his campaign, a formidable number given he will need to spend very little on a primary.

The Democratic total does not include the millions that two billionaire candidates — Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer — have pumped into the contest from their personal wealth.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren was the only top-tier Democrat to see a fundraising dip from the third quarter to the fourth, as recent polls suggest her momentum stalling in the primary race.

The Massachusetts senator raised $21.2 million during the final quarter of 2019, dropping from $24.6 million in the prior quarter, her campaign said on Friday.

The tally puts Ms. Warren behind rival and fellow progressive U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders by more than $13 million, as well as former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden, who all saw their fundraising hauls increase quarter-over-quarter. All are vying to take on the president in the November 2020 election.

After surging into a tie for first place with Mr. Biden in early October, Ms. Warren has dropped to third place behind him and Mr. Sanders in public opinion polls.

Mr. Trump remains the individual candidate who collected the most money, raising $46 million in the last quarter, a sum his campaign attributed to donations from supporters upset about the U.S. House of Representatives impeaching the president. He eclipsed his third-quarter fundraising haul of nearly $41 million, his campaign said.

Rufus Gifford, former President Barack Obama’s 2012 finance director and former ambassador to Denmark, said he had been worried about how Democrats were fundraising compared with Mr. Trump in the first part of the year.

“I think Q4 tells a remarkably different story. You see real strength in the numbers of these top-tier candidates,” he said.

But even with the uptick, Democrats should not get complacent, warned Jim Messina, longtime Obama adviser and his 2012 campaign manager.

Whoever comes out of the primary is going to be broke and facing an absolute buzz saw in the Trump campaign, he said.

But he said the sheer number of online small donors that have given to the Democratic candidates bodes well for November, since the eventual nominee can raise money from supporters of other candidates.

“Both parties are going to have whatever it takes to contest the general election,” he said.

Fundraising has become a point of contention for the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls.

Ms. Warren has criticized her rivals for holding fundraising events that court donors capable of writing $2,800 checks. She vowed early in the election cycle not to hold fundraisers and to rely almost entirely on donations made online.

The target of much of her criticism, Mr. Buttigieg, has argued that Democrats need to be taking donations from all donors, including the wealthy, to remain competitive with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sanders, who like Ms. Warren has also sworn off high-dollar fundraisers, raised more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter, likely the largest haul for that period of any 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.

Mr. Buttigieg raised $24.7 million and Mr. Biden raised $22.7 million in the same period.

Businessman Andrew Yang raised $16.5 million. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar raised $11.4 million, more than doubling the previous quarter’s amount after two highly praised debate performances, her campaign announced on Friday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lt3skw/article30474544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-IRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-cash-rich-campaign-faces-money-competition-from-democratic-rivals/article30474545.ece
51,2020/01/04,U.S. sees no domestic threat but New York braces for Iranian retaliation,"U.S. authorities and major cities saw no imminent threats on Friday from potential Iranian retaliation over a U.S. air strike that killed Tehran's most prominent military commander, but New York's mayor said his city was bracing for an attack like never before.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the security threat to his frequently targeted city changed significantly overnight considering the resources of a modern, major nation such as Iran compared to those of non-state organizations like al Qaeda or ISIS.

“We have never confronted in recent decades the reality of a war with a government of a large country with an international terror network at its behest,” the mayor told a news conference.

“New Yorkers deserve to know that we have entered into a different reality,” he said.

Mr. De Blasio and senior police officials called the news conference as Iran promised vengeance in response to the U.S. attack that killed senior military leader Qassem Soleimani.

Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said his agency was working with law enforcement officials and others across the country and was ready to respond to any threats, though none had yet been detected.

New York has been the target of repeated attacks on civilians, including the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, and failed attempts such as a truck bomb that did not explode in Times Square or a plot to bomb the subway that police thwarted.

In response, the New York Police Department has built intelligence and counterterrorism divisions, posting officers in 14 foreign locations.

New York police were on “heightened vigilance” and New Yorkers could expect to see more uniformed officers, some heavily armed with long guns, at sensitive areas, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said.

Greater security is typically seen on the subway, other mass transit, and tourist attractions at times of heightened alert.

But the escalation of tensions with Iran meant “a world of difference” and “we have to assume this action puts us in a de facto state of war,” the mayor said.

Iranian proxies such as the Hezbollah militant group have previously scouted New York locations for an attack, he said.

Other U.S. cities were also taking precautions.

Chicago increased security at airports and issued warnings to “stay vigilant after the holiday season,” officials said.

Los Angeles police asked people to remain on alert and said they were monitoring events in Iran.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/43d1x4/article30474513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-SECURITY-AROUND-NEW-YORK-CITY-INCREASED-AFTER-US-MISSILE-ST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-sees-no-domestic-threat-but-new-york-braces-for-iranian-retaliation/article30474514.ece

54,2020/01/04,Spain electoral board disqualifies Catalan president from office,"Spain’s electoral board ordered on Friday that Catalan separatist president Quim Torra be disqualified from being a member of Catalonia’s regional parliament, meaning he would lose his presidential post.

The electoral board decision comes after Catalonia’s High Court of Justice last month convicted Mr. Torra of disobedience for failing to remove separatist symbols from public buildings during an election campaign and banned him from holding public office for 18 months.

Catalonia’s autonomy statute specifies that the head of the region’s government must be a lawmaker in the regional assembly.

The election board ruling comes as Spain’s acting Prime Minister, Socialist Pedro Sanchez, faces a confidence vote in the national parliament next week following a November election. Sanchez he is counting on the abstention of Catalan separatist party ERC’s 13 lawmakers in order to take office for a second term.

The ERC rules Catalonia in coalition with Mr. Torra ‘s more hardline Junts per Catalunya, or Together for Catalonia, party which has said it will vote against Sanchez’s investiture.

Mr. Torra said in a statement that he would react to the electoral board’s decision later on Friday.

He vowed last month to appeal his conviction for disobedience, and said “only the Catalan parliament” could remove him from office.

“It is not a politically motivated court that will remove me from office,” he added after the court issued its ruling.

‘I disobeyed’

The electoral board was responding to a request from right-wing parties that it ban Mr. Torra from public office, following his conviction for disobedience, even before his appeal is heard.

In March, Spanish electoral authorities ordered Mr. Torra to remove separatist symbols to respect institutional neutrality ahead of parliamentary elections in April.

They objected in particular to a banner outside the Catalonian regional government headquarters that read “Freedom for political prisoners and exiles” next to a yellow ribbon indicating support for nine detained Catalan separatist leaders who were sentenced in October to lengthy jail terms over an abortive 2017 independence bid.

That court ruling set off a wave of angry protests in Barcelona and other Catalan cities that repeatedly descended into violence.

The Catalan government ignored two deadlines to take the banner down before finally ceding just before a planned police intervention.

During his one-day trial in November, Mr. Torra told the court he did not believe the electoral board had the right to order him to remove the symbols because they are “not higher on the hierarchy than the president” of Catalonia.

“I did not respect (the order from the electoral authorities) or put another way, I disobeyed,” he said.

Many pro-independence supporters, including Mr. Torra , have adopted a yellow ribbon to protest the arrest and jailing of the Catalan separatist leaders over the 2017 independence bid which involved a banned independence referendum.

In 2017, Mr. Torra ‘s predecessor Artur Mas, who governed Catalonia from 2010 to 2016, was banned from holding public office for two years after being found guilty of disobeying a Spanish court when his government staged a banned non-binding independence vote in the wealthy northeastern region in 2014.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tzzijf/article30474149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-SPAIN-CATALONIA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/spain-electoral-board-disqualifies-catalan-president-from-office/article30474150.ece
55,2020/01/04,Democrats ask U.S. Supreme Court to save Obamacare,"The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives and 20 Democratic-led states asked the Supreme Court on Friday to declare that the landmark Obamacare healthcare law does not violate the U.S. Constitution as lower courts have found in a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states.

The House and States including New York and California want the Supreme Court to hear their appeal of a Dec. 18 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the law's “individual mandate” that required people to obtain health insurance ran afoul of the Constitution.

57,2020/01/04,Trump impeachment: Stalemate remains in U.S. Senate over how to proceed with trial,"The U.S. Senate remained at a stalemate on Friday over how to proceed with the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, as the chamber's leaders continued a dispute over whether top White House aides will be called as witnesses.

After a two-week holiday recess, there was still no clarity about when Mr. Trump's impeachment trial might begin.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the trial could not begin without the articles of impeachment, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet sent to the Senate.

The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election.

A trial would be held in the Senate, and Mr. Trump is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber. But Mr. McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have been at loggerheads since late last year over how it should be conducted.

Mr. McConnell said on Friday the Senate should go ahead and start the trial and resolve the dispute over witnesses ”mid-trial,” a repetition of his earlier stance. He said this would follow the precedent set in former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial two decades ago. Clinton, a Democrat, was acquitted by the Senate.

“Just like 20 years ago,” Mr. McConnell said, “we should address mid-trial questions such as witnesses after briefs, opening arguments, senator questions and other relevant motions.”

Mr. Schumer, speaking after Mr. McConnell, repeated his call for a commitment to include witnesses before proceedings begin. He said there had never been an impeachment trial “in which the Senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses.”

“It may feel like we are no longer - we are no closer to establishing the rules for a Senate trial than when we last met, but the question - the vital question of whether or not we have a fair trial - ultimately rests with a majority of the senators in this chamber,” Mr. Schumer said.

Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, where 51 votes are needed to pass a set of rules for the Trump trial.

At least two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, expressed concerns over the holiday break about Mr. McConnell's approach to the trial after he said he was acting in ”total coordination” with the White House and would not be an impartial juror.

The actual impeachment trial in the Senate would need a two-thirds majority vote for a conviction, requiring more than 20 Republicans to break with their party to remove the president.

Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump administration correspondence released this week bolstered Democrats' case that Mr. Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to pressure Kiev to investigate the Bidens.

He has asked for testimony from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, along with former national security adviser John Bolton and two other White House aides.

The two Senate leaders spoke after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of Irans elite Quds Force and architect of its growing military influence in the Middle East. The attack was authorized by Mr. Trump, and Iran has promised harsh revenge.

Iran promised vengeance after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad on Friday killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran's most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing influence in the Middle East.

The overnight attack, authorized by President Donald Trump, was a dramatic escalation in a “shadow war” in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.

59,2020/01/04,"Songs, slogans, camaraderie and chocolate: a protest at India Gate","Most people have notions about the site of a protest. Protests are about resistance and we rarely associate them with peace. In the past few weeks, state-led violence and the actions of the police have made protests look far more chaotic than they are. While there is an attempt to intimidate people away from protesting, we must see protest as an act, as a space and as theatre.

Let me walk you through one evening of protest at India Gate.

There were police barricades at the entrance and they screened everyone, searched every bag. Ours had a few chocolate bars, a big Thai guava, peanut chikki, Oreo biscuits. The cop could not have been more disinterested. We walked in and there were three or four large groups: one raised the azaadi slogan, another was singing a song and then there were smaller groups and individuals holding placards.

We raised slogans. Then, we heard someone playing a tambourine in another group. Their chants were catchy. So, we walked over and joined in. The crowd, meanwhile, had swelled and fragmented into many smaller groups.

One small group was sitting on the ground with a framed image of the preamble. They were singing Faiz, Iqbal, Pash and Lohia. Most of them had googled the lyrics on their mobile phones. There was a guy with a massive suitcase — he likely had flight to catch — he was a fabulous singer and led the group for a few songs.

There can never be a protest without tea. The first to reach Jantar Mantar, for instance, were the chaiwallas. I wondered if they somehow knew the protest timings. The tea vendors at India Gate had tea bags, no desi masala chai. A vendor told us that people prefer teabags — now I love the younger generation for claiming the streets but is this what they were drinking!

Now that we had met our digital-turned-real comrades, it was time to bond over food. But we realised it is never easy to offer strangers food, whatever be the context. We offered a bar of chocolate to a lead singer. He laughed and took it but said sloganeers must not eat chocolate as it dries the throat. They didn’t want a break; they didn’t want a bite. It was a game of adrenaline.

Chats with chocolate

There was a smaller group with a placard that read ‘Free Akhil Gogoi.’ My wife is from Assam and there was an invitation as good as any. They chatted merrily and accepted the chocolates too. Next was a bouncy group of 20-somethings. Handing out chocolate was getting easier.

By now the smaller groups had merged into a single large one. A boy and a girl came over from the large group to convince this last small group to join in.

They reasoned that protesters should unite. The people in the small group shook their heads and left. All they wanted to do was sing songs.

Song and snacks

Behind India Gate stood bhelpuri, sevpuri and golgappa vendors. A group of young girls who had gathered around broke into ‘Hum Honge Kaamyaab’.

The placards ranged from wickedly funny to poetic. There were couplets from Pash, Faiz, Iqbal and Lohia. A young man stood with a poster that roughly translated to ‘we don’t leave the marrow in a bone, how can we leave India’.

There were people from across age groups at India Gate that evening. They were neither all students nor activists nor Page 3s nor Khan Market-types. If one thing stood out, it was the predominance of women: despite the recent atrocities by police, despite all the ideas about crowds, despite all the ideas about protests.

We sang songs, we screamed slogans, we read out the preamble together as if it were an oath, we sat down with strangers, we smiled and laughed with them. We felt safe and protected. I am sure, despite the uncertainties, they did too.

During dinner, several hours later, I happened to glance at my phone and learnt that only a few kilometres away, the police were brutally assaulting a peaceful protest march in Daryaganj. We looked at the bloody images and read news about children being assaulted and detained. It was going to be a long night.

60,2020/01/04,"Thanks to Kala Mytrah, Rubina goes back to school","The thickly populated slum in Borabanda, Hyderabad, shares a border with the plush Jubilee Hills; for a first-time visitor, it is almost surreal how palatial bungalows rise suddenly out of nowhere around the slum.

Here, people from all backgrounds, most of them migrants from the State and outside, live in cramped honeycomb tenements. The nearest high school is far away and so parents tend to take their daughters out of school soon after they complete their primary education. Sometimes household responsibilities force girls out of school.

But three years ago, things changed for the girls of Borabanda: a project called Kala Mytrah was launched to bring girls back to school and empower them. By 2018, when the project ended, nearly 700 girls had attended classes at the Adolescent Resource Centres established by the project in four localities to prepare them for the Secondary School Certificate through the Telangana Open School Society (TOSS). The project was partly funded through an artists’ camp conducted by the Mytrah Foundation, which raised ₹45 lakh by auctioning the paintings.

So successful was Kala Mytrah, launched by NGO Mahita in collaboration with UNICEF, that it has been replicated in several villages of Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh. And now Telangana’s women and child development department has asked UNICEF to draw up a larger proposal, modelled after this project, to educate 10,000 adolescent girls who dropped out of school.

Classes at home

But convincing parents to enrol their daughters at the centres was no easy task — the volunteers had to win their trust. The project team, of 10 members, with a coordinator, a field mobiliser and eight teachers, began by convincing the community — from the local MLA to community leaders, religious heads and headmasters of government and private schools in the vicinity. Anganwadi workers and health workers were brought in too.

Naseem Sultana, mother of four girls, was initially sceptical of the project when the volunteers approached her; but she allowed the classes to be conducted inside their home. Once the classes began, more girls from the surrounding localities joined; and Naseem Sultana, now reassured, even enrolled her younger daughter, Jabina, who has a speech and hearing impairment, so she could learn to read and write.

Into college

Rubina Begum, 20, from V. Rama Rao Nagar, had completed an Alim course at a madrasa and wanted to enrol for Class X. “But the government school was 5 km away. My three brothers were studying in private schools, and my parents could not have afforded my education,” she says. Her parents were also suspicious of the project, but later came around. Now Rubina has cleared the SSC exam thanks to Kala Mytrah, has got admission to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Open University, and now hopes to become a teacher. The centres ran in two shifts in the mornings and evenings. The classes were an uphill task for students who had been out of school for two or three years. TOSS provided study material but not all students could cope with the syllabus. So, a set of bridge course material in Telugu and Urdu was prepared by UNICEF, along with supporting modules for a few subjects with the help of the State Council of Educational Research and Training.

Road ahead

Sri Bhavani, a student from Indira Nagar, was forced to drop out of school after Class VII when her mother passed away and her father fell ill. “I stayed home for a couple of years, and then Mahita came knocking. I would finish my household chores in the morning and go for evening classes,” she says. Sri Bhavani was not able to pass the maths exam, “but I now know a lot more than before,” she says.

In fact, only 185 girls out of the 691 who attended the classes at centres passed exams after the two-year programme. The majority failed in maths. Interestingly, the pass percentage was better among the madrasa students. But despite the failures, the course has given the girls a new confidence, says Zakia Begum, a community organiser who led the project in the field. “Apart from the course curriculum, we also held weekend sessions on life skills — goal setting, time management, communication skills and negotiation abilities. We also guided the girls on careers and the road ahead after secondary education,” she says.

There were also sports sessions held at the ground nearby, where students won prizes. “I had never played outdoor sports till then, but then I won prizes in kabaddi,” beams Rubina.

“We also gave them little tasks to expose them to the world outside. For instance, we made the girls lodge a complaint about a sewage leak,” says Zakia.

“This is a second shot at education for drop-outs,” says UNICEF Child Protection Officer Murali Krishna. “With this exposure, they can move up to higher education, negotiate with elders about the age of marriage, and become more informed parents too.”

61,2020/01/04,"Social media in the time of Twitterstorms, trolls and fake news","It is hard to believe that at the beginning of the decade that just ended most of us were not on WhatsApp. There was no such thing as WhatsApp University. Now WhatsApp good mornings clog the Internet in India. At the beginning of the decade Facebook was still a place where we shared pictures of vacations, thought we were being daring when we described our relationship status as “It’s complicated” and took quizzes to figure out which Disney character we were. We had not clubbed Facebook with fake news and election-meddling. It was the Age of Social Media Innocence.

In pre-social media days I had a certain wistful nostalgia about old school-friends. We would meet once or twice a year, a fine excuse to drink whisky and reminisce about Class 4. But the school WhatsApp group has shattered that nostalgia by exposing a Petri dish of rabid political views, bad grammar and pubescent hormonal jokes. These are not school ties that bind. In fact those overheated WhatsApp groups can actually prove to be a deterrent when it comes to showing up for the annual reunion. WhatsApp at least has a mute button.

On Facebook, usually just a place for fomenting FOMO and envy, friend requests keep coming. A Sandip I did not know sent a request. When I checked I realised he had multiple friends named Sandip. He was a Sandip-collector. Someone I didn’t know from Adam sent a friend request. We had 73 friends in common.And I still had no idea who he was. In fact Facebook has done its part in devaluing the idea of what friend used to mean. Today we should ask “Is she a friend friend or a Facebook-friend?” When a real friend from my school days visited briefly from the U.S., we made sure not to post any pictures of our dinner together on social media in case our common “Facebook friends” found out, which begs the question, what’s social about social media anymore?

Trolls and stalkers

If Instagram was meant to be a pretty picture refuge, that was short-lived. Even there you are being stalked. I get elaborate film pitches meant for Satyajit Ray’s son, another Sandip, on my Instagram account. People just don’t believe that he is not on social media. Now they don’t show the likes counter because we were getting too competitive over there.

Once, people had conversations on Twitter. Now it’s just a troll-pit where people with seven followers spend their time needling celebrities, hoping to provoke some response from them. It’s a curious kind of negative validation. People put “Honoured to be followed by Narendra Modiji” in their bios as if it’s a career accomplishment. But then some people whose Facebook posts read like sentence fragments that have been run through a kitchen chopper get book contracts because of their humongous Twitter following. The only plus point, said a journalist friend, no stranger to being trolled, was that perhaps Twitter was a valve that allowed people to vent their vitriol. “Imagine what those people would be doing in real life if they didn’t have Twitter?” he said, making it sound like a sweat-out-your-toxins yoga class.

But the anonymity of social media also enables a kind of meanness and no-holds-barred misogyny few of us dare reveal in real life. Yes, there is positivity too. Stray puppies do find homes via Facebook posts. But it is not a medium that naturally encourages kindness. Kindness rarely goes viral.

True heroes

Yet despite all this we cannot turn Tiktok the clock to a pre-social media world. That genie is well and truly out of the bottle. Social media is where journalists find leads for stories and freelancers post their work. Social media is a business tool, a directory and a portable office. When an old friend logged off Facebook I realised I no longer had an email or phone number.

The true heroes of this decade are those who dare to go off social media. My friend the writer Prajwal Parajuly signed off Facebook 10 months ago despite having a massive and doting fan following. He said he was bored. I still make him suffer by sending screenshots of eyeroll-worthy things mutual “friends” are up to.

“It’s career suicide, I know, but it’s so liberating,” he says. “Every so often I wonder if I have ceased to be relevant. That’s okay, though. There’s a certain beauty TO being irrelevant.” But his days of exile might be numbered. His novel Land Where I Flee is coming out in French in 2020 and his agent has been harassing him to get back on Facebook.

With the 20/20 vision that comes with the end of a decade, it’s clear that when it comes to social media you can run but you cannot hide.

62,2020/01/04,Use working capital limits: SBI,"State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday urged corporates to utilise working capital limits as well as the facility under which the country’s largest lender extended finance against receivables due from government departments.

“I am absolutely comfortable in discounting receivables or extending receivables finance… ready to give up to 360 days [credit],” he said, adding the due, however, should not be disputed by the government.

In the past, there had been instances of such receivables shown in the balance sheet but the government department saying it did not owe any money, Mr. Kumar told FICCI Dialogue for Actionable Insights programme organised here by the industry body’s Telangana State Council.

The SBI head, who responded to various queries, including one on how credit flow can be better, sought to underscore the need for corporates to work towards building trust.

“Traditionally lending is always on trust… but last few years have not been good because of breach of trust,” he said, even while pointing out to the significance of encouraging entrepreneurship and accepting business failures.

The problem comes when the failure is not necessarily on account of business circumstances.

“When an enterprise closes down, its employees suffer… but we find no impact on the promoter. Their lifestyle remains unchanged, we cannot ignore that dimension,” Mr. Kumar said. Calling for responsible promoter behaviour, he said they should act as a trustee.

On the need for better coordination among banks with regard to consortium lending, he said a committee of six bankers — two foreign and an equal number of private and public sector banks — of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has been formed. It will submit its report in three months to usher in faster decision making, transparency and all bankers agreeing to share information on lending based on cash flows.

To query on threat to traditional banking system from fintech entities, he said while competition is always good from consumers perspective, for “public sector banks it is a question of survival. We have to mend our ways… the quality of governance, decision making, adoption of new technology, skill upgradation, cultural change is the most difficult but it is not impossible. It will be a combination of actions on many front… if not, definitely it will be an existential crisis.”On India’s plan to become a $5 trillion economy, Mr. Kumar said it was achievable, without commenting on the five-year time frame set to achieve the same. The growth will come on the back of private sector revival and not just on government investment, he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gfj8dv/article30480653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05BUSBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/use-working-capital-limits-sbi/article30480654.ece
63,2020/01/04,IT firms must focus on home market,"In the backdrop of the U.S. election, Brexit and challenges in Europe, Indian technology providers seem to have increased their focus on the home market, where sectors such as retail, telecom, media, travel, logistics, oil, power and hospitality are poised for deeper tech deployments, say global analysts.

Hansa Iyengar, senior analyst, advanced digital services, Ovum, said, domestic market, in the current context, would be much better for Indian technology providers than chasing newer customers in key markets such as Europe and the U.S.

“Retail, telecom, media, travel, logistics and hospitality are important sectors, and most desi providers have existing engagements in some of these verticals. In this year and near term, we expect these relationships to grow substantially with India as a whole being on a rapid modernisation drive,’’ she added.

Commenting on the market scenario, R. Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder, and chairman of California-based Constellation Research, Inc. said, “There are too many sellers chasing buyers in key markets. We expect clients to reduce the number of vendors they work with and seek more help in digital, AI and automation.’’

Growing North America

So, the home market would open up near-term growth opportunities for Indian providers, although the long-term prize would still be around growing accounts in North America and increasing market share in EMEA (Europe, Middle-East and Africa), stated Mr. Wang.

As per Chicago-based analyst firm HFS Research, data explosion, digital disruption and customer experience have emerged as the top three drivers impacting business operations. Offshoring and traditional outsourcing has lost its mojo. But the promise of emerging technologies across the Triple-A Trifecta (automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence), cloud, IoT and blockchain is unquestionable.

“However, the “how” to scale these technologies to realise their promise continues to be a black hole. Indian service providers, who can help clients get to the promised land beyond the piecemeal initiatives, POCs (proof of concepts) and pilots are the ones that are likely to succeed,’’ said Saurabh Gupta, chief research officer at HFS.

On the changing environment, Mr. Gupta said, a clash of cultures was imminent. “The socio-political environment across the globe was increasingly becoming bipolar – us versus them, right or wrong, 0 or 1! But emerging technologies from AI to Quantum are forcing us to get comfortable with probabilistic answers.’’

As per a market outlook analysis by HFS, all silos that are existing in organisations will soon crash. As customer experience takes center-stage, organisational silos around front-, middle-, and back-office are starting to collapse to create boundary-less entities where there is only “OneOffice” that matters – an office that caters to the customer.

Pecking order has nothing to do with size

Analysts said it was good to keep a closer look at the mid-cap firms like Mphasis, Hexaware, LTI, etc, beyond the TWITCH (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, TechM, Cognizant and HCL).

”While scale is important, it stops mattering at a certain point of time. Also, our recent research suggests that 75% enterprises believe that the service providers who get them here might not be the ones to take them into the future,’’ added HFS’ Mr. Gupta.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/1tvlsp/article30480616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05BUIT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/it-firms-must-focus-on-home-market/article30480617.ece
64,2020/01/04,Avail Finance eyes 15 million customers,"Fintech start-up, Avail Finance, that provides online loans, amongst other financial solutions, to blue-collared workers like drivers and security guards earning between ₹15,000 and ₹20,000 a month is targeting to onboard 15 million of such unserved people in the next 18 months on its platform, a top executive said.

The company, which has cumulatively disbursed loans of ₹250 crore to onemillion customers since 2017, plans to scale up the cumulative disbursements to over ₹3000 crore by then, said Ankush Aggarwal, its CEO.

“The potential is huge in India. Our objective is to reach out to all the ‘missing middle’ urban poor who are neither served by traditional financial institutions nor by micro finance com panies,” he said.In the next 18 months we plan to achieve a cumulative loan disbursements of $450 million (₹3,150 crore),” he said.

Currently, in India, the blue-collared workers earn very low salaries, have no cash reserves and may be little liquid savings. This segment has no credit card penetration, no credit history, and a very low CIBIL scores, which dissuades formalised lending institutions from funding them. And this is the segment that Avail Finance is striving to reach out.

Using a quick and simplistic loan application structure, the company identifies credit-worthy individuals who are currently underserved by banks and NBFCs, and provide them with a line of credit using an online app that enables access to personal loans.

“Our objective is to leverage technology to speed up the loan approval process, eliminate the need for physical verification and provide alternate data points to score the applicants that do not have a formal credit score,” Mr Aggarwal said.

He said the company wants to go deep into the markets it is already in and expand into new markets with several new financial offerings.

“We are not a lending company but a platform which links people with financial institutions and BFSI sector,” he said.

Set up in2017, Avail Finance has partnered with blue-collar worker force of service aggregators such as Ola, Swiggy, Ecom Express, Quess Corp to provide financial products to their workers.

The company provides unsecured personal loans of up to ₹20,000 which helps people to meet financial needs. Personal loan of ₹5,000, to be retuned in one month, attracts no interest.

The company has raised its Series A round of financing of $9 million led by Matrix Partners India in June 2019. It plans to use these funds to expand its product suite and will also offer micro-savings and micro- insurance products tailored specifically for the blue-collar workers.

In March 2018, the company had raised pre-Series A funding of $17.2 million led by Matrix Partners. This round had participation from Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati, co-founders of Ola, Binny Bansal, Co-founder and group CEO of Flipkart, Kunal Shah, Founder of Freecharge, and Manish Patel, founder and CEO of Mswipe.

The last fund-raise was a mix of debt and equity, including credit lines from multiple NBFCs. Prior to that, Avail Finance had raised $200,000 in a funding round led by Ola Co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/doocqf/article30480542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05thBUAnkush-Aggarwal,https://www.thehindu.com/business/avail-finance-eyes-15-million-customers/article30480543.ece
65,2020/01/04,"Nippon MF, Credit Suisse, IRDAI spat headed to SAT","An ongoing tussle between the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Nippon India Mutual Fund and Credit Suisse is likely to head to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) after the insurance watchdog declared that the pledging of shares of Reliance General Insurance with the two entities was in violation of the law.

According to persons familiar with the development, the two entities intend to contest the IRDAI directive as they believe that the pledge was created to safeguard the interests of their investors and unit holders without an intent of owning the shares of the insurance company.

Reliance Home defaults

“The pledge was invoked after a default by Reliance Home Finance and was done purely based on the fiduciary responsibilities and the share pledge agreement,” said a person familiar with the matter.

“The IRDAI directive has created a scenario wherein the issuer has already defaulted and the bond holders no more have access to the collateral that was placed while restructuring the payment terms,” he added on the condition of anonymity.

The matter goes back to March 2018 when Reliance Home Finance issued non-convertible debentures to raise about ₹400 crore. The bonds were subscribed by Nippon India MF and Credit Suisse.

Thereafter, the bonds matured in June 2019 but Reliance Home Finance was unable to meet the payment obligations and hence sought restructuring of the terms wherein the maturity date was extended to October 31, 2019 and additional security was brought in by Reliance Capital,the promoter of Reliance Home Finance.

For the additional collateral, Reliance Capital pledged its 100% shareholding in Reliance General Insurance Company.

The company, however, again defaulted on its payment obligations and both, Nippon India MF and Credit Suisse invoked the pledge as per the deed of guarantee dated July 19, 2019 and the amended and restated share pledge agreement dated June 26, 2019.

IDBI Trusteeship, which was acting as the debenture trustee, took possession of the shares of Reliance General Insurance from the depository account of Reliance Capital.

This pledge or the transfer of shares, as per IRDAI, is a violation of Section 6(4)(b)(iii) of the Insurance Act 1938 along with Regulation 3 of IRDAI (Transfer of Equity Shares of Insurance Companies) Regulations 2015.

In its letter dated December 27, IRDAI declared the pledge as “null and void ab initio” while also stating that Section 2(7A) of the Insurance Act caps the foreign holding limit in an insurance company.

While both, Credit Suisse and Nippon India MF are foreign entities, the foreign holding for an insurance company is capped at 49%. While a spokesperson for Credit Suisse declined to comment, an e-mail query sent to Nippon India Mutual Fund remained unanswered till the time of going to press.

“Transfer of shares is sacrosanct in depository system, and SAT, that hears appeals against orders issued by SEBI and IRDAI, has consistently taken a position that reversal of a transfer or invocation of pledge should not be allowed to maintain the sanctity of the market,” said a securities market lawyer wishing not to be named.

Interestingly, in a release issued on December 29, Reliance Capital said that the IRDAI decision has “protected the interest of all lenders and debenture holders” of the company and will help in monetising its stake in the insurance company to reduce its overall debt.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/l9g4bw/article30480531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th05BUGAVEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nippon-mf-credit-suisse-irdai-spat-headed-to-sat/article30480532.ece
66,2020/01/04,Murugappa Group heir for board seat in holding company,"A storm is brewing in the $5-billion Chennai-based Murugappa Group with Valli Arunachalam, the elder daughter of late M.V. Murugappan, locking horns with family patriarch, the 80-year-old M.V. Subbiah demanding that female heirs be given an equal opportunity in the family business on similar terms as male heirs.

Mr. Murugappan, who passed away in 2017, was survived by his wife and two daughters, Valli Arunachalam and Vellachi Murugappan.

Ms. Valli Arunachalam, karta of the MVM HUF, is seeking a board representation on Ambadi Investments Ltd. (AIL), the holding company of the 119-year Murugappa Group.

The MVM family is among the largest blocks of shareholders in AIL, the group’s public unlisted holding company. After Mr. Murugappan died, they have not had any board representation, whereas every other part of the family tree has due representation on the board, that exercises control on the business empire.

Asked for comments, Ms. Arunachalam told The Hindu, “My father, the patriarch of the Murugappa family, passed away in 2017. In keeping with his wishes, our family is seeking fair valuation of our assets. But for the last two years, we haven’t got any satisfactory response to our request.”

Fair asset valuation

As karta of MVM HUF, Ms. Arunachalam is seeking a fair valuation of their assets from the larger family.

“We own 8.15 % in AIL, yet we have no visibility in the business. So, in August 2019, we asked for representation on the board of Ambadi Investments Ltd. as our family is one of the largest shareholders. But to date, we haven’t got any meaningful response,” said Ms. Arunachalam.

After the demise of Mr. Murugappan, the former patriarch of the group, the branch was without a male heir for only the second time in the history of the family.

In the previous instance, one of Murugappan’s uncles, A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar (the second generation), adopted a male child from another part of the family tree because he had only daughters, but Mr. Murugappan bequeathed his entire estate to his wife and two daughters.

69,2020/01/04,"Amid fury over Nankana Sahib attack, BJP uses it to justify Citizenship Amendment Act","Parties across political lines on Saturday condemned Friday’s mob attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan.

While the ruling BJP said the incident justified its decision to bring in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Opposition leaders called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government to take up the issue with Pakistan to ensure the safety of the shrine and pilgrims.

‘Continuing persecution’

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi described the incident as ‘reprehensible’ and said ‘love and mutual respect’ were the antidotes to bigotry that knows no border.

At a press conference held at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi, party leader Meenakshi Lekhi said the attack on the gurdwara at the birthplace of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Devji, was symbolic of the continuing persecution of the minorities in Pakistan.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi urged the government “to immediately take up the issue with Pakistani authorities to ensure security for the pilgrims and for the holy shrine to prevent any future attacks”.

“The government of India should also press for immediate registration of case, arrest and action against the culprits,” she said.

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the affairs of all gurdwaras, asked the Pakistan government to take stern action against those responsible for the attack and decided to send a delegation to take stock of the situation.

‘CAA timely’

“Pakistan has proved that the CAA is a timely and right decision,” Ms. Lekhi said.

“The attack in Nankana Sahib should make those sitting in Shaheen Bagh and in the Kerala Assembly” understand the “importance of the CAA,” she said, referring to the anti-CAA protests in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and the resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly not to implement the law.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also condemned the attack. She said, “We condemn the incident of violence at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan. This is unacceptable. Humanity comes above all else.”

“Whatever happens subsequently will be dealt with subsequently,” she said in response to a query from The Hindu on refugees who may have fled to India after December 31, 2014, the cut off date according to the CAA.

The former Congress chief, while condemning the attack, sought to convey a subtle message about ‘bigotry’ that transcends borders.

“The attack on Nankana Sahab is reprehensible & must be condemned unequivocally . Bigotry is a dangerous, age old poison that knows no borders. Love + Mutual Respect + Understanding is its only known antidote,” tweeted Mr Gandhi soon after Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal questioned his silence over the attack.

“Cong leader @RahulGandhi’s refusal to condemn stoning of #GurdwaraNankanaSahib & threat to the very existence of holy shrine reveals his anti-Sikh face. Rahul working overtime to mislead ppl on #CAA but has no time to take on Pak & expose atrocities it's committing against Sikhs,” Ms. Harsimrat Kaur Badal has tweeted.

Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri shared a video of the mob outside the Nankana Sahib gurdwara on Twitter and said: “Murderous mob which laid siege to Sri Nankana Sahib has also threatened to change the name of this holiest of holy places to Ghulam-e-Mustafa. Persecution of minorities in Pakistan is for real. Do those opposed to CAA still need more proof? (sic),”

In Chandigarh, the SGPC chief said they would be sending a delegation to meet with Punjab Governor and Chief Minister in Pakistan and urge them to ensure the safety of Sikhs.

“Pakistan government should take an immediate and strict action against all those who were involved in this condemnable act of attacking the historic gurdwara. We have decided to send a four member delegation to Pakistan, which will asses the ground situation there,” said SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal.

He said that the management committee of Gurdwara Nankana Sahib informed the SGPC that the situation is presently normal.

On January 3, the situation had turned very tense after a mob led by the family of a Muslim man, who had married a Sikh teenage girl, hurled stones at the gurudwara, a holy shrine considered to be the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev.

“We will also take up this matter with the United Nations,” Mr. Longowal told reporters.

Condemning the attack, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take the issue with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. “This is a despicable act and it is the Pakistan government’s primary human, moral and Constitutional duty to ensure the safety of Sikhs in the country,” Mr. Sukhbir Singh Badal said in a statement.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee too condemned the attack and said, “We condemn the incident of violence at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan. This is unacceptable. Humanity comes above all else”.

“This is a shameful situation. Pakistani authorities can & should curb these vandals. I appeal to the Pak Govt to treat the defenceless pilgrims with humanity,” tweeted Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

Senior leaders and Punjab legislators of the Aam Aadmi Party — Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Manjit Singh Bilaspur and Kulwant Singh Pandori — also demanded immediate intervention of Mr. Modi in the incident. In a joint statement, the leaders said India should exert pressure and expose expose the deep-rooted conspiracy behind the act. “It was a condemnable act on the part of certain divisive forces, out to spreading communal poison among the minority Hindu-Sikh community living in Pakistan,”the statement said.

70,2020/01/04,"Citizenship Amendment Act : Undoing wrong done through Assam Accord, says Assam BJP","Leaders of the BJP’s Assam unit said here on Saturday that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was designed to undo the damage done by the leaders of the Assam agitation who settled for 1971 as the cut-off year for accepting foreigners instead of 1951.

Former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was the president of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) when it led the agitation from 1979 to 1985. That stir ended with the signing of the Assam Accord, which prescribed deportation of “illegal immigrants” who entered the State after March 24, 1971.

“Assam was made to absorb the burden of illegal immigrants for 20 years by accepting 1971 as the base year instead of 1951 for accepting them. This was because of the Accord the AASU had signed with the Rajiv Gandhi government. Wasn’t that a betrayal by those who are branding us betrayers now [because of CAA],” asked State Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at a rally of the party’s booth-level presidents and elected rural representatives in Guwahati.

Show of strength

The rally was a show of strength after other parties including the Congress had joined hands against the BJP in the past few days.

The BJP had been on the back foot after the stir shook the State in December with protesters attacking the houses of party MLAs and leaders.

Mr. Sarma was particularly severe on Mr. Mahanta, who had gone against the Asom Gana Parishad leadership to slam the CAA that he said would open the floodgates for “Hindu Bangladeshis” to threaten eventually the existence of the Assamese people.

The anti-CAA activists say the law violates the Assam Accord.

“Samujjal [Bhattacharyya, chief adviser to AASU] said the Accord was the best agreement. Why then was there no outrage when the Citizenship Act was amended in 1987 and 1992 for granting citizenship to the children of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants,” Mr. Sarma said.

People flustered

He said the first step toward setting things right was taken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government when it decided not to let the children of illegal immigrants become Indians.

“Some people get flustered when we talk about the Hindus. The Congress has nothing against the CAA. They want the Muslims to be included. In Parliament, they had said they were opposed to it as the Muslims were not considered,” Mr. Sarma said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uop6pr/article30480821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-THGRP-NADDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/citizenship-amendment-act-undoing-wrong-done-through-assam-accord-says-assam-bjp/article30480822.ece

72,2020/01/04,Unrest in Maharashtra Cong. camp over Cabinet berths,"Days after the expansion of the Maharashtra Cabinet, there is unrest within the Congress camp about the party getting a “raw deal” in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

With ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) likely to get both the Finance and the Home portfolios besides 16 berths, a section of the Congress is unhappy over the reported allocation between the allies.

Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel is reported to have discussed the Maharashtra issue with party chief Sonia Gandhi but there was no official word on the 45-minute long meeting on Saturday.

Apart from the Ministry allocation, the Congress stance on Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, especially a controversial booklet taken out by the Congress Seva Dal in Madhya Pradesh, has added to the tension with ally Shiv Sena.

“We are different parties with different ideologies and there would be differences over some issues. We expect the Shiv Sena as a political party to speak out but we hope it won’t affect the functioning of the government,” said a State Congress leader.

Several Congress leaders in Maharashtra are also upset at not being accommodated in the Cabinet, with MLA from Jalna Kailash Gorantyal issuing a fresh threat on Saturday that he would resign from all party posts along with his supporters.

On Friday, Congress workers in Solapur burnt an effigy of senior leader and State incharge Mallikarjun Kharge for including local MLA Praniti Shinde in the Cabinet.

A three-time legislator from Solapur City Central, Ms. Shinde is the daughter of veteran Congressman, former Chief Minister and Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde.

Supporters of senior leader and Bhor MLA Sangram Thopte had vandalised the local party office after he was not included in the Cabinet.

With 44 MLAs, the Congress has been given 12 berths apart from the Speaker post to Nana Patole. Distribution of portfolios have made matters worse as key Ministries have either gone to the NCP or the Shiv Sena.

Though the Congress was keen on having some of the key Ministries like Rural Development, Agriculture, Transport and Housing Development, it will have to settle with the Revenue and Public Works Ministries.

“We have got a raw deal both in terms of portfolios as well Ministries. We should have stuck to 14-14-14 formula where each ally would have got 14 berths. This way, we could have accommodated, at least, some of our 3-time MLAs who have been left out,” a Congress functionary familiar with the State told The Hindu.

Former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, who was inducted as a Cabinet Minister in the December 30 Cabinet expansion, and State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat have now been asked to speak to the disgruntled MLAs and explain the situation.

“There are other ways of accommodating in the government including making the MLAs heads of corporations and cooperative bodies. We hope that will settle down in some time,” the Congress functionary said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d8fn30/article30480677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-THGRP-AJIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unrest-in-maharashtra-cong-camp-over-cabinet-berths/article30480678.ece
73,2020/01/04,Punjab CM Amarinder Singh flays Akali Dal for ‘political stunts’,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday hit out at the Shiromani Akali Dal for its “political stunt” over the power tariff hike in the State and the murder of two former SAD sarpanches (village heads).

The SAD has threatened to take to the streets over the two issues, which the Chief Minister dubbed as mere theatrics, aimed at covering up its trail of misdeeds and mis-governance of 10 years.

Criticising the Akali leadership over its threat of agitation if the killers of former Akali sarpanches — Baba Gurdeeep Singh and Dalbir Singh Dhilwan — are not arrested within two weeks, Captain Amarinder said the Punjab police was doing a much better job at solving crimes under the present regime than the previous SAD-BJP government.

These kind of ultimatums might have worked under the Akali government, when many innocent people were thrown behind bars after being charged in false cases, he said, adding that under his goverment, no innocent person would be victimised for crimes they did not commit.

Countering the Akali allegations on the power tariff hike, Captain Amarinder cited figures to show that the percentage increase during the previous regime, from 2007 to 2017, was much more than what his government had implemented. “Why don’t you check out your own track record before lashing out at us,” he said.

The Chief Minister pointed out that the total hike under the SAD-BJP rule was 22.51% in 2006-07 over 2001-02, 42.13% in 2011-12 over 2006-07, 24.77% in 2016-17 over 2011-12, as against a mere 13.69% in 2019-20 over 2016-17.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gfmij9/article29302265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AmarinderSingh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punjab-cm-flays-akali-dal-for-political-stunts/article30480671.ece
74,2020/01/04,Vyapam scam: CBI has secured 94 convictions in four years,"Pursuing as many as 154 cases on the Vyapam scam for four years, the Central Bureau of Investigation has so far secured 94 convictions against those who subverted the entrance tests for admission in educational institutions and government jobs in Madhya Pradesh. More than 3,100 accused persons have been chargesheeted.

The convicts have been awarded three to 10 years of imprisonment, based on the severity of proven charges.

The agency has filed about 145 charge sheets against the accused persons. They include the masterminds, middlemen, a large number of candidates, impersonators and former Vyapam officials. Over 130 of them have been arrested. Complaints against suspects who were minors have been filed in juvenile justice courts.

During the course of investigation, the agency used an advanced software for the identification of those who impersonated candidates, based on the facial features lifted from examination hall admit cards and other records.

The CBI took over the investigation with the registration of the first set of cases on July 15, 2015, following a direction from the Supreme Court. Subsequently, 154 cases were instituted over a period of time. The cases pertained to multiple instances of rigging of tests for admission in medical colleges, besides the recruitment for posts such as police constables and forest guards.

The amount of effort that has gone into probing the cases was reflected in a key charge sheet filed against 592 accused persons in November 2017. Among those arraigned were 334 paper solvers and beneficiary candidates, 155 guardians of the candidates, 22 middlemen and 46 invigilators.

Chairmen of four private medical colleges, who allowed the admission of unqualified candidates, were also arraigned.

In order to trace 145 unidentified accused persons, most of whom were paper solvers hired to help the candidates clear the 2012 pre-medical test, the CBI collated details of more than 10 lakh students from Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra.

The effort — based on evidence that the ‘paper solvers’ were either those who were already enrolled in medical colleges or students who were attending coaching classes in these States — led to the identification of 42 persons in that case.

In multiple cases, the CBI found that the accused Vyapam officials tampered with digital records to increase the marks of a large number of candidates. The pairing of respective solvers-beneficiary candidates was done by getting their roll numbers manipulated through the officials in such a way that the candidate would sit right behind the solver.

Another important charge sheet was filed by the agency in October 2017 against 490 accused persons, related to a pre-medical test. Three Vyapam officials, three masterminds, 17 middlemen, 297 paper solvers and beneficiary candidates, and 170 guardians of the candidates were named in that case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lz73rc/article25319459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-cbi2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vyapam-scam-cbi-has-secured-94-convictions-in-four-years/article30480652.ece
75,2020/01/04,BJP’s pro-Citizenship Amendment Act number heats up Twitter,"From free Netflix subscriptions to chats and dates with ‘lonely women’, a variety of “services” were advertised by Twitter handles by Saturday, inviting people to call 88662-88662. The only catch was that the number was the one announced by the BJP two days earlier, seeking calls from members of the public supportive of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

By Saturday evening, the number of Tweets with the alluring offers had snowballed. One handle even claimed that the number belonged to Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt and that those who were “free” could “talk to a celebrity.”

Amid ongoing protests against the CAA, which fast-tracks citizenship for the specific minorities of Sikhs, Hindus, Jains, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists who fled persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, the BJP had launched the dial-in campaign to mobilise support for the law.

In a tweet on Thursday, the BJP’s official handle (@BJP4India), asked people to give a missed call on 88662-88662 to register their support for CAA. While many BJP leaders also shared the number, other users on Twitter used it for different purposes.

“This is absolutely fake,” U.S.-based online streaming provider Netflix tweeted on Saturday, reacting to the tweets about free subscriptions to its service. “If you want free Netflix please use someone else’s account like the rest of us,” the Netflix India account replied to a tweet that promised a 6-month free subscription. A few Twitter users tried to dissuade people from calling the number, raising the spectre of a data breach, and theft of bank details, Aadhaar and PAN numbers.

Asked to comment about the use of the number for other purposes, BJP national secretary Tarun Chugh told The Hindu that the “IT cell will have to look into it”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n905zx/article30480647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05TWITTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjps-pro-citizenship-amendment-act-number-heats-up-twitter/article30480648.ece

Venkaiah Naidu wants the procedure to raise complaints against members to be eased after it emerged that action could not be taken against 19 members in the past four years because the complaints did not comply with the procedure.

He has asked the Committee on Ethics, chaired by BJP MP Prabhat Jha, to re-examine the rules. A review conducted by this committee last week revealed that 22 complaints against 19 members in the past four years had to be returned without examination since they did not comply with the procedure.

The complaints against 19 members — belonging to eight parties, the ruling as well as the Opposition, besides two Independents — were not taken up for a preliminary examination by the committee as they were not addressed to the authorities as prescribed in the rules.

The Rajya Sabha Secretariat has refused to divulge the names of the 19 members.

Since 1997, only two members have been expelled on the recommendations of the committee: one for taking money to raise questions and the other for misuse of funds under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme.

79,2020/01/04,2019 recorded highest ever ceasefire violations by Pakistan in J&K in last 16 years,"Pakistani troops made the highest number of ceasefire violations in the last 16 years along the J&K border in 2019, amounting to over 3,200 instances or an average of nine such violations daily.

Shelling and firing by Pakistani troops was “very heavy” in 2019, virtually making the 2003 India-Pakistan border truce “redundant”, officials said.

There have been 3,289 ceasefire violations by the Pakistan Army along the Indo-Pak border in 2019, they said.

Of these, 1,565 ceasefire violations took place since August 2019, after the Indian government abrogated Article 370 and bifurcated the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories.

Revealing the data in reply to a RTI query of social activist Rohit Choudhary, Director, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Sulekha said October recorded the highest number of ceasefire violations at 398 followed by 333 in November, 323 in August, 314 in July, 308 in September and 275 in March.

“Pakistani troops repeatedly targeted forwards posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) to create a fear psychosis among the people,” a senior police officer said.

In 2018, Jammu and Kashmir had recorded 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan with an average of eight cases daily, in which 61 people were killed and over 250 injured.

The violations continued in 2019 despite Pakistani troops vowing to maintain peace on the border during flag meetings with the Indian forces, the Army official said.

“Pakistan vows to maintain peace and strengthen border relations, but they do not keep their promises,” he said.

The number of ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops in 2019 were over 300 more than in 2018 and over three times that of 2017, when 971 cases were reported. In 2017, 31 people — 12 civilians and 19 security forces personnel — were killed and 151 others suffered injures.

The officials said due to frequent shelling and firing incidents, fear gripped the border populace and prompted thousands of people to migrate to safer places.

People had to migrate to safer places on two occasions of shelling last year and three times the previous year, which affected their education and farm activities.

To protect border residents in view of increasing ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir, the central government sanctioned Rs 415 crore for the construction of over 14,400 underground bunkers along the LoC and the IB and made efforts to speed up the work last year.

Over 8,600 bunkers have been constructed so far in Jammu region, they said.

Giving details of cases of ceasefire violations in the past decade, the officials said 405 cases of ceasefire violations were reported in 2015, and 583 in 2014.

There was a gradual increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan between 2009 and 2013. The corresponding figures for 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 347, 114, 62, 44, and 28 respectively.

The numbers of such violations were 77 in 2008, 21 in 2007 and three in 2006, according to official data. For three years - 2004, 2005 and 2006 - there was not a single such violation on the border.

The Indian government led by late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee entered into a border ceasefire agreement with Pakistan along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, 2003.

80,2020/01/04,"No politician or trade leader, ex-member of panel on jobs completes 5 months in Valley jail","Neither a politician nor leader of a trade body, Shakeel Qalander, who was a member of a committee headed by eminent economist C. Rangarajan to formulate an employment policy for J&K in 2010-11, completed five months of detention on Saturday, with the family groping in the dark for reasons behind his arrest and the possibility of release.

The relatives and family members of Mr. Qalander, who is from Srinagar’s Kanitar area, huddle together every Wednesday and Saturday — the days of the week when a blood relation is allowed to visit the Srinagar Central Jail and ascertain his well-being.

“It was around 3 a.m. on August 5, when policemen surrounded our house, scaled the boundary wall and barged in,” recalled Mr. Qalander’s son Ahtisham Qalander, who is an IIT graduate. “The whole family was confused about the raid. My father was shifted to a local police station. It took us hours to locate the [specific] police station since none of our family members had ever been there,” he added.

Detained apparently as part of preventive measures under Section 107, a magistrate’s order against Mr. Qalander read: “I have been given to understand that you and your associates are about to organise processions and such meetings which are likely to deteriorate the law and order situation.”

Owning a well-known local furniture brand, the detained entrepreneur was a regular speaker at a civil society group the Kashmir Centre for Social and Developmental Studies (KCSDS) as well as at public functions, debates and television shows and also wrote newspaper columns.

“My father is well read and understands the dynamism of economy,” said his son. “He would get invited frequently for lectures. Most of his lectures would focus on the economic welfare of J&K. He has been apparently detained for having an opinion. If he was such a threat, would the previous regime make him a member of the Rangarajan committee?” wondered the younger Mr. Qalander, who left work on his start-up initiative in New Delhi midway to return to oversee the family business. The enterprise provides employment to about 50 locals.

The family said it had assured the district administration that Mr. Qalander would sign a bond, as required under Section 107, undertaking “not to cause any law and order issue”. Two separate notes by different police wings including the CID, underlining that “his release will have no adverse impact on the ground situation” have failed to secure the industrialist’s release even after 152 days, his son added.

“Hundreds of locals remain jailed. It seems the administration has forgotten it has even arrested my father. There is no other reason to prolong his detention. A state has to not only safeguard lives but also the dignity of its people. The prolonged detention is aimed at hurting our dignity,” he added.

The family claimed that the administration had furnished no fresh grounds or evidence or witnesses, as required under the law, to prolong his detention. “The release of businessman Mubeen Shah from the Agra jail recently did rekindle the hope that my father too would be released soon. However, with each passing day, we are grappling in the dark, and losing hope,” said Mr. Qalander’s son, while demanding his immediate release.

More than 6,000 people, including members of civil society groups, were arrested in the August 5 clampdown in Kashmir. According to authorities, about 1,200 people still remain detained, including some 200 politicians and activists, and “were being released in a phased manner”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ajif1a/article30480592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05SRINAGARJAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-politician-or-trade-leader-ex-member-of-panel-on-jobs-completes-5-months-in-valley-jail/article30479993.ece
81,2020/01/04,India caught in the crossfire as Trump invokes Delhi post Soleimani killing,"India got caught in the crossfire between the United States and Iran after President Donald Trump blamed assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani for a spate of terror attacks, including one in Delhi, a charge Iran’s envoy to India has denied.

In a statement in Washington, Mr. Trump justified the killing of Mr. Soleimani in a missile attack on his convoy outside the Baghdad airport, saying that the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) international operations or “Quds force” was responsible for several terror attacks and was planning more.

“Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London,” Mr. Trump said.

Watch | Who was Qasem Soleimani?

Iran’s Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni denied the allegations. “Mr. Trump can say anything he likes, he can give any list of attacks that he likes. But this is a big lie. General Soleimani was a soldier, he was not involved in the targetting of innocents anywhere,” Mr. Chegeni said in an interview to The Hindu.

The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s statement, which brought New Delhi into the rising tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Mr. Trump is believed to have referred to the car bombing of an Israeli diplomat in Delhi in February 2012. The diplomat, who was also the wife of the Israeli defence attaché, was injured in the attack along with three others. At the time, the Delhi Police’s special cell that investigated the case believed it was connected with attacks on Israeli diplomats in Tbilisi, Georgia as well as Bangkok, Thailand, and was reportedly carried out by IRGC agents at the time in retaliation for attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists. Delhi Police officials say the case has not moved since 2013, when the lone suspect, an Indian journalist with an Iranian news agency, was granted bail, a decision that was upheld in the Supreme Court.

Mr. Chegeni said that by raising the issue, Mr. Trump was attempting to cover the U.S.’s action in killing the Iranian official while he was visiting Iraq after travelling to Syria for “anti-terrorism consultations”.

“Gen Soleimani fought against the ISIS, Jubhat Al Nusra, Al-Qaeda. He was invited to Syria and Iraq by their governments for advice and assistance on fighting these terror groups. So anyone who assassinated him, is for the terrorists. And if this was ordered by their President, as the U.S. says, then this is an act of state terrorism,” he noted.

New Delhi expresses concern

On Friday, India issued a statement that expressed concern over rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and “noted” the U.S.’s killing of the senior Iranian official.

When asked, Mr. Chegeni said he expected India would also “condemn the assassination of an official who was on a visit to another country on official invitation.”

Also Read Thousands in Baghdad mourn Iranian general killed by U.S.

He stated,“We expect India as our reliable friend to advise the United States to follow international norms and not destabilise the region. We have the right to retaliate, but Iranians are patient, we will choose the time and place of our response to this killing.”

Tougher language is expected from Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who is due in Delhi on January 14 to address the Raisina dialogue. The 3-day event, where U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger will also speak, could see India, which has attempted a “tightrope walk” in ties with both countries, caught in the middle again.

Strongly condemning the mob attack on the historic Sikh shrine, SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal on January 4 appealed to the Pakistan government to take strict action against culprits.

“We strongly condemn the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and appeal to the Pakistan government to take stringent action against the culprits and also ensure safety of Sikhs living there,” Mr. Longowal said on January 4.

“We will send a four-member delegation to Pakistan to take stock of the situation there,” he said, adding that the delegation would also meet Sikh families in Nankana Sahib.

“The delegation will also meet Pakistan’s Punjab Governor and Chief Minister,” he further said.

He said the delegation will comprise Rajinder Singh Mehta, Roop Singh, Surjit Singh and Rajinder Singh.

“We have spoken with the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib management committee...they told us the situation is normal now,” he said.

The SGPC chief said the sentiments of the Sikh community were hurt with the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib.

Mr. Longowal said that the SGPC would also take up this matter with the United Nations.

Addressing a press conference at the party office here, he said, “Pakistan is a dead horse... Just to divert issues, Pakistan’s name is raised. What is Pakistan? If you send Kashmir police, they can also defeat Pakistan.” He added, “It is very insulting to say that Pakistan will attack us,” he said.

He accused Mr. Modi of repeatedly resorting to rhetoric in the name of Pakistan to divert the nation’s attention from real issues such as unemployment, declining GDP, farmers’ distress, and rising prices of essential commodities. “I have not seen the Prime Minister speaking on unemployment, the Home Minister speaking on farmers’ issues, any Minister talking about improving the GDP, and any of the BJP leaders speaking on controlling price rise. These are the issues that concern each and every individual, whatever religion or caste they may belong to,” he said.

On the protests against the amended citizenship law, the senior Congress leader said that in the past few decades he had not seen such a “spontaneous agitation” taking place across the country. “All sections of people are part of the protests... The entire country has risen to the occasion against this Act,” he said.

Noting that many political parties had opposed the the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, Mr. Azad said the BJP government used “brute majority” in the Lok Sabha to pass the Bill and in the Rajya Sabha it was passed with a very narrow margin. Five regional parties such as the BJD, the JD(U) and the YSR Congress, among others, who supported the Bill, had now realised that they committed a “blunder”, he said.

86,2020/01/04,"Nurses, midwives the backbone of every health system, says WHO","Nurses and midwives play a vital role in providing health services and are often, the first and only point of care in their communities. “The world needs 9 million more nurses and midwives if it is to achieve universal health coverage by 2030,” notes the World Health Organisation (WHO) in its latest report.

The World Health Assembly has designated 2020 the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.

WHO and partners including the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), International Council of Nurses (ICN), Nursing Now and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in a year-long effort to celebrate the work of nurses and midwives have highlighted the challenging conditions they often face, and advocate for increased investments in the nursing and midwifery workforce.

“Nurses and midwives are the backbone of every health system and in 2020 we are calling on all countries to invest in nurses and midwives as part of their commitment to health for all,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.

WHO has noted that educating nurses and midwives to international standards makes economic sense. It saves resources by reducing the need for costly and unnecessary interventions and increases quality of care and health for all.

“But too often nurses and midwives are undervalued and unable to fulfil their true potential. In 2020 we aim to ensure that all nurses and midwives operate in an environment where they are safe from harm, respected by medical colleagues and community members, have access to a functioning health-care service and where their work is integrated with other health-care professionals,” WHO has noted.

It says nurses and midwives can be the answer to so many of the world’s health problems but first we must overcome professional, socio-cultural and economic barriers.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eq175y/article30478320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nurses-midwives-the-backbone-of-every-health-system-says-who/article30478321.ece

A Seva Dal booklet has this week claimed Vinayak Savarkar and Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse were in a physical relationship. The NCP on Saturday said this was not a fair claim to make when the person in question was not alive. The Congress and the NCP are coalition partners in Maharashtra in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

“Since Savarkar is not alive, it is not correct to make this claim. This booklet should be immediately withdrawn, since ideological differences are one thing but making such personal remarks when the person is not even around is not right,” said State Cabinet Minister and senior NCP leader Nawab Malik.

The booklet in Hindi “Veer Savarkar, Kitne Veer” was recently distributed by a Congress-affiliated organisation in Madhya Pradesh. The book questions Savarkar’s credentials as a patriot and even claims he received money from the British after he was released from the Cellular Jail.

The State BJP has already demanded the Congress leaders behind the book be immediately jailed by the Sena-led MVA government. “If the Shiv Sena will not take action against them, we will show the Congress people behind this their place.

90,2020/01/04,India close to concluding trade package with U.S.: outgoing Ambassador Shringla,"India and the United States are close to concluding a trade package that would provide enhanced market access to both countries, India’s outgoing Ambassador to the U.S., Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said.

Mr. Shringla made the comments while addressing a group of Indian-American entrepreneurs during a farewell lunch on Friday organised for him by TiE DC, a regional chapter of the global non-profit membership and mentoring organization for entrepreneurs.

We are close to concluding a trade package that would provide enhanced market access to both countries, Mr. Shringla said during the event.

The outgoing Ambassador, who would take up his new assignment as India’s next Foreign Secretary later this month, however, did not give an exact date for the inking of the much anticipated trade deal.

Modi-Trump meet

The trade deal was first announced by U.S. President Donald Trump when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

Mr. Trump on September 24 said his country will soon have a trade deal with India to boost economic ties between the two nations.

Mr. Shringla said the signing of the trade package would pave the way for a much bigger bilateral trade deal between the two largest democracies of the world, which will only benefit the companies of the two countries.

We see a lot of openings, he said.

Mr. Shringla, who is scheduled to leave for India later this month, said that the India- US bilateral trade has increased significantly in the last one decade and it is expected to be over $ 160 billion by 2019.

Noting that there are a lot of complementarities between the Indian and the U.S. economy, the Ambassador said that Indian-American entrepreneurs and in particular organizations like TiE DC play an important part in strengthening these bilateral ties, not only people to people but also economic and strategic relationship.

Shringla's tenure

Ravi Puli, an entrepreneur from TiE DC, said that in just about an year, Mr. Shringla has made a great impact on India-US relationship.

As an ambassador, he has taken the US-India relations to a level that all of us are feeling very proud and we are looking forward to take it even further with his leadership as a foreign secretary of India, he said.

The event was attended by eminent Indian-American entrepreneurs from in and around Washington DC and leaders of other chapters from various parts of the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9swfgw/article30477072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shringlamodi2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-close-to-concluding-a-trade-package-with-us-shringla/article30477061.ece

Speaking at the inauguration of the second edition of ‘Mega Brahmin Business Summit’, he also claimed that eight out of nine Indian Nobel winners, including economist Abhijit Banerjee, were Brahmins.

The summit is taking place at Adalaj near here.

“Do you know that constitutions of 60 countries were studied and then our draft Constitution was prepared? Do you know who presented that draft to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar? We all take Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s name with respect when it comes to the Constitution,” said Mr. Trivedi, a Brahmin himself.

“However, in his (Ambedkar’s) own words, the draft was prepared by B.N. Rau — Benegal Narsing Rau — a Brahmin,” he said at the event, also attended by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.

“History tells us that Brahmins always stand behind and promote others. It was Rau who kept Ambedkar ahead of him. We are proud of Ambedkar because he admitted this during his speech in the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949,” Mr. Trivedi said. “And I quote him: ‘The credit given to me does not really belong to me. It belongs to B N Rau.’”

Mr. Trivedi also claimed that of the eight Indians who won Nobel prize, seven were Brahmins. “Do you know a ninth Indian recently received Nobel? Yes, he is Abhijit Banerjee, a Brahmin,” he added.

Sources claimed that the 55-year-old was under a lot of stress and tension following the controversy over his grandfather.

The controversy erupted after a booklet, distributed by Congress-affiliated Seva Dal in Madhya Pradesh, questioned Savarkar’s credentials as a patriot and his reputation for valour.

“Ranjit has been visiting television studios to defend his grandfather and it took a toll on his health. His blood pressure shot up to 220 last night, following which he was admitted to Raheja Fortis Hospital at Mahim,” a source said.

Ranjit Savarkar was admitted to the ICU, but his condition is stable now, he said.

Titled Veer Savarkar, Kitne Veer?, the Hindi booklet had also claimed that Savarkar and Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse were in a physical relationship.

The Department of Heavy Industry had invited the expressions of interest from entities for availing incentives under the FAME India Scheme Phase II for deploying charging stations within cities.

“By installing all these charging stations, it is expected that at least one charging station will be available in most of the selected cities in a grid of 4 km x 4 km, which will boost the confidence of users of electric vehicles in terms of range anxiety and also this will encourage the OEMs to launch the new electric vehicle models which they were hesitant because of lack of charging infrastructure,” the Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said.

Under the second phase of the FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, 317 EV charging stations have been sanctioned in Maharashtra, 266 in Andhra Pradesh, 256 in Tamil Nadu, 228 in Gujarat, 205 in Rajasthan, 207 in Uttar Pradesh, 172 in Karnataka, 159 in Madhya Pradesh, 141 in West Bengal, 138 in Telangana, 131 in Kerala, 72 in Delhi, 70 in Chandigarh, 50 in Haryana, 40 in Meghalaya, 37 in Bihar, 29 in Sikkim, 25 each in Jammu, Srinagar, and Chhattisgarh, 20 in Assam, 18 in Odisha and 10 each in Uttarakhand, Puducherry and Himachal Pradesh.

Sanction letters to the selected entities will be issued in phases after ensuring availability of land for charging stations, signing of necessary agreements/MoUs with concerned partner organisations like city municipal corporation/discoms/oil companies etc.

Subsequently, selected public entities are required to initiate the procurement process in a time-bound manner for deployment of sanctioned charging stations.

The Department of Heavy Industry had invited the Expressions of Interest from large cities, smart cities, state/union territory capitals and cities from special category states for submission of proposal for availing incentives under FAME India Scheme Phase II for deployment of EV charging infrastructure within cities.

In the aftermath of the protest, the measures taken by the police frightened the people. Drones hovered over their homes, posters with pictures of protesters accused of inciting violence were pasted across junctions, and police were deployed heavily for at least a week after December 20.

In Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, apparently no such attempt was made on December 20. In fact, the locals said they saw the police with local BJP leaders, instigating the protesters. The prominent Shia cleric, Maulana Asad Raza Husseini, and his students were beaten by the police who said that protesters took refuge in Sadaat Hostel, a seminary-cum-orphanage headed by Husseini. “The local right-wing leaders in collusion with the district administration tried to communalise what was a protest against the CAA by targeting prominent Muslim families and their businesses by arbitrarily sealing their shops,” said Akram Akhtar, an advocate and social activist.

Locals also said that men in uniform barged into Muslim localities destroying property and stealing jewellery. They raided houses in the dead of night to detain alleged protesters, the locals said. They also said the police had “promised” compensation provided they keep the looters “unidentified” in their complaints. “I have still not got the post-mortem report of my brother. How do you expect me to take any legal action,” asked Salahuddin.

In Nehtaur and Muzaffarnagar, the families were not allowed to bury the dead in their town as the police feared a breakdown of law and order. “When we went to the police station to complain, six rounds were fired in the air to threaten us,” said Shoaib Malik, brother of Suleman, the 20-year-old IAS aspirant who died of injuries from a 9mm bullet. “After 10 days, when we got the post-mortem report, we were shocked to find that Suleman’s age was mentioned as 35 and his grandfather’s name was indicated in the father’s column,” said advocate Afzal Ansari, Suleman’s uncle. He said the police refused to lodge a separate FIR against its men despite agreeing to do so initially. “We have only been given the stamped copy of the complaint,” he said.

Akhtar said Muzaffarnagar has become “a police state for Muslims”. He also followed the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 closely. “The well-off were looted while the poor were shot at,” he said. Even in places such as Saharanpur and Shamli which remained “calm but tense”, a large number of people were booked under Sections 147, 148 (punishment for rioting) and 152 (assaulting or obstructing public servants when suppressing riot) of the Indian Penal Code. “Sealing shops and asking for compensation without due judicial process is unprecedented. These are ways of frightening Muslims,” said Akhtar. The police and the district administration have asked the local media to publish names of those who have been booked for rioting in their news reports.

‘U.P. police is not communal’

The U.P. police maintain that protesters who have been identified through photos and videos shall be proceeded against. Officers cite Supreme Court orders on recovering money from rioters under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. The U.P. police issued notices to one dead man and two nonagenarians in Firozabad accusing them of vandalism. The Superintendent of Police admitted later that this was a mistake and promised that no action would be taken against senior citizens. Senior police officials in these districts insisted that they used only the “required force” to control the situation. In Meerut, a senior police official said Lisadi Gate, where all the deaths took place, was a hub of criminal activity. He claimed money was being pumped in from outside, from the Popular Front of India, to create a “communal situation”. “The policemen abused senior officials for sending them in with just polycarbonate canes. They wanted to have a free run and needed counselling on the spot,” he said. “In a law and order situation, there is no one rule. What works, works. The charge that the U.P. police is completely communalised is wrong.”

While the protests have largely been without any leaders or banners, the police have named Leftist and Muslim organisations in FIRs. In Lucknow, the police identified the Popular Front of India as the “mastermind” behind the violence and have written to the Home Ministry demanding that it be banned. The police said the outfit had mobilised outsiders, including those from West Bengal. Mohammad Shoaib, senior advocate and the head of Rihai Manch, a rights group that helps terror accused fight legal battles, was arrested despite being under house arrest during the violence. His colleague Robin Verma, many Ambedkarites, retired IPS officer S.R. Darapuri, and several other members of civil society were also arrested.

Scared of NRC more than CAA

There is an overwhelming feeling in Muslim localities in U.P. that the police action was disproportionate and discriminatory. Locals said the police was pursuing a vendetta against them. While many of them detached themselves from the violence during the protests and also condemned it, their concerns, insecurity, and confusion regarding the CAA, NRC and National Population Register was palpable. Noor Bano, a housemaker, was convinced that the NRC would follow the CAA and have an adverse impact on Indian Muslims. “How will we provide proof,” she asked. “And if it was fair, why would people come out to the streets?” Many said they feared the NRC rather than the CAA.

Syed Husain Afsar, editor of Sunday Aag, an Urdu newspaper in Lucknow, said the CAA is only a trigger. Several factors were responsible for the large turnout on the streets, including the Ayodhya verdict, the dilution of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, and incidents of hate crimes. But the “riling up” by the “majority” and by media channels also played a role, he said. He rubbished the BJP’s argument that Opposition parties are provoking Muslims to take to the streets and argued that a large number of Muslims have started understanding the atrocities themselves. Another Muslim scholar said that the question of CAA-NRC had made the community aware of the “continuous injustice” meted out to them and amplified their fears that they would be reduced to “second-class citizens”.

In Jamia, the beginning

The unrest in U.P. — indeed, the nationwide agitation over the CAA — began only after the Delhi Police’s action at the Jamia Millia Islamia. On December 15, at around 6.30 p.m., security personnel barged into the university’s campus, admittedly “chasing after arsonists”, and began beating people up. Several videos and testimonies from students who were inside the campus and not participating in the protests revealed how the police launched multiple rounds of tear gas shells into the university. The whole area was enveloped in white smoke. Some shells were also launched into the university library’s reading room, by breaking windows and causing panic. There were several students seated in the reading room at the time. The police then stormed the library and severely beat up the students. According to several accounts, the police destroyed furniture and other university property and also hurled communal slurs. Many described the campus as a “war zone”.

Among those grievously injured at the library was LLM student Mohammad Minhajuddin, who was studying in a separate section meant for research scholars. He said that nearly 25 policemen broke into this section and launched an indiscriminate attack, during which he was hit on his hand followed by a whack on his left eye. Videos shared by students showed Minhajuddin lying against a wall on a university bathroom floor, surrounded by shattered glass from broken mirrors. He was later taken to AIIMS, where tests revealed that he had lost vision in one eye. The crackdown resulted in several suffering fractures and other severe injuries. At least 50 people got admitted to the Holy Family Hospital.

The police said they were following some of those who had set fire to buses at multiple locations and had run into the Jamia campus. Senior police sources said that a large number of personnel on the ground had been continuously on duty for over 56 hours in lieu of the ongoing protests and were in an “irritated” state, which may have been the reason many of them used excess force. The sources also said that crowd control personnel were only equipped with batons and shields and were instructed not to carry arms during the protest.

A volatile situation in Mangaluru

A few days later, on December 19, as protests raged across other parts of India, coastal Karnataka’s communally sensitive city of Mangaluru saw anti-CAA protests too. This was followed by violence and police firing that claimed the lives of Jaleel and Nauseen. All this happened within a radius of about 2 km of the office of the Deputy Commissioner in Bunder area, a major wholesale and retail trading centre near the fisheries harbour. Jaleel worked as a labourer in the fishing harbour and Nauseen was a welder in a shop near Juma Masjid in the area. The families of both claimed that they were not in any way involved in the protests and just happened to be in the vicinity when firing began.

D.M. Aslam, a member of the Muslim Central Committee of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, said the police could have used restraint. “[The incidents of] stoning, throwing soda bottles at police and burning of tyres on the roads began after the Mangaluru police resorted to lathi charge... Had the police shown some patience, the protesters could have been taken into custody. The police should have allowed them to sit and continue the protest for sometime.”

M.S.M. Zaini Kamil, general secretary, Sunni Youth Sangha, Karnataka, has a video clip that indicates that at around 2 p.m., soon after the protest began, some police officials were trying to convince the youth to withdraw their agitation when two constables suddenly began lathi charging the protesters. Other police officials joined the constables, without waiting for orders, escalating the situation. This was followed by tear gas firing. “The violence could have been avoided if the police had shown some patience and common sense in controlling the mob,” he said, adding that action should also be taken against those who threw stones at police.

In another clip that went viral, Shantharam Kunder, an Inspector at Mangaluru East Police Station who was part of the police unit when the operation was on, is seen remarking, “So many bullets have been fired, yet no one has died.” Kunder has since been transferred out of station duty and a probe initiated into the incident.

Tear gas in a hospital

Later, the police entered the nearby Highland Hospital, where the injured had been admitted and the bodies of the Jaleel and Nauseen had been kept. Yunus, the CEO of the hospital, said it was the hospital that had called the police as people in large numbers were entering the premises. “But [they] burst tear gas shells… [the] smoke spread all over. We have conveyed our displeasure on the conduct of the police to Mangaluru South Police Station,” he said. However, the hospital did not file any police complaint or register a protest with the Indian Medical Association.

B.K. Imtiyaz, an eyewitness, said policemen kicked the doors of wards and even the doors of the ICU. Post violence, on December 22, Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa announced a compensation of ₹10 lakh each to the families of the two killed. But it was withheld the next day on the grounds that Jaleel and Nauseen were among those accused of violence and their names had been mentioned in the First Information Report filed on December 19.

One of the injured, Abu Sali, 45, said he is worried about his future. Speaking at Highland Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment for injury to his right hand after being hit by a bullet, he said: “Though I am innocent, I am named as an accused. This situation is really haunting me. I do not know how my brother (Saif) is managing to meet the mounting treatment cost. He added: “I do not know anything about the CAA.” Sali said he was at a photocopy shop located near the neighbourhood State Bank branch when he saw a lot of policemen. The shopkeeper then informed him of the impending protests. “At around 5 p.m., when I was going towards the bus stand [near the branch], I was hit by the bullet. Two others, who were going ahead of me, were also injured,” he said. A passerby bandaged his wound and brought him to the hospital at around 6 p.m., he said.

In Nehtaur, when Arshad Hussain said his son Anas had been “martyred”, a foreign journalist asked, “For what/whom?” Hussain was so distraught that he could not remember his own number. Someone noted it down on a piece of paper for the journalists gathered. Hussain retorted, “apne Hindustan ke liye (for India, his own country).”

100,2020/01/04,"Special provisions likely for J&K residents in jobs, land rights","The Centre is all set to provide protection to domiciles of Jammu and Kashmir in government jobs, educational institutions and land rights, a senior government official said on Friday.

The Centre is exploring the option of implementing the mandatory requirement of continuous stay in the region for a minimum of 15 years before applying for a job in government sector and admissions in schools and colleges in the Union Territory of J&K.

On August 6, Centre had revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution and downgraded and bifurcated the State into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh.

The two provisions of the Constitution that were revoked, let the J&K legislature decide the “permanent residents” of the State, prohibiting a non-J&K resident from buying property in the State and ensuring job reservation for its residents.

The official said special provisions were being examined on the lines of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The provisions pertain to regulating ownership and transfer of land to conserve the limited resources available for development.

The regulations also ensure that the State preserves its unique identity.

There are 12 States including Himachal Pradesh where provisions of special status under Article 371 of the Constitution apply.

The Hindu had reported on December 14 that Centre was considering a proposal to grant special status to J&K.

After the new UT of J&K was carved out, several groups in Jammu expressed concerns about losing special status and apprehension of losing land and jobs to outsiders.

“We are examining who will issue the notification, whether Centre or the J&K UT administration,” the official said.

Earlier, a Home Ministry official had denied that Jammu would be granted a UT status separately.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6xuc5q/article30473663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NF29T,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/special-provisions-likely-for-jk-residents-in-jobs-land-rights/article30473664.ece
101,2020/01/04,"Botcha defends BCG report on Capital, says Naidu instigating employees","Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana on Saturday reiterated that the YSR Congress Party government was committed to promoting three capitals with the Secretariat at Visakhapatnam, Assembly at Amaravati and High Court at Kurnool, with two camp offices for the Chief Minister.

Addressing a press conference at Tirupati, the Minister said development would be possible only with growth of cities. He said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was only correcting the mistakes done by TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu on the Capital issue.

“Mr. Naidu is deliberately instigating the employees to fight for Amaravati based on the Sivaramakrishna Committee report,” the Minister said and added that technically it was observed that Amaravati could not be the capital due to its irrigable lands. “Mr. Naidu should not stoop to the level of telling lies, while at the same time claiming seniority in politics,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

It was unfortunate that the TDP chief was claiming that proposals worth ₹52,000 crores were ready during its regime. But, ₹19,750 crore was spent on demolitions. About ₹331 crore was given to consultants, and still the TDP leaders were busy to get bills for ₹200 crore more, the Minister alleged.

The Minister said Mr. Naidu had no right to change the joint capital of Hyderabad, but he did it for his vested interests. Flaying the TDP chief’s criticism against BCG committee report, the Minister said that the report took the ground realities into consideration. “During demonetisation, it was Mr. Naidu who took the suggestion of the BCG. The same had given the route map for the NITI Aayog, and it had also extended its logistic support for participating in the various economic summits,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

Responding to a volley of questions, the Minister said that despite a plethora of problems, the government was committed to fulfilling all the promises made to the people. He said that it was the bounden duty of the government to address the water problem of Rayalaseema region. He said that the TDP’s corruption was glaring in housing schemes. “It is ridiculous on the part of Mr. Naidu to question the Chief Minister on the issue of stopping Pawan Kalyan,” he said.

Earlier, the Minister had darshan of Lord Shiva at Srikalahasti temple. Mild tension prevailed for a while at Srikalahasti when former SAAP chairman P.R. Mohan tried to obstruct the convoy of the Minister and to question him on the Amaravati issue. Later, the police intervened and cleared the way for him.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7s0wi2/article30481216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJBOTCHAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/botcha-defends-bcg-report-on-capital-says-naidu-instigating-employees/article30481217.ece
102,2020/01/04,Guntakal Railway staff get one-stop digital solution,"The employees of South Central Railway’s Guntakal Division have got a new portal that will serve as a One-Stop digital solution to cater to their requirements.

An online web portal named ‘Guntakal Division’ with a link from the South Central Railway Official Website www.scr.indianrailways.gov.in has four different sections: E-Subhakarya, E-Transfer, E-Gruha, E-Yatra that can be accessed by the employees according to their needs, a release from the Railways said.

Digital payment

While E-Subhakarya is for direct booking/allotment of Railway Institutes/community halls with the option of digital payment, E- Transfer is for registering transfer requests. This portal allows Inter-Railway, Inter-Divisional, Inter-Departmental requests. Acknowledgement is sent to the concerned employee through SMS and the requests are forwarded to the concerned supervisor.

E-Gruha is for allotment of railway quarters/change. Details of vacant/occupied quarters can also be viewed through this portal and E-Yatra is for issuing of Privilege Pass/Privilege Ticket Order (PTO) to employees/pensioners. A one-time registration is required and subsequently they can login directly through OTP received on the mobile number.

‘For transparency’

The system brings more transparency, uniformity in the working procedure and stems revenue leakage, the release said.

South Central Railway General Manager Gajanan Mallya said that staff welfare measures would be given due priority to boost the morale and confidence of the workforce.

“The web portal is accessible by the employees of all major railway stations, workshops, diesel sheds covering entire Guntakal Division. Employees working in Tirupati, Anantapur, Dharmavaram, Madanapalle, Chittoor, Kadapa, Raichur, etc., can access the online portal from their respective places without coming all the way to Divisional Headquarters,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/guntakal-railway-staff-get-one-stop-digital-solution/article30480893.ece

104,2020/01/04,"1,258 children rescued under Operation Muskaan","Operation Muskaan, undertaken by police teams in Ongole, Chittoor and Kurnool led to the rescue of 1,258 distressed children on Saturday.

In Ongole, SP Siddharth Kaushal said that 750 children were traced and given counselling. He also recalled that last time, on November 20, 2019, it was the Prakasam district police that stood first in the State by rescuing 423 children during Operation Muskaan. He said tough action would be taken against those recruiting children for work.

Success stories

Chinnaganjam Sub-Inspector Lakshmi Bhavani rescued a 11-year-old girl selling groundnuts near the railway gate and enrolled her in a local school there and helped her get all important documents.

In another case, Ballikurava Sub-Inspector Siva Nagaraju rescued seven boys working in granite quarries in the area, while S.N. Padu Circle Inspector rescued eight child workers.

In Kurnool. a total of 362 children were rescued in the special Operation Muskaan drive. Of them, 310 were boys and 52, girls. As many as 54 children were rescued in the Kurnool subdivision alone.

Addressing reporters on Saturday, Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli said that all the 79 police stations in district participated in the operation.

In Chittoor, the police teams rescued as many as 146 children, including eleven girls, from brick kilns, railway and bus stations, hotels and workshops, in Madanapalle, Palamaner, Chittoor, Puttur and Sri City police sub-divisions as part of the drive.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar told the mediapersons that special teams were formed to identify orphans, abandoned children, those who had run away from homes and those who were vulnerable to exploitation.

In Chittoor Corporation limits alone, the urban police rescued as many as 22 children after conducting searches in local railway station and bus station.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bfqz6i/article30480816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJCHILDREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1258-children-rescued-under-operation-muskaan/article30480817.ece
105,2020/01/04,Naidu rubbishes Boston report on development,"Terming the report of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the ‘Strategy for balanced and inclusive growth of Andhra Pradesh’ a rubbish, former Chief Minister and Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu has said it is an exercise to suit the interests of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

“The BCG has no credibility. As a consultant, it merely delivered what it’s client (A.P. Government) required,” he observed on Saturday while claiming that the panel headed by the then Municipal Administration Minister P. Narayana was mandated to draw up plans on the basis of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee recommendations. The same were followed by the TDP government.

Addressing the media at the TDP office near Mangalagiri, Mr. Naidu said Hyderabad was developed into a mega city along with Cyberabad and nine municipalities. On the similar lines, the TDP government had planned to transform the erstwhile Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri into a city that would be the State’s growth engine.“With the pooling of 33,000 acres, the problem of land was solved and with it all hurdles in the path of development of Amaravati have gone.”

The G.N. Rao Committee followed what the Principal Advisor to Chief Minister, Ajeya Kallam, directed to it, the TDP chief alleged. He said the TDP government worked hard for the development of all districts, including Visakhapatnam, which grew into a city of global standards during its (TDP) regime. “Balanced development was therefore a concept not unknown to the TDP.” Mr. Naidu objected to the comparison drawn between the countries which have multiple capitals and A.P. which has no capital city at all since bifurcation. He further said the government was obliged to honour the agreements entered with farmers and it also owed an explanation on the terms of reference given to the BCG and other details thereof.

He reiterated that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had gone back from his original stand on Amaravati that Vijayawada - Guntur region was the ideal location for development of the capital city.

‘Wrong belief’

The Chief Minister was apparently under the wrong belief that decentralisation of administration would facilitate development of all regions. He would pay a heavy price for his mistake and the TDP would stand by the aggrieved farmers and the five crore people of A.P. whose future was obviously linked to the capital.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-rubbishes-boston-report-on-development/article30480740.ece

Many were found at railway station platforms, bus stands, hotels, dhabas, auto stands and at other public places.

According to Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam Rural, Attada Babujee, the main intention of the operation was to ensure that children were not involved in any kind of labour works.

The deceased was identified as T. Basha Fakruddin of Class X and it was a miraculous escape for all the other students and teachers as the trees on the hill slope stopped the bus from falling into a 500-feet ravine. The bus, with 58 persons, fell into the valley while going from Jog Falls to Murudeswar at around 10.30 p.m. The Headmaster of the school, Rajendran, somehow broke the rear windshield of the vehicle and managed to bring six persons on to the road.

He got in touch with his relatives in Anantapur district, who in turn informed the police personnel here. By the time the Anantapur police got in touch with the Karnataka police, they were on their way to the spot and managed to rescue all those in the bus, Anantapur Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesubabu told The Hindu.

Shifted to hospital

Twelve of the injured were shifted to Manipal Hospital in Udupi, while some were treated at taluk government hospital in Honnavar. The team started for excursion on January 2 from Kadiri.

District Collector Gandham Chandrudu got in touch with his counterparts in Dharwad and ensured the injured got medical attention. He sent education officials to the accident spot with some cash to provide immediate relief to the injured students.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Shaik Lal Ahmed and Kadiri MLA P.V. Sidda Reddy arranged a bus from Kadiri to bring back the students. They are expected to reach by early hours of Sunday, as the majority of them were discharged in the afternoon.

108,2020/01/04,YSRCP govt. has no resources to implement schemes: Bandaru,"With the YSRCP government not releasing fee reimbursement amounts to educational institutions, lakhs of students are a worried lot as unless the government pays the dues they will not get hall tickets, former Minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy has said.

Though the government was announcing a slew of schemes it has no financial resources. The government promised to reimburse all the fees and besides ₹20,000 towards maintenance, he recalled. If the fee amounts were not reimbursed students belonging to Dalit, ST and weaker sections would suffer, he said.

He said the government lacked funds to implement the Rythu Bharosa scheme. Only 50% of the farmers received the full amount promised and the others only the Union government component, he said at a press conference he addressed with MLC Duvvarapu Rama Rao, here on Saturday. Linking of Aadhaar with bank account or lacking passbook were some of the excuses given for not crediting the money, he said. The YSRCP government was diverting the attention of people from its failure to fulfil its promises to the capital-related issues, he said.

Mr. Satyanaryaana Murthy said the government also lacked funds to implement the ‘Amma Vodi’ scheme under which incentive was given for enrolling children in school. It needed a total of ₹9,000 crore but had only ₹1,500 crore, he said wondering how the scheme would be launched on January 9.

Three capitals

The former Minister said the government was creating confusion in the name of three capitals. The G.N. Rao committee and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reports were mimicking what Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said in the Assembly. Instead of subjecting people to such confusion, the Chief Minister should speak out his mind, he said. He questioned the feasibility of locating heads of departments at various locations. Adani data centre and LuLu venture would have got huge employment in Visakhapatnam. If the available buildings in Visakhapatnam were used for the proposed Executive capital the move would preempt potential for other development, he said.

Mr. Rama Rao questioned the sanctity of BCG and said nobody knew when it was appointed.

The committee has P. Gopala Reddy (former CMD of A.P. Southern Power Distribution Company Limited) as Chairman and Rajagopal Reddy, Rama Rao and Usha Ramachandran as members, and AP-Genco Director (Finance) as convener.

Members of the APSEB Engineers’ Association (APSEBEA) and the electricity employees’ unions had expressed their concern over the takeover move at a meeting with Energy Secretary N. Srikant last week.

They are now hopeful that the expert committee will make a proper analysis and duly take their views into account before announcing remedial measures.

‘Let it be with Genco’

They are demanding that the RTPP should be retained as a State government utility (with AP-Genco) and not handed over to the NTPC, asserting that operational and performance issues can be sorted out. The basic argument is that RTPP can be turned around, and there is no need for outright sale.

The government’s observation is that the RTPP is suffering from multiple issues, including high unit cost, capital investments, and coal problem, and leaders of unions and associations of the A.P. power utilities have represented many issues that require an examination and consultation by experts.

The government has mandated the committee to submit its report within one month to take appropriate action.

The unions are arguing that the takeover of RTPP would leave the AP-Genco with a depleted generation capacity (to the extent of 1,650 MW) and its replenishment not only takes years but also the cost of power from new units in the future would be far higher.

It would, therefore, be a foolish decision to let the NTPC buy out RTPP, an office-bearer of APSEBEA opined, while pointing out that the RTPP stood all-India first in terms of PLF (97%) and bagged several awards for 11 years continuously from 1997.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/expert-committee-to-study-rtpp-problems/article30479660.ece
110,2020/01/04,Remarks against police: JC gets conditional bail,"Former Anantapur MP and TDP leader J.C. Diwakar Reddy, who had been accused of making derogatory remarks against the police personnel at a party meeting here on December 18, was granted conditional bail from a local court on Saturday.

Mr. Reddy was formally arrested after he surrendered before the Anantapur Rural Police and granted bail on producing personal surety bond and bonds of five others.

Based on the complaint lodged by the Police Officers’ Association, the police had booked a case under Section 153(A) and 506 of the IPC.

‘Don’t repeat comments’

When Mr. Reddy applied for anticipatory bail, the judge ordered him to personally go to the police station every second and fourth Sundays for three months, or until a charge-sheet was filed in the case.

Mr. Reddy furnished personal surety bond and had to be in the police station for more than a couple of hours as the procedure was on for granting bail after verification of the bonds. The court also asked Mr. Reddy not to repeat similar comments.

Mediapersons at receiving end

Meanwhile, mediapersons waiting outside the police station to take the version of Mr. Reddy as and when he emerged from the police station were at the receiving end as Rural Police Inspector D. Muralidhar Reddy harshly herded them onto the road and asked his men to record the proceedings. When the reporters pleaded for his statement in the case, Mr. Muralidhar refused to listen to them.

When the issue went to the notice of Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesubabu, he sent DSP G. Veraraghava Reddy to broker peace.

The DSP then gave a statement on the Diwakar Reddy case and promised to take action against the police personnel if they had behaved inappropriately with the mediapersons.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/remarks-against-police-jc-gets-conditional-bail/article30479546.ece
111,2020/01/04,JSP’s lone MLA supports three capitals idea,"In a major embarrassment to Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan, his party’s lone MLA Rapaka Varaprasad not only welcomed the three capitals idea but also termed it as the only solution in sight for the uniform development of all the three regions under the existing conditions, wherein the State was severely reeling under a financial crunch.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Varaprasad, who represents Razole constituency in the Assembly, said that being in the Opposition did not mean that one should oppose every move of the government.

“It has been our stance since the beginning to support all the initiatives taken in the interest of the people and resist those that do not benefit them,” he said.

‘Advantage north Andhra’

“It is an irrefutable fact that development was focused only in Hyderabad in the undivided State. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy looks determined not to repeat the mistake, and hence is toying with the idea of three capitals. The proposal to make Visakhapatnam an Executive capital will definitely contribute to eliminating the backwardness of the north Andhra region,” he asserted.

Ridiculing the argument that the farmers of Amaravati had voluntarily parted with their land for the development of the Capital city, the JSP leader said they were in fact taken over forcibly by the previous government.

“Though development and welfare are the two eyes of the government and go hand in hand, welfare alone without development will subject people of the State to miseries. The government has done enough for the welfare of the people and it is time to concentrate on development also,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jsps-lone-mla-supports-three-capitals-idea/article30479518.ece
112,2020/01/04,HPCL launches IMO compliant fuel,"The HPCL has announced meeting of the deadline set by the International Maritime Organisation to launch 0.5% global sulphur cap on fuel for ships in the areas which till December 31, 2019 were allowed to use fuel oil with 3.5% sulphur. This was part of resolve by IMO to ensure sale of clean and sustainable fuel to reduce maritime pollution by controlling sulphur dioxide emissions.

HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana launched the IMO compliant fuel in the presence of Director-Refineries Vinod S. Shenoy, Director- Marketing Rakesh Misri, Executive Director (direct sales) Ajit Singh and other top officials in the city on Thursday. The first batch of VLSFO is already produced in Visakh Refinery early December 2019, ahead of the deadline of January 1, 2020.

Mr. Surana said HPCL had always been in the forefront of providing cleaner and sustainable solutions. From January 1, 2020, the IMO enforced a 0.5% global sulphur cap on fuel for the areas which till December 31, 2019 were allowed to use fuel oil with 3.5% sulphur. In these areas, all ships are now required to use fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5%, unless they use exhaust gas cleaning systems like scrubbers.

Mr. Surana said the VLSFO would help the shipping companies respond to the tightening regulation on sulphur dioxide emissions by offering this IMO-2020 compliant marine fuel. The product meets the Residual Marine Grade (RMG) 0.50 specification and ISO 8217:2017 standard requirements.

Quality guidelines

This fuel also meets all quality guidelines detailed by the International Organization of Standardisation in its recently released ISO 23263:2019 standard.

HPCL owns and operates two major refineries strategically located in Visakhapatnam on the east coast and Mumbai on the west coast. To continue with its commitment towards environment protection, HPCL has undertaken measures at both refineries to produce BS-VI compliant transport fuels before the schedule stipulated.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hpcl-launches-imo-compliant-fuel/article30479373.ece

He participated as the guest speaker at a seminar on ‘Careers in management sector’ organised by The Hindu Future India Club (FIC) and KL B-School at BVK Degree College, Dwarakanagar here, on Friday.

During the hour-long interactive session, Mr. Srinivasa Rao emphasised on the importance of pursuing management education. Even if one gets employment immediately after graduation, it would be necessary for him or her to have a post graduate degree in their chosen field. A PG degree in management could be pursued by any graduate, irrespective of his/her specialisation at the UG level.

He explained as to how management principles could be applied in day-to-day life, citing examples like management of resources in order to derive the maximum benefit. He said that pursuing management degree through the distance mode may not really help, particularly in the beginning of one’s career.

A team of officials from KL University B-School informed the participants that KL Foundation was offering scholarships worth ₹5 lakh to the students who secure top 10 ranks in their entrance exam KL-MAT, even if they choose to join any other institute.

120,2020/01/04,"Set timeframe for speedy disposal of cases, says former DGP","Former Director General of Police C. Anjaneya Reddy has said that steps should be taken to ensure that all criminal cases are disposed of in one year and all civil cases in two years by taking up reforms like constituting Judicial Accountability Commission and National Judicial Appointments Commission.

Delivering the fifth D.Ch. Tirupathi Raju Memorial Lecture, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) and the Visakhapatnam Public Library on Friday, on ‘Criminal justice on trial.’ he spoke on the inordinate delay in the disposal of cases resulting in growing clamour for instant justice, the sluggish functioning of courts with 33 million cases pending and 40 % of posts in high courts being vacant.

Underlining the importance of accountability, he recalled the observation of Justice V. S. Malimath Committee on Criminal Justice System that judicial credibility was enhanced when it was transparent and accountable.

On the Supreme Court holding NJAA Act unconstitutional, he quoted Justice (rtd) J. Chalameswar who in his dissenting note commented that the primacy of judiciary in the appointment of judges was empirically flawed.

Reforms in law

Making out a case for changing outdated procedures, Mr. Anjaneya Reddy suggested that reforms, including decriminalising offences, particularly those relating to marital disputes, civil rights, making more and more simple offences compoundable, defining more ‘summary trail’ offences and making them punishable with substantial fine and introducing ‘plea-bargaining.’

To cut down delays in investigation, as suggested by various commissions, the order-keeping and crime investigation wings should be separated making the investigation wing independent or even autonomous.

On the ‘Disha’ case in Hyderabad, he said use of extralegal means was most unfortunate and would undermine the confidence of people in criminal justice system. The right way would be to amend the laws and make the system more effective. He said the Andhra Pradesh government bringing about the necessary amendments to the law and fixing investigation and trial of cases affecting women in a timeframe was a mature reaction.

He recalled his association with Tirupathi Raju, who headed several important organisations in Visakhapatnam besides working as secretary of the port trust.

CPS president A. Prasanna Kumar said the centre, acting as a bridge between various sections of people and the government, would organise a series of talks in its silver jubilee year. He described Tirupathi Raju as a good samaritan who would gladly associate himself with any public cause.

125,2020/01/04,BCG toes G.N. Rao panel line on Capital,"VI JAYAWADA

Two weeks after the G.N. Rao committee recommended that Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool be developed as cities representing three distinct capital functions, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) gave a similar advice in its report titled ‘Strategy for Balanced and Inclusive Growth in Andhra Pradesh’ which was submitted to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday.

Six development regions

Besides, the BCG segregated the State into six regions — Uttarandhra, Dakshinandhra, Godavari and Krishna deltas and East and West Rayalaseema — and mooted specific themes of development for them.

Briefing mediapersons on the BCG report, Commissioner and Director of Municipal Administration G.S.R.K.R. Vijaya Kumar said the BCG stated that the government of Andhra Pradesh had requested to look into a distributed capital model and it noted that countries/States considered distributed capitals to address regional aspirations and minimise the cost of capital set-up and facilitating ease of citizen access to government services like in Germany and South Korea.

Distributed Capital

Accordingly, the BCG prioritised Amaravati for Legislature, Visakhapatnam for Secretariat and Kurnool for High Court and provided relative advantages and disadvantages of each option around distributed capital with separation of Judiciary, Legislature and Executive across those cities.

Keeping the investment requirement (₹1 lakh crore as per the CRDA white paper dated June 2019) and a debt burden of ₹2.25 lakh crore in view, the BCG proposed that Amaravati region be developed as a hub for educational institutions, food and fisheries and hi-tech organic agriculture through cluster approach.

It (the BCG) has also stated that as per the technical studies jointly done by A.P. State Disaster Management Authority and IIT Madras, the area up to 5 km from the Krishna river front was highly prone to flooding/inundation and hence not recommended for constructions.

BCG suggested that agricultural realisation per unit of cultivated land should be focussed in nine districts outside Krishna-Godavari belt, per-capita industrial Gross Value Addition for seven out of 13 districts be improved, the need for increasing fish production in 11 districts be looked into and that Godavari-Penna linking and expansion of carrying capacity of canals in Rayalaseema are critical for increasing the irrigated land in the parched region.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bcg-toes-gn-rao-panel-line-on-capital/article30473625.ece

Speaking to presspersons at a helipad near Halebid on Saturday, he said he would begin budget meetings next week. “I will hold review meetings of all departments and decide on new schemes and projects,” he said.

Regarding the Prime Minister’s visit, he said it was his duty to present the State’s demands before him. “The Prime Minister has responded to the demands positively. He has suggested that I visit Delhi and hold talks with Ministers about the State’s requirements,” he said.

Mr. Yediyurappa was in Halebid to inaugurate Pushpagiri Utsav. Speaking after inaugurating the utsav, he said the State government was committed to the welfare of the farming community. The State Cabinet would soon give clearance to the project to fill up 11 tanks of Belur taluk at a cost of ₹125 crore. The government would take up development of tanks in Salagame hobli of Hassan taluk, he said. He also assured a grant of ₹5 crore to the Rural Development Scheme launched by Pushpagiri mutt.

127,2020/01/04,State student among CAT 2019 toppers,"Ten candidates across the country, one of whom is from Karnataka, scored 100 percentile in the Common Admission Test (CAT), the results of which were declared on Saturday.

The test is a gateway to management programmes in top business schools, including IIMs. According to a release from the Indian Institute of Management-Kozhikode, which conducted CAT-2019, 21 candidates in India scored an overall 99.99 percentile.

Bengaluru engineer Sushant Thombre, who got 99.99 percentile, was happy to be among the toppers in his second attempt. “I was not serious in my first attempt last year where I had scored a little over 99 percentile. I was in my last year of college. However, this year I took it more seriously,” said Thombre, who works at a private firm in Marathahalli.

The National Institute of Technology (NIT) Nagpur-graduate wants to study finance at any of the top Indian Institute of Managements. “IIM-Ahmedabad or IIM-Bangalore are my preferences. CAT is not an extensive study-oriented exam like the UPSC. With regular practice and strong basics, one can get a high score,” he said, and added that he gave over 20 mock tests.

Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section this year was tough and that he had not predicted. “That came as a bit of a surprise,” he said.

Several of the toppers in Bengaluru are engineers. Rohan Patnaik, who works at a private firm in the city, scored 99.92 percentile. A computer science graduate from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, he wants to pursue MBA in either finance or information system management as he has a background in computer science. “I gave over a 40 mock tests. Strategy and time management in CAT is important,” he said.

Manish Chandra, another Bengaluru-based engineer, who scored 99.46, said that attempting as many mock tests as one can is the key to success. “If you look at past three years’ papers, Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension was not that difficult compared to the two sections. However, this year, it was very difficult and time consuming. I have scored more in the quantitative part,” he said.

Many students, who cleared CAT, said they had found the English paper more difficult than Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning.

Srinivas Akkapeddi of Career Launcher said that CAT 2019 was easier when compared with the last two years. “This time, two sections were easy. Nobody expected Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension to be that difficult,” he said.

CAT 2019 was conducted on November 24 at 376 test centres across 156 cities in India. It had the highest number of entrants in the last 10 years. CAT is a three-hour examination comprising three sections — Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Quantitative Ability, and Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/odtv4h/article30480945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGMANISHCHANDRATOPPER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-student-among-cat-2019-toppers/article30480947.ece
128,2020/01/04,"With new riders, no funds for Chikkamagaluru literary event","The selection of chairperson for the district-level Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Chikkamagaluru has turned into a controversy with the Kannada Sahitya Parishat insisting that its district unit submit approval letters from the district in-charge Minister and Deputy Commissioner to get funds released for the event.

The organisers are unable to get this letter, and therefore no funds, with Minister in-charge of Chikkamagaluru C.T. Ravi, also Minister for Kannada and Culture, opposed to the choice of Karnataka Sahitya Academy awardee Kalkuli Vittal Heggade as president of the 16th district-level Kannada Sahitya Sammelan scheduled to be held in Sringeri on January 10 and 11.

The insistence on letter has come about after protests over selection of Mr. Heggade were held by right-wing groups. With days left for the sammelan, this has created financial problems for the organisers.

Manu Baligar, president of Kannada Sahitya Parishat, said that he will not interfere in the selection of the chairperson, but insisted that these letters were mandatory. Mr. Baligar said he would need a “clearance” from the district administration to release the grant.

The department provides grants for activities of the Parishat. “The Minister himself told me there was a tense situation prevailing in the district and suggested holding the event three-four months later. I have asked the district president to get a clearance from the district magistrate (DC) and a letter from the Minister. I will release funds within 24 hours of getting the letters,” said Mr. Baligar.

He argued that in a democracy, he would have to listen to elected representatives. The central unit of Kannada Sahitya Parishat provides ₹5 lakh for a district-level sammelan.

Ashok Kundur, president of Sahitya Parishat’s Chikkamagaluru district unit, said he had requested the Minister for a letter of recommendation for the funds, but he refused to give one. “The parishat’s central unit president has sought letter from the district Minister to release funds. It has not been the practice so far. There is no such rule,” he said.

With only a few days to hold the event, the district unit of the Parishat should have got the funds by this time. “Anyhow, we will hold the event, despite the difficulties. Our people are raising funds. If not a grand event, we will ensure a simple and meaningful programme,” Mr. Ashok said. He also ruled out the possibility of changing the president of the sammelan.

129,2020/01/04,Karnataka Nataka Academy announces new list of awardees,"The new leadership of the Karnataka Nataka Academy, nominated by the incumbent BJP government, has cancelled the list of awardees announced by the academy last year and come up with a new one on Saturday.

The Lifetime Achievement Award was announced to senior actor and Congress politician Umashree in July 2019. This had come under criticism as the previous president of the academy was appointed by Ms. Umashree during the Congress regime when she was Minister for Kannada and Culture.

Award for G.V. Sharada

The academy on Saturday announced the award to another senior actor, G.V. Sharada. It also announced annual theatre awards to 25 artists, scrapping the previous list.

This has drawn the ire of many in theatre circles. Senior theatre personality K. Marulasiddappa said this was an “undemocratic move” by the new leadership of the academy. A former chairperson of the Kuvempu Bhasha Bharati himself, he said all academies in the State followed a precedence of honouring the work of the previous leadership. “This move by the academy has put deserving artists, both those whose names were announced by the previous leadership and those announced now, in an embarrassing spot as awards to them have now been tarnished by politics,” he said.

But Bhimsen, the current president of the academy, has defended the move. “The previous committee announced the awards on July 29, 2019, the last day of their tenure. This was in violation of the set norms,” he said. “It was a unanimous decision in the committee to ensure a wrong precedent was not set and it was corrected. So we have taken this decision,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r5qxns/article30480904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMARULASIDDAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-nataka-academy-announces-new-list-of-awardees/article30480905.ece
130,2020/01/04,Hurdles in payment of Dasara sports prize money cleared,"The hurdles in the payment of prize money to the winners of Dasara Sports 2019 held in October last year were cleared after the delay in payment was raised during the visit of Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna to the city on Friday.

The prize money to all the 1,451 prize winners will be sent to their respective bank accounts through RTGS or Real-Time Gross Settlement. The recipients included 726 individual prize winners and 725 team event winners.

“The process of transferring prize money to their accounts had already begun”, said an official statement. A total of ₹54 lakh had been released to facilitate the payment.

The statement from the Information Department in Mysuru came after the delay was brought to the notice of Mr. Somanna when he arrived to inaugurate the district-level sports meet for State Government employees at Chamundi Vihar Stadium on Friday.

An angry Mr. Somanna sought out the Assistant Director of the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports (DYES) in Mysuru, K. Suresh, and lashed out at him for the lapse in the presence of Additional Chief Secretary, DYES, Kalpana G., while Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, Chamaraja MLA L. Nagendra and President of State Government Employees Association, Mysuru District, H.K. Ramu.

Claiming that he had already sanctioned ₹7 crore to the Department, Mr. Somanna suspected that the money had been siphoned off by the officials and directed his ire at Mr. Suresh. He even asked Ms .Kalpana to suspend Mr Suresh.

Later, Mr. Suresh explained that the DYES head office in Bengaluru had retained the responsibility of distributing the prize money. “They had started sending the prize money to the bank accounts of the winners from December 6. The process is under way. Sometimes, there are technical hurdles in the transfer of the money, which have to be individually sorted out”, he told The Hindu.

However, he clarified that the task of distribution of the prize money was entirely with the Department’s head office in Bengaluru and he had no role in the matter. Also, the ₹7 crore sanctioned by the Minister is the annual grant to the Department, which is released in four quarterly instalments.

He said the fact of the matter had been communicated to the Minister through the Department’s Commissioner and other senior officials.

Mr. Suresh, however, said he was responsible for clearing the bills pertaining to accommodation, transport and catering during Dasara 2019. Upto 60 per cent of the amount had been cleared and the remaining 40 per cent will also be cleared as soon as the money is received, he said. Most of the bills of the small businesses providing their services during the Dasara sports had been cleared while only the bills of major hotels were pending.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hurdles-in-payment-of-dasara-sports-prize-money-cleared/article30479759.ece
131,2020/01/04,Submit report on unauthorised religious structures by Jan. 31: DC,"Dharwad district officials have been asked to complete the survey on unauthorised religious structures and submit a report to the district administration by January 31.

Chairing a meeting of officials on the survey of illegal religious structures in public places in Dharwad on Saturday, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Deepa Cholan gave instructions on the things to keep in mind while conducting the survey.

She asked the village accountants to submit a detailed report on religious structures located in public places, on roads, and in gardens to the respective tahsildars.

The officials of Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) should submit their report to the Municipal Commissioner, she said.

The Deputy Commissioner said that the High Court of Karnataka has taken a suo motu case in this regard and was regularly reviewing the progress achieved on shifting of unauthorised religious structures which were causing hardships to motorists and general public.

The Chief Secretary had issued directions to all the Deputy commissioners to complete the survey by January 31, she told the meeting.

Ms. Cholan said that after receiving reports from their subordinates, the respective tahsildars would have to prepare a comprehensive report on such illegal structures in their jurisdiction and submit a report to the district administration in the first week of February.

She said that she would then, based on the reports, prepare a comprehensive report on the number of unauthorised religious structures in the district and submit the same to the Home Ministry before March 15.

Ms. Cholan said that the Supreme Court in its order had set September 29, 2009, as the cut-off date for the survey.

All the unauthorised religious structures which have come up in public place after this date would find a mention on the list. Citizens could also give information on such unauthorised structures to the officials and their identity would not be disclosed.

According to a preliminary report, there are 330 unauthorised structures in Dharwad district.

However the officials would have to verify whether these structures come under the purview of Department of Muzrai and Wakf.

The Hubballi-Dharwad Urban Development Authority (HDUDA) should also designate its employees for conducting survey on such unauthorised structures in public spaces belonging to the authority, she said.

Superintendent of Police Varthika Katiyar said that the police would provide security cover to the employees conducting the survey and she said that criminal cases would be filed against those who try to create hurdles for the survey.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/submit-report-on-unauthorised-religious-structures-by-jan-31-dc/article30479671.ece
132,2020/01/04,Engg. students told to bring tech innovations for villages,"Engineering graduates should bring about technology innovations with focus on rural areas since the country’s population predominantly lives in villages, Ashok G. Nijagannavar, Judge, High Court of Karnataka, said on Saturday

“Innovation of agriculture implements has helped farm sector to a large extent. We need hundreds of such innovations that are simple and sustainable in a rural context. Rather than agriculture tools designed in the West, we need tools that are simple, repairable by local technicians and usable without electricity,” he said in his address at the 10th Graduation Day of Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE) here.

The Judge, who was the chief guest, said innovation is a key managerial strategy for growth and emphasis should be laid on various dimensions of innovations such as process innovation, product innovation, business model innovation and new technology innovation. Strong capabilities in designing and building machine tools are particularly critical. Also, industry must develop close partnerships with universities and research institutions to take this aspiration forward, he suggested.

Mr. Nijagannavar said engineers are called nation builders as they play a very important role in every walk of life. They convert knowledge of basic sciences into products and are versatile minds who build bridges between sciences, technology and society. Engineers contribute to the nation’s technological and industrial progress. They help improve living conditions for the common people. The innovation capability of our scientists and engineers will play a critical role in enabling our country to reach greater heights, he opined.

“What we need today more than anything else is moral leadership – founded on courage, intellectual integrity and a sense of values. There is no replacement for a sense of values,” he observed.

Observing that a nation cannot live by the gross national product (GNP) alone, the Judge said the quality of life is far more important. In a free democracy like ours, the quality of life is to a large extent determined by the availability of basic human rights and civil liberties, which are placed in the chapter on fundamental rights in our Constitution.

“I have no doubt that as the years go by you will become more and more conscious of how far-sighted our Constitution-makers were in guaranteeing these fundamental rights to our people, because without them the quality of life would be gravely impaired,” he said, in his address to the students.

A total of 874 BE and one MCA students received their degrees for the year 2018-19 at the graduation day. Also, 21 medals were awarded to meritorious students, including 12 medals for students who have scored highest marks in respective branches. Nine were endowment medals.

133,2020/01/04,"Mysuru better poised for Swachh Survekshan 2020, says MCC","The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is better poised for Swachh Survekshan survey 2020 leading to clean city rankings compared to last year due to two major infrastructure works that have received government approval.

While the MCC has received in-principal approval to invite tenders for installation of bio-mining facility to clear the 2 lakh tonnes of legacy waste, the construction and building debris waste recycling plant will also see the light of the day.

MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde said on Saturday that compared to the 2019 survey, the local body was better placed this year in terms of infrastructure and the lacunae that were observed by the third-party auditors have been plugged.

The DPR for the C and D plant is ready and is expected to be functional during the course of the year. The plant will come up at Koppluru near the Outer Ring Road close to the existing truck terminal. It will have a capacity to handle and recycle 100 tonnes of debris per day.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), which is conducting the survey, takes into account the infrastructure facilities for which the DPR will be ready and hence the city is expected to secure additional marks on this count.

Similarly, the legacy wastewill be cleared through bio-mining and the DPR for the plant was prepared sometime ago. However, it was beset with procedural delays over financial issues. The district in-charge Minister V. Somanna has promised to get ₹18 crore released so as to complete the facility. Both the plants should be functional within an year.

The legacy waste accumulated at the Sewage Farm had emerged as a major eyesore for the city and was emerging as a health hazard for the residents of Vidyaranyapuram, J.P. Nagar, Visveshwarnagar and surrounding areas. Mysuru generates around 500 tonnes of waste daily of which nearly 200 tonnes is handled by the existing solid waste recycling plant. But the untreated waste, which has accumulated over years, has grown to nearly 2 lakh tonnes. But with the installation of the bio-mining facility the waste can be cleared and the entire land can be environmentally reclaimed through bio-remediation process.

Last year, Mysuru had secured 4,378 marks out of 5,000 and the MCC said the above two facilities will help bridge the gap significantly. The MCC has also installed sanitary napkin machines and incinerators in all the ladies toilets in the city which was not the case last year. This initiative is also expected to help achieve higher marks leading to better ranking. Mysuru was adjudged the 3rd cleanest city in the country and hence the MCC is striving to regain the top slot which it achieved in 2016.

Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath said Mysuru fell behind in citizens’ feedback and hence appealed to the people of the city to give their response to the online survey on the Swachh Survekhan website. The MCC will also conduct a public awareness drive on the survey and have extensive interactions with educational institutions, NGOs, doctors, lawyers, hotel owners and other professional bodies in the days ahead. She said My Waste-My Responsibility should be the motto of the citizens to ensure a clean Mysuru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-better-poised-for-swachh-survekshan-2020-says-mcc/article30479102.ece
134,2020/01/04,Waste segregation at source: MCC for public compliance,"In a bid to ensure better compliance with rules regarding waste segregation at source, the MCC is toying with the idea of adopting a unique strategy in the days ahead.

The pourakarmikas entrusted with garbage collection will park the garbage collection vehicle in front of such recalcitrant households and segregate the waste in front of their houses.

MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde told mediapersons on the sidelines of a programme on Saturday that this may bring about a change in the attitude and mindset of the people who are still failing to comply with the minimum requirement of waste segregation. If this approach fails, authorities will be left with no alternative but to penalise them, he added.

In an interaction with mediapersons, the authorities admitted that they have issues in collection, transportation and recycling of waste but efforts were on to attain higher standards. The MCC has also sounded out the bulk waste generators including apartments, choultries, and hotels to make arrangements for recycling waste and many have already complied with it.

The MCC has started penalising bulk waste generators and those littering in public and ₹6 lakh has been collected by way of fine during the last 3 months. It will be intensified in the days ahead, said the Commissioner.

Apart from garbage clearance, the city authorities will also take up beautification of 14 main roads. The medians will be decorated and flower pots with decorative and ornamental plants will be installed.

Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath played down the differences between councillors and officials and said they are all for Mysuru regaining the cleanest city tag again and would strive for it.

Baba rushed to the spot and tried to pacify them by telling them that a complaint had been lodged against him.

Mr. Vivek said though he lodged the complaint on Friday night, the police registered the FIR on Saturday “after pressure mounted from all sides”.

Addressing the protest meet on the premises of Deputy Commissioner's office, Kagodu Thimmappa, former Minister, alleged that the CAA proposes to accord citizenship on the basis of religion and was discriminatory by nature.

He said the CAA was a ‘ploy’ by the BJP-led government at the Centre to divert the attention of common people from its failure to address problems such as unemployment and economic slowdown. Expressing displeasure over the Centre being engaged in “negative politics,” he said that though Karnataka and other States suffered huge loss owing to flood and heavy rain, the Centre was trying to create rift in the society in the name of CAA instead of taking measures to compensate the affected families, .

H.S. Sundaresh, president of SDCC, flayed the alleged intimidating tactics adopted by the Central and State governments to suppress protests against CAA. Protests and voice of dissent form the essence of democracy but unfortunately the Central and States governments have turned insensitive and intolerant towards them, he said.

The protesters raised slogans demanding the Centre to immediately withdraw the CAA. They also submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister and Chief Minister of Karnataka though the office of Deputy Commissioner.

141,2020/01/04,BJP accused of spreading lies about SDPI and PFI,"Accusing the BJP of spreading canards against organisations such as the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Popular Front of India (PFI), Afsar Kodlapet, State general secretary of SDPI, said on Friday that the Uttar Pradesh government was trying to ban PFI.

Addressing presspersons here, he said that PFI was doing nothing that many other organisation in the country were in opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Holding protest against CAA and NRC cannot become grounds for banning any organisation. If that is the case, then the government should ban every other organisation and party sternly opposing [them],” he said.

Stating that the BJP’s objective was to malign the image of PFI and SDPI by projecting the organisations in a bad light, Mr. Kodlapet asserted that neither has been involved in any kind of anti-social or anti-national activity.

He also rubbished the claims of BJP leaders that the organisations have links with terrorist organisations such as the Islamic State (IS).

“The BJP, which is making allegations against us, has been in power at the Centre for six years. So why has it not found any evidence to corroborate its claim? BJP simply wants to spread lies about these organisations and nothing else,” he said.

Accusing the saffron party of trying to gag people opposing CAA and NRC, Mr. Kodlapet said that since the government had “completely failed” in controlling the falling Indian economy, it was raising issues such as NRC and CAA to divert the public’s attention.

“The priority of the government should be to provide employment to the people, control price rise and implement welfare schemes. But since the BJP has failed on all fronts and cannot face the people on these critical issues, it is tactfully trying to divert attention,” he said.

Condemning the police firing in Mangaluru in December where two persons were killed during anti-CAA protests, he demanded that the government immediately take action against P.S. Harsha, the Mangaluru Police Commissioner.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-accused-of-spreading-lies-about-sdpi-and-pfi/article30474085.ece

144,2020/01/04,"Minister arrives late to meeting, sees red over absentee officials","The Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) review meeting held here on Friday turned out to be a stage for district in-charge Minister V. Somanna to assert his authority over officials and repeatedly proclaim his “40 years of experience in politics”.

The Minister turned up late by an hour and, after a perfunctory apology, took up the role of a schoolteacher and called out the names of the heads of 29 departments who were supposed to attend the meeting.

As the Minister began reading out their names as if to mark their attendance, the hapless officials stood up to signal their presence and introduced themselves. Mr. Somanna sought to know their designation and rank, and whether they were district-level officials.

At least three department heads were absent, and taking umbrage to this, the Minister sought an explanation from their assistants who had been deputed to attend the meeting. In one case, the department head was out of town following the death of a relative. But Mr. Somanna instructed the deputy to call the official over phone and later spoke to him from the stage to ascertain whether he was indeed speaking the truth.

Another official was absent as he had to attend court proceedings. Mr. Somanna lashed out at the deputy and said, “Ask your boss to come to the meeting immediately. The court case can always be adjourned.” He then instructed the deputy to leave the meeting hall.

PWD engineers were conspicuous by their absence and an incensed Mr. Somanna asked for an explanation. On learning that they were in Bengaluru to attend a meeting called by Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, Mr. Somanna immediately called the latter, first to ascertain whether such a meeting had indeed been convened and then to express his ire over it. He asked Mr. Karjol to relieve the district-level officials from Mysuru so that they could return to the city and attend the meeting, which he said would go on till 6 p.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/awjkom/article30473961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMYSSOMANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-arrives-late-to-meeting-sees-red-over-absentee-officials/article30473962.ece

K.S. Eshwarappa, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Araga Jnanendra, MLA for Tirthahalli, Shafi Saduddin, senior assistant director of the Department of Information and Public Relations, and Umesh, assistant director of the Department of Kannada and Culture, were present.

Mr. Javali said that when dramas are staged at Suvarna Samskruti Bhavan, direct buses would be provided to the venue from main residential areas in the city. Discussions would be held with officials of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private bus operators in this regard shortly.

Replying to a query he said to attract common people to the theatre, efforts would be made to stage the dramas based on simple and humorous themes through Rangayana.

Mr. Eshwarappa said the State government has released an amount of ₹20 lakh for completion of the work of the construction of an open air theatre at Kuvempu Rangamandir. He assured that he would apprise the Chief Minister on the demand from theatre artistes to construct a separate rehearsal room at Kuvempu Rangamandir.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-shivamogga-rangayana-director-takes-charge/article30473921.ece

The action came on the direction of district in-charge and Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan, who paid a surprise visit to the hostel on Thursday night and found Mr. Panchal absent. He also noticed that the hostel was not clean. Mr. Panchal’s phone was switched off and he was not available in person till Friday. Thus, his absence during the Minister’s visit was considered to be deliberate.

Mr. Panchal is allowed to get suspension allowances as per the rules.

Mr. Chavan, who had his dinner at the hostel on Thursday night and even stayed there, discussed with the students the facilities and the food provided at the hostel. The Minister subsequently directed officials to stay in hostels at night and also suggested that the DC supervise the running of hostels.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hostel-warden-suspended-in-yadgir-district/article30473864.ece
147,2020/01/04,Mysuru’s legacy waste to be cleared through biomining,"The people of Mysuru can heave a sigh of relief as the legacy waste of nearly 2 lakh tonnes accumulated at the treatment plant in J.P. Nagar will be cleared through biomining.

District in-charge Minister V. Somanna assured that the project would be expedited at the KDP review meeting on Friday. He said that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had already given his consent. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, who raised the subject at the meeting, urged the Minister to take a final decision. Mr. Somanna said that he had already sought concurrence from the CM to go ahead and they could start the process for inviting the tenders.

Mr. Somanna said that he will lead a delegation comprising the local MP, MLAs and officials to the CM on Monday where a detailed presentation on the issue and the proposed solution will be made. “I will follow and secure the requisite government orders to kickstart the project,” he added.

The district administration and MCC officials had recently visited Nagpur to study a biomining facility there. Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar who made a brief presentation of the visit said Nagpur has a legacy waste of 1 million tonnes as against 2 lakh tonnes of legacy waste in Mysuru and installation of the infrastructure in Mysuru would cost around ₹18 crore.

Meanwhile, the authorities submitted a report on the Nagpur visit and having apprised themselves of the functioning of the bioremediation facility, have expressed confidence that a project with similar capacity can clear the legacy waste in Mysuru in less than a year. If the installed capacity of the bioremediation facility is 1,000 tonnes per day, then 2 lakh tonnes can be effectively treated and cleared in about 250 days, as per the report. The site can also be environmentally reclaimed through bioremediation.

Mysuru produces nearly 450 to 500 tonnes of waste daily but the installed capacity of the existing solid waste treatment plant at J.P. Nagar is about 200 tonnes. The rest adds to the accumulated waste that has become a health hazard for residents who have been waging a protracted struggle seeking the relocation of the existing plant.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uhn20y/article30473859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMYSURUBIO-MINING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysurus-legacy-waste-to-be-cleared-through-biomining/article30473860.ece
148,2020/01/04,Expedite housing projects for flood victims and tribals: Minister,"District in-charge and Housing Minister V. Somanna said on Friday that housing projects for tribals and for people who lost their dwellings in the recent floods would be expedited.

Speaking at a Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) review meeting held here, the Minister sought information pertaining to the number of tribal people in various hamlets who were without suitable housing. Mr. Somanna said he would stay in a tribal haadi during his next visit to H.D. Kote and apprise himself of their living conditions.

The Minister also took exception to the delay in completion of houses at Bidarahalli, which was ravaged by floods last year. Though officials tried to explain the technicalities entailing land ownership, he brushed them aside and said such matters should be resolved at the district level with the Deputy Commissioner as the head.

Completing civic works

MLA for Varuna Yathindra complained that the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) had left a lot of infrastructure works, mainly UGD, incomplete. He said this followed a Government Order directing MUDA to confine itself to areas coming under urban limits and not venture into rural areas.

The MUDA Commissioner, Kantharaj, was questioned about the pending works and subsequently directed to complete the projects that were already under way and not leave them incomplete. All essential works pertaining to road repair, UGD and streetlights should be taken up on a priority basis and completed. Paucity of funds is not an excuse, the Minister said.

Officials informed the elected representatives that projects worth ₹63 crore had been taken up and were in various stages of completion.

Buildings for GPs

Some of the elected representatives expressed concern over lack of office buildings for gram panchayats. Mr. Somanna sought a list of such gram panchayats in the district and said he would ensure that funds are released for their construction.

Pratap Simha, MP for Mysuru, expressed concern that people in the rural hinterland were being made to run from pillar to post even for basic works and were unable to avail many benefits as officials were playing truant. Subsequently, Mr. Somanna directed the officials to hold taluk-level adalats once in 15 days. The Minister also sought monthly progress reports on the implementation of various projects.

Officials were also instructed to ensure that UGD is connected to septic tanks and treatment plants and untreated water is not discharged into canals or lakes. Mysuru still retains its natural beauty, and its waterbodies should not be used to flush out sewage, the Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/expedite-housing-projects-for-flood-victims-and-tribals-minister/article30473833.ece

He had filed the petition before the judge on Tuesday. The special court accepted the prosecution’s stance that there was sufficient evidence against the actor. The court also rejected the discharge petition of Vishnu, ninth accused in the case.

The actor is likely to approach the Kerala High Court stating that he should be removed from the list of accused in the case. Dileep was arraigned as an accused in the rape case which was reportedly committed in Kochi in February 2017. He was later released on bail.

The actor had recently roped in an expert to examine the authenticity of the visuals of the alleged rape that were captured in the memory card of a mobile phone after the Supreme Court allowed his petition. However, the court had directed that he shall not copy or record or tamper with the visuals.

151,2020/01/04,Explosives stacked at Maradu flats,"Around 215 kg of explosives have been stacked at the H2O Holy Faith apartment complex which is set for demolition in Maradu here. The consignment arrived on Saturday morning.

R. Venugopal, deputy chief controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, said the explosives material was used to fill 1,471 holes at H2O Holy Faith. The apartment complex is being demolished on an order from the Supreme Court for violation of Coastal Regulation Zone norms. Three other complexes too will be demolished as per the Supreme Court order last year.

The H2O Holy Faith complex will be brought down around 11 a.m. on January 11, the Alfa Serene complex by 11.30 on January 11, Jain Coral Cove at 11 a.m. on January 12, and Golden Kayaloram will be demolished at 2 p.m. on January 12, according to a schedule fixed by the expert committee monitoring the operations.

Jain Coral Cove will require 395 kg of explosives, Golden Kayaloram about 15 kg, and Alfa Serene’s twin towers will require 200 kg each.

Complaints persist

Those living near the apartment complexes marked for demolition have been complaining about their concerns not being addressed by the district administration.

K.R. Shaji, living near Alfa Serene Tower II, said the residents were not sure about the extent of damage that would be caused by the explosions. While the government had virtually rejected their plea for total compensation, the authorities had not heeded a demand that the complexes around which there are fewer residents be demolished first to assess the impact on the surrounding areas.

Decision on schedule

Vice chairman of the Maradu municipality Boban Nedumparambil said a decision on the people’s plea for a change in the schedule of demolition would be taken at a meeting convened by the district administration late Saturday evening.

The government has sought approval and funds for the project being executed on cost-sharing basis by the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL), a joint venture company between the State and Railways.

The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the SHSR, which has been given in-principle approval by the Centre, will be submitted in the first half of the financial year, Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran said in the wish list submitted to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal.

Priority projects

153,2020/01/04,Transgenders raise the adoption question,"Though Kerala came up with a transgender policy in 2015, many socio-legal problems of sexual minorities are yet to be addressed, according to LGBTQ activists.

“Marriage and adoption of children are still a huge issue for sexual minorities,” says Vijayaraja Mallika, transwoman poet and winner of the Vayalar Ramavarma Poetry Award 2019, who got married recently. To get married, transgenders have to cross many hurdles. Even if they are transman or transwoman, they have to procure the identity cards of ‘cismale’ and ‘cisfemale’ to get married. Otherwise they can live together, but the relationship will not be legal, she noted.

“The online form for adoption does not even have a third option, other than male and female. Leave alone the huge financial burden for such legal adoptions, the rules do not allow sexual minorities to legally adopt children,” Ms. Shyam noted.

Vijayaraja Mallika, first transwoman poet in Malayalam and winner of Vayalar Ramavarma Award for poetry in 2019

Illegal adoptions

But illegal adoptions are common among transgender community. In some places in Tamil Nadu, people who are not in a position to take care of their children leave them with the transgender community. Adoption is also common there. But there is no legal validity for such adoptions.

What the sexual minorities in the State would like to have is gender policy. “More than an exclusive LGBTQ policy, we need a gender policy, which does not discriminate against a community. The Constitution promises equal rights for every citizen, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation,” says Ms. Shyam.

The gender policy should address all socio-legal issues of sexual minorities including marriage, adoption of children and employment, she added. Coming down heavily on the National Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act -2019, both Ms. Mallika and Ms. Shyam say the Bill not only failed to protect the rights of the transgenders but also strip them of the existing rights.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/txebtp/article30483687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sheethal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/transgenders-raise-the-adoption-question/article30481170.ece
154,2020/01/04,NCP to take up Kerala unit leadership issue,"A meeting of the State functionaries and national leaders of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in mid-January will take a call on the issue of finding a president for the party in Kerala in the wake of the death of the incumbent president Thomas Chandy last month.

Senior leader Praful Patel told The Hindu over the phone that he intended to call a meeting of Kerala leaders of the party in Delhi around January 16 to discuss the issue. “Until then, T.P. Peethambaran will function as stand-in president,” he said.

Kappan’s role

Rumours have been flying thick and fast about the newly elected legislator from Pala, Mani C. Kappan lobbying for a ministerial berth in the State Cabinet. Mr. Kappen, however, told The Hindu that he would neither seek a ministerial berth nor become the party chief in Kerala now. “I did not meet Mr. Pawar after my election, since he was busy with the Maharashtra election. That is why I met him last week. I did not seek ministership. But when asked if I could lead the party in the State, I politely turned it down as my priority is to take good care of my constituency,” he said.

Discussions are rife over a possible organisational rejig in the party. “But that is very unlikely before the organisational elections about seven to eight months away,” said a senior State leader, who thought it was very likely that Mr. Peethambaran would be made acting president till then.

However, Transport Minister and NCP leader A.K. Saseendran’s meeting with party supremo Sharad Pawar on Saturday added grist to rumour mills, which said a change in party leadership in Kerala was imminent. Talking to The Hindu from Mumbai, Mr. Saseendran said it was just a visit to invite Mr. Pawar for his son’s wedding. “It was just a personal visit and there was no political discussion,” he said. Asked if the post of president would be filled soon, he said there was no discussion to that effect within the party in Kerala either.

“But then we will not go on without a president for long as the Kerala BJP has been doing,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncp-to-take-up-kerala-unit-leadership-issue/article30481150.ece
155,2020/01/04,Pariyaram Medical College students go on indefinite strike,"Over 300 students pursuing courses in the Kannur Medical College Pariyaram are on an indefinite strike after they were prevented from entering the classroom for not paying the fees as demanded by the college.

The protesting students alleged that despite the government taking over the college, the authorities were forcing them to pay the higher fees as were being collected before the takeover.

The protesters argued that they would not pay the fees until the government came out with the fee structure for the academic year.

The students undergoing courses in the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), Bachelor of Dental Surgery, Bachelor of Pharmacy, PharmD, nursing, postgraduates, and house surgeons, who joined in 2018 were prevented from entering classes.

“While MBBS students who joined under merit in 2019 here have to pay the government fee of ₹25,000, the authorities are compelling the students who joined in 2018 to pay ₹5.60 lakh plus a special fee of ₹40,000,” said a student on conditions of anonymity.

He said they were prevented from entering the classrooms since January 1 and this was an act of injustice as the college was no more run by the cooperative society but by the government.

He said the Supreme Court had rejected the fee structure as determined by the Rajendra Babu Committee. However, the college authorities were forcing the students to pay the same fees in violation of the verdict. The government too had promised that it would not collect the higher fees.

They demanded that either the government should form a fee fixation committee for this academic year or the college authorities should wait until an order was passed in the case filed by them in the High Court.

The authorities had prevented the students from entering the classrooms without issuing any official notice or any letter seeking the higher fees. If the students did not attend the classes, they would have a year in backlog, they said.

Meanwhile, the students are planning to conduct a mass protest involving all the students of the college to raise the demand.

N.Roy, Principal, Kannur Medical College, said the college had demanded the fees after a decision to that effect was taken by the Minister for Health, Health Secretary and the Directorate of Medical Education.

He said the decision to collect the higher fees was based on the precedent at the Ernakulam Cooperative College which too was taken over by the government. The fees were collected in a similar way, he said, adding that he had been following the instructions given by the government.

Dr. Roy said that all the students had been allowed to enter the classes pending a final decision from the authorities. However, they would not be allowed to write the examination until they paid the fees, he sadi.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/llxt8h/article30481142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05krmedicosjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pariyaram-medical-college-students-go-on-indefinite-strike/article30481143.ece

Anaz, a PhD aspirant and Abhijith, a final year MBA student, say they have no plans for a ritualistic wedding. “We look forward to the enactment of a law like the Special Marriage Act which will legalise same-sex wedding.”

Quacks at work

Both express their shock at the portrayal of homosexuality as a mental disorder. “We have come across advertisements offering cure for different sexual orientation. Legal measures should be taken against such quacks,” they demand.

Sindhya Saji and M. Vidhya have been in a same-sex relationship for over six years.

Sindhya Saji and M. Vidhya, who have been in a same sex relationship for over six years, say social stigma continues to be the biggest hurdle in their lives. “Even the police treat us like antisocial elements and scoff at our complaints,” they allege.

“Most in our society view lesbian relationship with derision. With least understanding on the mental state of the couples, many pry into their sexual life or exploit their helplessness,” says Sindhya, a Civil Services aspirant.

She points out that a legal wedding without surgical sex change is the only way to ensure social justice to the lesbian community.

‘Give us a valid ID’

Her partner Vidhya believes that the identity crisis will end only when the government recognises same-sex couples and grants them a valid identity proof. As families never support people with different sexual orientation, the government has a bigger role in ensuring their well-being, she adds.

Transwoman Anjali Ameer, popular as an actor, feels that the government can easily bring in some relaxations in its adoption policy for the welfare of the LGBTIQ community.

“They love to look after children and adoption is the only way before them. The rigid rules never let them fulfil their dream of becoming parents,” she says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nk5ap3/article30483695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AnazandAbhijiths,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/we-are-not-special-treat-us-as-equals/article30481104.ece
157,2020/01/04,Investors play vital role in development: CM,"Chief Minster Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the second Hyatt brand project by the Lulu Group International here on Saturday.

Speaking after inaugurating the ₹245 crore project, Mr. Pinarayi said investors play a huge role in the development of the country.

Job opportunities

“The land is developing well, so too should the investment. More investment is required to generate more employment opportunities for our youth.”

The Chief Minister pointed out that the role played by Lulu Group and M.A. Yusufali in the development of Kerala is exemplary.

M..A Yusufali, Chairman and Managing Director of Lulu Group International, said that it’s the collective effort of all stake holders to promote Kerala as an an investment-friendly State.

He said that declining job opportunities in the Gulf will affect Kerala most.

He further added that it was his duty to bring investment to Kerala for the educated youth workforce.

158,2020/01/04,Happily ever after: Celebrating Kerala's same-sex marriages,"Like all love birds, Nived and Rahim had long been dreaming about their wedding day. They had meticulously planned the big event, including the dress they would wear. The couple, dressed in deep blue coats and white and cream pants, exchanged marriage vows in the presence of a few friends and relatives two weeks ago. They embraced and exchanged kisses. Then the party began. Nived and Rahim would probably be the first gay couple from the State to get married after the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court decriminalised Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in September 2018.

The section, introduced in the British era, had made sexual activities against the ‘order of nature’ illegal. The section, dealing with unnatural offences, prescribed a punishment of 10 years and fine for those who “voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of natur with any man, woman or animal.” In its epoch-making judgement, a five-member Bench of the apex court decriminalised consensual sex between adults of same sex.

The court held that the section would not apply to consensual same-sex acts between homosexuals, lesbians, and other sexual minorities. However, bestiality and sexual acts without consent would continue as offences.

Getting married in the post-decriminalisation period, Nived and Rahim did not have to keep their marriage a secret. They shared the pictures of their happiest moments in social media. “It was a simple event, attended by a few of our close friends,” says Nived. The couple, who had also shared their New Year party videos online, will be travelling to Kochi next week where they will throw a dinner party for their friends.

A discreet wedding

Getting married was not that easy for Nikesh Usha Pushkaran and M.S. Sonu, who tied the knot on July 5, 2018. Like their love affair, which had raised several eyebrows, they had to keep the event a discreet one and took care not to release the news and pictures of their marriage at Guruvayur Temple.

Better days ahead: Nikesh Usha Pushkaran and M.S. Sonu made their marriage public only after the Supreme Court judgment | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

“It was nearly two months after our marriage that the Supreme Court decriminalised Section 377. We made our marriage public after the judgement. First, we released the pictures of our ring-exchange and later, the images of garlanding,” says Nikesh.

“Initially, there was widespread criticism. People blamed our parents. But things changed. Society began accepting us as a couple,” says Nikesh.

“We are happily married, like any other couple. We decided to live as we are, without camouflaging our identity. Many people with same sex orientation are forced to marry people of the opposite sex. They are trapped in unhappy marriages, making life a hell for themselves and their spouses. Every day, we get phone calls from gay people who are facing unimaginable societal and familial pressure to get married to a woman,” he says.

No lesbian marriages

No lesbian marriages have taken place in Kerala so far. There may be lesbians who would want to live with the woman they love. But it is not easy for a woman in Kerala to open up about her sexual preference for a woman, he says. According to Jijo Kuriakose, the founder of Queerla, a community-based organisation for Malayali LGBTIQ people, several aspects of the Supreme Court judgment are yet to be discussed.

The LGBTIQ community members are yet to get visibility in society and workplaces. Each day, the organisation gets at least four to five calls from people regarding these issues. Many callers share their concern over the familial pressure to get married, says Mr. Kuriakose.

“We as a society, while taking about the mental health issues, should also talk about gender issues and the sexual orientation of people,” he says.

Legal reforms

Everything may be fair in love, but not in law. Though Section 377 has been decriminalised, Indian laws are yet to recognise same-sex marriages.

All Indian laws, including the personal laws of religions, conceive marriage as something taking place between a man and a woman, says a woman judicial officer. Since the laws do not recognise same-sex marriages, the legal protection and remedies prescribed for couples will not be available for them, she said. Such marriages do not have the approval of law and hence the partners cannot seek legal remedies in case of failed relationships, she adds.

The law is unfair to same-sex couples, says Nikesh, pointing out the difficulties in entering the name of their life partners as their legal successors or survivors while opening bank accounts, taking loans, and subscribing to insurance schemes.

Expanding the family is another issue faced by same-sex couples.

“In another two years,” says Nived, “we will have a baby. A woman friend has agreed to bear a baby for us through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) method. We have to opt for IVF in India since surrogacy is banned here,” he says. Who will father the child? “Either me or Rahim,” says Nived in a firm voice.

Adoption attempts

The efforts of Nikesh and Sonu to adopt a child have not succeeded so far. “We wanted to adopt a baby. But it has not worked out so far. The legalisation of same-sex marriage will open the legal route for us to adopt a baby,” Nikesh says.

According to a senior district judge, there is no legal bar for childless couple and single parents to adopt babies. However, in real life situations, preference is usually given to heterosexual couples over same-sex ones, he says.

Also read: Transgenders raise the adoption question

The present legal status of same-sex couples is that they can live under one roof, engage in sexual activities without the fear of being harassed by moral policing squads, or being afraid of being caught for an illegal act.

No hotelier can deny them rooms and no policeman can book cases against them, he says.

Divorce and rights

However, there are no laws governing their divorce, restoration of conjugal rights and maintenance since their marriages are not good in law, he says. When the going gets wrong in such marriages, says the woman judicial officer, the provisions of gender-neutral laws like the Indian Penal Code and civil laws will come into play. A whole new set of legislations are required for legalising such marriages, she adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/44gmej/article30483840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04kikss01-page-G066U,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/getting-married-post-decriminalisation/article30481047.ece
159,2020/01/04,KSU activists wave black flag at Governor,"The police here on Saturday removed KSU activists who tried to wave black flag at Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on his way to inaugurate the VAIGA (Value Addition for Income Generation in Agriculture) exhibition.

The KSU activists tried to wave black flag at the Governor on the Palace road on his way from Ramanilayam to Thekkinkadu Maidan, the venue of the VAIGA. The activists were protesting against his controversial remarks in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The police had tightened the security in the city as the Governor and the Chief Minister had many programmes in the city on Saturday.

‘Stand not changed’

Earlier, while interacting with media persons on Friday night, the Governor said nobody can intimidate him from expressing his opinion. “I have faced even more severe threats before. But I will never change my stand. Some people said they will not allow me to step out. But I am still travelling,” he said.

“It’s my responsibility to see whether the Kerala Assembly functions according to the Constitution. According to the Constitution I am the head of the State. No State has the right to intervene in an Act passed by Parliament. The State is exceeding its limit. If they are against the Act, let them win power at the Centre. Then they can make an amendment,” Mr. Khan said.

“I respect differences of opinion of the people. I can tell you, Kerala people will not be affected by the Act,” he said.

160,2020/01/04,Gandhian ideals getting popular in West: expert,"The Gandhian ideals of secularism, which espoused religious inclusiveness and cultural diversity, is gradually gaining ground in the western world, according to Rajiv Bhargava, political theorist at the Centre for Developing Society in New Delhi .

He was delivering the erudite lecture organized by the School of Gandhian Thought and Development Studies under the Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam. The event was held in connection with the Kerala Historical Congress, slated to begin here next week.

According to Mr. Bhargava, the concept of universal brotherhood embracing ethical values and norms for social interaction of religions is paramount to the Gandhian views.

Gandhian secularism is primarily centred around the concepts of self-fulfilment and transcendence in which moral integrity was of great importance, he noted.

Gandhi believed that all creations are part of the multitude manifestations of the ultimate truth, which can be realized in any number of ways. In his opinion, exclusion, strong centralised system to align the society to singular norms with the authority of political power would hamper the very concept of personal liberty and equality, observed Mr.Bhargava.

161,2020/01/04,Spotlight on facial trauma management,"A two-day intensive facial trauma management training programme, organised by the Association of Osteosynthesis, a Switzerland-based non-profit organisation and the Pushpagiri Dental College, came to a close at the college auditorium in Thiruvalla on Saturday.

The training programme got special attention in view of the fact that facial injuries are quite common in India and almost 80% of facial fractures are found to have been occurring in road traffic accidents, according to college Principal George Varghese.

Facial trauma

Facial trauma, also called maxillofacial trauma, can involve both soft tissue injuries and fractures of facial bones. Maxillofacial trauma affects facial aesthetics and function. Hence restoration of both is the primary goal of facial trauma management, says Dr. Varghese.

Bai Xiaofeng from China and Jose Florencio Lapena from the Philippines were the international faculty who led the training programme.

Oommen Aju Jacob, Yeshwasini Thelekkat, and Eapen Thomas, renowned maxillofacial surgeons, and Fr. Mathew Mzhuvancheril, academic director of the Pushpagiri group of institutions, addressed the programme on Saturday.

Ravi Veeraraghavan from the Amrita School of Dentistry in Kochi, Gopal Krishnan from Dharwad, Vivek Vardhan Reddy from Telengana, Srikanth Gadicheria from Manipal, Sathish M.S. Vashishta from Bengaluru, Pramod Subhash, Sherry Peter, Ajoy Vijayan, Bobby John, Latha P. Rao, and Philip Puthumana were the national faculty who addressed the two-day programme.

Training

The main attraction of the programme was the intensive hands-on training with the help of simulators and models, along with didactic lectures by experts in the field of facial trauma management.

About 50 maxillofacial surgeons and plastic surgeons from Kerala and South India participated in the workshop.

The participants got an opportunity to experience the latest trends like use of mini-plates and screws and other armamentarium in the management of facial bone fractures.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3s4bhj/article30480864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv05seminardental,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spotlight-on-facial-trauma-management/article30480860.ece
162,2020/01/04,Initiative to reclaim canals in Kuttanad,"Picturesque streams and canals are the lifeline of Kuttanad. With the construction of roads, many of them faded into obscurity and have been reduced to drainages due to waste dumping.

Now, CanKuttanad, a joint initiative involving local bodies in the region, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, (IIT-B), and the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), is set to reclaim streams and canals with people’s participation.

As part of the initiative, villagers brought an old canal back to life at Nedumudy in May 2019. Once a navigable waterway, the 2.5-km-long Thottuvathalathodu flowing through Wards 5, 6 and 7 in Nedumudy grama panchayat lost its glory due to waste dumping and aquatic weed infestation.

Restoration of canal

As part of the restoration of the canal, the villagers removed aquatic weed, deepened the channel and increased the height of bunds.

As the next step, the Nedumudy grama panchayat joined hands with the Champakulam block panchayat to restore 40 km of canals and rivulets in the local body.

Officials said that the canals would be deepened and protected using coir geotextiles. The silt removed would be used to strengthen outer bounds in the region. The project was expected to give a fillip to the farming sector in Kuttanad, officials said.

Canalpy

CanKuttanad is implemented in line with Canalpy (CanAlappuzha), an initiative to reclaim the canals in Alappuzha town.

The technical expertise for the implementation of CanKuttanad is provided by KILA, IIT-B and Canalpy. With the tagline ‘canals are not drains’, Canalpy strives to clean, sustain and inspire the people to take care of their surroundings and make a difference to society.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/initiative-to-reclaim-canals-in-kuttanad/article30480853.ece
163,2020/01/04,Sabarimala pilgrims flood Erumely,"Even as a spiritual frenzy has engulfed Erumely which is slated to host the ceremonial Petta Thullal preceded by the Chandanakkudam celebrations at the Nainar mosque here next week, the steady inflow of pilgrims en route to Sabarimala have put the authorities on their toes this season

According to the police, the town has experienced the biggest traffic snarls in its history since the December holidays. The ripple effects of these snarls are visible all across the region with serpentine queues going up to the Sabarimala route on one side and up to Kanjirappally on the other side.

“The entire region is so chocked with the pilgrims vehicles that traffic to only one direction could be permitted on most of these days. To ease the congestion, we have now opened more parking grounds that go up to several kms on both sides of the Sabarimala route,” said J. Santosh Kumar, Deputy Superintendent of police, Kanjirappally.

According to him, an additional batch of 100 policemen are set to join the crowd-management duties on January 8. Presently, as many as 378 officials have been deployed on a special duty for the two-month season.

The Erumely panchayat, meanwhile, has constituted a special committee to distribute refreshments to the pilgrims who get stuck in the vehicles for hours.

“This is the first time that the local body is initiating a system as the influx has been much beyond the carrying capacity of this region. The local business too has recorded a corresponding shoot up, which is expected to make up for the losses incurred to the local vendors last year,” noted T.S. Krishna Kumar, president, Erumeli panchayat.

Estimates with the Travacore Devaswom Board suggested that the twin temples at the town here together recorded an almost 100 percent jump in its revenue in the first 41 days of the season, which stood at ₹5.04 crore. Of these, the Erumeli Dharma Sastha temple alone recorded an income of ₹4.79 crore.

Windfall

The Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) too has made a windfall from this unprecedented rush with its collection at the Erumeli operating centre crossing ₹91 lakh as against ₹51.22 lakh in the previous season. During the period, the Corporation operated as many as 3,621 trips between Erumeli and Pampa and transported around 1.17 lakh people. The revenue per km is estimated to be ₹69.13.

“The Corporation currently operates a fleet of 10 buses from the Centre here while this uninterrupted flow has forced us to deploy an additional batch of 50 employees to carry out the operation round the clock. With this influx set to multiply in the final week leading to the Makaravilakku festival, we have sought an additional fleet of 10 buses to meet the demand,” said a senior KSRTC official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lt5y6c/article30480833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv05erumesli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-pilgrims-flood-erumely/article30480825.ece
164,2020/01/04,Producers rule out talks with Shane,"The Kerala Film Producers’ Association has upped the ante against actor Shane Nigam by stating that there is no scope for any conciliatory talks unless he completes the dubbing of the movie Ullasam.

The association and the actor have been on a warpath since October last year after Shane alleged that he had received death threats from Joby George, producer of his movie Veyil, for changing his hairstyle while working for the film Qurbani. The differences of opinion peaked after the association banned him in November when he stirred up a controversy by shaving off his hair and beard, thus disrupting the shooting of Veyil in which he was to appear in different looks.

M. Renjith, president, Kerala Film Producers Association, said on Saturday that they had asked the actor to complete the dubbing of Ullasam before January 5. ‘‘He had failed to turn up and hence we have no other option but to continue our non cooperation till the dubbing work is over,’’ he said.

Shane had earlier said that the dubbing could not be completed as the producer was yet to settle his remuneration agreed for the movie. Renjith alleged that the actor had agreed to complete the film for a fee of ₹25 lakh, but later changed it ₹40 lakh, saying that his movie Kumbalanghi Nights was a hit.

The actor had tendered an apology in December over his statement that the producers had suffered mental illness and not mental trauma. An executive committee meeting of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) scheduled on January 9 is likely to take up the actor’s request seeking its intervention to sort out the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/producers-rule-out-talks-with-shane/article30479925.ece
165,2020/01/04,Railway to belt out messages in popular tunes in Kerala,"A welcome change awaits train passengers who now turn a disinterested ear to the monotonous announcements over the public announcement system at railway stations.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF), in a novel initiative, is set to release an album titled ‘Rail Suraksha’ comprising nine songs set to the tunes of famous Malayalam chart busters and sung by noted playback singers to drive home awareness messages for passenger safety and security.

‘Life is Precious’

The initiative is part of the ongoing ‘Life is Precious’ campaign being carried out by the RPF since last July.

The campaign has been launched after it was found that avoidable deaths on tracks increased from 264 between January and July in 2018 to around 364 during the same period last year.

“The songs to be released shortly in CD format will be given to all railway stations under the Thiruvananthapuram railway division to be played through the public announcement system frequently,” said S. Ramakrishnan, Commissioner RPF, Thiruvananthapuram Division. The songs penned by lyricist Baburaj Kanampur will have a combined length of 12 minutes.

Four out of the nine songs have already been recorded.

The RPF also plans to use the songs as part of its awareness campaigns in several schools and colleges.

Social media

They will also be uploaded over multiple social media platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp, to maximise the reach of the messages.

Among the songs included is one tuned along the lines of a traditional boat race song.

“We chose popular Malayalam songs since we felt they could best carry the safety messages. It will be far more effective than distributing pamphlets and notices to the people,” said T.S. Gopakumar, Assistant Commissioner, RPF, Ernakulam.

The messages being conveyed through these songs include never to board a moving train or board from off-side, not to jaywalk across railway tracks, not to pull the chain without a valid reason, to leave the ladies’ compartments to them, not to usurp the facilities dedicated to differently abled passengers, and to reach out to the RPF for help through its helpline number 182.

Effective

“We limited the ‘Life is Precious’ campaign to awareness in the initial months before moving to prosecuting offenders. We have prosecuted nearly 500 people since then. It seems to have the desired deterrent effect, as we have been able to arrest the alarming increasing trend of untoward incidents in the six-month period ending December 31,” RPF official said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/usbcps/article30481392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-railway,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/railway-to-belt-out-safety-messages-in-popular-tunes/article30479815.ece
166,2020/01/04,Cyber training for entire State police force,"A three-phased programme is under way to impart advanced cyber training to the entire State police, which is expected to be complete in a couple of years.

Last year, when 54,000 police personnel were trained turned out to be the year of cyber training for the State police and marked the first phase of the larger training programme.

Considering that the total strength of the police in the State hovers somewhere around the region of 60,000, only a few more thousands remain to receive the initial cyber training.

Digital mode

“With almost every transaction getting shifted to the digital world, the entire force needs to be equipped to deal with the entailing challenges. Initially, the basic computer training is being imparted to the police personnel. This will be followed by training to handle the cyber equipment used by the force. A more advanced training to deal with cyber crimes will follow,” said Manoj Abraham, ADGP, Headquarters, and Nodal Officer, Kerala Police Cyberdome.

He said that the crime patrol app used by the police also provided for online cyber training.

Efforts are also on to streamline the functioning of three cyberdomes in the State through regional coordination and assigning them specific subjects.

Cyberdome

The Kerala Police Cyberdome at Thiruvananthapuram has been active for years now and has been doing a commendable work in preventing cyber crime and mitigate cyber security threats to the State’s critical information infrastructure.

It has been functioning with the help of volunteers including ethical hackers, expert coders, youth prodigies skilled in software, law enforcers and civilian volunteers.

The cyberdome at Kozhikode was inaugurated on Sunday while the one at Kochi has been up and running for a while now though it is yet to be formally launched.

“It would not be readily possible to set up cyberdomes in places without Information Technology parks. But that is no hurdle in extending online support elsewhere. The possibility of assigning these three cyberdomes with specific subjects will also be explored,” Mr. Abraham said.

For instance, the cyberdome set up by the Kochi City Police Commissionerate at Infopark is already focusing on patrolling and policing social media and the internet for enhanced cyber security.

State police are also collating critical data about crimes against children to monitor the trends and checking it effectively.

The initiative has three principal objectives — diligent follow-up of cases, rehabilitation of victims, and constant monitoring of perpetrators.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cyber-training-for-entire-state-police-force/article30479769.ece
167,2020/01/04,Crack down on shops selling drugs near educational institutions,"Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan has said the State government would intensify action against shops in the vicinity of educational institutions found selling narcotic substances.

“Currently, such shops reopen even though they were identified as the real perpetrators in many cases. To change the scenario, the State Excise Department and local bodies will take stern action against such shops and prevent them from reopening,” he said while chairing a meeting of the executive committee of the drug and addiction-free mission Vimukthi.

The Minister said the Excise Department had registered 67,713 cases under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 12,425 excise cases and 6,573 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) in 2019.

De-addiction centre

A ₹100-crore model de-addiction centre would be opened at Kinalur in Kozhikode by the Excise and Health departments in collaboration with the Aardram Mission.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said units of the Vimukthi Sena would be formed in all wards in the State by January 30 to keep track of drug-related activities.

Out of 19,499 wards in the State, Vimukthi Sena units had already been formed in 11,550 of them. Each unit would have 5 to 10 members, including two women, anganwadi workers, Asha workers and Kudumbashree workers.

Anti-drug clubs

He said anti-drug clubs would be set up in all schools, professional colleges and medical colleges. Currently, such clubs were functioning in 3,739 schools and 576 colleges.

“Apart from this, around 7,500 anti-drug clubs will be established in all libraries across the State. Various anti-drug campaigns such as evening gatherings, home visits and lighting the lamp against drugs will also be organised,” he said.

168,2020/01/04,Syllabus: nursing community sees red,"Trained nurses and students from Kerala have opposed the draft syllabus of B.Sc. (Nursing) course for the upcoming academic year, which has proposed, among other things, a go-ahead for those from arts, humanities, and commerce streams to join the course.

Renu Susan Thomas, treasurer, Trained Nurses’ Association of India (TNAI), State unit, told The Hindu on Saturday that the health sector needed people who had a thorough knowledge of biology and an aptitude for science. “Students who join humanities stream in Plus Two classes do not learn anything on biology for two years,” she said.

The publication of the draft syllabus by the Indian Nursing Council follows the decision to scrap the three-year general nursing and midwifery course by 2021. Right now, only those who have studied biology during their Plus Two science course can apply for the four-year B.Sc. (Nursing) course. Objections and suggestions can be sent by January 24.

Ms. Thomas said that B.Sc. (Nursing) has papers in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, bio-chemistry and microbiology, learning of which requires a scientific base. “At a time when a majority of students with science background are unable to handle the syllabus and are failing in the first year itself, how will those from arts and humanities stream cope with it?” Ms. Thomas asked.

Reduced teaching hours

The draft syllabus proposes to cut down the teaching hours for anatomy and physiology, which, she said, would affect the quality of nursing graduates. “The move to reduce the teacher student ratio from 1:10 to 1:15 will also affect the academic and job prospects of students. Teachers will not be able to directly supervise them,” Ms. Thomas said.

D. Aneesh, staff adviser, Student Nurses Association of India (SNAI), Kerala unit, said that there was only one paper in nursing for the first year of B.Sc. (Nursing) course and the rest were science subjects. Those from non-science streams would find it difficult to sail through. He said that though the government had earlier given green signal to such students to apply for the general nursing and midwifery course also, they were not allowed to pursue the two-year post-basic B.Sc. course in nursing. Both the TNAI and SNAI were sending their objections to the council , they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nursing-community-see-red-in-draft-syllabus/article30479559.ece

The theme for VAIGA 2020 is sustainable growth through agripreneurship.

“We need to ensure that ordinary farmers get modern knowledge about value addition. What we need is a committed army of agripreneurs, who would use the available technologies to start business ventures that would fruitfully utilise the opportunities for value addition in agriculture,” the Governor said.

He said value addition in agriculture required more capital investment, infrastructure, marketing efforts, proper guidelines, training, governmental support and close monitoring. “Agricultural enterprises should get privileges at par with any other modern industry. Let us extend the concept of ‘ease of doing business' to agricultural businesses too,” he added.

Worst affected

Over 61% of the population in the country was dependent on agriculture. But its contribution to the total Gross Domestic Product was less than 15% and it was decreasing year after year.

The rise of the services sector as a major contributor to the nation’s economy had affected both the agricultural and industrial sectors. But, agriculture remained the worst affected due to people moving away from farming. The reasons included unstable income and risks relating to production, markets, and prices, the Governor said.

It was in this context that the Sate government decided to educate people about the importance of agriculture and the immense potential in processing and value addition of agricultural products. “These efforts of the Department of Agriculture have now resulted in more people coming into cultivation of paddy, vegetables and other crops. This certainly is an encouraging trend. However, our aim should be to ensure that we have more agro-based businesses flourishing in our State,” Mr. Khan noted.

170,2020/01/04,Students stop Principal from entering college,"The Principal of a private college here has alleged that he has stopped coming to the college following threats from members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) for about a month now.

N. Yousef, Principal, MES College at Kuthuparamba, alleged that the students were preventing him from entering the college and discharging his duties. He said the students had turned against him after some of them, mainly SFI members, were not allowed to attend the semester examination for want of attendance.

He said he intervened only after one of the staff in the college was threatened by the students after suspecting him to be instrumental in disqualifying them. This was reported at the nearby police station, he said.

However, the students, who came to know about this, agitated against him and the staff. The student members of the SFI, with local support, did not allow him to enter the college, he said. The management asked him to remain away for a few days until things settled down and suggested to administer the work from home, he said.

Meanwhile, the students also gave a complaint to the Director of Students Service (DSS) against the Principal levelling various allegations. He could not attend the meeting called by the DSS with sufficient documents, as the students had imposed restrictions on him from entering the college, Mr. Yousef said.

However, the SFI denied the allegation and said that it was the college management that had prevented the Principal from entering the college for denying attendance to college union members.

The DSS, which received complaints from the students, said there were more allegations against the Principal. Only few students had attendance shortage, while various other complaints had come from the college, said Priya Varghese, who is probing the issue. She will submit a report before January 15.

Vice Chancellor Gopinath Ravindran said the issue had come to his notice. If the Principal had such problems, it could have been brought to the Vice Chancellor’s notice. However, the issue would be looked into, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/students-stop-principal-from-entering-college/article30479416.ece
171,2020/01/04,Hospitals get access to advanced lab services,"In a first in the State, health-care institutions in Ernakulam district are being provided logistic support to utilise the advanced laboratory services available only at major public health centres.

Pooling in the resources, the district unit of the National Health Mission (NHM) and district panchayat have started systematic collection of body fluid samples for tests at higher centres for advanced diagnostics, under the hub-and-spoke model, on an everyday basis.

The District General Hospital, Public Health Laboratory, and Cochin Cancer Research Centre, all in Kochi, and Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, are the hubs and far-flung government hospitals in the district are the spokes. Two vehicles and trained drivers have been engaged to collect colour-coded samples and deposit them at the required hub, from where reports are sent to the respective hospital by mail.

Mathews Numpelil, district programme manager, NHM, told The Hindu that the hospitals used to engage separate transportation systems whenever they needed to send samples. Now, a vehicle reaches the laboratories of these hospitals, collect samples and sent for advanced microbiological and pathology tests. The cost of running two vehicles is less that ₹90,000 a month. About 1,000 samples are being transported every day at a cost of ₹70 for each sample. With more samples, the cost would come down further, said Dr. Numpelil.

The scheme goes thus. A vehicle starts collecting samples from Kothamangalam hospital and moves via Perumbavoor, Angamaly, Paravur and Aluva hospitals and then reaches the hub centres. Another one starts from the Muvattupuzha General Hospital and collects samples from Piravom, Thripunithura, Fort Kochi, Karuvelipady, Mattanchery and reaches the hubs.

Cancer biopsy, papsmear, metabolic screening of newborns, cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for TB, sepsis management, and antimicrobial resistance are some of the tests.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a7mukz/article30481367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-hospital-revisedcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-shorter-effective-route-to-heaclthcare-hubs/article30479304.ece
172,2020/01/04,"No talks unless Shane completes dubbing of Ullasam, says producers’ association","The Kerala Film Producers’ Association has upped the ante against actor Shane Nigam by stating that there is no scope for any conciliatory talks unless he completes the dubbing of the movie Ullasam.

The association and the actor have been on a warpath since October last year after Shane alleged that he had received death threats from Joby George, producer of his movie Veyil, for changing his hairstyle for the movie Qurbani.

The differences between the actor and the producers peaked after the association banned him in November when he stirred up a controversy by shaving off his hair and beard, thus disrupting the shooting of Veyil, in which he was to appear in different looks.

M. Renjith, president of the Kerala Film Producers Association, said on Saturday that they had asked the actor to complete the dubbing of Ullasam before January 5. He had failed to turn up and hence we had no other option but to continue our non- cooperation till the dubbing work was over, he said.

Mr. Nigam had earlier said that the dubbing could not be completed as the producer was yet to settle his remuneration agreed for the movie. Mr. Renjith alleged that the actor had agreed to complete the film for a fee of ₹25 lakh, but later changed it to ₹40 lakh saying that his movie Kumbalanghi Nights was a hit.

The actor tendered an apology in December over his statement that the producers had suffered mental illness and not mental trauma.

He filed the petition before the judge on Tuesday. The special court accepted the prosecution’s stance that there was sufficient evidence against the actor. The court also rejected the discharge petition of Vishnu, ninth accused in the case.

The actor is likely to approach the Kerala High Court stating that he should be removed from the list of accused in the case.

Dileep was arraigned as an accused in the rape case, which was reportedly committed in Kochi in February 2017.

The actor had roped in an expert to examine the authenticity of the visuals of the alleged rape that were captured in the memory card of a mobile phone after the Supreme Court allowed his petition.

However, the court had directed that he should not copy, record or tamper with the visuals.

A group of 39 students of Class 12 came up with the idea of giving back to the school, after they suffered huge water shortage on the campus. Instead of spending their pocket money for other purposes, the students used it for constructing a filtration tank for a rooftop rainwater harvesting system at the school, said T. Gopalan, coordinator of eco-club.

Before undertaking the project, the students carried out a survey and collected samples from 200 houses in Kasaragod. “We found that 40% of the houses depended on borewells, which drained groundwater,” said E.V. Adithya Dev, who led the survey and construction of the filtration tank. None of the houses had rainwater harvesting systems and many houses faced water shortage, he added. Many depended on multiple sources for water and they were unaware about water usage, he said.

178,2020/01/04,Tough choices,"I am an IT ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) professional with over 15 years of experience. I want a career change, preferably after doing an MBA. Please suggest some options and the pros/cons in this regard. — Raj

Dear Raj,

Combining your 15 years of IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) experience with the business expertise of an MBA, you will be poised to take on a leadership position in the field. So, go for it! There is a growing need for skilled employees to implement, use and upgrade ERP software to increase efficiency and help organisations stay competitive. You could do this from any premier MBA institute in the country or go abroad and do a specialisation in ERP, Accounting, Business Analytics, Finance, International Business, Healthcare Management, Operations Management and so on. The scope is pretty huge. You will need to study hard, though, and that might be the only challenge, given that you are used to working now and haven’t been a student in a while.

I am 21 and I completed my graduation last year. I am currently preparing for Grade B government exams. While preparing for these exams, I have developed an interest in Law. Is there are any way that I can do the course from a university without hampering my preparation? It can be distance learning course as I am not going to practice Law. — Manvendra Singh Chauhan

Dear Manvendra,

Yes, there are many distance education universities offering courses in Law via distance education. Eligibility for LLB is graduation in any discipline, so you qualify. Do look through http://www.indiaeduinfo.com/ to get more information and good luck to you.

I am pursuing B.Tech (ECE) from Manipal Institute of Technology. Due to backlogs, I have lost one year and I am in my sixth Semester instead of eighth. My GPA is just six. Now, I have realised that I want to pursue my master's abroad. Can I get admission in any good university in the U.S., if I get a good GRE score? What is the required GRE score and other requirements to achieve my goal? — Rohan. K

Dear Rohan,

If you are planning to get into a top master’s program in the U.S., you need a good GRE score in the application process. The GRE scores would differ depending upon the school and the subjects you select. 150-165 is the average score on Verbal test and 160-175 is the average on Quantitative test for a reputed college/university.

Please focus on building your portfolio and enhancing your CV with extra curricular achievements, sports and music credentials. Also, please focus on your GPA, it is indicative of the student’s academic potential and certainly counts. Good luck!

I am 18 years old and am currently pursuing my graduate in commerce. I will be writing the CA Foundation exams and if I clear those exams, should I drop-out of college and join for IPCC or should I continue my graduation and pursue CA later? — Aswathi Rajeev

Dear Aswathi,

Yes it is challenging, I agree. What do you want to do eventually in life? Be a Chartered Accountancy (CA) or complete your BCom (honours), as doing both together is not possible anymore.

Commerce teachers suggest that students should either choose CA or pursue B.Com from an open university if they want to do CA. However, doing B.Com (honours) will not be easy for students if they want to go for CA. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India mandates that if you wish to do BCom, you can pursue CA only after that now.

A student who wants to pursue CA needs to appear for a Common Proficiency Test (CPT - held twice a year in June and Dec), for which the eligibility is Class XII. Nine months after this test, the student is eligible for the Integrated Professional Competency Course (IPCC – also held twice a year in May and Nov). After which the student does an ‘articleship’ of three- and- a- half years. A student cannot do articleship while pursuing B.Com. So, one can appear for the IPCC in her/his B.Com final year and pursue articleship. This means a student will now require six-and-a-half years to acquire both the degrees.

179,2020/01/04,"Take care, folks!","If I may ask, what was your New Year’s resolution? Or perhaps, you are among those who has discarded this tradition of making promises to oneself that begins with the big lift of good intention and ends with the slow slide of regret? I have reached the age of forgetting, where I can happily blame unkempt resolutions on the erosion of short-term memory. So at this point, almost a week into the new year, if such a thought existed, it has conveniently slipped out of remembering range.

However, one of the advantages of reaching this point in life is that one can dispense advice freely (and unashamedly) to those who will listen, and even to those who won’t, confident in the belief that one has acquired at least some measure of clarity over the years.

Self-care

So what advice can I pull out of my rather worn backpack at the start off this year? What new resolution can I ask you to consider, having myself given up on the practice of resolving a long time ago? Well, here is one that I think will stand you in good stead: resolve to take better care of yourself and your health — physical, emotional, mental.

Perhaps that sounds self-evident. After all, isn’t self-interest the guiding principle of life, for most? Self-care, however, while being in one’s interest, is quite different from self-interest. When you are young, you get caught up in many activities that are driven by passion, curiosity and ambition, as well as the appetite for adventure and learning. You are eager to feed your body, mind and soul with all manner of exciting things, experimenting and exploring to the fullest — and no doubt, that’s the best part of being a student, and being young.

Little wonder then, that you occasionally go to class sleepy, having survived several nights on a few hours of rest, or that you are distracted by mid-morning hunger pangs, having had no time for breakfast or having overdosed on instant noodles and multiple mugs of tea the previous night. A few days of this can be great fun, but more than that can show on you over time. Some of the downs come from the indifferent quality of food and less-than-perfect hygiene in hostels, but a fair contribution also comes from simple disregard for that aspect of life, that most young people think is an old person’s concern: health. But, and this is not backed by citable evidence but by simple observation, I find that my campus clinic is more often visited by students than by the older faculty.

Balancing act

So, even as you participate in all the excitement that college and particularly, hostel life can offer, do be mindful of your well-being. Balance out the fast food days with some good food days, making sure you always have a bottle of water at hand. Even as you stretch out the days and nights in conversation and hard work, find a few times a week when you get a full night’s sleep. Even as you gather many fair-weather friends to laugh with, make sure you have at least one or two you can cry with as well. And even as you sharpen your mind with deep conversations, learn to pay attention to the signals of your own body and psyche.

180,2020/01/04,Audio books and podcasts: Listen to the words,"Gargi has to endure a two-hour commute to college each way. As she has to board a bus, the metro and then walk for 15 minutes each way, she prefers to listen to audio books instead of reading them. This way, her hands are free and she can even listen while standing in an overcrowded bus. She is grateful she is majoring in English because most of the books on her reading list are easily available in the audio format unlike textbooks in other subjects. Moreover, she is really pleased that she saves time.

With audio books and podcasts gaining popularity vis-à-vis printed or e-books, students may benefit from understanding the pros and cons of each medium. In an article in The New York Times, cognitive psychologist, Daniel Willingham compares the two media and concludes that each has its own pluses. Knowing how the two formats stack up against each other in different contexts can help readers or listeners pick the one that best meets their needs.

Audio scores over the print format when it comes to prosodic cues, that includes pitch, tone and tempo. Statements like “I simply love it here” can be interpreted as a genuine praise or as mockery depending on the tone employed. While tone can be conveyed auditorily, it’s harder in print and the reader usually relies on contextual cues. So, do audio books aid comprehension as compared to print?

Put to test

The answer is not so straightforward. In one study, researchers compared performance of students on a science quiz. Half the participants heard the material on a podcast while the other half read a printed version. Even though both groups spent the same amount of time with the study material, the print group outperformed the audio group.

Willingham points out that the content was fairly dense and hard to grasp. What do we readers typically do when we encounter difficult subject matter? Typically, we pause and slow down our reading and may even re-read bits to clarify our understanding. While going back and forth is easy to do with print, the audio format doesn’t easily lend itself to this type of comprehension monitoring.

Additionally, in print, the text can be divided with headings and subheadings and keywords and concepts may be bolded to highlight them. These organisational markers are not available in the auditory format. However, Willingham wagers that as people get more used to audio books, their comprehension in this format may increase with practice.

When we listen to audio books, we may engage in other tasks like driving or cooking. However, umpteen studies have pointed out that humans are poor multitaskers. When our attention is thus fragmented, our comprehension is likely to be compromised. Willlingham says that you will get the “gist, not subtleties.” So, while audio books may entertain us on long commutes, they may not replace reading in the conventional sense just yet.

Thus, based on your purpose and what you wish to derive from your reading experience, choose your medium wisely.

181,2020/01/04,The all-powerful MAYBE,"If you followed MasterChef Australia 2019 on television, you would have watched with awe, the youngest ever winner, Larissa Takchi, who bagged the quarter million dollar prize money and the coveted MasterChef Australia 2019 title. The two contestants who fought head-to-head till the last second of the three-round grand finale were equally resilient, talented, creative risk-takers throughout; yet some key aspects were fundamentally different on the day it mattered the most.

The difference was most apparent when, at the finish line, Larissa’s surprise at winning was as big as Tessa’s (her opponent) at her loss. Both contestants had come up through the long, gruelling stages of the contest on a trail of innovative, audacious and unpredictable flavours and combinations. That set them apart from the rest, as they beat professional chefs in the preliminary rounds, riding on their penchant for the unique. Yet, in the finale, Tessa’s hunger to seal her win seemed to dim her innovative streak, as she settled for safer, crowd pleasing, predictable recipes, while Larissa continued to back herself with a slew of audacious and intuitive flavour ideas. Yes, the possibility of it backfiring loomed right till the end of the four-hour contest. And yet, she won the game of high stakes for those very reasons.

Spirit of winning

A winner’s momentary surprise at winning steers me to what I call the attitude of ‘Maybe’ in success — an attitude that is unafraid to put everything on the line for creativity and excellence and by that very act is tentative of a win, because creativity is subjective. The winner in the above reference opts out of playing safe and follows her own wild and imaginative spirit; she honours the quality that had got her there and carries it through to the big win.

How does ‘maybe’ look on ground?

Standing between over-confidence and over-caution, ‘maybe’ calls for openness, curiosity and humility. It makes us learn to approach ‘knowing’ and ‘certainty’ in a tentative spirit, particularly in fluid environments. This is not the tentativeness of capability, but the smart wisdom to overlook the pressure of certainty that our brain demands in conclusive moments. A pressured mind poses roadblocks to conducive action and risk-taking. ‘Maybe’ gives space to the spirit of possibility and experimentation, reinforced by tons of patience and self-belief.

‘Maybe’ is non-linear

‘Maybe’ has the power to distil and distance us from our noisy, overstretched minds. Going into a challenge ready to excel, yet being open and relenting, is more forgiving than a constricted headspace. ‘Maybe’ is an open and unbound internal setting that potentially replaces the linear pressure points of the mind.

In linear settings, we tell ourselves story after story, believing we know how life should proceed for our success and well-being. Yet, how can there be just one way for us to win or manifest our goals?

This realisation guides one straight into the rewarding potential of ‘maybe’.

182,2020/01/04,Brew a career,"Coffee is one of the second most consumed beverages in the world. Now, imagine the economic potential in that one fact. According to E-Imports, in the U.S. alone, about 50% of the population drinks coffee in some form, and independent coffee shops equal $12 billion in annual sales.

This throws the door open to multiple career opportunities from production to retail. To deal with this demand, Araku Coffee, a speciality, certified organic luxury global Indian coffee brand, has been offering courses covering various skills.

The Coffee Skills Programme consists of six different modules: Introduction to Coffee, which is available at one level, and five specialist modules: Barista Skills, Brewing, Green Coffee, Roasting, and Sensory Skills. Each of the specialist modules is available at three different levels — Foundation, Intermediate, and Professional, with points attached at every stage. Each course (ranging from one to three days) offers a certificate. A diploma is offered once students garner 100 points.

Baristas to boardrooms

Araku Originals Coffee Campus has now become the first in the country to receive global accreditation as an SCA (Speciality Coffee Association) Premier Training Campus in Hyderabad.

“Coffee is a complex beverage and there’s so much that goes into creating a good coffee — the perfect soil, the perfect terroir, the perfect climate, and meticulously carrying out each step from seed to cup. This makes way for a lot of opportunities that people can explore when it comes to a career in coffee,” explains Sherri Johns, Head Judge, and Mentor, Araku Coffee, who teaches Barista and Sensory at the campus currently. “Our team at Araku Coffee consists of agricultural scientists, coffeeologists, organic farming experts, quality controllers, coffee mentors, master roasters, master brewers, baristas, and so on... so there are a lot of possibilities that one can explore when it comes to a speciality coffee like ours.”

Speaking about the future of the industry, Johns feels it is really promising. “Independent shops and cafes are springing up throughout the country with Bengaluru being the hotbed of activity. The expansion of the coffee industry has a lot to do with people becoming increasingly aware of what they’re consuming and looking for better coffee than they’ve been drinking in the past.”

Introduction to Coffee

A foundation course suitable for everyone from enthusiasts to beginning professionals.

Barista Skills: Practical skills you need behind the espresso bar: learn how to set your grinder, milk techniques and latte art, health and safety, customer service, and basic business practices.

Brewing: Provides hands-on learning on grind profiles, brewing methods, measuring coffee strength and charting a coffee’s extraction.

183,2020/01/04,Skill up for the New Age,"As the Fourth Industrial Revolution or the New Machine Age takes off in 2020, only graduates who are highly accomplished in the new technologies, will find jobs. Cloud computing, algorithms, automation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and analytical reasoning have emerged as the next generation technologies in which high quality jobs will replace existing ones.

Cloud computing, AI, robots, and social media marketing are already with us. How many graduates have equipped themselves for a seamless absorption into the new jobs?

According to Aspiring Minds, an objective assessment organisation, a mere 26% of engineers are employable. Analytical reasoning, financial and marketing analysis, essential for the vast data being transferred through Cloud, has rendered the large number of engineers and MBAs, unfit for employment. The assessment concludes with the observation that “our students are not ready for the next decade”.

What is it that has changed, and why is it necessary that students prepare for the New Machine Age with alacrity?

I spoke with R. Venkatesh, Chief Scientist, TCS, Pune and asked him this question. He replied, “New age innovations are going to dominate businesses and college curricula because jobs will centre on advances in Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and Internet of Things — or Internet of Everything — which consists of all the web-enabled devices that collect, send and act on the data collected from their surrounding environments, using embedded sensors, processors and communication hardware. Obviously, new jobs are set to replace uncreative, boring jobs where those who work on projects do not understand the entire project.”

New roles

Jobs will be created to increase profits in a digital economy by working with a handful of employees — as in Amazon, Google, Facebook and Instagram — using technology and data imaginatively. Employees will be expected to use critical thinking to develop automation for decision-making or develop applications for easily available data (on Cloud) and creatively exploit technology to provide entertainment. For instance, the arts (such as paintings and symphonies) can be creatively produced with machines by highly imaginative employees, and sold on portals in large numbers at little cost.

A new way of marketing is growing for selling products. This is called social media marketing, an important and growing skill which requires MBAs with a knowledge of machines, the web, finance and marketing to sell products in big numbers. Cloud computing has become a key part of enterprise digital transformation strategy. Cloud services are projected to become a $300 billion business by 2021. Employer interest in positions related to Cloud will rise manifold. In the past three years, jobs in Cloud computing, Cloud infrastructure, and Cloud architecture have risen by 108%. Employer demand everywhere in the world is outpacing the number of qualified candidates available.

The U.S., with some of the most advanced curricula, is struggling to find an adequate number of qualified employees for the jobs in the new age. To expect that India, where colleges offer a generally outdated curricula, will be able to produce well-qualified graduates and have faculty who can teach courses in the new areas, is unrealistic.

What does this mean? Will our graduates be rendered jobless, especially those studying computer science and engineering, although it appears that no stream is likely to remain unaffected by the machine revolution?

What can students do? They must develop a life-long ‘education mind set’, and urgently begin to train themselves to meet the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. On researching, I found many online courses on these subjects — some costly, some affordable and some free. Students will have to search for courses of their interest, enrol for them and master them without delay. The new employer is keen on employees who are well-equipped in the different machine technologies, as well as possess skills such as inventiveness and creativity.

“AI can take on repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up humans for other activities,” said Mike Rollings, Vice President Research at Gartner. “Rather than have a machine replicating the steps that a human performs to reach a particular judgement, the entire decision process can be re-factored to use the relative strengths and weaknesses of both machine and human to maximise value generation and redistribute decision making to increase agility.”

These requirements heighten the need to be trained in communication skills, critical thinking, soft skills and the global language of business — English. “They are precisely the skills robots can’t automate,” writes LinkedIn Learning Editor Paul Petrone in a blog.

The writing on the wall is clear. Students will have to prepare themselves industriously for these challenges, or experience joblessness. The New Machine Age is not going to spare anyone as it is going to affect every aspect of business and society.

184,2020/01/04,Watch: Al Pacino goes Nazi-hunting in his debut web series ‘Hunters’,"Hollywood icon Al Pacino turns into a Nazi hunter in his web series debut, Hunters. The highly anticipated series will see him go on a murderous rampage.

The trailer of the conspiracy thriller, produced by the award-winning Jordan Peele, was released on Friday night and has been garnering quite a buzz.

The series follows a group of Nazi hunters in New York. The group is known as the Hunters.

Set in the late 1970s, the trailer follows Pacino on a quest to find a team who will help him violently hunt down Nazis living in the city and planning to start the Fourth Reich in the US.

The trailer opens with Meyer Offerman (Pacino) attending a funeral. After the service, Meyer is seen consoling Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), and said that he knew his deceased grandmother because they “went to the camps together”.

“She lived through all of that just to be shot in the living room by a burglar,” said Heidelbaum, adding that he feels his grandmother’s murder was a result of something personal.

To which Meyer responded: “I suppose every murder is personal”. He then recruits Heidelbaum to his team, explaining that he co—created the group with Heidelbaum’s grandmother.

The trailers showcases the thin line between taking matters into one’s own hands and doing it the right way.

It also stars Jerrika Hinton, Josh Radnor, Kate Mulvany, Tiffany Boone, Greg Austin, Louis Ozawa Changchien, Carol Kane, Saul Rubinek, Dylan Baker and Lena Olin.

The series is produced by Amazon Studios, Peele’s Monkeypaw Productions and Sonar Entertainment, was created by David Weil, who serves as executive producer and co—showrunner alongside executive producer Nikki Toscano.

Alfonso Gomez-Rejon directed the pilot and is an executive producer. The series is executive produced by Win Rosenfeld from Monkeypaw Productions; Nelson McCormick; Tom Lesinski from Sonar Entertainment.

The series will go live on Amazon Prime Video on February 21.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4wkywy/article30478695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hunters,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/al-pacino-goes-nazi-hunting-in-his-debut-web-series-hunters/article30478696.ece
185,2020/01/04,"‘Tenet’, ‘West Side Story’, ‘Dune’ and more: 20 films to watch out for in 2020","Among the sequels, the superhero films and the reboots this year, there just might some original stuff to look forward to. There are biopics like Jennifer Hudson playing Aretha Franklin or Benedict Cumberbatch playing the spy Greville Wynne. Superhero films include Angelina Jolie entering the MCU with Eternals, Tom Hardy taking one more shot at Venom and Wonder Woman returning, while Iron Man Robert Downey Jr decides to talk to CGI animals in the reboot of Dr Dolittle. Auteurs including Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan return. Thriller Uncut Gems is getting a lot of buzz. Acquired by Netflix, we can look forward to Adam Sandler showing off his acting chops as a New York jeweller in whole lot of trouble. There is horror, comedy, drama and crime in the coming months — but no romcoms (sigh).

Here are some of the best picks to keep a look out for:

Underwater

(January 10)

Underwater

Science fiction and horror, subterranean creatures, a besieged research station and Kristen Stewart with short, silver hair. Will William Eubank’s Underwater be 2020’s answer to Alien? Stewart has the hair right. And remember, no one can hear you scream under water either. Or could it be a happy creature feature? Meg seems so long ago! Vincent Cassel, Jessica Henwick, John Gallagher Jr., Mamoudou Athie, and T.J. Miller also star.

The Last Thing He Wanted

(January 27)

Anne Hathaway stars as a journalist who gives up her job to care for her father (Willem Dafoe) who just happens to be an arms dealer for the American government in Central America. Directed by Dee Rees, The Last Thing He Wanted is based on Joan Didion’s eponymous book. Ben Affleck stars as government official Treat Morrison. The movie, which is premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, has been acquired by Netflix.

Little Women

(February 7)

Little Women

A Christmas release in the States, this latest adaptation of Louisa M Alcott’s coming-of-age novel comes to India a little later. Saoirse Ronan (Jo), Emma Watson (Meg), Florence Pugh (Amy) and Eliza Scanlen (Beth) are the March sisters growing up in 1868, the year the novel was published. Meryl Streep stars as Aunt March, and Laura Dern as Marmee while Timothée Chalamet is childhood friend Laurie in this period drama directed by Greta Gerwig.

Bloodshot

(February 20)

Bloodshot

This movie sounds so insane that it should be fun and the right antidote to all the flowers, red hearts and candy from Valentine’s Day. Vin Diesel plays Bloodshot, a Marine who is killed and brought back to life to become the ultimate killing machine (why?) He is also hell bent on revenge. David Wilson makes his debut in this film based on a comic book character. Guy Pearce stars as Dr. Emil Harting, the evil scientist who does shady experiments to create Bloodshot.

Godzilla Vs Kong

(March 11)

Godzilla vs. Kong

Yes last year’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters was awful but Kong: Skull Island was good fun with Samuel L Jackson doing his deranged Ahab routine. This one pits Legendary Pictures monsters against each other. Directed Adam Wingard, the film stars Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown and some shady conspiracy theories.

A Quiet Place: Part II

(March 18)

A Quiet Place: Part II

The Part II seems just that wee bit pretentious. John Krasinski, who wrote and directed A Quiet Place (2018) about the Abbott family played by Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe, struggling to survive blind aliens with an acute sense of hearing in a post-apocalyptic world, has written and directed the sequel as well. Blunt, Simmonds and Jupe reprise their roles while Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou join the cast. The sequel looks at new terrors the Abbotts have to face.

No Time to Die

(April 8)

No Time To Die

This is the 25th film featuring the suave super spy and Daniel Craig’s fifth and last (probably, he has become a bit of a drama queen over his role) outing as James Bond. There have been all sorts of things happening on this movie from Danny Boyle dropping out as director to accidents on set. Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek is the antagonist, so what is Christoph Waltz’s Blofeld doing in the mix? Then there is Léa Seydoux who Bond walked or rather drove into the sunset with at the end of Spectre. Will she do a Tracy? Ana de Armas, the nurse who couldn’t tell a lie in Knives Out, also incidentally starring Craig, plays a CIA agent assisting Bond. Ralph Fiennes (M), Naomie Harris (Moneypenny), and Ben Whishaw (Q) reprise their roles.

Antlers

(April 16)

Antlers

Produced by Guillermo Del Toro, Antlers is based on a short story by Nick Antosca. The horror film tells the story of a boy who has a scary secret— something to do with horns I wager. Directed by Scott Cooper, Antlers stars Keri Russell, Jesse Plemons, Jeremy T. Thomas, Graham Greene, Scott Haze, Rory Cochrane, and Amy Madigan.

Black Widow

(May 1)

Black Widow

The 24th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow is joined by Stranger Things’ David Harbour, who plays a Russian super soldier, Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian—maybe this proves he is the ‘American’ at the end of Stranger Things Season 3 in Russia who goes native and becomes Alexei! Rachel Weisz also stars as yet another Black Widow in this film directed by Cate Shortland, which takes off immediately after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016). Florence Pugh plays Natasha's sister.

Artemis Fowl

(May 29)

Artemis Fowl

Why did it take so long for this movie to be made? Eoin Colfer’s books about a 12-year-old criminal mastermind are the greatest fun. With Kenneth Branagh directing, the film is sure to be magnificently mounted and since he is not starring in the film, Artemis Fowl is guaranteed to be a rip roaring ride. Based on the first two novels of the series where Artemis (Ferdia Shaw) is searching for his father, the film also stars Judi Dench and Josh Gad.

Top Gun: Maverick

(June 26)

Top Gun: Maverick

Why is there Maverick in the title? If it wasn’t, would we be fooled into thinking the film is about some other hotshot pilot—Topper Harley for instance? So then many years after Tony Scott’s Top Gun (1986), Tom Cruise is once more in the cockpit, now as flight instructor. Val Kilmer reprises his role as Iceman Kazansky while Jennifer Connelly is Maverick’s love interest—that thing with Charlie (Kelly McGillis ) obviously didn’t last. Why do we want to watch Cruise grin maniacally again? Mainly as a science experiment— how does he keep himself forever young like that?

Minions: The Rise of Gru

(July 3)

Minions: The Rise of Gru

Who says only Star Wars can have prequels? Little yellow creatures in denim overalls with a fondness for banana can have them too. Minions first appeared in Despicable Me (2010) as helpers to the wicked Gru. They became so popular, they had their own movie, Minions (2015) which was a kind of origin story for them. In the sequel directed by Kyle Balda, the minions meet a young Gru. Look out for more gibberish and mayhem.

Ghostbusters: Afterlife

(July 10)

Ghostbusters: Afterlife

After the gender-swap reboot in 2016, this one is supposed to be the real deal, being directed by Jason Reitman, son of the original director, Ivan Reitman. In addition, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts reprise their roles—what happened to the Alien movie featuring Weaver? However, the city of New York which was an important part of Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) has been replaced by some generic American countryside. When a single mom and her two children move to the country, they discover their legacy.

Tenet

(July 17)

Tenet

After placing Dunkirk in a very specific time and place, Christopher Nolan is back to his spatial and temporal high jinks. In the trailer Dimple Kapadia says “you have to start looking at the world in a new way”. With Nolan that is kind of a given innit? There are also mentions of avoiding World War III and something worse than a nuclear holocaust—all suitably portentous. John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Michael Caine and Kenneth Branagh star in this twisty thriller—music is outstanding as always.

The Witches

(October 8)

Anne Hathaway will star in Roald Dahl’s ‘The Witches’ | Photo Credit: Jordan Strauss

Robert Zemeckis directs and co-writes this second adaptation of Roald Dahl’s novel about a boy and his grandmother defeating evil witches. While the 1990 film directed by Nicolas Roeg featured Anjelica Huston, this one features Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, and Chris Rock.

Death on the Nile

(October 9)

Kenneth Branagh will return as Detective Hercule Poirot in ‘Death on the Nile’

Kenneth Branagh returns as the magnificently-moustachioed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in this sequel to Murder on the Orient Express. For some strange reason Tom Bateman reprises his role as the amorous Bouc. What is the director of the Orient Express doing on a steamer? Based on Agatha Christie’s 1937 novel of the same name, the cast includes Russell Brand and Ali Fazal, with Wonder Woman Gal Gadot playing heiress Linnet Ridgeway and Armie Hammer playing Simon Doyle. Hopefully Poirot would have stopped giggling over Dickens on board the luxurious Karnak.

Deep Water

(November 13)

Ana de Armas will star in ‘Deep Water’

It seems to be the year of the lovely Ana de Armas as she stars opposite Ben Affleck in Adrian Lyne’s psychological thriller. Like Lyne’s last movie, Unfaithful (18 years ago!) Deep Water also features an unhappily married couple playing vicious mind games on each other. Bring on the bodies! Tracy Letts, Lil Rel Howery, and Rachel Blanchard play supporting roles in the film based on a Patricia Highsmith novel.

Dune

(November 18)

Long considered unfilmable, Dune based on Frank Herbert’s eponymous novel gets its second cinematic outing (David Lynch directed the 1984 film) with Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) at the helm. Dune stars Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem.

West Side Story

(December 18)

West Side Story

Why is Steven Spielberg doing a remake? Anyway, this take on Romeo and Juliet about teenagers from rival street gangs in 1950s America was a Broadway musical and a 1961 film directed by Robert Wise. Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler play star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria. Spielberg was originally supposed to work on West Side Story after Indiana Jones 5, but that seems to have been pushed back so here we are with Spielberg and Sharks.

The Duke

(no release date)

Jim Broadbent from ‘Game of Thrones’ will be in ‘The Duke’

Based on a true story, Jim Broadbent stars as a 60-year-old cab driver who steals a Goya and promises to return it on the condition that the government spends more on elder care. Directed by Roger Michell, The Duke, seems to be a potent mix of thrills and warmth. Helen Mirren also stars in this ultimate art heist movie.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/uot8im/article30478628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2020-moviesjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tenet-west-side-story-dune-and-more-20-films-to-watch-out-for-in-2020/article30478604.ece
186,2020/01/04,‘Alli’ deserves an audience here: Karthik Subbaraj on presenting ‘Chola’ in Tamil,"There seems to be a culture of co-existence developing among filmmakers cutting across languages. One could argue that Anurag Kashyap is the torch-bearer of this movement, if you wish to call it that, and has been instrumental in bridging the gap between filmmakers across the country.

It is gradually picking up pace down South with director Karthik Subbaraj leading the pack. His production house, Stone Bench, has been at the centre of several initiatives. One such is the launch of Stone Bench Indie, which provides a platform for independent filmmakers. “It (co-existing) has been happening in Bollywood. It will be great if it happens down South, and I am working towards that,” says Karthik Subbaraj, about presenting the Malayalam indie movie Chola, re-christened as Alli in Tamil.

Brothers in arms

When filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan was toying with the idea of releasing Chola in Tamil Nadu, the first name that crossed his mind was Karthik’s. A meeting was arranged followed by a screening. The movie, Karthik says, had a profound impact on him so much so that he could not come out of its zone for the next two days.

The decision to distribute Alliworked two ways. One, Karthik was looking for a strong, sensible movie to launch Stone Bench Indie; and two, Sanal wanted the backing of a mainstream filmmaker, for he had made Chola as a Malayalam-Tamil bilingual.

As someone who is well-aware of the indie circuit, Karthik says he was impressed with Alli for retaining the aesthetic sense that is usually found in world cinema. “I watch independent movies on and off. Every time I watch a foreign movie, it gives this mood piece sort of a feeling. Alli gave that feel, and I felt it deserves an audience here,” he explains.

Stone Bench Indie, which has a team of three including Karthik, will also fund independent projects, provided they are rich in content. Alli, in fact, is the first finished product that the production house is presenting. Karthik says that his team at Stone Bench Indie will decide whether or not a movie is worth spending for, “So far, we have been involved in projects right from scratch, be it movies or web series. I told my team about Alli and they also jumped at the idea,” he says.

A different cinema

Tamil audience might find it hard to warm up to Sanal’s movies, given the abstract nature of his narratives. But that is what fascinated Karthik, prompting him to take Alli under his wing.

“ I have seen Ozhivudivasathe Kali and Alli — both deal with larger politics of society with smaller characters,” he says, adding, “You will be left with a lot of questions. I know some people might not get the inner politics of it, but Alli works as a movie even without that.”

Talent spotting Alli stars the National Award-winning actor Joju George, Nimisha Sajayan and Akhil Viswanath in lead roles. Karthik was so impressed by the measured performance of Joju George that he signed him to play a prominent character in his upcoming movie with Dhanush. “I wanted an experienced actor for D40. Jojo George was finalised after I watched Alli. He is treated like a demon in the movie. Later, I watched his Joseph which I loved. He has played a very important role in D40,” says Karthik.

Abstractness is not the reason why Chola has been trimmed for the Tamil version. Both Karthik and Sanal felt that it was a slow-burn, and wanted to tighten it even further. “It is a violent movie, but we haven’t toned down the violence. We have made certain changes with regard to the pacing of the movie. I had a few suggestions and he [Sanal] was kind enough to oblige.”

Double-edged sword

Karthik understands the risks involved in presenting an indie movie to a mainstream audience.

“I know there is an audience for a movie like Petta or Jigarthanda. But there are movies that solely rest on a filmmaker’s voice. I know the risks, and I know I cannot invest beyond a certain amount. But if I get bogged down by that, my purpose gets defeated,” he says, adding that he is targeting at 75 screens for Alli, which is scheduled for release later this month.

Karthik Subbaraj is not the only filmmaker to support indie ventures. Right before Alli, it was announced that director Vetri Maaran will be presenting the National Award-winning movie Baaram , directed by Priya Krishnaswamy. What is drawing mainstream filmmakers towards indie movies lately? “This is not a big deal for reputed production houses. Somewhere down the line, it has to start as a movement. Which is why filmmakers have started supporting them,” he remarks.

“It was a coincidence that Vetri Maaran sir announced it a day before us. I spoke to him and he was the one who released Alli’s first look (along with director Pa Ranjith), and he said, ‘I am only presenting one movie, but you have started an initiative which is very healthy’,” Karthik says, adding in conclusion that Ranjith and S Sashikanth’s Y Not Studios are also in the process of backing independent movies.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/z8xjlt/article30478144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AV7I9730JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/alli-deserves-an-audience-here-karthik-subbaraj-on-presenting-chola-in-tamil/article30478146.ece
187,2020/01/04,Photo-exhibition ‘No Answers’ based on the migrant labourer’s presence and sexual violence,"When photographer-artist Binu Bhaskar returned to Kerala after a stint abroad, in 2012, the presence, and the number, of migrant labourers struck him. As he was by the cases of violence against women, cases such as Nirbhaya and how some of these horrific crimes were forgotten. These two elements segue - the migrant labourer’s presence and sexual violence - in his first feature venture Kottayam, which was screened at the International Film Festival of Kerala (2018).

This film delves into these concerns, with empathy toward the labourer who has left home to come to Kerala to make a life here, he clarifies. The film releases on January 17, and an exhibition, ‘No Answers’, of photographs based on the film, is on at Draavidia Art Gallery, Fort Kochi.

“Kottayam was a long project which started in 2016,” says the 47 year-old who divides his time between Guruvayoor and Thiruvannamalai, where he has a farm. Work on the film, which was also shot in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and places around the Himalayas, involved extensive research as part of which he shot several portraits and a few landscapes.

His fine art photographer’s eye captured the striking images of people, “My works have been people who are connected to the land. For this project I photographed a lot of people since the film is about the displaced.”

Around 35-odd stylised photographs (collages and installations) are on show. The artist in him plays around with the images and tells the stories, in a format seldom seen - material for film as an art show. For now cinema is his medium, fine arts will have to wait.

With this show he also experiments with the idea of space— the gallery as a private space and the cinema hall as a very public space — while creating art out of art (the photographs and the film).

He chose the moniker, ‘No Answers’, because “you hear of all these things, but only partially. And it is all old news and forgotten two days later,” he says referring to cases of sexual violence against women and its reporting.

He is no newcomer to the fine arts, the English literature graduate had conducted his first solo exhibition at Draavidia Art Gallery in the late 1990s, and the current exhibition is a kind of revisiting that old connection though the city has many more spaces to show art today. Since completing his photography degree in Australia, he worked with art galleries there and elsewhere. He has lived and worked in Dubai, in the advertising industry, which he quit out of ‘boredom’. A few years spent in Spain, as part of his stint in Europe, resulted in a Spanish film ‘Roadsong’ which whetted his interest and led him to films; he is the cinematographer of the Malayalam film Lukka Chupi (2015).

Making the film opened his eyes to the filmmaker’s struggle, especially exhibiting it. Kottayam was chosen deliberately, as location, to underline the fact of migration —emigration, immigration and migrants. As a result it is a place populated by a new people and the resultant inevitable tensions.

“Our intention was to use Kottayam to express a certain geography. A terrain which was once virgin is now violated, like what happens to the female protagonist, Annie and resonates with the tribal people of Himalayas who are now forced migrant labourers.” The film follows the investigation into the rape and murder of a policewoman in Kottayam, which leads the investigators to the North-East.

The Kottayam cast includes scenarist Sangeeth Sivan, Aneesh G Menon, Annapoorni Devaraja, Shafeeq, Nzabeni Kitan, Ravi Mathew and Nimmi Raphael. The cast and crew comprises new faces. Binu co-wrote the script with old friend Sajith Narayanan. The film has been produced by NiteVox.

Binu’s oeuvre

Binu has shown his works in Kochi and internationally. He has shown at ‘Alive’ - Dalslands Konstmuseum (Sweden), ‘Human Race’ - the Mojo Gallery (Dubai), ‘Di stance’, Bodhi Art, Travancore Palace (Delhi), ‘Diksha’ - Smith Street Gallery (Melbourne), ‘Intérieur nuit’ - La Galerie Miniature (Paris), Christie’s Auction ‘South Asian Contemporary Art’ (New York), ‘Inner Vision’ - The Guild (New York), ‘Witness’ - Centre for Contemporary Photography (Melbourne).

188,2020/01/04,A.R. Murugadoss on working with Ajith and why their 'Mirattal' was dropped,"It does not get any bigger than Rajinikanth for an Indian filmmaker. For AR Murugadoss, it is a dream come true to direct his boyhood idol in a feature film — Darbar, which is scheduled to release on January 9.

But the filmmaker is not alien to working with the biggies of Indian cinema; quite the opposite, he is someone who made his name working with stars like Aamir Khan, Suriya, Vijay, Chiranjeevi, Akshay Kumar, Vijayakanth, Mahesh Babu and the likes.

The filmmaker, in fact, started his career with a star. His debut film, Dheena (2001), catapulted both Murugadoss and its star Ajith Kumar to instant fame.

It was Dheena which gave Ajith the moniker by which he is still fondly referred to by his fans, Thala.

Six-pack situation

And yet, there is an odd thing about Murugadoss’ relationship with Ajith.

The filmmaker has collaborated on more than one occasion with most of the big name stars he has worked with, except Ajith.

The duo were set to work again, and even launched a film named Mirattal way back in 2004. But the movie was dropped for unknown reasons, and the Ajith-Murugadoss combo never materialised since.

In an exclusive conversation with The Hindu, Murugadoss shed light on the situation.

“Mirattal had to be dropped because there were problems between the producer and Ajith sir after we started the project,” the director recalls.

Soon after, Murugadoss started work on the film Ghajini (2005) with Suriya. The film fetched accolades, and was remade in Hindi in 2008 with Aamir Khan in the lead.

But more importantly, the film also started the ‘six-pack fetish’ among leading stars in Indian cinema.

However, Murugadoss reveals that he had no idea how sporting six-pack abs could alter the image of a hero, until Ajith Kumar introduced him to the concept.

“It was Ajith sir who, when he heard the script for Mirattal, had suggested that he would gain six-pack abs for the film. He told me instantly after listening to the story line. It was not in the script but only after he told me that did I start to think, ‘Oh, if a hero sports a six-pack, it would look nice’,” says Murugadoss.

“Though we did not end up doing Mirattal eventually, his idea gave me the opportunity to ask stars like Suriya and Aamir Khan to gain six-pack abs for their roles,” he adds.

So why has a film not materialised since Mirattal?

“It has always been a good relationship between us. But I started working in Hindi and Telugu films after [Mirattal was dropped], and when I returned to Tamil, I had opportunities to make films with Vijay sir. So, slowly, this small gap built up.

191,2020/01/04,"‘STR was punctual,’ says ‘Maha’ director UR Jameel","Hansika Motwani’s 50th film directed by UR Jameel, Maha, which has actor Silambarasan aka STR playing a cameo role, is generating buzz after a promotional photo featuring STR was uploaded to Twitter recently. While the revelation is that STR is set to play an airline pilot, filmmaker Jameel has now clarified that the actor will be seen playing an “extended cameo” in the film. “The fact is that he has a screen time of nearly 45 minutes. He will be seen in the flashback portion of the film,” Jameel says, adding that STR’s character will be “based on real life incidents”.

“We have fine tuned the role with some fictional touch, and his portions will be more gripping,” Jameel notes. It was speculated that STR’s character too will be named Jameel, which the filmmaker confirms. “We had [thought of] the name Shoaib initially. But our team felt that it was too common a name, and we zeroed in on [Jameel],” he adds. STR has also steadily built up an unwanted reputation of being a difficult actor to work with in the Tamil film industry. Director Jameel, however, has only good things to say of his star. “I have never come across a perfectionist like him. He would be an early bird to the shooting spot, and he would remain calm and patient even if there was a delay in wrapping up the day’s shoot,” Jameel says, adding that STR “was punctual” throughout the shoot.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9x19yy/article30477315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STRMaha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/str-was-punctual-says-maha-director-ur-jameel/article30477316.ece

Scheduled to release on January 9, the film will vie for box office attention amid other Telugu big ticket releases — Mahesh Babu starrer Sarileru Neekevvaru, Trivikram Srinivas’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo starring Allu Arjun, and Kalyan Ram starrer Entha Manchivaadavura directed by Satish Vegesna.

Darbar is positioned as an action thriller and the Telugu dubbed version is presented by produced N V Prasad. During the pre-release event, an action-laced video of the film was unveiled. Action choreographers Ram-Lakshman stated that they were eager to work on a Tamil film and took up the offer when Darbar came their way.

The guests for the evening included Telugu directors Vamshi Paidipally, Harish Shankar, Maruthi, producer-distributor Dil Raju and BVSN Prasad. Harish stated that Rajinikanth had broken records in the pre-digital era: “In this digital age, there’s stiff competition about who gets the maximum hits online. Rajini sir broke all records without the big events and publicity decades ago. That’s how he became close to the Telugu audience.”

196,2020/01/04,Model Code of Conduct lifted after rural local body elections,"The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission has announced that the Model Code of Conduct has been lifted following the completion of rural local body elections in 27 districts of the State.

Speaking to media persons on Saturday, Tamil Nadu State Election Commissioner R. Palaniswamy said, “Local body elections in rural areas were conducted in a fair and transparent manner in the 27 districts. All the elected representatives of rural local bodies will be sworn-in on Monday.” However, the Commission did not provide a final tally of the results.

“We have taken action on complaints received from political parties. We are analysing the video footage. We will take action against officials who are responsible for procedural lapses. We have received many complaints against Returning Officers and Assistant Returning Officers,” said Mr. Palaniswamy.

The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission has received 712 complaints in written format and 1,082 complaints on the phone during the period of December 1, 2019 to January 4, 2020. “We have taken action on all the complaints. All the issues reported in the complaints have been addressed immediately,” said Mr.Palaniswamy.

Reacting to a question on the allegation by DMK leader M.K. Stalin that the State Election Commission was acting in favour of the ruling AIADMK, Mr. Palaniswamy said the election was conducted in a fair manner. “We have taken action on all the complaints by all the political parties. We have been fair and transparent. This is our message; and a strong message,” said Mr. Palaniswamy.

“This election was better than the previous election for local bodies in the State. The people know it. It was conducted in a fair manner with 1,890 micro observers from Central government agencies monitoring the counting of votes,” said Mr. Palaniswamy.

“We have not taken any decision on conducting election for urban local bodies in two phases. We will announce it later,” said Mr. Palaniswamy.

As many as 1 lakh polling personnel were at work in the 27 districts where elections have been conducted. A total of 91,975 posts in rural local bodies will be filled by the elections.

In the first phase, 77.1% polling was reported. In the second phase, 77.73% polling was registered. Polling has been postponed in areas such as K. Periapatti in Tiruchi district and Sennagaram in Tiruvannamalai district because of the death of the candidates.

197,2020/01/04,Former Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P.H. Pandian no more,"Former Assembly Speaker and the AIADMK’s legal advisor, P.H. Pandian, died of cardiac failure at a private hospital in Porur in Chennai on Saturday morning. He was 74. He had been under medical treatment for cardiac-related problems.

He is survived by a daughter — Devamani, a gynaecologist, and four sons — P.H. Arvindh Pandian, an Additional Advocate General, P.H. Manoj Pandian, the AIADMK’s former MP and MLA, and Naveen Pandian, a doctor, and Vinoth Pandian, an advocate. His wife and former Vice-Chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Cynthia Pandian, died in January 2018.

The funeral will be held on Sunday evening at the Kilpauk Cemetery in Chennai.

Known for his statement during his term as Speaker that the presiding officer of the Assembly had “sky high powers”, Mr Pandian hailed from Cheranmahadevi in Tiruneveli district. A product of the Pachaiyappa’s College and Law College in Chennai, he enrolled himself at the Madras Bar in April 1968.

After M.G. Ramachandran formed the AIADMK in October 1972, Mr Pandian joined his party and got elected for the first time to the Assembly from the Cheranmahadevi constituency (now abolished) in 1977. He went on to win in 1980, 1984 and 1989. In the 1989 Assembly polls, he was the only nominee of the AIADMK (Janaki faction) to win.

Mr. P.H. Pandian emerged into prominence when he became the 11 Assembly Speaker in February 1985, a post he held for 4 years. In November 1986, when the Opposition had confronted him, Mr. P.H. Pandian told the Assembly that “sky is the limit [for me]."" Five months later, the Assembly awarded S. Balasubramanian, then editor of Tamil weekly Ananda Vikatan, a three-months rigorous imprisonment for publishing a cartoon. For the next couple of days, when the State was rocked by the controversy, it was left to Mr. P.H. Pandian to defend the House’s decision. The row was resolved a few days later with him ordering the release of the journalist in deference to Chief Minister’s wishes.

There were other controversies associated with Mr. P.H. Pandian’s innings. In the first of its kind, the Assembly, in December 1986, expelled 10 MLAs of the DMK for having taken part in an agitation to burn the Constitution. In January 1988 when the Janaki Ramachandran ministry sought a vote of confidence in the House, Mr. P.H. Pandian, in two installments in a single day, disqualified 33 MLAs, belonging to the rival faction of the AIADMK led by Jayalaithaa.

On Mr. P.H. Pandian’s rulings, his long-standing colleague C. Ponnaiyan, who was Law and Education Minister in the 1980s, said his actions were based on his interpretation of the Constitution to the effect that “the Assembly and the office of Speaker are independent authorities which cannot be controlled by judiciary or executive.”

When the merger of the AIADMK factions led by Janaki Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa took place in February 1989, he stayed away and in 1991, he contested unsuccessfully in his native place as an independent with the DMK’s support.

In August 1993, he returned to the AIADMK, after associating himself briefly with the Tamil Nadu Movement for Good Governance led by Subramanian Swamy. In 1999, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Tirunelveli constituency and headed the AIADMK’s parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha.

After Jayalalithaa’s death, Mr. P.H. Pandian refused to accept the leadership of V.K. Sasikala and publicly raised suspicions about the circumstances leading to the former Chief Minister’s death. He had associated himself with O. Panneerselvam who had revolted against Sasikala in February 2017.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselam visited the residence to the former Speaker in the city to pay homage to him. Mr. Palaniswami described Mr. P.H. Pandian ’s passing as a “huge loss” to the AIADMK.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3wble2/article30477031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04JANTH-PANDIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/former-tamil-nadu-assembly-speaker-ph-pandian-no-more/article30477032.ece
198,2020/01/04,T.N. rural local body polls: Stalin calls it a massive victory against odds,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday said that his party and its allies had secured massive win in the rural local body polls, going by the trends so far, despite the State Election Commission acting in favour of the ruling party and alleged misuse of power by the AIADMK.

“The results have brought to light the people’s faith in the DMK and their dissatisfaction over the ruling AIADMK,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Stalin said the elections should have been held in 2016, but it was delayed by the ruling party. “We went to the High Court and the Supreme Court, which imposed strict conditions due to which the State Election Commission conducted the election now,” he said.

He alleged that despite making complaints to the State Election Commissioner even at mid-night to stop malpractices by the ruling party, there was no change in their attitude.

Despite Ministers of the ruling party campaigning in various districts and distributing money, the AIADMK had suffered a set back, which showed the level of dissatisfaction people had towards the current government, Mr. Stalin said.

He pointed out that several family members of the AIADMK leaders losing elections like the former AIADMK MP Anwar Raja’s daughter and the party’s Manamadurai MLA’s wife. “The people have taught a lesson to the ruling party, but it is doubtful whether they will learn the lessons,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said if the urban local body elections had been held along with the rural local body elections, the DMK could have secured a bigger win. Mr. Stalin also thanked the people who voted for the party and its alliance candidates for ensuring their massive win. He said elderly people, a college student, a transwoman and a conservancy worker winning the elections were positive signs.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/17445s/article30474289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THTNSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-calls-it-a-massive-victory-against-odds/article30474290.ece
199,2020/01/04,"16,000 CCTV cameras recorded counting: State Election Commission","The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (TNSEC) on Friday told the Madras High Court that it had installed around 16,000 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, at the rate of about 50 cameras in each of the 315 counting centres spread across 27 districts, where local body elections were held.

Justice M. Sathyanarayanan was also told that more than one lakh polling personnel and over four lakh counting agents were involved for counting 8.01 crore votes cast by two crore voters, with each of them casting four votes for different posts, to elect their representatives from among 2.34 lakh contestants.

The details were submitted in compliance of an interim order passed by the judge during a late night hearing held by him on Thursday on a writ petition filed by R.S. Bharathi, organisation secretary of the DMK, accusing the commission of not maintaining purity in elections by acting in favour of AIADMK candidates.

The TNSEC filed an affidavit on Friday claiming that a free and fair process had been followed to fill 91,975 posts, including 515 district panchayat ward members in 27 districts; 5,090 panchayat union ward members in 314 panchayat unions; 9,624 village panchayat presidents and 76,746 village panchayat ward members.

It submitted that one IAS officer had been deputed as Election Observer in each of the 27 districts where the elections were held and six micro observers deployed in each of the 315 counting centres. The polling officials had been instructed to strictly adhere to the statutory rules on counting of votes and declaration of results, the commission said.

However, senior counsel N.R. Elango, representing the writ petitioner, alleged that Returning Officers in the districts began favouring the ruling party candidates when the initial trend across the State showed that the results were by and large in favour of the candidates sponsored by the DMK and its allies.

“A series of malpractices have been committed by the election commission officials in support of the AIADMK party,” the senior counsel said and pointed out that irregularities were at their peak in the local bodies in Salem and Karur districts in particular. He insisted on production of CCTV cameras from those two districts.

In reply, senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, appearing for the TNSEC, obtained time till January 20 from the court to file a counter affidavit to an additional affidavit filed by the petitioner alleging irregularities in certain districts. Thereafter, the court may take a call on production of the CCTV footage from the counting centres, he said.

“The commission is not shying away from producing the CCTV footage, but we do not want this to become a precedent,” the senior counsel told the judge who wanted to know why sample footage from the two districts should not be produced in the court to rebut allegations of irregularities in the counting process.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/16000-cctv-cameras-recorded-counting-state-election-commission/article30474282.ece

203,2020/01/04,T.N. rural local body polls: Impressive show by DMK in central region,"The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has put up an impressive performance in the rural local body elections in the central region, securing a majority in district panchayats in six of eight central districts. The AIADMK managed to gain majority in the district panchayats of Ariyalur and Karur.

The DMK’s most striking performance came from Tiruchi, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts as it relegated the AIADMK to single digits in district panchayats and panchayat unions.

Claiming that the commanding performance of the party in the region was on expected lines, former Minister and DMK Tiruchi south district secretary K.N. Nehru said the party always performed well in local body elections. “We had won most of the seats in the civic polls even in 1986 when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was riding the crest of a wave with three successive electoral wins,” Mr. Nehru said. The results were a forerunner to the party’s victory in the Assembly elections, he added.

AIADMK routed

The party trounced the AIADMK in Tiruchi and Thanjavur districts. In the 24-member district panchayat council in Tiruchi district, the party won 18 wards. The DMK’s ally, the Congress won another ward, leaving just five to the AIADMK. The party cornered a lion’s share of seats in the panchayat unions, winning 146 out of the 241 seats. The DMK and its allies are set to bag the chairmanship in at least a dozen of the 14 panchayat unions.

In Thanjavur, the party won 21 of the 28 district panchayat wards, leaving six to the AIADMK (The result of one ward was not officially announced till late on Friday evening). Apart from retaining its sway over the delta region by winning a majority of district panchayat seats in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, the DMK made deep inroads into the turf of Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar to win 11 of the 22 wards in the Pudukottai district panchayat.

The Congress strengthened the alliance tally by winning two wards. The AIADMK could manage only eight seats while its ally, the Tamil Maanila Congress, won from a ward. The DMK won 113 of the 225 panchayat union wards and secured a clear majority in eight of the 13 panchayat unions, including the Viralimalai Panchayat Union, Dr. Vijayabaskar’s native, in the district. In Perambalur, the DMK won seven of the eight district panchayat wards and the AIADMK triumphed in just one ward.

The AIADMK, however, won a comfortable majority in Karur district panchayat with nine seats, leaving three to the DMK. The ruling party won 66 of the 115 panchayat union wards in the district while the DMK bagged 33. The AIADMK secured a comfortable majority in six of the eight panchayat unions in the district.

Ariyalur goes to AIADMK

In Ariyalur, the AIADMK decimated the DMK winning eight of the 12 wards in the district panchayat. The DMK could manage only one district panchayat seat while three other wards went to ‘others.’ However, the DMK put up a better show in the panchayat unions winning 40 of the 112 wards, while the AIADMK won 35 seats.

The Left parties, especially the CPI, put up a good show in Tiruvarur, a traditional Left bastion. The CPI won three district panchayat seats and 21 panchayat union wards. The CPI (M) won one district panchayat and three panchayat union wards in the district.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qv1zim/article30474248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TYCITY-DMKCADRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/impressive-show-by-dmk-in-central-region/article30474249.ece
204,2020/01/04,"T.N. rural local body polls: Results prove that PMK is the third largest TN part, says Ramadoss","PMK founder Dr. S. Ramadoss on Friday claimed that the recent results of the local body polls held in rural areas prove that PMK is the third largest party in the State. Dr. Ramadoss also added that the DMK alliance only leads the AIADMK by a slender margin in terms of number of seats won in the local body polls.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that PMK has won 16 out of the 36 district panchayat wards and has bagged 224 out of the 430 panchayat union wards it contested.

“Contesting in panchayat unions, PMK has won 52.09% and 44.44% of the total panchayat union and district panchayat seats that it contested in. I have no doubts that this is one of the biggest wins,” said Dr. Ramadoss.

He was confident that the AIADMK would have won more seats if the local body polls had been held in all districts.

“In the same way, thousands of PMK members have won the village panchayat president and village panchayat ward members, where candidates fight the polls not on party lines but as independents,” he claimed.

Stating that PMK contested in less number of seats despite its strength at the grassroots, the party has won so many seats despite money and lies being used against the party by the Opposition, he further claimed.

“When the polls for Villupuram, Vellore and Kancheepuram are held soon, where PMK is very strong, I am sure that AIADMK-PMK would smile a lot more than the DMK. I urge the PMK cadres and office-bearers to work harder in the polls held to be 9 districts,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jq76fc/article30442365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DECTH-PMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/local-body-poll-results-prove-that-pmk-is-the-third-largest-tn-part-ramadoss/article30474241.ece

Its ally, the PMK won a considerable number of seats thanks to its Vanniyar vote bank.

The Chief Minister's home district of Salem gave a major victory to the AIADMK. The party bagged 18 district panchayat seats while its allies the PMK and the DMDK bagged four and one respectively. The DMK won five.

In the Chief Minister’s home town of Edappadi, the DMK won just one ward.

In Krishnagiri, the AIADMK lost the district panchayat to the DMK by securing only eight seats, including the one bagged by the PMK, while the DMK and its allies managed to win 15 seats. Similarly, in the Nilgiris, the DMK bagged four of the six district panchayat seats, leaving just two for the AIADMK.

The AIADMK bagged a sizeable number of seats both in the district panchayat as well as in the panchyat union wards in the other districts. In Tiruppur, the AIADMK bagged 13 seats leaving just four for its rival and its allies.

206,2020/01/04,T.N. rural local body polls: AIADMK edges past rivals in southern districts,"The AIADMK has gained marginally over its political rival DMK in terms of the district panchayat member posts in southern districts of Tamil Nadu.

Out of eight districts in the south, the ruling AIADMK wrested control in Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari, Theni and Virudhunagar.

The DMK emerged victorious in Madurai, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram respectively. Both the DMK and AIADMK bagged eight seats each in the Sivaganga district panchayat.

Interestingly, the BJP opened its account in Theni, Dindigul, Virudhunagar, Madurai and Kanniyakumari districts for various posts including the district panchayat member seat.

In Theni district, the BJP won a seat to the district panchayat post, while many of its candidates emerged outside the counting centres waving the victory symbol and armed with the certificate received from the officials.

BJP State secretary R Srinivasan, in charge of south zone, said the party developed roots in the rural local bodies. “This is an important step and a beginning for us. This has silenced many of our critics,” he added. The BJP, which lost to its rivals by wafer-thin margin, would only make the cadre prepare for the upcoming polls, Dr Srinivasan said. After the outcome of Lok Sabha poll, this election results had come as a morale-booster for the AIADMK, which was not the case with the DMK as they should have swept the polls. Thus, it was a beginning of the end for the DMK,” he summed up.

‘Proof of public ire’

The DMK regional leaders in south said they had emerged victorious despite interventions by the ministers and MLAs with the official machinery.

The former Minister Thangam Thennarasu from Virudhunagar district said they had won comfortably in the district panchayat posts and in the unions against their rivals AIADMK. This only showed the public ire against the government, the intra-party feud and the local minister’s autocratic behaviour.

In Madurai, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram too, the DMK had won comfortably. Interestingly, in Sivaganga district, the DMK and AIADMK shared eight seats each in the district panchayat member post, which is poised for indirect election for the chairman post.

The victory of the AIADMK combine in Kanniyakumari district came as a shock to the DMK and Congress functionaries. Local Congress leaders said that the indifferent attitude and non-cooperation from the CPI(M) made them to contest, which proved to be advantageous to the AIADMK candidate.

Similarly, in the neighbouring Thoothukudi district, the DMK walked with the cake in urban pockets of the Pearl city, while the AIADMK bagged major chunk in rural areas such as Vilathikulam.

The victory for the AIADMK in Theni district was much needed to the party after the results in Lok Sabha. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam told The Hindu that the performance would continue in the ensuing Assembly polls too. “The DMK should stop indulging in misleading the people. We sincerely thank the electorate whose votes had shown that this government is delivering,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-edges-past-rivals-in-southern-districts/article30474168.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has put the onus of winning the municipal polls on the MLAs concerned and sent a stern message that any lapse in the plan of winning all the municipalities and corporations will be viewed seriously.

The Chief Minister, who spoke for 90 minutes at a stretch giving minute details of the planning for reaching out to masses, reminded the MLAs that these were not general elections and various factors come into focus in voting. He advised them not to encourage only those people who moved with them during ticket selection but take into account every worker.

A pen drive with the list of beneficiaries of government schemes was also handed over to the MLAs and KCR asked them to reach out to every beneficiary and remind them of the schemes implemented by the government, said a senior TRS leader. The meeting was attended by all senior leaders and incharges and the CM asked them to constantly remind people of the Aasara pensions, Kalyana Lakshmi, Kaleshwaram project benefits and other schemes. Mr. Rao told them that the party was on a strong foot and the opposition was weak.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress would not be able to make much impact, according to the CM but MLAs and local leaders concerned should ensure that every household was touched with the network of people who had enrolled as party members recently. Mr. Rao ruled out alliance with any party, including the Communists. These parties would approach TRS leaders locally but they should not be entertained, he said.

Referring to the problems faced by North Telangana districts, Mr. Rao mentioned migration of people from these districts to Gulf countries, and said he would take a tour of the Gulf countries, along with MLAs, after the municipal polls to discuss their problems and find solutions. Migration to Gulf from these districts has been a big political issue.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao also touched upon his proposed initiative, “Each One Teach One” and asked all the leaders to take it seriously. A date would be announced soon and all the party members should be part of it.

Later, the MLAs belonging to erstwhile districts met separately and discussed their issues.

Dharmadhikari Committee and the Telangana utilities taking up the process to relieve the staff allocated to AP.

This time, 10 days after the final report of the One-Man Committee appointed by the Supreme Court completing the allocation of employees, the AP utilities have requested the panel to keep its report “under abeyance” and have filed a direction petition in the Supreme Court challenging the final report of the committee.

Further, in a letter addressed to the Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Transco and TS-Genco on January 4, Joint Managing Director of AP-Transco K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu has requested the Telangana utilities “not to relieve any employee in pursuance of the One-Man Committee Report”. He informed the Telangana utilities that “AP power utilities are not going to admit or give posting to any of the employees who are now working in Telangana power utilities (and allocated to AP by the panel) as there are no vacant posts to accommodate them”.

‘No obligation’

Besides, the AP official stated in the communication that the employees allocated to AP by the committee afresh would be in addition to the number of employees which AP power utilities were obliged to accommodate as per the AP Reorganisation Act. The Dharmadhikari Committee has filed its final report on December 26 following the continued sharp differences between the two sides even after over a year’s exercise to bring some rapprochement.

Sources in the Telangana utilities, however, told The Hindu that they had started the process to relieve the employees allocated to AP as part implementing the One-Man Committee report. “We are simply complying with the order of the Supreme Court appointed committee,” a senior executive of Telangana utilities said.

The Telangana official explained that the committee had given four months time for postings to the relieve employees on either side and not for relieving them.

220,2020/01/04,‘Both Centre and State to blame on turmeric board issue’,"Kisan Congress, the farmers wing of All India Congress Committee, has alleged that the State government has been grossly neglecting the agriculture sector, a key driver of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, AICC Kisan Congress vice-president M. Kodanda Reddy and State president of Kisan Congress Anvesh Reddy accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of not keeping the promises made to the farming community, particularly to the sugarcane and turmeric farmers. They sought to know why Mr. Rao had deceived the sugarcane farmers on the promise of reviving the Nizam Sugar Factory.

Blaming both the Central and State governments for not establishing the turmeric board in the State after making the promise during the elections, the Congress leaders said Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao did not show any initiative in the matter and he did not even write a letter to the Centre in this regard. “A letter from the Chief Minister on the turmeric board issued would definitely have made a difference and both the Central and State government are shying away from the responsibility now,” Mr. Kodanda Reddy alleged.

They suggested that the Centre could at least include turmeric in the minimum support price list in case of any technicalities preventing it from establishing the turmeric board and requested the Chief Minister to write to the Centre to include the crop in the support price list. The Kisan Congress leaders further alleged that the BJP’s words on the turmeric board were limited only to score some politics points.

On withdrawal of subsidy on the farm equipment, Mr. Anvesh Reddy said it should be re-introduced to provide some relief to farmers, who could afford them, from the huge labour costs. He also criticised the Chief Minister for not keeping the election promise of implementing the farm loan waiver up to ₹1 lakh a farmer.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/both-centre-and-state-to-blame-on-turmeric-board-issue/article30479143.ece

Deodhar said that except in certain universities where some students echoed anti-national slogans, the entire country and people belonging to all sections of the society, strongly support the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Population Register (NPR).

Speaking here on Friday, he said that neither the CAA nor the NPR are against the interests of Muslim citizens. They are only against only those who intrude the country with malafide intentions and enter from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

He said that the country has the largest Muslim population in the world. Those opposing the Act are doing so with evil designs and are spreading venom for their political gains, he said, adding that nowhere in the world, except in India, are Muslims safe.

Mr. Deodhar said that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh declared themselves Islamic Republics, one after another, but India has never declared itself as Hindu State. Addressing a public meeting at the DSA Ground here, Mr. Deodhar remarked that utterances of Pakistan president Imran Khan and Rahul Gandhi on CAA are similar.

Citizens of the country will not tolerate TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao, MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Congress leaders if they provoke people on religion lines, he said.

BJP State president K. Laxman said that it was the Congress which divided the country on the basis of religion. “Is it wrong to provide citizenship to our Hindu brethren in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh where they had undergone persecution all these years?” he asked.

Member of Parliament D. Arvind said that the BJP is in the hearts of people, and advised the TRS leaders not to talk against his party without applying their minds. He also advised them not to create panic among people on CAA and NPR.

Thanks to lethargy and negligence on the part of officials preparing the voters’ list for the forthcoming municipal elections, the toddler has been issued a voter ID card (YOJ8588352) with her picture as a one-year-old.

The age mentioned in the ID card is 35 years.

The three-year-old, who resides in Maruthinagar, is an LKG student at a private school in the same locality.

Several discrepancies have been noted in the voters’ list prepared for the municipal elections scheduled to be held between January 22 and 25.

225,2020/01/04,"Adilabad Collector urges citizens to bring blankets, instead of bouquets for New Year","It is surely a nice augury for bureaucrats to start a New Year with ‘warm’ greetings.

Last year, district Collector D. Divya urged people intending to greet her not to bring bouquets, but blankets. The plan is to provide protection to as many poor people, especially in rural areas, from the severe cold that prevails in the district around the turn of the year.

“We too are blessing her,” said Salar Khan Pathan, a seller of winter wear and blankets near the TNGOs home. “We have sold around 2,000 blankets during the last four days, thanks to her initiative,” he gave the reason.

January 1 alone saw around 1,000 blankets, shawls and sweaters being handed over to Ms. Divya by those who greeted her. Though the final count has not yet come in, the total number of blankets and other types of winter wear received will exceed 3,000, according to sources.

“There was lot of enthusiasm among officials and others who purchased the merchandise. Some bought 20, some 30, and some others 50 of the warm blankets, each costing around ₹200,” Mr. Pathan pointed out.

The appeal of the Collector also had a spin off which the general public is not aware off. It infused enthusiasm among many individuals, who purchased two or three blankets and handed them over to the poor who sleep in railway stations without any protection from the cold, according to a winter wear salesman at NTR chowk.

“Such people even wake us up at midnight and seek to purchase the blankets. We do oblige despite the severe cold as it is charity work,” Mr. Pathan observed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1wst8p/article30473710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04ADB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/people-extend-warm-new-year-greetings-to-collector/article30473711.ece

The prosecution, which presented 15 witnesses, argued that Balaraju, an alcoholic, nurtured a grudge against Sreeja, who was a Class X student in a local school, for repeatedly telling him to stop drinking.

After his wife Sayavva left for her parents house in Machareddy mandal, Balaraju hacked Sreeja. He fled after committing the crime. Sayavva was shocked to see her daughter’s body after she returned home. The police registered a case based on her complaint. They arrested Balaraju and investigated the case.

227,2020/01/04,Ministers release app for Medaram jatara,"The comfort of devotees turning up for Sammakka-Saralamma jatara is important to the State government, Minister for Tribal Welfare Satyavathi Rathod said on Friday.

Along with Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao and Endowments Minister A Indrakaran Reddy, she reviewed the progress of works under way for the biennial Medaram jatara, scheduled to be held from February 5 to 8.

The Ministers went around Medaram and surrounding villages, inspecting ongoing civil works and arrangements, besides paying obeisance to tribal gods – Sammakka and Saralamma at their altars. The Ministers also released Medaram app on the occasion.

The Minister, who inaugurated bathing ghats at Jampannavagu (stream), directed the officials to ensure water level even in the stream to avoid accidents. They asked the officials to identify accident-prone areas and put up signboards besides manning those spots with professional swimmers.

“With not much time left for the jatara, all the arrangements such as drinking water, toilets and bathing ghats should be completed before January 15,” Ms. Rathod said, instructing officials to draft more manpower to expedite works. In order to make the jatara plastic-free, the authorities were ensuring supply of cotton and paper bags manufactured by self-help groups, she said.

“Efforts are on to get national status to the Adivasi jatara, which is regarded as Asia’s largest tribal fair. The State Government has decided to invite President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, Union Ministers and prominent tribal leaders to project the importance of the jatara,” said the Minister.

Mr Errabelli Dayakar Rao expressed unhappiness over the slow pace of Hyderabad-Warangal road expansion works. He directed the authorities to complete the works before the commencement of jatara.

The onus was on Trust Board to ensure that the jatara became a huge success. He emphasised the need for coordination between officials and Trust Board members to ensure that arrangements were in place for the jatara.

Endowments Minister Indrakaran Reddy said the jatara had been witnessing a gradual increase in the number of devotees visiting it. “With more than 1.30 crore devotees expected this year, the onus is on officials to ensure arrangements properly,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/z9tovj/article30473683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04HYMULUG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ministers-release-app-for-medaram-jatara/article30473684.ece
228,2020/01/04,Irfan calls time on his career,"Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan called time on his 15-year career at the Star Sports studio, here on Saturday.

One of India’s most prominent swing bowlers, Irfan, however, may play in overseas franchise-based leagues.

On his mind

Irfan said the thought of hanging up his boots had crossed his mind after a word with the National selectors a few years ago.

“In 2016, I had a good outing in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I spoke to the selectors after that, but got the feeling they were not too happy. I knew that was it. There was no way I could return to the National team,"" he said.

However, Irfan continued to play Ranji Trophy for Baroda, and for Jammu and Kashmir as player-cum-mentor till the last season.

“In domestic cricket, too, I have been part of Jammu and Kashmir cricket and after last season, I thought ‘what’s the motivation to play any more’?” Irfan said.

“I will keep contributing to Indian cricket, but it is always better if someone else takes my place in domestic cricket. There are a lot of other things in store for me,” the left-arm pacer, who will continue as J&K mentor said.

Irfan featured in 29 Tests, 120 ODIs and 24 T20Is. He last donned India colours in 2012, but indifferent form and injury issues forced him out of National reckoning.

Fans of Indian cricket will always remember Irfan’s heroics during India’s tours of Australia and Pakistan in 2003-04, where he impressed the likes of Wasim Akram. In his debut series, he emerged the highest wicket-taker against Australia and Zimbabwe in the ODI tri-series.

The hat-trick

His hat-trick in the first over of the Karachi Test of 2006 established him as one of the leading swing bowlers of his time. He was also part of the Indian team that won the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 taking three wickets in the final against Pakistan.

“It has been a great journey. I played cricket with all my heart and soul. I am really proud of it and when I look back, I feel happy with my achievements. It’s been a great career,” the pacer said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/kxgb5q/article30478667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRFANPATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/irfan-pathan-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket/article30478668.ece
229,2020/01/04,Government gives green light to IOA for hosting Commonwealth shooting and archery events in India,"The government on Saturday approved “in principle” the Indian Olympic Association’s (IOA) proposal to host the Commonwealth shooting championships and archery events — which are not part of the 2022 Commonwealth Games roster — in March 2022.

Earlier this week, the IOA had withdrawn its threat to boycott the Birmingham Commonwealth Games over shooting’s omission and decided to submit a formal proposal to host a shooting championships, where the medals won will be counted in the tally of the 2022 edition.

“I am directed to refer to Indian Olympic Association’s letter dated 1st January, 2020, regarding holding of Commonwealth shooting and archery events in India in March 2022 and to convey the ‘in-principle approval’ of the government,” the Ministry said in a letter.

On Friday, IOA had written a letter to Commonwealth Games Federation President Dame Louis Martin, outlining the cost of hosting shooting and archery events.

“Whilst the costs outlined and enclosed in the shooting programs have been graciously accepted to be met largely by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), the archery programme will likely be funded solely by the Government of India,” IOA wrote in the letter.

The IOA also asked CGF to “consider the cost and operational complexity of the proposals.”

“Regarding the enclosed proposals, I venture to add that it is far more cost effective and efficient to conduct both events simultaneously and in the same host city,” IOA president Narinder Batra said in the letter.

“We have given you two options to consider as the NRAI is awaiting your decision to conduct or not the full bore discipline in the shooting programme which is a significant cost.

“The NRAI has informed me that this decision would be necessary to recommend whether the events could be hosted in Chandigarh or New Delhi.”

The IOA also proposed that the two events are run “adjunctly to and some months prior to the XXII Commonwealth Games in Birmingham during 2022“.

“It is proposed that the opening ceremony would coincide with Commonwealth Day on the 14th of March 2022.”

The IOA also informed CGF its decision to “bid for hosting of 2026 or 2030 Commonwealth Games in India.”

230,2020/01/04,"IND vs SL: Break was not difficult as I didn’t feel any pain, says Bumrah","The forced four-month break due to a stress fracture “wasn’t a difficult” period for India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah as there was “no pain” and he utilised the time away from the game to work on his strength and conditioning.

Bumrah is making a comeback to competitive cricket against Sri Lanka in the opening T20 international in Guwahati on Sunday.

“It was not difficult for me as I was never in pain. Not even for a single day. I took it as an opportunity to build my strength,” Bumrah told bcci.tv after his first training session with the team.

He was always updated about how the team was progressing and did his homework so that he is not found wanting once he is back in action.

“I was always keeping a track on what is happening so when you are back in the team, you shouldn’t be too far away.”

The 26-year-old slinger felt that playing all three formats continuously did affect his fitness, for which the break was necessary.

“When you play continuously, your strength level goes down. Your fitness level can also go down a little bit. So I was looking at how to bring the strength back, how to improve upon the things I wanted to improve.

“So take some time off and return fresh. Be hungry again. So all these things were on top of my mind. I am not looking too far ahead. I wanted to take one match at a time,” said Bumrah.

Bumrah feels that if one plays regularly, it becomes difficult to remain “hungry”.

“Initially what happened, I was playing a lot of cricket and it was very difficult to manage the hunger. I was playing regularly. Then I got a break and after that I felt like ‘now you want to play as soon as possible’ You are always eager but you don’t want to rush into things.”

Bumrah thanked the Indian support staff for consistently keeping a tab on his rehabilitation work and giving their valuable inputs.

“Very good inputs (from bowling coach Bharat Arun). I was always in touch with the support staff. The team management also kept on asking me what was going on and how was I progressing. Constant monitoring was going on. They asked questions like what do you want to do now that you are back from break.”

Bumrah was satisfied with his first complete training session under lights on Friday evening.

“The intensity was very good, very high intensity, to the point where you do exactly what you wanted to do.

“At the fielding session, we covered all bases, we did the high catches, we did the run-out practice. And in the nets, we did spot bowling, practised bowling yorkers. We ticked all the boxes,” he added.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/aqadtf/article30478538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUMRAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/sri-lanka-tour-of-india-india-vs-sri-lanka-first-t20-international-in-guwahati-bumrah-on-his-comeback/article30478539.ece
231,2020/01/04,"Jailed Chandrashekhar Azad unwell, needs immediate medical care: Bhim Army","The Bhim Army claimed on Saturday that its jailed chief Chandrashekhar Azad was unwell and needed immediate medical care.

Rejecting the claim, a senior jail official said Mr. Azad was “absolutely fine” and no such issue had come to their notice during routine medical check-ups by the official jail doctor.

Mr. Azad’s personal doctor Harjeet Singh Bhatti claimed that the Bhim Army chief suffers from a disease which requires biweekly phlebotomy, a “procedure to remove extra red blood cells from the blood to treat certain blood disorders”.

Bhim Army spokesperson Kush Ambedkarwadi, who had met the jailed chief on Friday, said Mr. Azad has been undergoing treatment for the disease for the past one-and-a-half years and that he had informed authorities at the Tihar Jail, where he is currently lodged, about it.

The last session of phlebotomy was scheduled a week ago. Mr. Azad has been complaining of headache, dizziness and pain in abdomen, Mr. Bhatti claimed.

“If Azad doesn’t get immediate medical care, his blood might get thicker and he may suffer a cardiac arrest. The jail authorities are not allowing him to visit AIIMS,” he said.

“This is inhuman and clear violation of human rights. I request Delhi Police and (Home Minister) Amit Shah to get him admitted to AIIMS,” he posted on Twitter.

The jail authorities, however, said Mr. Azad was “absolutely fine” and medical assistance will be provided to him if the need arises.

232,2020/01/04,J&J implants: Maharashtra FDA sends 50 names for compensation,"Maharashtra’s Food and Drugs Administration has so far recommended the names of 50 patients who received Johnson & Johnson’s faulty hip implant for compensation by the U.S.-based company. The recommendations followed a review of these patients’ case files by an expert panel and have since been forwarded to the Centre.

FDA commissioner Pallavi Darade said they had received 74 applications after they published advertisements asking hip implant patients to come forward and submit their details. “The number of applications related to J&J’s faulty hip implant were 50 and all them were recommended for compensation after scrutiny,” Ms. Darade told The Hindu, adding that the expert panel had held 11 meetings to review the applications.

The metal-on-metal Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip implant manufactured by J&J’s subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics was recalled worldwide in 2010 following reports that it was leaching metal and causing severe pain, fluid accumulation, and metal poisoning in the patients. In November 2011, the Maharashtra FDA was the first to file a First Information Report against J&J under Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) of the Indian Penal Code and several sections of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. As many as 4,700 surgeries have been carried out in India that involved use of the faulty implant.

“Getting the applications from new patients will be a continuous process since so many have been operated upon in the State,” said Ms. Darade. “The expert panel meets as and when we get applications,” she added.

Last year, J&J offered to pay ₹25 lakh to each of the 67 patients who had undergone revision surgeries after being implanted with the faulty hip replacement. Many patients had accepted the interim payment but said it cannot be termed as the fair and final compensation.

The medical device company was asked to pay compensation amounts derived through a formula based on the disability, age and other risk factors of the patients, which could range from ₹30 lakh to ₹1.2 crore. J&J, however, challenged this in the Delhi High Court and stated that it was willing to pay only ₹25 lakh per patient.

“The company has paid hefty amounts to patients in the United States,” said Vijay Vojhala, a patient who was implanted with the faulty artificial hip in 2008. “What they are doing here is simply an eyewash.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jj-implants-maharashtra-fda-sends-50-names-for-compensation/article30480590.ece

Talking to reporters in Kota after visiting the hospital, he said the State’s response to the deaths should have been “more sensitive”. “Our response was not satisfactory, to some extent. We should have been more compassionate. Since we are in power, we have to be responsible and face the consequences,” he said.

Seven more children died at the hospital in the first four days of 2020, after 100 infants died in December 2019.

Mr. Pilot, who also met some of the families of the children, said one “could not escape responsibility by citing the number.”

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had said infants had died at the hospital even when the BJP was in power, and the number of deaths had come down under Congress rule. State Health Minister Raghu Sharma, who went to Kota on Friday, accused the BJP of politicising the matter.

Mr. Pilot, who is also the president of the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee, said that not just Congress president Sonia Gandhi but also the entire country was concerned about the deaths. “The entire country has been shaken up...

Darapuri were among 14 persons granted bail by a Lucknow court on Saturday in connection with violence in the Uttar Pradesh capital on December 19 during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Additional Sessions Judge S.S. Pandey passed the bail order and asked the accused to furnish two bail bonds of ₹50,000 each and personal bonds of the same amount. The 12 others granted bail included Dalit lecturer Pavan Rao Ambedkar.

As per the FIR, 34 named persons were charged under 18 Sections of the IPC and the Public Property Act.

The charges include serious ones like rioting, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy.

However, the charges have been questioned by the Congress and the families of Ms. Jafar and Mr. Darapuri.

In a detailed memorandum signed by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and submitted to Governor Anandiben Patel, the Congress said Ms. Jafar was arrested from the spot “without cause or reason” while she was recording a video when the protests turned violent.

The party and Ms. Jafar’s family also alleged that she, a single mother with two minor children, was “brutally assaulted” by police officers in custody.

The family of Mr. Darapuri also questioned his arrest. The Mr. Darapuri, 76-year-old retired IPS officer and Ambedkarite activist, was under house arrest on December 19 when the violence took place. His son Ved Kumar recently told The Hindu that Mr. Darapuri did not attend the protest but posted a photo of himself holding a placard which read ""Save Citizenship,"" on Facebook to express solidarity.

The next morning at around 11:45 a.m., a group fo about nine policemen came to his residence and arrested Mr. Darapuri without informing his family where he was being taken, they said.

Known for voicing issues concerning the marginalised, Mr. Darapuri also contested the Lok Sabha election in 2019 from the backward area of Sonbhadraa and his family claims he was was implicated due to his activism.

""Satyamev Jayate (truth alone triumphs,"" Mr. Ved told The Hindu after his father was granted bail.

236,2020/01/04,Sena denies Minister Abdul Sattar’s resignation,"Abdul Sattar, a Shiv Sena junior Minister, on Saturday reportedly offered to quit from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, upset at being relegated to a Minister of State in the recent Cabinet expansion.

Mr Sattar was among the 36 ministers of the three parties - Shiv Sena, Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) - who took oath to office on December 30, 2019.

The first cracks in the ruling coalition surfaced following a prolonged delay in the allocation of portfolios to the new Ministers.

Mr. Sattar’s reported resignation, which was later denied by senior Sena leaders, was not confirmed either by the Governor’s Office or the Chief Minister’s Office until the time of going to press. Sources said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had deputed a team of leaders to negotiate with him.

Abdul Sattar Abdul Nabi, a three-time MLA from Sillod, was a Cabinet Minister in the Congress government in 2014. Mr Sattar was appointed a Cabinet Minister of Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development after he won a second term in the legislative assembly elections on a Congress ticket in 2014. However, he resigned from the Congress, claiming that he did not get any support during the local elections.

Two years later, he resigned from the Assembly in support of the Maratha quota demand, which would guarantee government jobs and education to be reserved for Marathas. Mr Sattar He later attempted to join the BJP, but was denied ticket and joined the Shiv Sena in September 2019.

Meanwhile, Sena leaders said the rumours of Mr Sattar’s resignations were baseless. Sena leader Arjun Khotkar said there was no question of Mr Sattar tendering his resignation.

“These rumours are baseless. Sattar Sahab will meet CM Uddhav Thackeray tomorrow. This is the party’s internal matter and I am now going to meet him and talk to him,” said Mr Khotkar.

Senior Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut also denied a rift in the MVA. “There are no differences in our Cabinet. If some minister resigns then normally resignation is sent to CM or Raj Bhawan. But both have no information about it yet,” Mr Raut told reporters.

Mr Sattar’s son Sameer told the media he was not aware of the resignation and requested everyone to wait and watch for a statement from the father himself.

The BJP claimed it was the beginning of the end for the MVA. “They have taken a full month to expand the Cabinet and now without any portfolio allocation, one minister has already resigned. This is the beginning of the fall of this government,” said former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis.

The discontent among the MVA is owing to delay in the distribution of portfolios, BJP Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Council Pravin Darekar said. “This government was formed days ago but it has still not sorted out the internal differences. Now the news of a MoS resigning only shows all is not well. This government will not survive long,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l37uqd/article30478498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABDULSATTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/reports-of-sillod-mla-and-minister-abdul-sattars-resignation-baseless-says-shiv-sena/article30478499.ece
237,2020/01/04,‘Foreigner’ from detention centre dies in Guwahati hospital,"Naresh Koch became the first 'declared foreigner' to die in captivity in the new year. He happened to belong to the Koch-Rajbongshi community that has been demanding Scheduled Tribe along with five other indigenous communities in Assam.

Doctors at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital said Koch, who was in his mid-50s, died on Friday night due to health complications. He was brought in a critical condition from the Goalpara detention centre, about 140 km west of Guwahati, 10 days ago.

Goalpara is one of six detention centres functioning from central jails in Assam. Together, they house about 1,000 people declared foreigners by 100 Foreigners' Tribunals across the State.

Koch, officials at the detention centre said, was lodged in March 2018 after a tribunal in Goalpara district marked him a foreigner.

“The man suffered a stroke and died in the hospital. He was from the Mornoi area [near Sainik School, Goalpara],” Goalpara's Superintendent of Police Sushanta Biswa Sarma told The Hindu.

‘It’s the poor who suffer’

Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who represents the Kaliabor constituency in central Assam, said the death was another example of how the poor bear the brunt of the politics around citizenship. “It is invariably the poor and the marginalised who suffer when forced to show documents to the satisfaction of the administration. And it does not matter which religion you belong to,” he said.

Data provided by the government in the Assembly in November 2019 said 25 declared foreigners died in the detention camps since 2009, when they were established. The government also said 335 such people having served three years in detention were set to be released conditionally, in deference to a Supreme Court order on May 10, 2019.

Most of the declared foreigners were Bengali speakers, both Hindus and Muslims. A few like Koch -- from indigenous communities or settlers from other parts of India -- have been victims of the system too, activists said.

One such person was Amila Shah, a Hindi-speaker, whose father Keshav Prasad Gupta had come from Bihar and settled down in north-central Assam's Sonitpur district during the British rule. Another is Puna Munda, a tea plantation worker, whose family traced their roots to Sekai village in Jharkhand's Gumla district.

“Such cases show the system of declaring foreigners is flawed,” said H.R.A. Choudhury, a senior lawyer.

Case dropped

On December 31, the Foreigners' Tribunal No. 2 in Bongaigaon district dropped a case against one Akbar Ali, who was served a notice by the police for the second time in four years.

Tribunal member Eva Kakoti dropped the case following a plea by the office of the district superintendent of police.

Ali, a farmer, was lodged in the Goalpara detention centre after the same tribunal, on December 31, 2015, declared him a foreigner for “illegally entering” the State after 1971. He was released on bail on November 21, 2019, but was served a notice within a week.

“I don't know why I became a foreigner despite possessing all requisite documents. But I know my case left my family shattered and battling poverty, forcing my children to leave studies,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/qbwdu2/article30421357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THDETENTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/foreigner-from-detention-centre-dies-in-guwahati-hospital/article30478222.ece

243,2020/01/04,"Civil society groups, officials, Opposition decry AFSPA extension in Nagaland","Various Naga civil society groups, State government officials and opposition parties have expressed displeasure over the extension of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 in Nagaland by another six months.

The Centre issued a notification on December 30 last year extending the law in Nagaland till July-end which empowers security forces to conduct operations anywhere and arrest anyone without any prior notice.

The Union Home Ministry had said in the notificiation that the central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole state of Nagaland is in such a “disturbed and dangerous” condition that the use of armed forces in aid of civil power is necessary.

However, State government officials, Opposition and organisations like Naga Hoho, Naga Mothers Association (NMA), Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) and Nagaland Tribes Council (NTC) have expressed resentment over the move.

The State government always objects to the extension of AFSPA in Nagaland as and when the Union government seeks the State’s opinion before declaring Nagaland a ‘disturbed area’, but the law is extended every year and now it has become a routine exercise, a Government official told PTI on condition of anonymity.

“As the State government, we have been objecting to the extension of AFSPA and even this time we did so when the Union Home Ministry sought our views. The State government doesn’t want AFSPA but we are not aware if the Centre is looking at wider issues unknown to the state,” the official said.

Opposition leader and former Chief Minister, T.R. Zeliang sarcastically said Nagas got the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 as a “Christmas gift” instead of peace accord between Naga groups and the Centre and now extension of AFSPA has come as a “New Year’s package"".

Naga Hoho general secretary K. Elu Ndang said AFSPA is not relevant anymore in a civilised society and its applicability has no place in the modern world.

“AFSPA is only a means to terrorise and create fear among innocent people,” he said.

India being the largest democracy must live on the values of democracy and in the true spirit of secularism, Mr. Ndang said.

NMA President Abei-u Meru told PTI, “I don’t see any reason or situation why AFSPA was extended in Nagaland. Is it to please the security forces?”

The NSF media cell condemned the move in a statement.

“A peaceful state like Nagaland is painted in a picture of chaos and lawlessness by the Centre’s notification, as the world is witness to the fact that Nagaland is not what it is made to look by the ill-intended notification of the central government,” it said.

“The extension of AFSPA is not for the maintenance of law and order in Nagaland but only a diabolic attempt of the Centre to further the suppression of the Naga people through militarisation and to encourage the numerous abuses and serious human rights violations by the armed forces which has been ongoing for many years,” it added.

The NSF also questioned “the overarching approach of the central government in extending the inhumane Act as law and order is the subject matter of the state government.”

The federation also reiterated its long-standing view that the AFSPA violates the Constitution as infringes upon the fundamental rights of the citizens and that the law must be repealed.

NTC general secretary Nribemo Ngullie said, “What NTC is confused is that Nagas are passing through the political negotiations with the Government of India (GoI) and according to the commitment given by the GoI, settlement should have already been made but it is getting delayed because of one or the other technical reasons.”

He said that extension of AFSPA while giving hope for a settlement of the Naga political issue is “like handing over an olive branch or a piece of bread on one hand with a stick on the other.”

“When we want peace...there should be total peace but the Nagas have been continuously threatened by AFSPA for the past 70 years, and the fear psychosis continues. There is no peace in our minds under the draconian law and it is time that the GoI thinks how to soften AFSPA,” Mr. Ngullie added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article19433425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/zeliang,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/civil-society-groups-officials-opposition-decry-afspa-extension-in-nagaland/article30476798.ece

The student, Mustafizur Rahman, said on Friday that he wanted nothing but an “unconditional apology” in public from the BJP leader.

The Union Minister accused Mr. Rahman of being a “serial offender” and saying that he “does not need to apologize to fools”. Mr. Supriyo also said that his comments had nothing to do with the student’s religion.

The matter came to light on December 26 when Mr. Supriyo shared a post on the social media advocating Citizenship (Amendment) Act and criticised the act of a Jadavpur University’s student, who tore up the first page of the contentious legislation at the annual convocation of the university while receiving her gold medal on December 24.

The next day Mr. Rahman commented on Mr. Supriyo’s Facebook post and questioned the educational qualifications of Mr. Supriyo and BJP State president Dilip Ghosh. “Babul-da (dada) how educated are people like you can be gauged from the fact that your mentor (State president) Dilip Ghosh spots gold in cow milk,” Mr. Rahman wrote.

To this Mr. Supriyo retorted “Mustafizur Rahman let me first pack you off to your country, then will send the reply in post card”. The comment triggered a wave of protests.

Mr. Rahman, a final year student at a Birbhum college in Birbhum district, said, “I am in possession of enough proof about my identity as an Indian and a Bengali. You don’t know how to respect Bengalis and still you are the MP of the State..... Are you drinking cow urine regularly?”

247,2020/01/04,Vehicles of anti-CAA leaders attacked,"Unidentified miscreants attacked two leaders of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement about 220 km apart on Thursday night in Assam.

The police said they were probing the attacks and that there was no evidence yet to establish these were related to the anti-CAA stir.

Shots alerted people

In the first of these incidents, a gunman fired at the car of Binoy Barua at Ganakpukhuri near Dergaon in eastern Assam’s Golaghat district. Mr. Barua had gone to the house of an acquaintance Pranjal Rajkonwar and the car was parked outside his house when the shots were fired.

“The gunman fled after the shots alerted the neighbours... the attack could be related to the anti-CAA protests I have been organising,” Mr. Barua said.

Golaghat SP Pushpraj Singh said seven empty cartridges were recovered from the site of the incident. “The man who was attacked is politically active. We are investigating, so it is difficult to say at this point of time whether the incident is due to political or personal enmity or if there is some other reason,” he told The Hindu.

The local police said the incident happened around 9 p.m., almost 12 hours after Mr. Barua had organised an anti-CAA rally in Ganakpukhuri.

Almost simultaneously, some miscreants pelted stones at the car of Entajul Islam, a former leader of the All Assam Students’ Union leader, when he was travelling from Udalguri town to Paneri in north-central Assam’s Udalguri district.

The AASU has been spearheading the anti-CAA movement in Assam which began violently and claimed six lives in December 2019.

The district police said the attack could have been carried out by two unidentified men riding a two-wheeler.

249,2020/01/04,Malegaon blasts: NIA gives defence non-truncated witness statements,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday handed over non-truncated copies of 122 witness statements to the defence in the 2008 Malegaon blasts trial.

The agency had earlier refused to share information about several “sensitive” witnesses with the accused — BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur, Lt. Col. Prasad Purohit, Sameer Kulkarni, Major (retd.) Ramesh Upadhyay, Sudhakar Chaturvedi and Ajay Rahilkar.

Mr. Purohit had filed an application in court seeking all the details for a “fair trial”. The application said, “The documents supplied by NIA to him are without furnishing the names of any witnesses and most … are in the truncated form. The extent of truncation is so wide that it is impossible to construe the true import of the contents of the statements … the prosecution has deprived him of his statutory right to prepare for cross-examination and his defence.”

Appeal in HC

On November 21, 2018, the NIA court refused to share the witness names with him, after which he filed an appeal in the Bombay High Court.

On February 2, 2019, the NIA told the HC it was willing to share statements of witnesses, but it would file an application in the trial court seeking police protection for 38 sensitive prosecution witnesses. NIA counsel Sandesh Patil had told the HC that out of the 475 witnesses statements, 186 had been truncated. Of these, 38 witnesses were “sensitive” and would have to be given police protection. Their evidence would have to be recorded in-camera, he had said.

Defence lawyer Ranjeet Sangle told The Hindu, “Under NIA and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), names and other information was withheld from us. But … we need a fair and reasonable chance to conduct the chief and cross-examination of all witnesses. Therefore, untruncated copies have been given.”

On October 30, 2018, the NIA court had charged all the accused with murder, abetment and conspiracy under the UAPA.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/malegaon-blasts-nia-gives-defence-non-truncated-witness-statements/article30473831.ece
250,2020/01/04,"Govt. tells Collectors, banks to ensure transparent loan waiver","Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday instructed banks and District Collectors to ensure that only crop loans of farmers are waived under the Mahatma Phule farm loan waiver scheme and no other loan is added to the list.

According to sources within the Chief Minister’s Office, the directions were issued to ensure transparency, anticipating the possibility of banks including other farm-related loans in the scheme to lower NPAs.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has asked Collectors to take action if information of non-crop loan accounts is submitted under the scheme.

Mr. Thackeray, Mr. Pawar, Finance Minister Jayant Patil, and Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab held a video-conference with all District Collectors on Friday and a meeting with the State Level Bankers’ Committee to discuss the loan waiver. According to sources, the government will spend ₹21,216 crore on the crop loan waiver, which is estimated to benefit 30.57 lakh farmers.

‘Empathy needed’

“This loan waiver has been announced by the government for farmers and not by banks to settle their NPAs. It is the responsibility of the Revenue Department to ensure this scheme is successful. There is a possibility that beneficiaries raise questions. It is expected that every query is resolved with empathy,” Mr. Thackeray said in the video-conference.

Banks have also been instructed that farmers will not be asked to fill forms to avail benefits of the scheme, and it is the responsibility of the banks that all the information is filled correctly.

An official who attended the discussions on Friday said, “The list of farmers’ accounts which are not linked to Aadhaar will be announced on January 7. Special buses will be arranged in every village to transport farmers to the government’s Aaple Seva Kendra, where these formalities will be completed.” The entire process is likely to be completed by May 2020.

Each District Collector is being asked to set up a dashboard at the office which will be updated daily on the progress of the waiver.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/govt-tells-collectors-banks-to-ensure-transparent-loan-waiver/article30473808.ece
251,2020/01/04,Ex-CM calls on Khadse in Jalgaon,"Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday met disgruntled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse in Jalgaon, triggering speculation of rapprochement between the estranged leaders.

Also present was former minister Girish Mahajan, Mr. Khadse’s bitter political foe in north Maharashtra. The three leaders met for breakfast and had a half-hour discussion, before Mr. Fadnavis left to address public meetings in Nandurbar and Dhule districts.

However, when questioned whether his friction with some BJP leaders remained constant, Mr. Khadse evaded a direct answer, repeatedly stressing there had been no discussion among the three on anything other than the Jalgaon zilla parishad election.

“Mr. Fadnavis dropped by before proceeding to Nandurbar. We spoke about the Jalgaon ZP election and about the choice of candidates. There was no talk on any other issue,” Mr. Khadse said.

After being denied a ticket in the Assembly polls and following the defeat of his daughter Rohini, Mr. Khadse has been vocal about his disenchantment with the BJP and is said to be in touch with the Shiv Sena.

Earlier this week, Mr. Khadse had claimed that he had learnt from some BJP core committee members that Mr. Fadnavis and Mr. Mahajan had opposed the party’s decision to give him a ticket from Muktainagar, his stronghold in Jalgaon district.

On his part, Mr. Mahajan said everything was “fine” within the party. “There was some friction owing to miscommunication … but that has been resolved now,” he said.

Despite Mr. Khadse’s allegations against Mr. Mahajan, the two were seen working amicably prior to the Jalgaon ZP polls.

On Friday, the BJP retained its 30-year-old sway over the ZP, with its candidate Ranjana Patil being elected president with 34 votes against the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s Rekha Rajput, who won 31 votes. “Though the Sena, the Congress and the NCP were ranged against us, we still beat them,” Mr. Mahajan said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-cm-calls-on-khadse-in-jalgaon/article30473783.ece
252,2020/01/04,Maharashtra to present plan on women’s cyber safety,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will co-chair the next meeting of the Western Zonal Council (WZC), which will have, among other issues, women safety on top of the agenda. The 25th meet of the council will be held this month under the chairmanship of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Maharashtra, the lead coordinator this time, will present a roadmap for the safety of women online and ways to curb cyber bullying as its priority agenda, senior officials said.

The council, functioning under the aegis of the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Inter-State Council Secretariat, comprises Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, the Union Territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

“This meeting will be coordinated by Maharashtra; all States take turns to chair it. We have finalised our agenda related to coastal security and other priority projects in the State,” Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta told The Hindu.

As part of the agenda, Maharashtra will present to the council a plan for making the internet safer for women. The Chief Minister has directed the government machinery to hold awareness campaigns in districts on cyber bullying of women, cyber frauds and internet child pornography, among other internet crimes.

“The entire State must participate in the drive, to be called ‘Cyber Safe Women’, to make the internet safe for women. While there are a lot of benefits of the internet, there are some evils of this world which we need to look at seriously. Our State has prepared a special plan to ensure these crimes against women and children in the online world are prevented, a small part of which is the ‘Cyber Safe Women’ programme,” the Chief Minister announced on Friday.

Earlier meeting

The 24th meeting of the council in Goa had highlighted the need for Maharashtra to speedily investigate cases of sexual assault cases. The meeting had directed States to put in place a comprehensive security plan and improved security at railway stations. It had also discussed the implementation and mismanagement, if any, of the direct benefit transfer scheme as well as forest clearances pending for construction of the third line in the Wirpur-Sirpur section of major train projects. The next meeting could be held in Mumbai, officials said.

The five zonal councils created under the States Re-Organisation Act, 1956, are advisory bodies that discuss and make recommendations with regard to any matter of common interest for economic and social planning between the Centre and States, border disputes, linguistic minorities, inter-State transport or matters connected with the reorganisation of States under this Act.

257,2020/01/04,T.N. rural local body polls: AIADMK wins 13 out of 17 district panchayat wards in Tiruppur,"The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) won 13 out of 17 district panchayat wards in Tiruppur district in the recently held local body elections.

As per the final numbers released by the District Administration on Friday, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) managed to win only three wards – Ward No. 7 in Palladam Panchayat Union and Wards 15 and 16 in Madathukulam Panchayat Union. Congress, the DMK’s ally, managed to win only one ward.

However, the DMK secured 75 out of 170 panchayat union wards. Its allies, Congress won nine wards, CPI two wards and CPI(M) and MDMK won one ward each.

The AIADMK managed to win only 57 out of 170 wards, and its allies, DMDK and BJP, won four and three wards respectively.

While independent candidates were unable to win any seats in the district panchayat wards, they won 18 out of 170 panchayat union wards, according to election officials.

259,2020/01/04,‘Technology in classrooms cannot replace teachers’,"Technology in education, particularly in classrooms, was changing the way the teaching-learning happened but it could not replace teachers, Nandini Rangaswamy, Chairperson, GRG Institutions, said at the inauguration of Edu Intec 2020, an exhibition-cum-conference the Codissia had organised here on Friday.

“There is a fundamental shift in learning process. The millennial do not want to learn by rote; they want to learn at their own pace, place, on their choice. Basically, they want to choose what, when, where, from whom and how to learn. This has largely been aided by technology. But no way the technology can replace teachers.”

But teachers needed to embrace technology as conventional classroom was outdated. They also should realise the fact that classrooms had turned learner-centric. In embracing the technology, the faculty should realise that it could at best be only a tool for enhanced learning.

In this context, generation and dissemination of information were of importance and therefore e-content generation had gained prominence, Ms. Rangaswamy said.

Use of digital platforms and multimedia content was needed to make classrooms attractive to students as smart mobile phones, computers, cinemas and almost everything outside classrooms seemed to attract them, said G.D. Rajkumar, Trustee, Geedee Technical Training Institute.

But in using digital content or any form of technology, the institutions should understand that it could at best be a tool and overuse of technology could turn students restless, as a few studies had shown.

The schools should, instead, adopt such teaching and learning techniques that what the students learnt stayed with them for long.

Emphasising the importance of vocational education, he said when Germany realised that graduates had started preferring white-collar jobs to blue-collar ones, the government made it compulsory for students to undergo vocational training along with college studies.

India should, perhaps, adopt such a step because it was becoming increasingly difficult to find graduates with good skill sets and it was imperative that the Central Government do so at the earliest while it tried to make the country a manufacturing hub.

On the first day of the three-day conference, speakers spoke on teacher training, pedagogy, technology adoption and school management.

Ramamurthy and other office-bearers were present at the inauguration.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bu2ayr/article30473697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB04EDUINTEC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/technology-in-classrooms-cannot-replace-teachers/article30473698.ece
260,2020/01/04,T.N. rural local body polls: AIADMK will control district panchayat and 8 panchayat unions in Coimbatore,"The ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), by winning most of the district panchayat wards and panchayat unions, has re-established the fact that the district is its fort.

The party won 10 of the 17 district panchayat wards, leaving only half of it to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The Bharatiya Janata Party won two seats. The 10 seats give the party the chance to elect one of its district panchayat councillors as the district panchayat chairperson.

In the elections to the 155 panchayat union wards, the AIADMK won 83 and the DMK 51. With the addition of the seats won by their respective allies, the AIADMK tally goes up to 90 and that of the DMK to 56.

This victory gives the AIADMK the numbers necessary to control Thondamuthur (six out of nine wards), Kinathukadavu (nine out of 17), Periyanaickenpalayam (eight out of 12), Pollachi North (11 out of 17), Karamadai (16 out of 21) and S.S. Kulam (three out of five) panchayat unions.

The DMK gets to control only the Pollachi South Panchayat Union, where it trounced the AIADMK, bagging eight of the 13 seats.

In Sulthanpet Panchayat Union, the AIADMK alliance won six (AIADMK five plus DMDK one) of 13 seats equalling the DMK alliance. The party with help from the Congress’ two has managed to match the AIADMK numbers.

This leaves crucial the role of the lone Independent panchayat ward councillor.

The AIADMK sources said the Independent candidate Manoharan was a party rebel candidate and therefore the Sulthanpet Panchayat Union chairperson victory is the party’s.

The story is even more interesting in Madukkarai Panchayat Union as the AIADMK and DMK have won three seats each in the six-ward local body, leaving open the possibility that one of the two parties could poach a union councillor from the other or elicit a tacit support to win the chairperson post.

In Anamalai Panchayat Union, the role of two Independent union ward councillors could be of importance to win the chairperson post as the AIADMK alliance with six ward councillors has only a slender margin over the DMK’s five. AIADMK has six ward councillors and has the support of a BJP member. The DMK has five, including the support of a Congress member.

In Annur Panchayat Union, the support from one BJP and DMDK member gives AIADMK seven councillors in the 15-ward local body. The DMK alliance has six seats. This again leaves the support of two Independents critical to both the parties. The same appears to be true of Sulur Panchayat too, as the AIADMK has won seven of the 14 wards. The DMK has won five wards and Independents two.

In short, the AIADMK will control the district panchayat and almost eight panchayat unions.

An interesting aspect in Coimbatore was a winning candidate crying and making a scene at the counting centre in Madukkarai Panchayat Union. Sources said that the delay by polling officers in declaring her the winner as the president of Mavuthampathy Panchayat made Gomathi cry aloud. The officials had to pacify her by declaring the result. Thereafter, she wiped her tears and walked away beaming a smile.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/txwmv0/article30468832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03JANTH--COUNTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/aiadmk-will-control-district-panchayat-and-8-panchayat-unions-in-coimbatore/article30473681.ece

Of the 10 panchayat unions, the DMK won seven leaving behind only Hosur and Shoolagiri for the AIADMK, while Krishnagiri union is headed towards a tie between the two parties.

The DMK alliance won Thally, Kelamangalam, Uthangarai, Veppanapalli, Mathur, Kaveripattinam and Bargur. DMK alliance won eight seats in Krishnagiri, while the AIADMK alliance won 10 seats.

However, there are two independents touted to be swinging towards the DMK.

The AIADMK was routed in Mathur union, where the ruling party won just one seat on par with its two other allies, the PMK and the DMDK that won one seat each.

The DMK swept 10 seats and the Congress one seat in the union.

In Thally, the DMK swept 16 seats closely followed by the CPI that won 10 seats, while the AIADMK and the PMK won one ward each.

The district unit is seen to have not learnt its lessons from the byelection debacle faced in Harur and Paapireddypatty constituencies, where the loss of Harur was seen as an unnecessary loss, especially when the DMK swept the Lok Sabha election. Just as then, the debacle in the local body polls too is seemed to have been caused by inadequate grassroot management and strategy, coupled with mismanagement of local cadre disgruntlement. For instance, Dharmapuri panchayat union election saw two DMK candidates contesting in the same ward.

264,2020/01/04,Wholesale price of onion drops in Coimbatore,"The wholesale price of big onion declined to nearly ₹50 a kg in Coimbatore on Friday.

M. Rajendran, a wholesale onion trader and president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants’ Association, said the price of imported onion ranged between ₹25 a kg and ₹40 a kg. Onions from Turkey, Egypt and Holland were not selling much. The wholesale price of Indian onions was ₹45 to ₹55 a kg, depending on quality.

Onions from other countries coming to the domestic market now were imported by private traders. The Governments had also placed orders from other countries. These are expected to land in India after January 12. There might not be many takers for these and might affect the prices of Indian onions too.

In markets such as Bengaluru, the wholesale prices were relatively lower. The Government should take steps to ensure that the Indian farmers got sustainable prices, he said.

The wholesale price of small onion continued to be above ₹100 a kg. It might take a month to fall as arrivals from Mysuru are expected only then, he said.

The retail price of big onion, however, remained high at ₹100 to ₹120 a kg.

One of the leading vegetable retailers here said that retail sellers, especially large-scale players, have two to three days stock with them. The prices of big onions are falling for the last couple of days and the retailers are also diluting the stocks with them, selling at lower prices. The rates of big and small onions will fall further in the coming days, the retailer said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wholesale-price-of-onion-drops-in-coimbatore/article30473640.ece

268,2020/01/04,SA vs ENG: Elgar shines but England on top in second test,"Dean Elgar and Rassie van der Dussen put on a century fourth-wicket stand for South Africa but England have taken charge of the second test after reducing the home side to 215 for eight at the close of the second day at Newlands on Saturday.

South Africa trail by 54 runs on the first innings having bowled England out for 269 and will resume the third day with Vernon Philander (13 not out) and Kagiso Rabada (0 not out) at the crease.

England had the new ball in hand five overs from the end of play and will resume on day three in search of the wickets to quickly end the home side's innings with a handy lead.

There is plenty in the wicket for the bowlers but South Africa were able to frustrate England through the middle part of the day as they seek to build on their 107-run first test win in Pretoria.

England made an excellent start with the ball and reduced South Africa to 40 for three.

Seamer Stuart Broad (2-36) had debutant opener Pieter Malan caught by Joe Root at first slip for five, while Zubayr Hamza (5) could only fend a delivery to Ben Stokes at second slip.

James Anderson (3-34) removed South Africas captain Faf du Plessis (1), also caught by Stokes, before Elgar and Van der Dussen's century stand steadied things for the home side.

Elgar has a reputation as a dogged accumulator of runs and played to type to score 88 from 180 balls, his 14th test half-century to go with 12 hundreds.

He was out to an uncharacteristically loose shot though, trying to smash off-spinner Dominic Bess to mid-off, but only succeeding in picking out England captain Root halfway to the boundary.

The dangerous Quinton de Kock played a typically breezy 20 before he was out in similar fashion, though seamer Sam Curran (2-39) was the bowler and Anderson took the catch.

Van der Dussen's patient stay at the crease saw him reach 68 from 187 balls, before guiding Curran to Stokes at second slip.

Dwaine Pretorious also then steered an Anderson delivery to Stokes, a fourth catch for the all-rounder, before the seamer also claimed the scalp of Keshav Maharaj (4) off what proved the final ball of the day.

England had resumed their first innings on 262 for nine at the start of the day but Anderson (4) was caught by Van der Dussen at first slip off Rabada (3-68). Ollie Pope finished the innings not out on 61.

Meanwhile, the tourists are hoping to have fast bowler Jofra Archer available for the third test that starts in Port Elizabeth on Jan. 16.

A second scan on an elbow injury that kept him out of the Cape Town test revealed only bruising and swelling.

269,2020/01/04,"Ranji Trophy | Suryapprakash, Ganga Sridhar do the rescue act for TN","Openers L. Suryapprakash (51, 159b, 6x4) and Ganga Sridhar Raju (45, 88b, 8x4) did the bulk of the scoring as Tamil Nadu finished the second day at 165 for six against Uttar Pradesh in their Elite Group-B Ranji Trophy clash at the Green Park Stadium here on Saturday.

The start was delayed by 105 minutes due to bad light before Uttar Pradesh captain Ankit Rajpoot won the toss and asked the visitors to take strike.

The decision looked vindicated as Rajpoot himself got Suryapprakash in the third over of the day. However, much to the batsman’s relief and Uttar Pradesh’s agony, the bowler had overstepped.

Cashing in on the reprieve, Suryapprakash, in the company of Ganga Sridhar, added 79 before the latter fell to a well-disguised delivery off left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar.

Change in luck

Rajpoot’s luck changed after lunch as he sent back Kaushik Gandhi and B. Aparajith in quick time.

Skipper Vijay Shankar, who walked in next, made his intentions clear: be positive and counterattack.

He smashed three boundaries off a Rajpoot over and looked in control before being surprised by a delivery from leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari that dipped.

Vijay Shankar (24, 17b, 5x4) tried to dig it out, but ended up offering a catch to substitute Umang Sharma at mid-off. N. Jagadeesan, too, showed positive signs but did not last long.

Suryapprakash, who showed immense patience all along, finally succumbed to Saurabh’s spin. And the umpires soon called off play owing to fading light.

“The wicket was doing a bit and it was keeping low. Surya and Ganga (Sridhar Raju) batted really well,” said Vijay Shankar.

If the weather doesn’t affect play in the next two days, an intriguing battle between bat and ball awaits.

The scores:

Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: Ganga Sridhar Raju c Rinku b Saurabh 45, L. Suryapprakash c Upendra b Saurabh 51, Kaushik Gandhi c Upendra b Rajpoot 7, B.

270,2020/01/04,Ranji Trophy | Injured Shaw asked to report to NCA,"Prithvi Shaw’s hopes of making an India suffered a major dent as it was confirmed that the Mumbai opener has a labral tear in his left shoulder after injuring himself in the field during the opening day’s play.

As a result, the BCCI medical team has asked Shaw, in contention for the reserve opener slot for the two-Test serires against New Zealand, to leave the Ranji game midway and travel to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to assess his injury.

“He has been called to NCA. Mumbai Cricket Association got an email from the BCCI. He has left for Bengaluru,” said Ajinkya Naik, Mumbai’s team manager. “He couldn’t even lift his hand. He has a tear in the shoulder. That much is known. He was not in a position to bat. How serious is the injury will be known at the NCA.”

Shaw fell on his left shoulder while attempting to stop an over-throw in the field in the last session of the opening day’s play. He didn’t take the field ever since, with Mumbai being left with a batsman short for the rest of the game.

An MRI scan was conducted on Shaw’s shoulder on Friday evening, with the results on Saturday morning confirming a tear.

Shaw is supposed leave for New Zealand on January 10 for India- A’s tour to New Zealand. Considering that a labral tear in the shoulder usually takes at least four weeks to recover, it will be a miracle if Shaw to boards a flight to New Zealand.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gpdrga/article30480420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05SHAW,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-injured-shaw-asked-to-report-to-nca/article30480421.ece
271,2020/01/04,Karnataka noses ahead after see-saw battle,"Off-spinner Shashank Attarde picked a five-for in only his second First Class game. Shams Mulani bolstered his reputation as an all-rounder by playing a perfect second fiddle with the ball and the bat. B.R. Sharath displayed his breezy batting down the order. And Abhimanyu Mithun justified the tag of Karnataka’s pace-bowling spearhead by running through Mumbai’s top-order.

Intense action

Still, an intense second day’s play of the high-profile Ranji Trophy league game between Mumbai and Karnatakan belonged to two batsmen who were making a comeback in their own ways.

R. Samarth, the Karnataka opener who had been dropped from the squad for the trip to Mumbai only to be recalled after Mayank Agarwal was advised rest by the BCCI, anchored the Karnataka innings with a solid 86 to ensure that Karnataka earned a slender 24-run lead at the MCA’s Bandra-Kurla Complex facility.

Sarfaraz Khan, playing a First Class match in Mumbai’s whites for the first time in five years, then helped Mumbai bounce back with an unbeaten fifty.

When Sarfaraz took guard after lunch, Aditya Tare, Ajinkya Rahane and Siddhesh Lad had repeated their first-innings streak of single-digit scores, with Mithun at his best. From 12 for three, things got worse for Mumbai when Mithun got one to rise and jag back a little to kiss Suryakumar Yadav’s gloves en route to B.R. Sharath behind the stumps.

At 26 for four, Sarfaraz showed remarkable patience along with Mulani to weather the storm. Once Shreyas Gopal’s spin was inrtoduced, he cut loose, driving the leggie through covers, employing a paddled-sweep before a conventional sweep sailed over the square-leg fence. But the shot of the day came moments later when he drove Mithun over covers for a big six.

Gutsy knock

Earlier in the morning, Samarth continued is gutsy knock from his overnight unbeaten 40. Royston Dias and Tushar Deshpande posed a lot of questions with their contrasting pace bowling but Samarth was at his best. After the fall of captain Karun Nair off the fifth ball of the morning, Samarth and Gopal added 78 for the fifth wicket before Surya lunged in the air to pouch a top-edge off the latter’s willow.

Just when Samarth was cruising towards a deserving hundred, Attarde forced him into lobbing one to Sarfaraz at short-leg during an impressive spell that read 6-1-19-3.

Sarfaraz and Mulani seemed to have kept the game in balance with an 83-run partnership for the fifth wicket after Mumbai had been tottering at 26 for four in its second essay. But V. Koushik forced the left-handed Mulani to nick one in the slips off the last ball of the day to tilt the balance in Karnataka’s favour.

With a lead of 85 runs and four wickets in hand — Prithvi Shaw having been ruled out of the game after hurting his left shoulder — Sarfaraz would realise his job is far from being done.

272,2020/01/04,Sumanth is Hyderabad’s saviour,"Hyderabad’s saviour of the day turned out to be wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth (91 batting, 157b, 11x4) as he helped the team clinch the vital first innings lead against Kerala on the second day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group match at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Saturday.

Earlier, the Kerala innings, resuming at 126 for seven, lasted 10 overs and finished at 164 as the pace duo of Ravi Kiran and Mohd. Siraj claimed four wickets apiece to ensure the tail didn’t wag.

In reply, Hyderabad was off to disastrous start with seasoned opener P. Akshath Reddy failing once again, driving away from his body only to give a leading edge to the wicketkeeper Vishnu Vinod off pacer Sandeep Warrier’s fifth ball of the innings.

In the next over, Basil Thampi trapped captain Tanmay Agarwal leg before as he made a half-hearted, defensive push.

The home team’s batting woes continued with Himalay Agarwal doing exactly what former India captain Mohd. Azharuddin told him not to do in the nets — play a stroke without getting to the pitch of the ball. His attempted off-drive was snapped up smartly in his follow-through by Warrier.

The situation tested the efficacy of debutants J. Mallikarjun and Jaweed Ali but they failed, looking both out of sorts and over-cautious. They perished cheaply, playing irresponsible strokes.

Then, Sumanth and all-rounder T. Ravi Teja (32, 44b, 4x4) put on a a useful 46 with the latter being more aggressive even as the former decided to drop anchor.

Importantly, Sumanth strung together another gritty 72-run stand for the eighth wicket with Saaketh Sai Ram (27, 72b, 3x4) which effectively dashed whatever hopes Kerala had of coming back strongly after reducing the host to 110 for seven at one stage.

Sumanth was clearly the star of the day in the face of a splendid bowling performance by the Kerala pacers.

273,2020/01/04,"Ranji Trophy 2019-20 | Shorey, Rana keep Delhi in the hunt","The battle for the first-innings lead intensified as Punjab clawed back with two late wickets and Delhi needed another 119 runs with six wickets in hand on the second day of their Ranji Trophy match in Mohali on Saturday.

The fiercely-fought contest saw Punjab’s last wicket add 39 runs this morning to frustrate the visiting team. After Punjab aggregated 313, Delhi finished the day at 195 for four, built largely on the 122-run third-wicket stand between skipper Dhruv Shorey (96, 186b, 13x4) and Nitish Rana (64 batting, 8x4).

Though Shorey fell short of a well-deserved century, much like his opposite number Mandeep Singh on Friday, he clearly played his part getting Delhi this far. His choice of strokes was judicious and gave no chance to the bowlers.

Walking in, in the first over after Baltej Singh removed makeshift-opener Anuj Rawat, Shorey gave the bowlers the respect they deserved. With Baltej bowling a disciplined line in his first spell, Shorey displayed patience and went on to carve out an innings of substance.

After adding 62 for the second wicket with Kunal Chandela, who fell to a brilliant diving catch by wicketkeeper, Shorey joined hands with left-handed Rana and carried on.

The left-right combination frustrated Punjab but all credit to the home bowlers who ensured that run-making was not easy. The fielders, too, played their part in diving and stopping the flow of runs.

With the shadows lengthening and close of play not far, Shorey was eager to reach his century. Off a short delivery from Akul Pandove, Shorey chose to cut but ended up offering an easy overhead catch to Mayank Markande.

A dejected Shorey made no secret of how he felt as he dropped his bat in exasperation and waited for the umpires to confirm his dismissal. Simarjeet Singh, sent in as a night-watchman also did not last the day.

These two successes lifted Punjab’s spirits as it looked forward to some early success on Sunday. Delhi was hoping young players like Jonty Sidhu, Lalit Yadav and Kunwar Bidhuri could play second fiddle to a well-set Rana and help Delhi gain the lead.

274,2020/01/04,"Need guys at Nos 6 or 7 to win matches under pressure, Kohli tells youngsters","India captain Virat Kohli on Saturday said it will be tough for India to win ICC events unless the middle-order steps up and delivers in pressure situations if the top-order has a rare failure.

India last won an ICC event back in 2013 (Champions Trophy) and often described as a top-heavy team, relying on big contributions from either skipper himself or his deputy Rohit Sharma.

The focus this year on T20 World Cup and Kohli, in his first media interaction of the year, conveyed his expectations from his fellow teammates.

“We need guys who are ready till Nos six and seven to win you games. It can’t be dependent on two guys or three guys in the batting line-up. You know, that’s not how you win ICC tournaments,” said Kohli ahead of T20 series opener against Sri Lanka.

“So that’s our main focus to reveal situations to guys and expect them to come into their own and become those fearless match winners that we should have going into a big tournament.”

Crucial next few series

Shreyas Iyer has delivered ever since his comeback but has not been tested enough in tense situations. Rishabh Pant, on the other hand, has been criticised for not being consistent enough.

“These next few series is going to be very exciting to see who stands up in pressure situations, how they react when may be Rohit or myself or KL or Shikhar at the top have not fired.”

Similarly, with the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar injured and Mohammed Shami rested, this series will give an opportunity to the likes of Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur to make their selection case for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October-November.

“I think because the tournament is in Australia, you will need these many options and back-ups ready to be able to take firstly your strongest XI or strongest squad and then have those back-ups in place, who also can come and do the job.

“It’s good that we identify five or six guys and it will be priority based on you know who goes and then back-ups will be in place. Also with fast bowlers, we know small niggles can happen every now and then. So yeah, we’re pretty sorted in that regard not worried at all.”

Best combination at the top

At the top, Kohli however conceded that he will be in a difficult position once Rohit Sharma returns after being rested for this series.

“As far as the series is concerned, it’s pretty straightforward. Both of them will start (Dhawan and Rahul). But when Rohit comes back, you know, it’s going to be a difficult thing to address because Shikhar has been an experienced player but KL is playing so well.

“So I think we’ll have to decide what is the best combination that we can go with and who are the best XI to take the field,” he concluded.

Asked what he has in mind for the team in the new year, Kohli had plenty to say.

“We have put the team on the right track in terms of, you know, being the team that everyone wants to be across formats. I think it is a very exciting position to be in. And that is something that we want to continue, keep the standards of the cricket that we’ve played as high as we have in the past couple of years.”

Cultural change in Indian cricket

Kohli said there’s a cultural change in Indian cricket which is about playing for the team and not thinking about individual performances. He also spoke on the pep talk he gave to the players before their first practise session of the new year.

“I think we get involved in the rat race to an extent where we can go into our individual cocoons a lot of the times and that can hamper the team at an important stage.

“From a very young age, we are always, you know, focused on what we did as individuals. Even when we came back from a game, we were invariably asked, what did you do rather than did the team win?

“So I think that’s a mindset change that I see that happening in the last three years at a very big level where they started to appreciate small performances of guys who might have taken a catch or a great run-out in the game and they turned the whole game.

In the recent past there has been a lot of talk about the talented Rishabh Pant’s reckless batting and poor wicketkeeping even but the Delhi 21-year-old remains to have firm backing from his team.

“If someone you feel like is going into a shell, pull that guy out saying, don’t worry about it, just focus on the team, you’ll be fine. So I think these things are very important to address and speak about every now and then. Because as sportsman, we can tend to sort of take a lot of pressure in our own performances,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tepwsw/article30478543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-tour-of-india-india-vs-sri-lanka-first-t20-international-in-guwahati-virat-kohli-press-conference/article30478544.ece
275,2020/01/04,Don’t tamper with Test format: Kohli,"India skipper Virat Kohli on Saturday rejected the idea of having four-day Tests, saying the five-day format should not be altered.

Kohli said there was no need of another format just to commercialise the game.

“T20 was a revelation. I was not in favour of the 100-ball (format), either. I'm not going to try myself out in another format, because there's already so much going on,” Kohli said.

“With Test cricket, day-night Tests is the most that should be changed,” he said.

Talking about getting numbers and entertainment was not right. The talk then would go on to three-day Tests, he said.

“I mean, where do you stop? I don't endorse that at all. I don't think that is fair to the purest format of the game. Five-day Tests is the highest of tests you can have at the international level. It should not be altered,” he stated.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5kbyah/article30477967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/not-in-favour-of-four-day-tests-says-virat-kohli/article30477968.ece
276,2020/01/04,Aus vs NZ | New Zealand openers resist after Labuschagne hits double-century,"Marnus Labuschagne scored a maiden Test double-century to drive Australia to 454 all out before New Zealand's openers resisted the home attack to post 63 without loss on the second day of the third Test on Saturday.

Tom Latham, standing in as captain for the sick Kane Williamson, had made 26 not out at the close of play with Tom Blundell unbeaten on 34 but the tourists know they still have a mountain to climb if they are to avoid a 3-0 series sweep.

Labuschagne is a large part of the reason for that and a hot, sunny day at the Sydney Cricket Ground belonged to the irrepressible 25-year-old, who has enjoyed a golden summer in Australia's home season.

He had a nervous 20 minutes one run short of the double-century mark but his 19th four got him over the line and earned him a standing ovation from the crowd.

He finally departed for 215, caught and bowled by spinner Todd Astle, and left the field to another huge ovation having scored 837 runs at an average of 119.57 in five home Tests this season.

Labuschagne faced 363 deliveries in a magnificent innings that looked to have set Australia well on their way to another victory to add to the thumping wins they enjoyed in Perth and Melbourne.

“It was a good day personally but more importantly a good day for Australia,” Labuschagne said.

“They fought back, as you would expect, but we'll do the toil and hopefully get the win.”

New Zealand made short work of the tail after Labuschagne's exit to dismiss the hosts and bring up tea before their openers headed back out to face Australia's in-form pacemen.

The Black Caps have accumulated only one score in excess of 200 runs in their previous four innings in the series but Latham and Blundell saw off the attack and scrapped their way to stumps.

“It was nice to turn up and show that fight today,” said Astle. “It's gonna be a tough ask but that's what this group's about. We'll keep grinding away.”

There had been concerns that soaring temperatures forecast for Saturday might worsen the bushfire emergency around Australia and the blanket of acrid smoke that has covered Sydney on several occasions in recent weeks might return.

Labuschagne, however, resumed his innings on 130 under blue skies and was soon passing 150 for the third time in his last seven innings.

With Australia utterly dominating all five home matches this year, their fans have had precious little drama to enjoy so it was perhaps understandable that they made the most of Labuschagne's progress through the 190s.

“Being in the 190s is a bit different to being in the 90s, you're just trying to avoid doing something stupid,” Labuschagne added.

The crowd were kept waiting for four overs with Labuschagne stuck on 199 and there were good-hearted boos for captain Tim Paine when he scored a single off the final ball of one to keep the strike for the next.

New Zealand pulled in the field to deny him the single and it worked for seven deliveries until he swiped at a Colin de Grandhomme delivery and got a thick edge that sent the ball racing to the boundary.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kr4wa2/article30477832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARNUSK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aus-vs-nz-new-zealand-openers-resist-after-labuschagne-hits-double-century/article30477833.ece
277,2020/01/04,Bumrah’s return highlights India’s first venture in the new year,"With about 10 months to go for the T20 World Cup, India and Sri Lanka will look to try out various options as they begin the New Year with the first of the three-match series at the ACA Stadium, Barsapara, here on Sunday.

“Because the tournament is in Australia, you will need several options and back-ups ready. We need to identify five or six guys on priority, who goes (first) and then the back-ups. With fast bowlers niggles can happen. We're pretty sorted out in that regard,” said India captain Virat Kohli on Saturday.

Opportunities

By resting opener Rohit Sharma and speedster Mohammed Shami, India has given others opportunities.

Jasprit Bumrah’s comeback is one of the major highlights of the series. The pace ace was out of action for four months owing to a back injury and would like to regain his touch.

Bumrah’s combination with other pacers, including Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini and all-rounder Shivam Dube, will be interesting to note.

Rohit’s absence brings together K.L. Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan as an alternative opening pair. Sanju Samson, who played his only T20 for the country in 2015, will be a back-up opener and a second choice wicketkeeper.

Rishabh Pant gets a chance to rectify his glove-work and boost his confidence. The spin quartet of Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar will offer variety.

The Indians would also like to work on correcting their fielding, especially catching, which has been rather woeful in recent times.

The last time the two teams met was in the Nidahas Trophy almost two years ago and India would want to keep its decade-old record of not having lost a series to its neighbour.

Sri Lanka has been strengthened by the return of the hard-hitting Angelo Mathews, though he hasn’t played a T20 match in some time and has not been bowling in order to avoid injuries.

The islanders, who have been beaten in nine of their last 13 T20Is and are coming off a 3-0 loss to Australia down under, have included Kasun Rajitha in place of injured fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep while Shehan Jayasuriya has made way for Dhananjaya de Silva.

Both bowling units are likely to be tested thoroughly on a batsman-friendly track, with the dew factor adding to the bowlers’ woes.

Security

The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) and the State government have made arrangements to thwart any anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests during the match.

Rain, however, could play spoilsport. The ACA authorities, who are looking forward to hosting some Indian Premier League matches, trust the state-of-the-art drainage system to come in handy in case of a rain interruption.

281,2020/01/04,Court acquits man of attempting to kill wife,"A Delhi court has acquitted a man in a case of attempting to kill his wife as the latter went back on her charges submitted to the police.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that his husband used to beat him, tried to kill him and also prevented her from going to her parents’ house. She also said her in-laws instigated him to hit her.

Domestic violence

The victim alleged that she had also filed a domestic violence case against him in the Crime Against Women Cell.

However, she later returned to his home after counselling at the cell but her mental and physical cruelties increased, the complaint read.

As no evidence was found against the in-laws during the probe, the police only chargesheeted her husband under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC. In the trial, the woman turned hostile while giving her evidence. During her cross-examination, she could not say anything against the accused.

Dismissing seven appeals against as many judgments passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate, Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Gupta said: “Since the appellant/accused has failed to repay the amount of the cheques [₹15.95 lakh] despite service of legal notice, thus, he is guilty of commission of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.”

285,2020/01/04,"Anti-CAA stir: queer groups, sex workers take centre stage","Protesters from all genders, sexual and caste minorities along with other marginalised groups of migrant as well as sex workers gathered at Jantar Mantar on Friday against the three instruments of citizenship — the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The event was organised on the birth anniversary of social reformist Savitrabai Phule, who is also known as the first woman educationalist in India.

As many as 45 different groups from a cross-section of society were present, including the All India Network of Sex Workers, Telangana Hijra Intersex Trans Samiti, The Queer Muslim Project, Pink List, TransNow Collective, Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students’ Association (BAPSA), National Federation of Indian Women, National Hawker Federation, Basti Suraksha Manch, among others.

The common refrain among these groups was that the inability to furnish evidence in the form of birth certificate, proof of residence, land records, etc. that will likely result in their harassment.

Sex workers

“The biggest problem for sex workers is to prove their work and the other is a lack of documents to prove their identity. When I have no proof of where I was born, who is the father of my child, then the NRC will completely erase my identity. Often sex workers migrate from one city to another and in the process, they lose these documents. The NRC is yet another example of a patriarchal society where children will be required to prove their father’s identity. Is then the government turning a blind eye to a mother’s relationship with her children,” said President of All India Network of Sex Workers, Kusum.

Queer groups

“A family is often a cite of violence for the queer people. Many of us are not even in touch with our families as we have been thrown out and ostracised. So, asking for our documents is not even an option. How are then we supposed to come under the NRC? This is how the queer people are put at risk. The CAA anyway excludes Muslims and when you are a queer too, you are doubly marginalised”, says Syeda Lameeya Parveen of The Queer Muslim Project.

She added that both NRC and NPR deny the sexual and gender minorities their right to self-determination. “NRC and NPR say that you are not who you are until you have proven it, until the government considers you worthy of being a citizen. Historically, the State has been violent towards trans, queer groups and other marginalised groups and with the CAA and NRC there will be more power in the hands of the police”.

Migrant workers

“We have seen in Guwahati that the urban poor and migrant workers have been excluded from NRC because they did not have different documents. Further, just like demonetisation, many daily wagers will be forced to appear before Foreign Tribunals and skip work. Moreover, while many migrant workers are not legal owners of land occupied by them, such as in slums, they are their legitimate owners because they have lived there for long and have developed the area but the NRC or NPR exercise will not take those rights into account,” said Ankit Jha from National Hawkers’ Federation.

The government is yet to announce the NRCbut as per the rules inserted in 2003 to the Citizenship Act, 1955, the NRC will flow from data gather under the NPR. The Ministry of Home Affairs maintains that individuals will not be asked to produce physical copies of different documents but that information provided by individuals will be accepted. As per the trial form prepared by the MHA, information will be collected across 21 parameteres which include “place of birth of father and mother, the last place of residence”, along with Aadhaar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving licence numbers.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hegfss/article30474397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-caa-stir-queer-groups-sex-workers-take-centre-stage/article30474400.ece

287,2020/01/04,Haryana govt. told to consult experts after plea seeks remedies to control flooding,"Following a plea seeking remedial action to control flooding in Gurugram, the National Green Tribunal has directed the Haryana State government to consult experts and furnish a compliance report on the same.

The plea had also sought increased rainwater harvesting measures which were “adversely affected due to the concretization of the Badshahpur drain”.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel took note of an October 2019 report furnished by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board that stated: “concretization reduces the groundwater recharge”.

“However, there is no adequate consideration of the problem of an increased potential for flooding. During the hearing, it is prayed that the concretization was done five years back. The fact remains that even if the concretization is not to be undone, abatement measures need to be adopted to ensure that rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge are not affected and flooding is avoided,” the Bench observed.

The Bench said, “On these aspects, Haryana needs to take further steps after consultation with the concerned experts on the subject. Let the same be done and the compliance report filed before March 3.”

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Vaishali Rana Chandra and others.

While particular individuals had identified themselves as the “Chief Organiser” of the movement, the protesters here stressed that no single person could “assert themselves as organiser of the mass movement”. The protesters said those spreading rumours were part of the stir for a short time and also engaged in attempting to communalise the movement. Meraj Khan of Shaheen Bagh Coordination Committee said some persons also tried to scare the crowd by claiming that “BJP goons” were going to “infiltrate” the gathering.

The protesters said they will continue the stir at least till the Supreme Court hearing on the Act scheduled for January 22.

On Friday, the demonstration at the Noida Kalindi Kunj Highway, which has been shut down for over two weeks now, saw a large number of people. Speakers at the stir condemned the government. They appealed to those present to keep “their spirits up as victory was nearby”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rxru3t/article30472704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHEENBAGHPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dont-believe-in-rumours-say-shaheen-bagh-protesters/article30474388.ece
289,2020/01/04,‘Got to know about Baliyan’s death much later’,"Delhi Fire Service (DFS) personnel Amit Pawar, brother-in-law of Amit Baliyan who lost his life during a rescue operation in Peeragarhi, was about to enter the building to rescue people trapped under the debris but was stopped by his senior as the condition of the structure was not good, his family said on Friday.

Initially, Mr. Pawar was unaware that his brother-in-law was among the three fire service personnel trapped under the debris. Only after he checked the batch number of the DFS personnel, he got to know about Baliyan.

The victim’s younger brother-in-law Ankur, who works in Gurugram, said he got to know about the incident around 2 p.m. on Thursday. Meanwhile, on Friday morning, the DFS staff paid tributes to Baliyan at the Fire Safety Management Academy in Rohini.

Several people visited the victim’s home to console the family. His wife Shivani said: “I last spoke to him around midnight. I took an off on Thursday as he had told me that he will take me out for some work. Later, I came to know that there was a fire incident. Initially, I thought it was a normal fire call. When I realised that he was stuck inside, I got scared and everyone assured me that he will be fine. The moment I heard the news of his death, I got numb.”

Rohit, Baliyan’s cousin, said, “Baliyan was very happy after being selected in DFS. I spoke to him a couple of days ago and asked him about his job. He said everything was fine and he was performing well.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/b6skyf/article30474379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL04-FIREFIGHTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/got-to-know-about-baliyans-death-much-later/article30474380.ece

Mr. Singh said that the BJP should concentrate on delivering basic responsibilities of a municipal body before pitching a manifesto to run the State government. He alleged that people living in unauthorised colonies could not undertake any construction or make alterations to their dwelling units, without first paying a hefty bribe to corrupt BJP councillors and said that the schools and hospitals under the jurisdiction of MCD were in a pathetic condition.

He also reminded the BJP of its promise of a ‘garbage-free Delhi ‘ and suggested that they first focus on fulfilling this promise as visitors to Delhi are greeted by heaps of garbage when entering by road.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/zb8b4d/article29651045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11AAP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-reacts-to-bjp-campaign/article30474378.ece

292,2020/01/04,NDMC outlines goals in its2020-21 budget,"Making areas garbage bin-free, setting up 100 charging stations for electric cars besides an intensive plantation drive to mitigate air pollution are among the top tasks underlined by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) in its 2020-21 budget.

The civic body Chairman Dharmendra presented his maiden budget on Friday with a financial projection of ₹4,372.40 crore and said an Integrated Command and Control System will be made live by March this year.

“We plan to remove roadside garbage iron bin trolleys in a phased manner to make NDMC bin free city,” said Mr. Dharmendra

He said the body has already established 55 charging stations of 15KW capacity for electric cars.

“It is proposed to install 17 more Organic Waste Converters in residential colonies thereby removing the need of transportation of organic waste from residential colonies to Okhla waste processing plant,” Mr. Dharmendra said in his budget speech

It is proposed to set up 100 more fast public e-charging stations in the NDMC areas with higher capacity (150KW) that can charge three vehicles at the same time at three times faster speed.

“To mitigate air and dust pollution, it is proposed to undertake intensive plantation of shrubs and grass to cover all left over open soil surface or barren portion in all avenues and lanes in the NDMC area and proposed plantation of 5,000 trees and 5 lakh shrubs,” he added.

The civic body has also proposed to form cycling clubs in its five schools in the financial year 2020-21.

Each of the schools will be provided 20 cycles to form the club. The NDMC school cycling club will be used to spread messages about the ‘Fit India’ and other social messages in neighbourhood areas of the school.

“An Integrated Command and Control System, established by NDMC to integrate 30 services, will become nodal point of availability of all online data and information related to smart services which can be monitored on real-time basis and necessary action can be taken. This is likely to be made live by March and will be completed by June. It is proposed to enhance its disaster preparedness and come up with comprehensive implementation plan and create necessary mitigation mechanism including infrastructure as required and accordingly allocate ₹10 crore for this in 2020-21,” Mr. Dharmendra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ndmc-outlines-goals-in-its2020-21-budget/article30474368.ece
293,2020/01/04,Police issue tender for procurement of drones,"Delhi Police has issued a tender for the procurement of two UAV drones for Mobile Control Room, purchase of image/video enhancement software and purchase of mobile phone forensic/analysis software tools. These tools will further strengthen the cyber forensic laboratory of the department, said a police officer.

“We have written for procurement of five drones in the North East district as it was much required given the current law and order situation here . At present, we deploy policemen with video cameras during a procession or a march. Now with the help of drones we will be able to cover a larger area with no police deployment for the task,” said a senior police officer.

Another officer, meanwhile, mentioned that he has also written for procurement of five drones in the district.

During the protests held in the national capital against the amended Citizenship Act, the city police had hired drones on a charge of ₹4,000 per day. Later, it was decided that the department would buy drones as it would help police personnel assess the crowd and deter any person for breaching a peaceful environment. The drones will have the capability to work with Google Maps, the State police said further.

Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) Centre and the National Cyber Forensic Lab (NCFL) in Dwarka will soon be getting image/video enhancement software. The software will be able to recover formatted, deleted and partially overwritten videos. In a similar pattern, mobile phone forensic software will help policemen search for and find similar images throughout the selected device using PhotoDNA.

“We will be purchasing these software tools that will help us extract all the data from a phone with only a few clicks. This data would include deleted data, call history, contacts, text messages, multimedia messages, files, events, notes, passwords for Wi-Fi networks, reminders and application data from apps such as from Skype, Dropbox, Ever note, Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber and many others.

294,2020/01/04,"Refund booking amount to buyer, NDCRC tells builder","The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has held a builder responsible for unilaterally changing the loan plan without issuing “sufficient notice” to a flat buyer.

It directed the builder to refund within four weeks the booking amount to the buyer. “We also award cost of ₹50,000 to be paid by the developer for not putting the complainant to the sufficient notice prior to unilaterally changing the payment plan,” it said.

The order of the consumer court came on a plea by Abhinav Gupta who booked an apartment in Gold Souk Golf Links, a group housing complex at Sector 17 Sohna, Haryana, built by Gold Souk Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (GSIPL).

Advocate Aditya Parolia, representing Mr. Gupta, argued that the developer had offered the sale of the property costing around ₹1 crore in the payment plan of 10:80:10.

As per an agreement, 10% of the total price of the flat was to be paid at the time of booking, 80% by the bank as loan and the balance 10% by the buyer at the time of delivery of possession. Mr. Parolia said a “tripartite agreement” was executed between his client, GSIPL and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFCL) in March 2015. He contended that as per Clause 8 of the agreement, if the buyer is unable to make the balance payment then the developer is liable to refund DHFCL.

On the other hand, the DHFCL said that initially, it had agreed to disburse ₹80 lakh, but subject to “technical and legal verification and also the credit score and credibility” of the buyer, a revised sanctioned amount of about ₹70 lakh was allotted. GSIPL argued that the buyer had failed to secure the loan of ₹80 lakh and since it had no connection with the reduction of the loan amount from ₹80 lakh to ₹70 lakh, it cannot be held liable.

The Commission, however, took note of the fact that there was no notice issued prior to the change of the payment plan to enable the buyer to exercise the option of opting out, if need be.

As the buyer wanted to opt out of the project on account of change in the payment plan, the Commission asked the developer to refund the booking amount with 8% interest from the date of filing of the complaint.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/refund-booking-amount-to-buyer-ndcrc-tells-builder/article30474313.ece
295,2020/01/04,Five arrested for killing driver on Christmas Eve,"Five persons have been arrested for allegedly killing a man after he resisted a robbery attempt in Dwarka’s Dabri on Christmas Eve, the police said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that the accused have been identified as Ritvik (20), Saurabh alias Bahta (27), Gaurav Singh (20), Vikas Paswan alias Mota (21) and Saurabh alias Bihari (20) who allegedly stabbed to death Vipin Kumar Yadav, a driver who hailed from Bihar, in the early hours of December 25.

The police said that a they received a call regarding a man who had sustained multiple stab wounds. When they reached the spot, it was found that one of the victims’ mobile phone was missing, while another was in his pocket. He was then identified and a case was registered.

During investigation, the police found a CCTV footage in which the five suspects were seen near the place where the victim was found dead. The missing mobile phone’s technical surveillance got the police a lead. “They were traced on Thursday when they were out to commit another robbery. The robbed mobile was recovered and the knife used in the commission of the crime was seized,” Mr. Alphonse said.

The police said that Bahta is a resident of Ghaziabad and has been working as a water tanker driver. He was arrested earlier in an attempt-to-murder case and later in a snatching case. He has spent a year in jail.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/five-arrested-for-killing-driver-on-christmas-eve/article30474311.ece
296,2020/01/04,Fear of getting uprooted is now a thing of the past,"“This is the biggest dream of my parents. Our house is not even fully built. But our family has been living here for around 25 years in the same condition as we are scared to invest. We could not risk building the house as there is always a fear that civic body officials will come and raze it down,” said Kiran Maurya, a resident of Raja Vihar.

Maurya’s mother Asha is one of the 20 residents of unauthorised colonies who received registry papers from Union Minister Hardeep S. Puri on Thursday.

Sixty two-year-old Inder Singh Bisht, a resident of Suraj Park since 1980, said seeing “false promises” of political parties turn into a “reality” is a big relief.

“Governments and political parties constantly make promises which ultimately turn out to be false. But seeing this turn into a reality is a big deal for us,” said Bisht.

Rajeshwar, a courier boy and son of Sangeeta who is one of the residents to have received the papers, said: “For over two decades we had been living in constant fear of getting uprooted as we had no documents to show. Authorities could have turned up at any moment and razed our homes. Finally we will get to live a life without fear of being displaced.”

Uncertainty ends

For Pratap Choudhary, the “uncertain life” has come to an end with the handing over of papers.

“We are a family of eight living here since 1982. With us finally getting the papers, we no longer need to be apprehensive of uncertainty. We no longer need to fear the DDA or the municipal corporation,” said Mr. Chaudhury.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fear-of-getting-uprooted-is-now-a-thing-of-the-past/article30474305.ece
297,2020/01/04,"All India Judicial Service no panacea, says study","Most of the reasons for creation of an All India Judicial Service (AIJS) for appointing lower court judges “no longer exist or have been resolved through changes in rules, regulations and practices”, a report by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy said.

Currently, the appointments of District Judges and Subordinate Judiciary are done by the respective State governments. But in recent years, there have been an invigorated push for creation of a unified pan-India judicial service for appointing them.

AIJS has been pitched as a solution to judicial vacancies, lack of representation for the marginalised and the failure to attract the best talent.

Vidhi in its report titled, ‘A primer on the All India Judicial Service - A solution in search of a problem?’ demonstrated that many of these issues have been “incorrectly diagnosed”.

The idea for AIJS was first proposed by the 14th Report of the Law Commission of India in 1958, aimed at creating a centralised cadre of District Judges that would draw better talent.

One of the recent justifications for creation of AIJS has been that a centralised service would help fill the approximately 5,000 vacancies across the District and Subordinate Judiciary in India.

The report,however, said it is only certain High Courts which account for a majority of the approximately 5,000 vacancies.

“In our opinion, rather than proposing an AIJS as a solution for judicial vacancies, it may be more prudent to investigate the reasons and causes for the large number of vacancies in the poorly performing States,” the report authored by Prashant Reddy T., Ameen Jauhar and Reshma Sekhar said.

The report also highlighted that many of the communities who currently benefit from the State quotas, may oppose the creation of AIJS. This is because the communities recognised as Other Backward Classes (OBC) by State governments may or may not be classified as OBCs by the Central government.

While AIJS has been pitched as a solution to lack of representation for the marginalised on the Bench, the report said many States are already reserving posts for marginalised communities and women.

Another argument made against creation of AIJS is that judges recruited through this process will not know the local languages of the States in which they are posted. This becomes important considering that the proceedings of civil and criminal courts are to be conducted in a language prescribed by the respective State governments.

“The issues of local language and customs are issues that deserve serious consideration before moving ahead with the creation of the AIJS,” the report said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/all-india-judicial-service-no-panacea-says-study/article30474304.ece
298,2020/01/04,Puri hands over property deeds to 20 illegal colony residents,"In a first, the registry and conveyance deeds for their properties in two unauthorised colonies of Delhi were handed over to 20 applicants for ownership rights by Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (Independent Charge) Hardeep S. Puri here on Friday.

This comes in the backdrop of the coming Delhi Assembly election.

But Mr. Puri said the grant of ownership rights had “no relationship with elections”, adding that the work had been pending with the Delhi government since 2008.

The grant of rights would benefit 40 lakh residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies, he said.

The 20 applicants from Raja Vihar and Suraj Park in the Rohini Assembly constituency became the first to get ownership rights to property in unauthorised colonies as part of the government’s decision to grant rights in 1,731 colonies.

At an event attended by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal and officials of the Ministry and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Mr. Puri said the 20 applicants had completed their documentation on the DDA portal, paid the fees, been given a conveyance deed by the DDA and completed the registry process at a registrar’s office of the Delhi government.

The Minister had launched the DDA’s portal for registration of applicants and submission of applications in December. A total of 57,000 people had registered so far, and 3,500 had completed their applications.

He said more applicants would be given documents in the coming days and a dedicated server would be put in place to speed up the process.

Referring to the ruling Aam Aadmi Party’s criticism that the Centre was misleading the people about regularisation of these colonies, Mr. Puri said the “old way of regularisation would have taken 10 years”, so the Union Cabinet had taken a decision and passed a law in Parliament to facilitate the grant of rights.

“The more I deal with the Delhi government — I’m not talking about the institution but some eminent representatives who are occupying public office — I continue to be amazed at their capacity to derail matters... I have decided not to spend any time on commenting on the Delhi government or what they are doing. Because their actions speak for themselves and the people of Delhi will have to judge,” he said.

Social infrastructure

He said the money collected in the form of fees would go to a special development fund that would be used to create social infrastructure and roads.

DDA vice-chairperson Tarun Kapoor said the work on creating layout plans — a step towards regularising the colonies — would start soon in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Centre.

One of the applicants given the documents, Pinki Sharma, of Suraj Park, said the registry would enable her family to take loans.

Sisodia’s reaction

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday, questioned the validity and authenticity of the papers and called them “fake.”

“Today the BJP and Mr. Puri distributed conveyance deeds which are worthless without the official notification change of land use. You cannot give property right or permanent ownership to a family, whose home is built on government or agricultural land, without first regularising these unauthorised colonies. The BJP’s claim that they are giving legal property and ownership rights to a home built on unauthorised land is fraudulent,” said Mr. Sisodia.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aonrod/article30474301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL03-UNAUTHORISEDCOLONY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/puri-hands-over-property-deeds-to-20-illegal-colony-residents/article30474302.ece

301,2020/01/04,"Tricolour, Hyderabadi witticism dominate protest","It was a sea of saffron, white and green — the Tricolour — which dominated the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register, at Dharna Chowk on Saturday.

Protesters reached the venue in unexpected, yet unprecedented numbers, from several parts of the city, including the University College of Science, Saifabad, in Masab Tank. While permission was not given for the rally, with several protesters reaching the venue on foot, it appeared that it was. Traffic was thrown out of gear even as protesters raised slogans in small groups at and near the venue.

Several shops and business establishments had to down their shutters in Old City and other parts of the town, in solidarity with the protest. Some schools and colleges too, had given the day off to its staff and students.

Interestingly, police in Old City allegedly began taking down anti-CAA, NRC and NPR posters, from the shutters of establishments closed for the day. While the JAC against CAA, NRC and NPR gave the protest call, a vast majority of protesters, observers said, arrived at the venue voluntarily and out of a “sense of duty”.

“I work with a banking corporation. My wife and I are here simply because we need to convey a message that the direction towards which the country is heading is wrong. The BJP is breaking the country apart,” said Abdus Samad. When asked how he got to know of the protest, he said, “It was all over social media. Apart from one or two speakers, I do not know them.”

The protests were not without Hyderabadi witticism. Placards had sardonic slogans and dark humour.

“Abba ke waalid Dada humaare, who bakra paalte thhe, baakra kaaghazaat khaa gaya” (My grandfather had a pet sheep that ate his documents), one placard read.

And how can one dissociate baigan (eggplant), a sign of exasperation, from a Hyderabadi joke? “Yaha biryani ke saath piyaz dhoonde toh nai milri, 50 saal ke documents kya milte baigan” (It is impossible to find onions in biryani, how can one find 50-year-old documents baigan).

Another read, “Hum to wazu bhi nahi tootney detey, mulk kya khaaq tootne dengey” (We don’t break out ablutions, leave alone letting the country break apart).",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tricolour-hyderabadi-witticism-dominate-protest/article30481290.ece
302,2020/01/04,Traffic thrown out of gear,"Weekend plans of Hyderabadis for an outing went for a toss as a protest rally against the Citizenship Amendment Act and proposed National Register of Citizens threw traffic out of gear on Saturday.

Instead of relaxing, those who were on the roads were left fuming as they got stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for a long time, especially in the central parts of the city.

People started to gather at Dharna Chowk from early afternoon and by 2 p.m. Lakdi-ka-pul, Tank Bund, Gandhi Nagar and other roads leading to the protest site were chock-a-block with traffic.

In fact, assessing the situation, people, starting from Lumbini Park, parked their bikes by the roadside and chose to walk.

It was not just vehicles, a large number of people holding the tricolour walked in groups alongside roads which added to the congestion. In desperation, motorists squeezed their vehicles into every inch of the road. And equally desperate pedestrians made their way by jumping over mudguards of bikes.

The same situation was witnessed in the bylanes around Dharna Chowk.

Movement of vehicles to RGIA, Shamshabad, MGBS, JBS and all the three major railway stations — Secunderabad, Kacheguda and Nampally — was the worst affected. Initially, the jam extended from Tank Bund to Mehdipatnam, Koti, Narayanguda and other central and southern parts of the city. In the afternoon, the congestion spread to even western (Madhapur, Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills) and northern (Begumpet, Bowenpally and Marredpally) parts of the capital.

Around 5 p.m., a middle-aged man, who came to a hospital near Indira Park, was seen asking DCP (Task Force) P Radhakishan Rao when the traffic would be cleared as his car was stuck because of the protest.

Hundreds of commuters took to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to share their experiences and many alerted their friends and family in WhatsApp chat groups to the traffic situation.

However, the Hyderabad Traffic Police did not issue any advisory and restrictions; instead, they kept updating Twitter.

The traffic jam became worse in the evening when people who participated in protest were on their way back. For at least 4 km around Dharna Chowk, the flow of traffic was affected. Amid constant honking and thick layer of smoke emanating from vehicles, people became eager to cut through the serpentine traffic and reach their destination.

Organiser to be booked

Meanwhile, an official said the Gandhi Nagar police would register a case against the organiser of the protest, Mustaq Mallik, for violating police permission conditions. “We gave permission for only 1,000 people, whereas he mobilised more than 10,000 protesters and violated our conditions. This led to the traffic jam,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/g2d39v/article30481157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05HYCAANRCNPR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/protest-throws-traffic-out-of-gear-in-hyderabad/article30481158.ece

Speed limit on the flyover has been fixed at 40 kmph, after two successive accidents in which three persons were killed by over-speeding vehicle riders.

Expert committee constituted to pore over the design aspects of the structure suggested a slew of measures to contain the speed, and inspected it 10 times to oversee their implementation. On December 30, the committee members took a test ride on the flyover and expressed satisfaction over the measures, a statement from GHMC said.

The committee will observe the traffic and commuters’ behaviour on the flyover for the next one month and suggest further measures if any, the statement said.

The structure was built under the Strategic Road Development Plan, a project for facilitating signal free traffic in the city.

Within a week after its launch, the flyover saw its first accident, wherein two persons taking selfie were rammed to death by a drunk techie riding an over-speeding car.

Within a fortnight, the second accident took place when a car, driven at over 100 kmph, flew off the flyover and fell on a woman, resulting in her instant death.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p5jell/article30477863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04Biodiversity,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabads-biodiversity-park-flyover-reopened-after-multiple-accidents/article30477051.ece
304,2020/01/04,NHAI gears up for Sankranti rush,"Anticipating heavy rush of vehicles for the ensuing Sankranti festival, the National Highways Authority of India has set up special counters in close to a dozen highway restaurants on Hyderabad-Vijayawada (NH-65), Hyderabad-Bengaluru (NH-44) and Hyderabad-Warangal (NH-163) to sell FASTag for hassle-free travel.

The decision comes in wake of the rush seen at all the 17 toll plazas in Telangana consequent to the collection of user fee through FASTag mode only, from December.

With many travelling without tags waiting for considerable time at the non-FASTag lanes and expressing ire, the authorities decided that more counters would be opened to sell the tags.

Sale points

Accordingly, five restaurants on Hyderabad-Vijayawada highway, four on Hyderabad-Bengaluru and two on Hyderabad-Warangal highway have been requested to allow setting up of special counters.

“These counters will sell the tags for vehicles which do not have one. The idea is to help travellers avoid hardships like waiting for a long time in cash lanes. We will continue to run the counters at all the toll plazas till we achieve the target,” said NHAI-Hyderabad Regional Officer A. Krishna Prasad.

NHAI officials expect heavy rush at Panthangi toll plaza (NH-65), Raikal plaza (NH-44) and Gudur plaza (NH-163). “As Sankranti falls in the middle of the week, our expectation is that the travellers would start heading for their hometowns from January 11 (Saturday) itself. The flow could be scattered giving us some breathing time,” Mr. Prasad said.

Technical staff at plazas

At a meeting with NHAI officials, bankers and vendors selling tags, it was decided that sale of tags should be stepped up. As part of the measure, banks were asked to start more counters and deploy technical staff at the toll plazas to meet any technical issues.

Asked about the technical hiccup in implementation of the National Electronic Toll Collection programme for collection of user fee through FASTag based on RFID technology, Mr Prasad said some problems did crop up which are being addressed.

He pointed out instances of travellers using tags issued for non-commercial vehicles on commercial vehicles. This was leading to the tag getting blacklisted and disrupting free flow of traffic in the dedicated lanes. “We have warned the tag owners and banks to be cautious of such attempts,” he said.

Similarly, old tags issued for heavy vehicles and RTC buses were also not getting scanned easily leading to delay. Some tags affixed in an improper manner also led to scanners not reading the tags. “We are issuing new tags with the same identification numbers without any extra charge,” the NHAI official said.

Another problem was tag-enabled vehicles entering the dedicated lanes without sufficient balance in the account.

“Such vehicles are stuck in the booths as the barrier will not open, causing inconvenience to other users,” he noted.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kfafe1/article30476404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy03FASTagcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nhai-gears-up-for-sankranti-rush/article30476406.ece
305,2020/01/04,Cyber fraudster visits Vaishno Devi for salvation after cheating hundreds,"He flew to Jammu and Kashmir to take the blessings of the goddess at Vaishno Devi temple after cheating hundreds out of their money.

Sandeep Kumar alias Aryan (22) from Kabirpura in Sheikhpura of Bihar told Cyberabad police he boarded a flight to Srinagar a few months ago after successfully fooling several victims with his cyber crime techniques, hoping for salvation after a visit to the temple.

He also performed his sister’s marriage with Manikchand Paswan (30) and gave ₹ 3.5 lakh as dowry. Later, Paswan, who was a mason in Chennai, shifted to Kabirpura to join hands with his brother-in-law to make a quick buck.

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior officer associated with the investigation of the case said that Sandeep was very confident that he won’t be caught by the police, and even in the worst conditions, he was ready to pay a hefty bribe for his release.

A few years ago, Sandeep learnt the fraud tricks from his ‘guru’ Mitlesh Paswan, an expert in cyber crimes and formed his own gang. The gang would make at least ₹10,000 per week, and in case if they trap a ‘big fish’ they would earn not less than ₹1.5 to ₹2 lakh.

The accused told police that at least 500 youths of the 2,500 in their village took to cyber frauds as a full-time profession

When the 39-year-old victim from Kompally questioned them about the so-called prize after transferring ₹2.30 lakh into various bank accounts, the accused said, “Aapke Maa Baap Sanskar nahi sikhaya kya (Didn’t your parents teach you manners), why are you harassing us. We will return the money and won’t send you the car.”

Further, the victim told The Hindu that when she called Sandeep repeatedly to know the status of her prize, the accused called Abid Road police station and told them that she was ‘harassing’ them. “I was so scared after the police called and warned me,” she said.

The gang members paid ₹ 5 per customer contact details and made payments only via Paytm to Delhi-based marketing executive Tausif Ahmed.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rbec0k/article30476333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/abhinay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cyber-fraudster-visits-vaishno-devi-for-salvation-after-cheating-hundreds/article30476334.ece
306,2020/01/04,KCR for construction of check dams on all streams,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has instructed the officials to build the required number of check dams on all streams in the State.

The number of check dams required should be identified and half of them be constructed this year, and the rest, the next year. The tanks that were revived under Mission Kakatiya should also be maintained every year and adequate budgetary provision would be made for construction of check dams and maintenance of tanks. He also wanted the officials to examine proposals to construct a lift irrigation scheme to supply water from Palair to Nagarjunasagar Project ayacut in Miryalaguda division. A survey be taken up for this purpose.

The Chief Minister gave these instructions during a review meeting on utilisation of small and minor irrigation resources with Minister G. Kamalakar, CMO and Irrigation officials, at Pragathi Bhavan, here on Friday.

State’s share of Godavari waters would be utilised through Kaleshwaram, Devadula and Sitarama projects. Kaleshwaram project alone would provide over 500 tmc ft of water to fill Yellampally, Mid Manair, Lower Manair, SRSP and also Mallannasagar, Kondapochammasagar, Baswapur reservoirs - that are being constructed. All the tanks would be filled under various projects and this would ensure water availability in all areas across the State for cultivation of abundant crops, he said.

In the process of releasing water to the ayacut lands, water would flow down along with rain water through several streams and rivulets and to impound this water, check dams should be constructed, Mr. Rao said.

Once the data on total number of check dams required is finalised, half of them should be constructed this year itself, and for this, tenders should be called by January 15. Mr. Rao reiterated that tanks across the State were revived in a mission mode under Mission Kakatiya, and consequently the economy of villages is also being reviving. It also important to maintain these tanks by repairing tank bunds and drains regularly. Farmers should be encouraged to take the silt removed from the tanks during every summer into their fields and it should be coordinated by the Agriculture Department, Farmers Coordination Committee and village panchayats. One of the Village Revenue Assistants should be entrusted with the responsibility of maintenance of tanks and also for removal of weeds from the tanks regularly, he said.

He instructed that during summer itself, Yellampally waters should be transferred to SRSP as in the beginning of the rainy season itself water from Kadem reservoir would reach Yellampally. Measures should be taken to ensure that there is no water scarcity for the SRSP ayacut. All the reservoirs in the State should be filled to the brim by October, Mr. Rao said.

Reorganisation of dept.

In view of the transformed irrigation system in the State, the Irrigation Department would be brought under the jurisdiction of five to six Engineer-in-Chiefs and accordingly the department should be reorganised, the Chief Minister said. The E-in-Cs would supervise and monitor all kinds of water resources under their respective jurisdiction. The Irrigation Department should work as one department without the differentiation as small, medium and major irrigation departments, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sjthpt/article30474182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy03CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-for-construction-of-check-dams-on-all-streams/article30474183.ece
307,2020/01/04,Execute court orders on illegal structures: GHMC to planners,"GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar directed Town Planning wing officials to strictly implement court orders with regard to illegal structures in the city.

During a meeting on Friday, Mr. Lokesh reviewed the progress of court cases from all 30 circles in GHMC’s purview. He asked the officials to implement court directions in toto and submit an action taken report (ATR) before January 10.

“Illegal structures should be completely demolished and removed, instead of half-hearted action like drilling holes in slabs,” he said. In case of status quo orders from courts, such structures should be inspected, and photos and videos should be taken about their present status, which could be used as proof to get favourable orders for lifting of stay orders.

In instances when orders from higher courts went contrary to lower court orders, orders from the latter should be implemented. It is the responsibility of officials to implement the court orders within the stipulated time, and any dereliction will beget strict disciplinary action, he said.

In cases, where the Commissioner is summoned for contempt of court, officials concerned will be held responsible and action will be taken against them, he said.

Grievances from public about illegal structures and related matters should be responded to, and written replies should be furnished on time.

308,2020/01/04,"After unseasonal rain, thick fog envelopes old Adilabad","Many parts of old undivided Adilabad district on Friday resembled hill stations thanks to a blanket of thick fog that enveloped it through the day.

The foggy condition was apparently the result of overnight rainfall which, according to a weather bulletin of the Telangana State Development Planning Society, was 47.5 mm for Adilabad and 48.5 mm for Nirmal.

Foggy conditions at Khandala ghat, one of the most scenics place in Adilabad rural mandal, created problems for road users. The picturesque Lohara village also remained hidden for the better part of the day due to fog.

Though the minimum temperature did not plunge beyond the 17 degree Celsius mark, the cold was bone chilling due to the dampness.

It hampered daily routine of people both in urban and rural areas; even shepherds ventured out only towards the afternoon to graze cattle.

Cold wave

Rain lashed several mandals of the undivided district early on Friday resulting in inundation of low lying areas.

Slum dwellers, beggars, commuters and passersby were the worst hit.

Cloudy weather and cold wave forced people, including morning walkers, to stay cooped up at home. There are no immediate reports on the damage of standing crops. Rudrur received the highest rainfall of 45.5 mm followed by Kotagiri (38.5 mm), Varni (37.10 mm), Bheemgal (29.4 mm), Nizamabad South (25.2 mm) and Makloor (24.0 mm).

Mosra mandal experienced no rainfall while Sirikonda received a minimum of 2.5 mm, Morthad at 2.60 mm; Yergatla 3.8 mm and Darpally 5.7 mm. Beerkur, Banswada, Kamareddy, Machareddy, SS Nagar, Tadwai mandals in Kamareddy district also received rainfall between 10 mm and 19 mm.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9sexsv/article30473791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03-KHANDALAROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/after-unseasonal-rain-thick-fog-envelopes-old-adilabad/article30473782.ece
309,2020/01/04,Mela promotes SHG businesses,"To support women self-help groups (SHGs) involved in income generation activities to market their products, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has organised an exhibition called Kala-2020 at the Revenue Gardens here.

The three-day exhibition aimed at women empowerment was inaugurated by Collector K. Shashanka on Friday along with NABARD AGM P. Ananth, DCCB CEO Satyanarayana Rao, District Agriculture officer V. Sreedhar, DD (marketing) Padmavathi and ATMA project director Priyadarshini.

Stating that only new SHGs are part of the exhibition, the Collector stressed the participation of at least one SHG from each mandal to market their products. He also promised to conduct exhibitions for SHGs at least once in six months to encourage women empowerment and said he would provide marketing facilities for their products.

In this exhibition, women SHGs from the integrated Karimnagar district have set up 25 stalls to market their products as part of their income generation programme. There were stalls on handloom, dress material, jute products, oils, detergent powders, bathroom cleaners etc.

Peddapalli district SHG women are displaying their products of Sabala sanitary napkins and jute bags.

312,2020/01/04,Gang cheating online shoppers held,"They obtain data of customers of popular e-commerce and telemarketing companies from a Delhi-based marketing executive and cheat people in the name of lucrative prize and gift by sitting in a remote Bihar village.

The youngsters send bulk SMS to online shoppers stating that they had won the first prize of a car or an amount of ₹ 6.90 lakh from the e-commerce firm and ask them to call the toll-free number.

“When a gullible person calls the given number, the gang members initially ask him to send some money for registration and RTO charges. They also share the fake ID card and Pan Card to gain trust,” said Cyberabad Commissioner of Police VC Sajjanar. Once a customer starts transferring money, they ask for more amount in the guise of insurance, GST, transportation, driver charges, car check and block the number when they question about the promised gift.

In one such case, a 39-year-old woman from Kompally who bought a spiral potato-cutter worth ₹ 228 from Snapdeal.com through her mobile application on October 8, was duped of ₹ 2.30 lakh by a gang from Bihar, who were arrested by the Cybercrime wing of Cyberabad on Friday.

Mr. Sajjanar said that on November 11, the woman received a message that she won the car and cash prize. Believing the message, she called the toll-free number and chose Tata Nexon car as a gift.

“Initially, she was asked to pay registration charges of ₹ 6,500 and transfer the money to an SBI account,” he said. The victim was then asked to pay a large amount for registration and other processes to claim the prize. “Within 48 hours, she transferred ₹ 2.30 lakh into various bank accounts, before she realised that fraud was played on her,” Mr. Sajjanar said, adding that the next day she approached the cyber crime police.

Following her complaint, a case under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act was registered and teams were sent to New Delhi and the other nort Indian states to nab the gang members before they ended up in Bihar.

The accused, who were arrested and brought to Hyderabad were identified as Sandeep Kumar Aryan (22) from Sheikpura, his brother-in-law Manikchand Paswan (30) from Nawada, marketing executive Tausif Ahmed and website developer Vikas Kumar from New Delhi.

According to the Cyber crime ACP Ch.Y. Srinivas Kumar, the gang members had taken seven toll-free service numbers, developed 13 websites and several bulk SMS services to cheat customers.

He said that no e-commerce company send bulk SMS to their customers offering gifts or prizes. “Never believe such messages as the fraudsters are also using toll-free numbers to trap the gullible.”

Mr. Sajjanar said that the gang arrested for the first time alone was operating 13 fake websites in the name of popular e-commerce sites, but they (the original sites) have not lodged a single complaint.

“Companies providing bulk SMS and toll-free service should obtain KYC documents and do field verification before giving the credentials,” he added.

314,2020/01/04,"The ancient carvings at Elephanta Caves are fading, and no one cares","The logo of the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation shows a 20 ft high monolith of the three-headed Trimurti Sadashiva representing the three aspects of Shiva: the right half-face signifying life and creativity; the left half-face, its obverse — the deity as a destructive force that can reduce the world to ashes; and the central face shows Shiva deep in meditation, as the protector of humanity. This awe-inspiring piece of carving, hewn out of rocks similar to Ellora in the same State, is the focal point of the Elephanta Caves, a small island about 10 km from Apollo Bunder on the Mumbai mainland adjoining the Gateway of India. The silhouette of the iconic gateway looms behind the Shiva image in the same logo.

Both the Gateway of India and the Elephanta Caves are huge tourist attractions, and every year thousands of people from India and abroad visit the caves, whose carvings, dated mostly between the late 5th and late 8th centuries, narrate Hindu mythologies and depict various magnificent figures of Shiva. There are also ancient Buddhist stupa mounds on the same island. It can be reached by an hour-long boat ride. Originally known as Gharapuri, the island was renamed by Portuguese invaders after a giant stone sculpture of an elephant, which was removed from the island and now stands outside the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum.

The Elephanta Caves in their entirety, and the forested areas around them, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site way back in 1987. Legislation to shield the island monuments has existed since the 1950s but only in name. Both the Maharashtra government and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which is supposed to protect them, turn a blind eye to the gradual, but visible, degradation of the spectacular carvings in the caves and the pollution of the Arabian Sea whose waters lap the mangrove forest around the island .

“Over the years the Island has been exposed to a great deal of stress as it is located in the midst of the Mumbai harbour,” states the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). “Pollution caused by port activities, the risk of explosion from nearby chemical storage facilities and oil silos as well as underwater blasting are among the environmental threats to the island. It is also situated on a fault line that runs through the island,” it adds.

Sludge and scraps

As I disembark from one of the rickety boats that ferry tourists from the Gateway of India, and jump — at great risk to life and limb — across the fleet anchored around the jetty to reach the causeway that leads to the island, I cannot help but notice the thick layers of sludge that sully the shores and the mangroves encircling the island. The tourist boats use old, polluting diesel engines. Scraps of plastic bags cling to the mangrove roots, and debris lies scattered around the shore during low tide.

“The sludge comes from ships, refineries, underground pipelines. There is a large amount of industrial pollution, pollution caused by port-related activities, and the discharge of untreated sewage,” says Debi Goenka, executive trustee and founder of the NGO, Conservation Action Trust.

Plastic and oil could choke the mangroves, but the domestic sewage, says Goenka, could encourage the growth of mangroves.

The boats cross a high security zone — research reactors of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre are not far away — and as the Gateway of India and the two Taj hotels are swallowed by the horizon, liners and ships and rows of cranes and rigs crowd out the shadowy skyscrapers along the Mumbai skyline. A cluster of tiny, multi-coloured houses of local inhabitants, amidst the thick cover of trees, comes into view as the boat draws closer to the island.

As I walk along the causeway strewn with garbage, I notice a signboard offering a toy train service to the caves. Toy train to an important archaeological site? Is this a zoo? Does a World Heritage Site deserve such treatment?

Toy train at Elephanta Caves | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini

Sure enough, tourists occupy all the seats of the diesel-fuelled toy train. The narrow gauge line takes about 10 minutes to reach the foot of the hills. The number of hawkers selling snacks and water grows as I approach the caves, and they swell into a crowd as I come closer to the steep and uneven stairway that leads to the caves. They have erected shacks all along the causeway and the 120 steps that are covered with plastic sheets meant to shelter their wares, mostly gewgaw. Tasneem Mehta, former vice-chairperson of INTACH and honorary director of the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, says the local people have no other means of livelihood save peddling trinkets, but “let’s regularise them. Let’s do it in a sustainable way.” Why is the State government reluctant to set the hawkers’ stalls in order? “Tourism is the mainstay of the island. The government is generally unable to regulate these kinds of activities,” says Goenka.

This uphill track can leave you out of breath, and the plastic canopy makes it even more stifling. Eateries offering everything from fruit juice to lunch occupy all the space along the steep gradient. And with crowds ceaselessly walking up or down, a sudden panicked rush is not a remote possibility. One doesn’t have to stretch one’s imagination to envisage the scale of the resulting disaster. Then there is the monkey menace. Troops of macaques are ubiquitous and are adept at snatching food from tourists.

In a letter to the then director-general of ASI, dated February 20, 2004, Richard A. Engelhardt, UNESCO Regional Advisor for Culture in Asia and the Pacific, had written, “Elephanta is the ‘crown jewel’ in the necklace of cave art sites along the coast of Maharashtra.” He expressed his concern over the proposal to upgrade tourist facilities on the island, which had been prepared without the approval of the Elephanta planning committee and “without appropriate input” from ASI or INTACH experts. “Most worrying, the proposals appear not to be in conformity with the approved management plan for safeguarding the heritage values,” prepared by INTACH for ASI.

Entrenched politics

In 1997, ASI appointed INTACH Mumbai to prepare a management plan for the Elephanta Caves, says Mehta. “INTACH’s efforts have been to develop a holistic engagement with the site to address not only the needs of the visitor but also the community.” Despite several years of work and many reports being presented to the government, very little work was undertaken at Elephanta Island. Mehta ascribes this to “deeply entrenched politics” involving this “money-spinner”.

Engelhardt’s letter reminded ASI that in 1995, Sir Bernard Feilden, UNESCO-appointed expert, found that “the state of conservation in the core zone had deteriorated dramatically... Sir Bernard had warned that the situation at Elephanta was so serious that unless corrected, Elephanta could be removed from the World Heritage List.” How would Sir Bernard have reacted to the mess at the Elephanta Caves today?

So why didn’t the government implement the INTACH proposal? “Probably because the ASI and the Maharashtra government did not want an independent agency in the picture that can rock their boat,” replies Goenka.

Goenka is concerned by the construction of the new airport and its impact on the island too. “I would expect that a lot of the finer particles from the quarries have been washed into the sea around Elephanta. The overflights would definitely affect the rock-cut caves. Thirty years ago, the blasting carried out for Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust was believed to have caused some damage to the caves,” says Goenka.

The imposing rock carvings inside Cave no.1, which is the pièce de résistance, have for ages been defaced and vandalised, but whatever remains is stupefying enough. Yet, Indian tourists busy taking selfies hardly notice these outstanding rock carvings. As in Ellora, some of the visitors clamber on the carvings at the Elephanta Caves in their narcissistic quest for a better selfie. Guards busy explaining the ‘history’ and ‘myths’ behind the carvings have no time to notice the errant visitors, and the visitors seem to be impervious to the fact they are breaking the laws meant to protect the site.

Incredible India indeed.

315,2020/01/04,"Jeweller robbed of cash, jewellery","A jewellery owner was robbed of his bag allegedly containing ₹80,000, a couple of gold bangles and a few documents at Kanjoor near Kalady on Saturday around 10.15 a.m.

Stephen of Malayattoor was about to open his jewellery at Kanjoor when the incident was said to have taken place.

He kept his bag by the side to unlock the shop and had opened one lock.

It was while working on the second lock that someone who was apparently waiting for the right moment, wrested the bag and fled.

According to local residents, he rode pillion on a motorcycle in the direction of Aluva. Reportedly, some liquid had been poured inside the lock, which was suspected to be a deliberate ploy to delay the unlocking, giving the miscreants enough time to pull off the theft.

“We have registered a case for theft and are looking at the CCTV footage in the nearby areas,” said the Kalady police.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jeweller-robbed-of-cash-jewellery/article30481138.ece

322,2020/01/04,Kochi to have an embedded GIS map soon,"A user-friendly Geographic Information System-based master plan is in the offing for the city.

The first such plan for the Kochi Corporation area, developed using GIS software, will map existing buildings, land use and utilities, and help prepare development proposals.

The map is being designed to make it accessible on mobile phones. “Using the map, property buyers within the corporation limits should be able to enter the survey number into their phones and find out whether the land they are buying falls in the residential, commercial or industrial zone, cutting down visits to offices to look for such information,” said J. Jayakumar, Senior Town Planner, Department of Town and Country Planning.

The ₹70-lakh project is being implemented by the department under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Master plans are to be prepared for all the nine AMRUT cities in the State in accordance with the mission’s objectives.

The last sanctioned structural map for the city is from 1991. Another master plan was completed in 2015 for the Kochi region but has not been sanctioned by the government yet, and it does not include now relevant details like the metro and associated development, Mr. Jayakumar said.

Maps that are available in most cities were earlier prepared on a 1:50,000 scale. A small error of a millimetre while reading or preparing the map could mean very drastic changes on the ground.

A GIS-based map could avoid such errors of scale and is nearly impossible to manipulate, Mr. Jayakumar said. Master plans must be updated every five years, but this was rarely done since the hard copies were difficult to update. Updation will also be easier with the software-based system.

As part of the mapping process, satellite imagery from 2016 for 98 sq km of the city area was obtained from the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC). The aerial photographs cover roads, waterbodies, buildings, bridges, railway networks, drains, trees, electric poles, and even streetlights. Ground-truthing to vet satellite data and correlate it with ground reality was recently completed, and the data is being updated based on ground-level studies. This will be followed by a spatial analysis of the data and preparation of development proposals, including suggestions like road widening.

Underground utilities were also to be mapped, but departments like the Kerala Water Authority and Kerala State Electricity Board have incomplete maps of such utilities, making it nearly impossible to map them entirely, said another official at the Town Planning Department. The corporation will be able to use the map later to add layers and plan development projects. The project, around 50% complete, is hurtling towards its deadline.

The final plan is to be completed by March, after which funds will not be allotted for AMRUT projects, the official said. Along with GIS experts, around 70 surveyors had to be hired to complete ground-truthing since the department did not have the necessary manpower to deal with the project.

While the project requires a team larger than the seven-member one currently handling it, a shortage of funds made it difficult to hire staff, the official said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kgpes8/article30474489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-KOCHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-to-have-an-embedded-gis-map-soon/article30474490.ece
323,2020/01/04,Twin flyovers getting ready for commissioning in March,"With over 80% of work on the Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers over, officials of the PWD (NH Wing) are hopeful of readying them for commissioning by the end of March.

Work is in full swing to make optimal use of the ongoing season since the rain has subsided. It could speed up further if the Government clears three bills worth approximately ₹6 crore that the contracting firm for the Vyttila flyover had submitted, stakeholders associated with the work said. The 18-month deadline to complete the flyover had expired in May 2019, following which it was extended to September and subsequently December 2019.

A little over 80% of work on the six-lane structure is over. The retaining wall for the flyover’s approach ramp has been filled on the Aroor side. Work on the wall on the Palarivattom side will begin shortly, for which barricading will be extended northward. Prior to this, slip roads on the eastern and western sides have to be completed and tar-coated to divert traffic.

Eight of the twenty 40-m-long I-girders over the central span of the flyover have to be launched using a 300-tonne capacity crane. This will be followed by the launch of four 30-m-long girders next to the central span.

The launch of these girders suffered delay due to work on the Kochi metro viaduct which hovers over the flyover and work getting halted for over a month following an adverse remark by an engineer of the quality inspection wing of the PWD. This subsequently necessitated inspection by experts from IIT-Madras.

However, experts are of the view that the flyover could have been completed much earlier if the PWD had allocated funds to set up a yard for pre-cast girders as was done by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for the Kochi metro. The small yard on a vacant land behind the PWD office beneath the Vyttila railway overbridge has space just to store materials and house a lab and labour camp. Pre-casting work right at the junction has necessitated wide and extensive barricading, throwing traffic out of gear.

While over 50% of vehicles passing through the junction are expected to use the flyover that has been built in the north-south direction, an electronic signal system will be erected to streamline the flow of vehicles in the north-east direction. Allied works like raising service roads, reconstruction of drains, and perhaps a roundabout at the junction will be completed after the commissioning of the flyover.

Kundannoor flyover

As regards Kundannoor flyover, official sources said 82% of work is over. “The flyover should be ready for commissioning, as was initially scheduled, in March or latest by April, if everything goes according to plan. Girders have been launched, and slabs over them are ready. Work on the retaining wall on the Vyttila side is under way. This will soon be followed by similar work on the Aroor side and installation of street lights,” they added.

The PWD had fixed a 24-month deadline for the project whose piling began in March 2018. Post-commissioning, signal lights, crash barrier, and kerb will be built, the sources said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6u6b5c/article30474475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-VYTTILA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/twin-flyovers-getting-ready-for-commissioning-in-march/article30474476.ece
324,2020/01/04,Deadline for GPS installation extended,"The Regional Transport Office (RTO), Ernakulam, has set January 30 as the deadline for installing Global Positioning System (GPS) on private water tankers to track their movement.

The decision forms part of steps being taken to ensure that tankers do not draw water from illegal sources in the district. There were complaints that they had been collecting untreated water from abandoned, waterlogged quarries and other waterbodies for supply at schools, hotels, and hospitals.The RTO had found that tracking the movement of tanker lorries supplying drinking water in Ernakulam was difficult as only a few of the 350-odd tankers had GPS.

Senior officials of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) confirmed that only around 10% of private water tankers had GPS despite an earlier directive making it mandatory. However, new tankers were found equipped with the system, they said. The department will hold regular inspections to ensure that tankers do not carry contaminated water. The interior of the storage tanker should be coated with polyvinyl chloride sheets. Drinking water should be transported only in tankers that are painted blue, said officials.

The RTO said the number of tankers registering with the department had gone up over the last two days. The district administration had earlier maintained that only those tankers registered with the RTO, Ernakulam, would be allowed to operate from January 1. The deadline was later extended to January 10.

The association of water tanker operators in the district had submitted a list of around 300 vehicles affiliated to it for registration. The registration process is expected to be over by Monday, it said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/deadline-for-gps-installation-extended/article30474474.ece
325,2020/01/04,Two more water samples test positive for coliform,"Two more samples collected from private tankers supplying drinking water in Ernakulam have tested positive for the presence of coliform bacteria.

The samples were collected from two private wells at Chalakkal near Aluva. The Hindu had reported on Sunday that four of the nine samples taken by a special squad constituted by the district administration on December 24 had been found to have the presence of coliform.

Three of the nine samples were found fit for consumption during preliminary tests held at the inspection site. The squad had been awaiting the laboratory test results of the two samples. Now, six of the nine samples collected from tankers as part of the Operation Pure Water initiative have been found unfit for consumption.

The samples were collected after the Assembly Committee on Petitions at its meeting held here on December 5 came down heavily on the district administration for not acting against water tankers drawing water from illegal sources. There were complaints that they were collecting untreated water from abandoned and waterlogged quarries and other waterbodies for supply at schools, hotels, and hospitals.

The presence of residual chlorine, an indicator that sufficient amount of chlorine had been added to the water to inactivate bacteria and some viruses, was nil in the six samples.

The report filed by the special squad pointed out that the recommendation of the Assembly Committee that drinking water be drawn only from hydrants and supply points of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) was appropriate going by the test results. The authority informed the panel that it was prepared to supply the required quantity of drinking water to private suppliers.

Commenting on the findings, a senior district administration official said stringent action would be taken against operators who failed to abide by the colour scheme for water tankers proposed by the Assembly Committee. The panel had insisted that vehicles used to supply drinking water should be given blue colour, while those meant for transporting septage should be painted yellow, and those carrying waste water should be given brown colour.

Regular inspections and surprise checks will be conducted in the coming days to ascertain that water supplied to consumers is drawn from KWA hydrants and supply points, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/icdkrz/article30474449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KI-Coliform-bacteriacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/two-more-water-samples-test-positive-for-coliform/article30474450.ece
326,2020/01/04,‘Wooden Overcoats’ is a classic British comedy in podcast form,"When I first heard the title, I thought it might be a tad too morbid for morning listening. But then, one person who recommended it to me said it was the falling-off-your-chair-laughing kind of funny. I thought this level of hilarity might pose a driving hazard, so I decided to put it off for an off-road listening opportunity. Soon, another recommendation came along, now from a comedy artist who’s quite difficult to please, and I decided it was time to queue up all three available seasons, and hit play.

Wooden Overcoats is a comedy podcast and audio sitcom that’s as British as you can get — and given that many of us were raised on a diet of P.G. Wodehouse and Yes, Prime Minister (even the somewhat over-the-top Fawlty Towers), it’s a familiar sort of drollery, replete with clueless leading men, devious charmers, smart women and, in this case, one very articulate mouse, who opens the story:

“Now, hidden in the English Channel is an island called Piffling. On the island is a village, called Piffling Vale. The village has a square, and the square has this lovely little antique shop, but opposite the antique shop is a funeral home...”

Fun(n) funerals

The funeral parlour is run by the ironically named Rudyard Funn, assisted by his sister, the expert embalmer Antigone, and their person-Friday, Georgie. “Funn Funerals” has for years had the monopoly in the funeral business in Piffling Vale, but now there is competition, in the form of the handsome and urbane Eric Chapman. The latter is bringing all kinds of exciting innovations to the management of the final journey, starting with a spiffy new coffee machine in the waiting lounge. Rudyard’s situation isn’t helped by the mayor, who is convinced that if Piffling Vale is to become a town, it must have at least two funeral parlours. The ensuing competition results in all manner of awkward situations, mainly for Rudyard, who decides he must do everything he can to stay ahead in the business, including espionage and sabotage, thus providing the little village with the most excitement it has seen since the 15th century. The spirited Georgie mostly goes along with Rudyard’s plotting, but the long-suffering Antigone much prefers to focus on art cinema (which is “meant to be survived, not enjoyed”) even as she harbours a secret crush on the dashing Chapman (who quite fancies Georgie).

The ongoing tensions between Funn and Chapman are presented by Madeleine, Rudyard’s pet mouse, whose painstaking chronicling of this saga will, she tells us, become the first ever Sunday Times bestseller to be written by a mouse (possibly to be contracted by Random Mouse, publisher of such great works as Of Mice and Other Mice).

The independently produced comedy is written by David Barnes and played by an ensemble cast. Despite receiving both acclaim and awards, Wooden Overcoats ran for three seasons (2015, 2016 and 2017) but had to take an extended break until a Kickstarter campaign brought in enough funds for a fourth and final season that will be released in mid 2020. There’s enough in the archive to keep one going till Season 4 comes along, with 24 episodes across the three seasons and several extras that, the producers say, “have been crafted with love and — as Antigone would say — with fluids”.

So, what is a wooden overcoat? Just listen, won’t you.

So they were in a for a surprise when they were invited by P.S. Sreedharan Pillai, who took over as the Governor of Mizoram three months ago, to have tea and meals with them. On Saturday morning, the players, the coach and the supporting staff arrived at Mr. Pillai’s residence. “It was great to spend time with them,” the Governor said. “When I came to know the Aizawl team was here in my hometown, I thought it would be nice to meet them. They were too very happy; they said they were meeting a Governor for the first time.”

He said he had seen from close quarters how passionate Mizoram was about football.

“That is easily the most popular sport there,” he said. “And that is something Kerala shares with Mizoram, especially here in Kozhikode, which is actually known across the country for its passion for football. I like to watch football, of course.”

About the match that was played later on Saturday night, Mr. Pillai said he hoped the best team would win. “I wouldn’t wish any team in particular to win,” he said.

329,2020/01/04,Policing goes hi-tech in Kozhikode,"The Kozhikode City and Rural police districts got some valuable additions to their existing facilities on Saturday with the opening of northern Kerala region police cyberdome, an exclusive cyber police station and two hi-tech control rooms to step up video surveillance and crime-tracking measures. They were opened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through videoconferencing.

The modern cyberdome set up at the Government Cyber Park with the technical support of nearly 100 IT experts will offer its service to the entire Malabar region. Mainly, it will be used for the scientific collection of evidence by the new cyber police station, and its accurate analysis and preservation for further legal proceedings.

The new cyber station, set up at a cost of ₹30 lakh, too will offer its services to all local police stations in Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod districts in investigating major cyber cases. The 19-member team trained in the field by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing is the first of such specialised units in Northern Kerala.

The two hi-tech control rooms, one at Vadakara and the other in Kozhikode city, will facilitate the 24x7 monitoring of police control room vehicles in Kozhikode district using a GPS navigation system. Also, the inter-district movement of such vehicles can be tracked with precision. According to officials, live visuals from high-end traffic surveillance cameras too can be monitored from there.

Over 70 surveillance cameras have been linked to the hi-tech control room for live monitoring in Kozhikode city. CCTV visuals from about 15 police stations too will be accessible for control room operators.

In Kozhikode Rural, the camera network is in the process of expansion.

332,2020/01/04,20 arrested for group clash at Paralachi,"A day after, Tiruchuli Deputy Superintendent of Police, R. K. Sasidhar, opened fire in the air to disperse an armed mob at Paralachi on Friday night, the Virudhunagar district police on Saturday booked over 40 persons belonging to two groups under various sections of Indian Penal Code, including attempt to murder.

The police have arrested around 20 persons in two separate cases.

When a group of people from Sengulam were returning home after garlanding the statue of freedom fighter Kattabomman in a convoy of eight vehicles, people belonging to another community attacked the convoy with stones at Paralachi.

Three vehicles were damaged and Sengulam people fled the scene in other vehicles leaving behind the damaged vehicles. The incident is said to have happened around 6.30 p.m.

Later, Sengulam people, who mobilised more strength, were proceeding towards Paralachi to take revenge on the attackers at around 8.15 p.m. However, by then a small group of policemen, led by the DSP, Sasidhar, had rushed to the spot.

When the police tried to stop them, the mob tried to overpower the police. The DSP fired two rounds in the air.

“As the men were armed and situation could have gone worse, had they reached Paralachi in the night, I opened fire in air to force them to disperse,” the DSP said.

334,2020/01/04,SHRC flays complainant for falsely accusing police officer,"The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has slapped exemplary cost of ₹25,000 on a complainant, who had falsely accused a woman police officer of having verbally abused and assaulted him when he appeared before the police in connection with a complaint preferred against him by his maternal aunt.

In his complaint with the SHRC, N. Balachandar of Kondaanagaram near here said he had submitted a complaint with Suththamalli police against his maternal aunt A. Thamaraipushpam, accusing her of having usurped his land measuring about 5.50 cents and a gold chain, weighing 2 sovereigns, from him.

When he and his parents went to the police station on May 5, 2018 for inquiry, Sub-Inspector of Police Sudha verbally abused and assaulted him, he charged adding that he had to undergo treatment in the government hospital for the injury he had sustained in the assault.

Since his petition with the Superintendent of Police seeking action against Ms. Sudha did not evoke any response, he was constrained to approach the SHRC, Mr. Balachandar said.

Denying the charges levelled against her, Ms. Sudha, who appeared before the SHRC, said the then Inspector of Police, Suththamalli police station, Vijayakumar completed the inquiry into the petition of Mr. Balachandar and the complaint preferred by Mrs. Thamaraipushpam against Mr. Balachandar as he had assaulted the lady even as she was standing in front of her house.

Property dispute

It was then found that he had a dispute with his aunt over a property and filed a fake complaint against her besides cheating and assaulting her.

Ms. Sudha registered a criminal case against Mr. Balachandar and subsequently filed the charge-sheet in the Judicial Magistrate court, Cheranmahadevi, against him.

“In order to take vengeance against me, Mr. Balachandar filed a false complaint with the SHRC,” the Sub-Inspector said.

SHRC member D. Jayachandran observed that Mr. Balachandar had filed the complaint with the SHRC against Ms. Sudha “who has discharged her duty as per law”.

“While the police officer has not violated the human rights of the complainant as he has failed to prove it, he is not entitled to get any compensation. The complainant, using his political influence, has troubled the police officer and harassed her besides giving news in the media in a bid to tarnish her image. So, the petition is dismissed with the exemplary cost of ₹25,000 to the respondent,” Mr. Jayachandran ordered.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/shrc-flays-complainant-for-falsely-accusing-police-officer/article30480178.ece
335,2020/01/04,"Be focussed on serving people, students told","It is important to be aware of one’s purpose or aim in life instead of going through the process of just doing one’s job for the sake of it, said Chief Information Commissioner R. Rajagopal.

Speaking at the 32nd convocation of Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education (KARE), the senior IAS officer said students would be able to flourish if their purpose was directed towards serving the people. He distributed graduation and post-graduation degree certificates to 1,965 students.

Recollecting his role as Collector of Virudhunagar, Mr. Rajagopal said that the district had seen numerous communal clashes between 1996 and 1997. “Poverty was not the cause for clashes 20 years ago. People of different communities could not live together cordially. We decided to impose Section 144 when there were clashes and murders in nearby districts and in this district though there was political pressure not to do so. When the decision was implemented, it saved many lives,” he said. It was important to remember core purpose during such occasions and ensure that he was able to stick to his decision. He said that Tamil Nadu was one of the first States in the country to offer school education to all sections of people soon after independence.

“Growth of higher educational institutions could not be possible without the contribution of the private sector,” he added.

336,2020/01/04,Bulls and tamers get ready for the game,"Seven-year-old Kaari looks handsome and majestic with rippling muscles, a pair of symmetrically curved horns and a well-shaped hump on his back. He is one among the star bulls in the village of Metturajakkapatti near here, known for bull tamers and jallikattu bulls. The bull has been hailed as a winner in many of the jallikattu events, bringing accolades to its owner Sukumar.

“Almost every household in the village has at least two jallikattu bulls. The people here have such heightened passion for the sport and pride for their bulls,” says Sukumar, who owns five bulls. He and other youth in the village have been taking out their bulls for daily training as Pongal festival near.

Training

Just like the tamers, the bulls also get ready to face jallikattu and as part of the preparation, the animals are trained to do short sprints apart from swimming and walking. “The bulls are made to poke the sand with their horns. It’s a way to intimidate the tamers while on the arena. The animals are also taught to shrug off any tamer who manages to cling on to its hump,” he adds

The bulls are also given a special diet rich in nutrition during the season. “We feed them nuts, oil cakes, cotton seeds, dates and powdered pulses so that they gain a lot of protein and stamina,” he says.

Like other southern districts, Dindigul hosts about 10 famous jallikattu events during the Pongal season. Starting from Neikkarapatti near Palani, Natham Kovilpatti and Kosavaptti to Ayyampalayam, Batlagundu, Pattiveeranpatti, Athoor and Pillamnayakkanpatti. Many other jallikattu events are also held all over the district, in which hundreds of bulls and tamers take part every year.

Permission procedure

The district administration has announced that committees seeking to conduct jallikattu events should apply to the Collector for permission 20 days prior to the event.

“The application should be annexed with particulars such as invitations printed for the sport conducted in the previous years, permissions sought for the same in the past years, the venue details and insurance certificate for the entire event. Most importantly, the application should have a self declaration stating that the committee or organiser is solely responsible for any untoward incident that may occur during the conduct of the sport,” said Collector M.

337,2020/01/04,Protest staged against CAA and NRC,"The Madurai district Muslim Aikkiya Jamath organised a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Melur bus stand on Friday.

A large number of persons including district-level office-bearers of various political parties took part in the protest.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan participated in the agitation and voiced his concern over the Act. He said the BJP-led Central government did not pay heed to any concern raised by other party MPs in the Parliament.

“Had the government asked people’s opinion before passing the law, there would have been no such protest. As the movement is gaining momentum, the BJP seems to be retracting its decision,” he said.

He clarified that the protest was set rolling by students and not by any religious group.

“It’s a fight for the nation and its people and not for any particular religion or sect,” he added.

A similar protest was held in Ramanathapuram.

Members of the Ramanathapuram District Muslim Aikkiya Jamath gathered near the new bus stand and raised slogans against the BJP, the Central and State governments.

They said that the Act should be withdrawn immediately. Later, a public meeting was held.

Tiruvadanai MLA S. Karunas, Ramanathapuram MP K. Navas Kani and Muthukulathur MLA Malaysia S. Pandian took part in the protest and voiced their opinion against the Act.

338,2020/01/04,‘Judicial probe alone will bring out truth behind Mangaluru police firing’,"A judicial probe alone can bring out the truth behind the police excess and the violent protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the city on December 19, said Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) national president Mohammed Riyaz on Friday.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Riyaz alleged that the death of 23-year-old Nauseen and 53-year-old Jaleel in the police firing last month was nothing but “a State-sponsored killing”. The two, who were innocent, were unnecessarily shot down by the police, he said.

He alleged that like in Uttar Pradesh, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists had joined the police in assaulting peaceful protesters, aggravating the situation in Mangaluru on December 19. “There are videos of RSS activists in plainclothes trashing people at a select few shops in the city market area on that day. What happened in UP was repeated here too,” he said. The Union and State governments are pushing their agenda of creating unrest in society by prompting two communities to fight against each other, he said.

“The State government is wary about a judicial probe as it will bring out the true reasons behind the police firing and the violent reaction of the protesters,” Mr. Riyaz said.

While demanding the suspension of Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha, the DYFI leader said that the family members of the two deceased should get ₹25 lakh each as compensation. The State government should withdraw the “false cases” foisted against innocent people, he added. Mr. Riyaz was part of a delegation of the DYFI central committee that met the kin of Nauseen and Jaleel on Friday. The delegation included DYFI Karnataka and Kerala presidents Muneer Katipalla and A. Satish, DYFI Kerala secretary A.A. Rahim, and DYFI central committee members S.K Sajish and K.U. Janeesh Kumar.

342,2020/01/04,Seer wants extended Hore Kanike throughout Paryaya tenure,"With no major projects in mind for his two-year Paryaya of Udupi Sri Krishna Mutt, Admar Mutt’s junior seer Eeshapriya Tirtha Swami, the seer-in-waiting for Paryaya, on Friday said he would like the Hore Kanike (offerings by devotees) to be extended for the entire two-year tenure.

He was interacting with reporters here after the Tulabhara of the mutt’s presiding deity Kaliyamardana Krishna at the residence of Dakshina Kannada District Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Pradeep Kumar Kalkura.

Hore Kanike is offered after the ‘Pura Pravesha’ (January 8) and before the Paryaya celebrations (January 18).

“During this period, we will be busy visiting devotees and overseeing Paryaya arrangements. As such, we get little time to interact with devotees who bring in Hore Kanike,“ the seer said.

The extended Hore Kanike will enable devotees to interact with the seer freely.

“We have formed groups of 5-6 villages, whose residents would bring in the Hore Kanike once a fortnight as indicated by the mutt,” he said. This will also ensure a continuous supply of essentials to provide ‘anna prasada’ to all devotees visiting the mutt.

Normally, Hore Kanike items, including vegetables, fruits, rice, coconut, groceries, plantain leaf etc., get accumulated at once and many could not be preserved for long, he noted.

It is not compulsory for villagers to bring any particular item, the seer said. They could also bring local talents as Hore Kanike and they will get an opportunity to exhibit their talent at the mutt, the seer said.

There are no major projects planned during the Paryaya either, he said. “The Paryaya seer has to perform 16 pujas a day and we would be happy to perform them ardently,” he said.

As and when need arises to execute some work or project, the same would be carried out with the cooperation of all concerned, he added.

Speaking before performing the Tulabhara, the seer said Indian tradition did not have the concept of a weekly off or holidays. Even the Ekadashi was meant to purify one’s soul and body.

Speaking about Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt who died recently, the seer said his works were the leading lights for all.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/10z0hb/article30473892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BGPUJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/seer-wants-extended-hore-kanike-throughout-paryaya-tenure/article30473893.ece

344,2020/01/04,Valli Arunachalam seeks board seat in Murugappa Group’s holding firm,"A storm is brewing in the $5 billion Chennai-based Murugappa Group, as Valli Arunachalam, elder daughter of the late M.V. Murugappan, has locked horns with family patriarch 80-year-old M.V. Subbiah, who apparently is representing the entire family in the issue, demanding that female heirs in the family be given equal opportunity in the family business, on the same terms as male heirs.

Mr. Murugappan passed away in 2017 and is survived by his wife and two daughters, Valli Arunachalam and Vellachi Murugappan.

Valli Arunachalam, karta of the MVM HUF, is seeking a board representation in Ambadi Investments Ltd. (AIL), the holding company of the 119-year Murugappa group, after her father, the patriarch of the Murugappa family, passed away.

While the MVM family is among the largest blocks of shareholders in AIL, the group’s public unlisted holding company, after Murugappan’s passing away, they do not have any representation on the board, whereas every other part of the family tree has due representation on the board, which exercises control on the business empire.

When asked for comments, Ms. Arunachalam told The Hindu, “My father, the patriarch of the Murugappa family, passed away in 2017. In keeping with his wishes, our family is seeking representation on the board of Ambadi Investments Ltd. (AIL) as our family is one of the largest shareholders.”

As Karta of MVM HUF, Ms. Arunachalam is seeking a fair valuation of their assets from the larger family.

“Even after more than two years of my father’s death, we are still struggling to get the fair value of our assets as we are two daughters and my mother. The family has historically followed a practice of only allowing male heirs to run their business enterprises. This fight is not for us but for all women facing discrimination,” said Ms. Arunachalam.

After the demise of the former patriarch of the group, a branch was without a male heir for only the second time in the history of the family.

In the previous instance, one of Murugappan’s uncles, A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar (second generation), adopted a male child from another part of the family tree because he had only daughters, but the progressive Murugappan bequeathed his entire estate to his wife and two daughters.

A detailed query sent to Murugappa Group on Thursday remained unanswered.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/56t8qu/article30478938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ValliArunachalam,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/valli-arunachalam-seeks-board-seat-in-murugappa-groups-holding-firm/article30478063.ece
345,2020/01/04,Bracing for global impact after Soleimani’s assassination,"Yesterday’s targeted assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani, Commander of Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), bears two important differences from recent targets of similar U.S. operations. Unlike Abu Musaib al-Zarqawi (leader of the al-Qaeda in Iraq), Osama bin Laden (founder of the al-Qaeda) and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, (founder of the Islamic State, or the IS), Gen. Soleimani, 62, was a state actor. Second, unlike the previous three, he was not past his prime. Both these factors could lead to more substantive fallout.

The U.S. has sought to link the operation to a surge in attacks on its assets and personnel in Iraq. America proscribed the Qods Force and Gen. Qassem Soleimani more than 12 years ago for terrorism, but has not acted. In fact, during 2017-18, the U.S. indirectly collaborated with the Hashd Al-Shabi created by Gen. Soleimani, to defeat the IS. Gen. Soleimani was a frequent visitor to Iraq, and these visits were hardly secret. Moreover, had the U.S. wished to avoid a direct confrontation, it could have steered clear of taking public responsibility for the operation. But, presumably for domestic political reasons, it decided otherwise, thereby throwing down a risky “double-or-quit” gauntlet, at Tehran. Yet, unlike the targeted assassination of the IS chief in October, the U.S. President has, uncharacteristically avoided taking personal credit. Therefore, the handling of this operation raises more questions than it answers.

Pivotal figure

Gen. Soleimani hailed from a modest background in Kerman, far from the country’s traditional power centres. He was a child of the revolution, fought with distinction as a member of the IRGC in the Iraq-Iran war and was from 1998 the founder-commander of its Qods Force, formed for extra-territorial operations. During the past decade, he managed to leverage the disarray to enhance Iranian influence in Arab countries with a significant Shia population such as Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

He astutely created a network of local sympathisers and proxies and waged effective asymmetric wars. Unlike many Iranian public figures, he was untainted by corruption. His accomplishments earned him a cult-like following among most Iranians and their regional proxies. The U.S. and its Sunni allies saw his successes being at their cost. In an unguarded comment in 2017 that caused much alarm, he claimed that four Arab capitals were under Iranian sway.

Iranian authorities have reacted with predictable vehemence at Gen. Soleimani’s “martyrdom” and vowed vengeance. This tit-for-tat between the U.S. and Iran could easily go out of hand and lead to a major confrontation in a pyretic and fragile region, with unpredictable consequences. Both the antagonists have their respective domestic compulsions: Mr. Trump faces a Senate impeachment and re-election and Iran has its parliamentary elections next month. These factors would, hopefully, limit their options to low-intensity skirmishes. Iran has in the past used its foreign proxies, many of which were created and fostered by Gen. Soleimani, and they may now be itching to avenge his loss. Moving concentrically, Gen. Soleimani’s assassination in Baghdad is one incident most Iraqis could do without. It is likely to queer the pitch for Iraq, a hapless country with a caretaker government convulsed by nearly three months of youth protests, inter alia, against undue foreign interference by both Iran and the U.S.

The event is likely to re-polarise Iraqi society along sectarian lines and intensify the Iran-U.S. competition for influence. In a worst case scenario, Iraq could turn into the new Syria. The popular Iraqi clamour for political reforms and transparency may be eclipsed by the demand for eviction of the U.S. presence itself.

Oil sector as target

At a regional level, anxiety may rise about Gen. Soleimani’s death being avenged by a thousand cuts at the interests of the U.S. and its allies. This may involve resumed attacks on oil tankers and other low hanging but high value economic targets, particularly in the oil sector. Global oil prices have already seen a 4% rise within hours of the incident due to the “fear premium”; unless de-escalated, jittery commodity speculators may spin out of control.

The urge for a riposte runs deep in the Iranian psyche. The U.S. has a global presence but that also brings in vulnerabilities. All that can be safely predicted is that the situation remains highly unpredictable.

Potential fallout, on India

India has already had considerable difficulties in meandering through the obstacle course created by the U.S.-Iran cold war. While we need to be on the right side of the U.S., our ties with Iran, apart from being “civilisational”, have their own geostrategic logic. Now that the conflict has turned hot, its adverse impact on India could magnify. Apart from a rise in our oil import bill and difficulties in supplies, the safety of an estimated eight million expatriates in the Gulf may be affected. Iran has the capacity to influence the U.S.-Taliban peace process in Afghanistan, a neighbouring country. Last but not the least, after Iran, India has perhaps the largest number of the world’s Shia population and the possibility of some of them being radicalised by this event cannot be ruled out. It can be argued that had the U.S. not invaded Iraq in 2003 creating the mother of all chaos, Qassem Soleimani and his Qods Force would have largely remained a sideshow in Lebanon. So his targeted assassination yesterday completes the circle.

346,2020/01/04,An act of war: On U.S. killing of Iran commander,"Friday’s assassination of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Qods Force for over two decades, in Baghdad, is a reckless and unilateral act of provocation by the U.S. that could trigger another full-scale war in West Asia. The strike against Mr. Soleimani and several Iraqi Shia militia members when they were leaving the airport, was apparently in retaliation for the storming of the American Embassy in Baghdad by protesters earlier this week. Mr. Soleimani, who had a unique celebrity status among Iran’s military leaders, was highly popular among the hardliners. He was reportedly very close to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who once called him a “living martyr of the revolution”. Mr. Soleimani was also the main architect of Iran’s recent foreign operations, mainly in Syria and Iraq, which were crucial in saving the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and defeating the Islamic State (IS) in both countries. It was under his leadership that Iran founded and trained Shia militias and despatched them to the battlefields of both Syria and Iraq. The militias fought alongside Kurdish paramilitaries and the Iraqi Army, with air support from the U.S. Air Force, against the IS in northern Iraq, from Amirli to Mosul. Ironically, the same soldier who helped the U.S. and the Iraqi government defeat the IS has been assassinated inside Iraq by the Americans.

This was a crisis foretold by many, and U.S. President Donald Trump is squarely responsible for where U.S.-Iran ties stand today. He single-handedly destroyed the détente between the two nations established by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by unilaterally pulling the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018 and reimposing sanctions on Iran. By sabotaging the fragile peace painstakingly negotiated over years between world powers, Mr. Trump, in a single act, pushed both the U.S. and Iran down a dangerous slope. Now, with the assassination of Soleimani, Mr. Trump has escalated the crisis to the levels not seen in the past; not even during the siege in 1979 of the American Embassy in Tehran by the revolutionaries. It might help an impeached President in an election year to divert attention from his domestic woes and mobilise political support, but for a region already struggling to cope with multiple armed conflicts and external interventions, it could be dangerously consequential. The attack has already killed off even the possibility of renegotiating the nuclear deal. Iran might see this as an act of war like any sovereign country would do. A full-scale war with Iran would be totally different from the wars the U.S. has fought in West Asia in recent years. It could trigger multiple attacks across the region, destabilising it further, cause heavy casualties and help the jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda and the IS regroup and re-emerge. It is unfortunate that the U.S., which is struggling to get out of Afghanistan after 18 years of war, which destroyed the Iraqi state 17 years ago, turning parts of the country into fertile ground for jihadists, is triggering another conflict in the Muslim world.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-act-of-war/article30473006.ece
347,2020/01/04,Missing the wood: On anti-CAA resolution in Kerala Assembly,"The Kerala Assembly’s resolution calling upon the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, reflects the widespread unease and disquiet the legislation has caused. Rather than treat it as a controversy over the question whether a State Assembly is competent to question the law on a matter under the Union government’s domain, the Centre should reflect on the core issue: that the CAA may be in violation of the equality norm and secular principles enshrined in the Constitution. Given how deeply the country is divided on the changes in the law, Kerala’s example may set the stage for a wider confrontation between the Centre and States that have expressed their disinclination to give effect to the Centre’s policy in this regard. The resolution reflects a legitimate concern that in enacting the CAA, the Centre has written a patently discriminatory norm into the law. There is justified opposition across India on the amendment’s implications, especially in combination with the expected follow-up action in the form of establishing a citizenship register. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is among several CMs who have spoken out against the CAA’s discriminatory nature, but his has been the first regime to adopt a formal resolution for repeal. The Centre must make an effort to understand the underpinnings of the ongoing protests against its amendments, of which the Kerala resolution is surely a part.

Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan have denounced the adoption of such a resolution, the former arguing that all States had a constitutional duty to implement central laws. However, the principal objection — that citizenship being a matter concerning the Union, it is not open to State Assemblies to give their opinion on it — is not valid. To the extent that a State government believes that a parliamentary law is not constitutional, it is entirely in order for the State legislature to call for its repeal. Further, a resolution is not legislation, and is not governed by the principle of legislative competence. It is only an expression of a political opinion. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has passed several resolutions concerning India’s foreign policy — such as asking for a war crimes probe against Sri Lanka and even a referendum on ‘Tamil Eelam’. There is a technical problem on the resolution’s admissibility. Kerala Assembly rules say matters pending before a court or those that do not concern the State should not be admitted in the form of a resolution. However, these are minor issues. Ultimately, the House Speaker decides on admitting a resolution, and it is an internal matter. Voicing support for the CAA and disapproval of Kerala’s resolution are also valid political opinions, but these should not translate into any ill-advised action such as hauling up the Chief Minister before the Privileges Committee of Parliament.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missing-the-wood/article30472985.ece

349,2020/01/04,Police organise night marathon for residents of Vidyaranyapura,"More than 300 residents of Vidyaranyapura have made a New Year resolution to join the beat police on their night patrols.

In an effort to boost community policing, the Vidyaranyapura police had organised a night marathon last Saturday from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. where residents walked or ran in groups in the neighbourhood after which they gathered at the police station.

Hundreds of men, women and children attended the event. “Inspector L. Praveen Kumar gave a talk on how people can contribute, and over 300 people pledged to be part of the night patrol team as volunteers,” said a police officer.

Ramesh Kumar, a private firm employee, said, “ It is a great initiative as were introduced to the beat police and met senior officials who participated in the event.”

Participants who expressed their willingness were divided into groups comprising men and women. Each group has been assigned a beat police officer, who will form a WhatsApp group for communication purposes.

One of they key problems that residents and the police are hoping to address is the rise in instances of drag racing and youth performing stunts on motorcycles in the dead of the night. Hours after the groups were formed, residents started posting photos and videos of bikers performing stunts like wheelies.

The traffic police, who are also part of the initiative, have promised that action will be taken against the culprits.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-organise-night-marathon-for-residents-of-vidyaranyapura/article30480820.ece
350,2020/01/04,Residents up in arms against burning of plastic on Vrishabhavathi riverbed,"Bengaluru's polluted water bodies have been in the news in recent years though the spotlight has mainly been on lakes, especially Bellandur and Varthur, after high levels of pollution caused the lakes to spew froth and fire. But the city's only river – the Vrishabhavathi – has been under constant threat from pollutants, raw sewage and other effluents.

People living near the river have now alleged that plastic is being burnt on the riverbed on a large scale, and debris is being dumped into the river, leading to water and air pollution.

Narahari Rao, who lives in a housing complex close to the river in Kambipura, said the burning of plastic has been taking place barely 10 feet away from the river. ""It has been one year since it started. But it has increased in recent times. It has become a burning issue for us here as the smoke has been suffocating us and causing allergic reactions. And this is happening in the buffer zone,"" he said.

Sreenandan A.V., another resident, said not only has the quantum of plastic being burnt increased, the river is being encroached upon by dumping debris and concrete.

Residents allege that large quantities of plastic is brought in trucks to private land across the housing complex on the other side of the river at night. Though the burning allegedly takes place at night, the smell of smoke is evident near the complex.

According to another resident, Amrit Pandurangi, electrical components are also being burnt to separate the metal components. “Not only is this whole act dangerous and polluting, it is also illegal,” he pointed out.

Residents have reached out to the Kumbalgodu panchayat and police, both of whom have assured action.

Kumbalgodu panchayat president Chikkaraju told The Hindu that he had received a representation from the residents. ""They gave a representation this week when I was out of town. I will definitely visit the spot on Monday and put an end to the activity,"" he said.

Earlier, researchers from Ashoka Trust for the Environment and Ecology (ATREE) had conducted a year-long study involving monthly 24-hour sampling, and found that illegal discharge was being done from industries at night. Researchers found big peaks in heavy metal levels between midnight and early morning.

Probing the nature, sources and impact of waste water-based irrigation in the Vrishabhavathi valley, they had collected water samples from three villages downstream of Byramangala tank, and found that contamination, particularly of heavy metals such as nickel, copper, chromium, lead and manganese, had seeped into the soil, groundwater as well as milk and vegetables.

They had revealed how this was a risk to the local population as well as people who would ultimately consume the food.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mpp8n8/article30480794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/residents-up-in-arms-against-burning-of-plastic-on-vrishabhavathi-river-bed/article30480795.ece
351,2020/01/04,BBMP to fast-track work on signal-free corridor on Old Airport Road,"In what will come as a relief to motorists, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is set to fast-track work on the ₹109.5-crore signal-free corridor on the busy Old Airport Road, which has been mired in land acquisition problems since August 2018.

As part of the 17.5-km signal-free corridor from Vellara Junction to Hope Farm Junction, three underpasses were planned at Wind Tunnel Road Junction, Suranjan Das Road Junction and Kundalahalli Junction.

On Friday, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar met representatives of National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to sort out issues related to land acquisition for the underpass at Wind Tunnel Road Junction. Work on the underpass began in August 2018 after the required land was handed over to the BBMP by the two agencies.

However, according to senior BBMP officials who attended the meeting, work was halted as ISRO had requested that the service road on either side be six metres wide for easy access to their campus and for ease of commute. As per the original design, the BBMP had factored in service road of 3.5-metre width. The BBMP is now trying to see if the width of the service roads can be increased as per ISRO's request.

“Several deadlines have long passed. Work on the underpasses has either stopped or is progressing at a slow pace. We will review the work periodically to fast-track the project,” an official said.

Work on Suranjan Das Road Junction started in April 2019.

Construction of the underpass at Kundalahalli Junction was stopped due to issues with land acquisition. BBMP officials are trying to solve the issues. The civic body needs to acquire 23 properties.

“We have held preliminary meetings with the land owners. We will soon arrive at a consensus on compensation to be paid to them,” an official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fip0hi/article30480401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGOLDAIRPORTROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-fast-track-work-on-signal-free-corridor-on-old-airport-road/article30480403.ece
352,2020/01/04,"Camps to add, delete, alter names of voters get under way","Special camps for verification of voter details were organised in all polling stations of Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet districts on Saturday. Similar camps will be held today and on January 11 and 12. The move follows a directive from the State Election Commission.

The camps are intended to help those on electoral rolls verify their names and get errors rectified. It is also an exercise in including names not on the list.

Vellore District Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram said, “Public cooperation will ensure the election department prepares an error-free electoral roll.”

EPIC not enough

“Mere possession of Electoral Photo Identity Card does not guarantee franchise. The EPIC holders should ensure that their name is on the electoral roll,” said an official from the Election Department.

Ranipet Collector S. Divyadarshini visited the polling stations at Panchayat Union Middle School, V.C. Mottur in Walajah block and Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Walajahpet.

Voters whose names have been left out may submit Form 6, seeking inclusion, to the designated officer on that day of the camps.

Claims for inclusion

Copies of residence/age proof, passport size colour photo and EPIC, if available, are to be adduced in support of the claim for inclusion.

For deletion of names, Form 7 is to be submitted. For corrections, Form 8, and for change of address within the same assembly constituency, Form 8-A, has to be submitted.

NRIs must submit Form 6-A to the designated officer at the polling station, taluk office or revenue divisional office for inclusion of their names on the electoral rolls.

Besides, applications for corrections and transpositions can also be filed at the special camps, Election Department officials at Ranipet said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gd1lhy/article30481221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04VELLOREVOTERENROLMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/camps-to-add-delete-alter-names-of-voters-get-under-way/article30481222.ece

354,2020/01/04,Unauthorised parking disrupts traffic at Greams Road intersection,"The neatly-laid footpath and the pothole-free carriageway on Greams Road seem to be benefitting neither the motorists nor the pedestrians. The stretch, especially near its intersection with Pantheon Road, Moores Road and College Road along the Cooum river, has become an unauthorised parking lot. Cabs and autorickshaws are parked here through the day and night.

Hundreds of commuters use Greams Road in a day. The intersection provides access to many other stretches.

“Cab and autorickshaw drivers are taking advantage of the wide road and lower volume of vehicular traffic on Greams Road,” says B. Sundar, a motorist from Thousand Lights.

Motorists point out that lack of surveillance and absence of traffic police personnel at Greams Road intersection has worsened the problem of unauthorised parking.

At present, traffic policemen are present at Casa Major Road and Pantheon Road intersection. After the relocation of the Police Commissioner’s office to Poonamallee High Road in Vepery in 2013, traffic regulation on Greams Road has taken a back seat.

“Street lights along the stretch are not properly maintained. Branches of overgrown trees are snapping cables often. The stretch going towards Thousand Lights is damaged and does not have adequate safety in terms of reflectors and warning boards to prevent rash driving,” says another motorist.

Traffic violations including wrong-way driving are also common on the stretch. “Steps will be taken to prevent unauthorised parking with the help of local police,” said a Corporation official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/urj24g/article30478734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GREAMSROADPARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unauthorised-parking-disrupts-traffic-at-greams-road-intersection/article30478735.ece
355,2020/01/04,Traffic congestion near Gemini flyover,"Two-way traffic arrangement may have eased traffic flow on Anna Salai to a great extent, except for a small stretch. The area between Gemini flyover and Anand theatre bus stop is where much of the chaos is witnessed during rush hour. This section of Anna Salai is relatively narrow, and it will stay that way.

Highways officials said that the two newly-reconstructed pedestrian subways, which are yet to open, between Thousand Lights and Anand theatre will make things easier for pedestrians and also address the problem faced by motorists to some extent — however, this is possible only if pedestrians use the subways and don’t cross the stretch abruptly.

At present, people do not have specified pedestrian crossings near the ramp of Gemini flyover and in front of the Thousand Lights mosque.

They cross as and when the traffic slows down. During rush hour, a traffic police personnel is seen in front of the Thousand Lights mosque to help pedestrians cross the stretch safely.

“Due to the presence of key institutions, widening of this section of the road is tricky as security of these institutions is crucial,” says a State Highways official.

Motorists especially those using light vehicles can take a ‘U’ turn at Anand theatre bus stop as against the old traffic system where vehicles can take right turn opposite Thousand Lights mosque to reach Peter’s Road in Royapettah.

The new traffic arrangement has been in place for the last few years to facilitate metro rail work and to ease traffic at Gemini flyover and the U.S. Consulate. As a result, motorists, especially motorcyclists wait at the Anand theatre traffic point to take a ‘U’ turn with other motorists that proceed straight, having to negotiate through the narrow carriageway that is available to them. Currently, a lone traffic police personnel is deployed to regulate motorists in taking the ‘U’ turn there.

Pedestrians have to cross the stretch at their own risk.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cfjjza/article30478687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GEMINIFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/traffic-congestion-near-gemini-flyover/article30478688.ece
356,2020/01/04,Residents’ request to WRD,"The residents of Kolathur Village, have made a request to the Water Resources Department to re-construct the

sluice gate and the weir at the sprawling ‘Kolathur Eri’.

The sluice gate and the weir were damaged during cyclone ‘Vardah’ in the year 2016.

If re-constructed, the weir will be able to store rainwater, which in turn will recharge the ground water level,

and increase the storage capacity of the water-body.

During the ‘copious’ rains received this year, the ‘Eri’ reached full capacity, and the water flowed through the

broken weir to Bay of Bengal, residents say.

Similarly, if steps are taken to re-construct the sluice gate, water can be stored and can be released when the

lake or pond overflows. Besides, the shutter of the sluice gate can be opened to release water when needed for

irrigation purposes, residents added. Sluice gate controls water levels, and in times of flood, the gates are

opened to safeguard the bunds of the lake from getting breached, residents added.

The water-body receives rain water from Kayar Forest near Mambakkam. This time, due to broken weir and

sluice gate, the surplus water from the forests wasn’t stored in the eri. The rain water flowed into the sea. As a

result, the farmers have to depend on ground water for agricultural purposes. Similarly, steps should be taken

to de-silt and deepen the water-body and form bunds, residents pointed out.

“ We have been giving representations in this regard for the past three years. But, till date, no action has been

taken.”

A WRD official assured to inspect the lake and do the needful at the earliest.

357,2020/01/04,Intersection of Anna Salai and General Patters Road turned into unauthorised parking spot,"A few months after it was made two-way route, this section of Anna Salai, especially between Tarapore Towers and erstwhile Anand theatre, is fighting for it space. This battle is intense at its intersection with Thiru-Vi-Ka High Road, earlier known as General Patters Road, in Royapettah.

The struggle is against rows of vehicles including cars and two-wheelers were parked along the stretch towards Thousand Lights blocking the free flow of vehicular traffic on the stretch.

This stretch was restored as two-way route in 2019, after the operation of Metro Rail stations along the stretch.

“During rush hour, especially in the evenings, and during weekends, many vehicles mainly cars and two-wheelers, can be seen parked along the widened carriageway blocking movement of motorists,” says S. Naveen Kumar, a motorist from Royapettah.

Motorists say that visitors to commercial establishments who park their vehicles at the intersection of the stretch with Thiru-Vi-Ka High Road, are essentially taking the advantage of the one-way traffic change that is in place for the Thiru-Vi-Ka High Road as the stretch witness lower traffic movement due to the traffic change, effected a few months ago along with the restoration of two-way traffic on Anna Salai.

Such one-way traffic on Thiru-Vi-Ka High Road has left the stretch with more road space making it convenient for unauthorised parking at the intersection and also along the stretch of Anna Salai opposite Tarapore Towers.

Motorists say the traffic police and the State Highways, which maintains Anna Salai, should prevent such illegal parking along the stretch especially at the intersection.

“Steps will be taken to check such illegal parking near the intersection soon,” say traffic police sources.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1wpij8/article30478630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05DCNOPARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/intersection-of-anna-salai-and-general-patters-road-turned-into-unauthorised-parking-spot/article30478631.ece
358,2020/01/04,From town criers of Old Madras to village assistants of Smart Chennai,"On Velachery Main Road, in Selaiyur, the office of village administrative officer is set on a parcel of land roughly measuring 10 cents. On its premises, right outside the office, there are two makeshift “concrete benches” whose significance is hard to guess.

Oral history has it that these “concrete benches” were once “concrete pillars”. Along with a pair of clamps, these pillars had once served a singular purpose.

Stray cattle that had walked roughshod over paddy fields in the village would be impounded, and kept tied to these pillars.

The village head would instruct one of the three town criers to take care of the cattle by providing them with feed and water spending out of his own pocket, till the owner of the cattle paid the required fine to the village head, and also reimbursed the town crier for the expenses he took on himself to keep the cattle adequately cared-for.

This is said to have been a practice followed well over a hundred years ago. Since then, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge, and there is no need to have people beating the drums and raising a clangour to make announcements. Public announcement systems fixed on a moving vehicle serve the purpose very well.

Symbols of change

And, in a sense, these pillars serve as symbols of change, one that has altered the role of the town-criers.

The pillars are now used as seating arrangement. Across Tamil Nadu, erstwhile town criers have long been re-designated as village assistants.

While their portfolio would have become wider, they however continue to perform the duty of a making public announcements, but in an entirely different manner.

“Even now, a few old time residents in the village inform us (village assistants) about the day-to-day developments in the neighbourhood,” says 50-year-old D. Ravi, the village assistant of Selaiyur revenue village, one of the 24 revenue villages under Tambaram taluk in Chengalpattu district, which was bifurcated from Kancheepuram district recently.

In the past, town criers, would be among the first, beyond the family circle, to know of any birth, death, marriage, missing of people, thefts and fire breakouts. They would also get to know about the establishment of new shops or public buildings in the village. They would be the eyes and ears of the government at the village level.

Interactions continue

As village assistants, they continue to have a bird's eye view of what is happening in the locality and this means they interact closely with residents. Most of the village assistants are local residents, living in the neighbourhood for generations.

The village assistant, D. Ravi, is from Selaiyur village. His father, S. Dharman, was one of the town criers in the village for more than three decades.

Bridging the gap

During British times, town-criers are said to have been used more extensively for announcement of government orders and schemes to the public. They would also have to communicate day-to-day developments in the village to officials. In that sense, they would be the bridge between residents and officials.

Proclamations, local by-laws and market days would also all proclaimed by the town crier with a drum to draw their attention.

In Tamil Nadu, the role of a town crier had been changing over the years, from a key public announcer to a ceremonial crier at annual grievances meeting, called Jamapanthi at the district level.

The functions

In pre-Independent India, every village in Tamil Nadu would have a minimum of three town criers. They would have a common title “Thalaiyadi” (village headsman). However, each of the three town criers would be tasked with a specific function.

One function was related irrigating farm lands, with the town-crier’s job involving maintaining the waterbodies in the village and releasing water from check dams for cultivation, after getting the nod from his higher-ups in the village.

He was responsible for any leakage and theft of water from the waterbodies in the village.

Another function had to do with small construction work assigned by the village heads, ensuring the upkeep of drains, an informing the higher-ups about the day-to-day happenings in the village.

The third important function was that of supervising the work being carried out by the other town criers.

Reduced numbers

Over the years, the roles of town criers have changed, their numbers have reduced. During the 1980s, from three town criers, the number was reduced to one in many villages.

In 1995, they were re-designated as village assistants.

Changing titles

The names of town criers have changed from “Thalaiyadi”, to “Grama Kavalan”, to “Village Writer” and finally “Village Assistant”.

For many decades, since the times of the British, the title and office of the town crier was conferred on people on hereditary basis, as a family member is expected to have learnt the nuances of the job from their forbears.

However, after re-designation as village assistants, direct recruitment through competitive examinations is being carried out. This system of recruitment is in place for many years now.

Despite better communication facilities, the role of a town crier is still essential at least at the level of field staff, as it helps the government machinery establish a communication link with the people of a

village.

“During emergencies, we still perform the role of a town crier to alert residents about the possibility of danger. Even now, we inform residents about public grievances meetings and other government events in the village,” says M. Kannan, village assistant for Sembakkam revenue village.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mc1uau/article30478553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05dctown1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/from-town-criers-to-village-assistants/article30478554.ece
359,2020/01/04,Plea to lay new roads in Chitlapakkam,"The residents of Chitlapakkam, have made a request to the Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat to relay the roads taken up for construction of cut-and-cover drains.

The cut-and-cover drains construction works were taken up in October 2018 and was completed in September 2019 at G.D. Naidu Street, Pamban Swamigal Salai, Maraimalai Adigal Street, Bharathi Street and Chokkanathan Street.

“Following the completion of construction of cut-and-cover drains, tenders were floated by the town panchayat to lay the roads in November. The due date for the tender was November 22. But, till date, the work on relaying the stretches hasn’t started,” says K. Dayanand, president, Pradeep and Karthik Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association.

To add to the woes of the residents, the ramps in front of most houses were demolished to match the gradient of the cut-and-cover drain. As a result, the height of the houses has increased above four feet than the ramps. People are not able to bring their two and four-wheelers and park them. The residents have put ladders and ramps as a temporary measure outside their homes.

The surface of Pamban Swamigal Street has become slushy and slippery.

360,2020/01/04,Dangerous short-cuts,"Motorcylcists pass through open plots near the Porur toll-plaza on Chennai Bypass Road, to beat the traffic and head to Samayapuram Main Road. By taking this short-cut, they skipping a congested right-turn on the Chennai Bypass Road. When motorists speed through these vacant plots, they often take motorists already driving down Samayapuram Main Road by surprise.

Residents say this violation is rampant during the evening rush-hour and it has been causing a lot of traffic chaos. They say there has been a spike in accidents in recent times. Samayapuram Main Road connects Chennai Bypass Road and Mount - Poonamallee Main Road, and therefore witnesses heavy traffic. “Samayapuram Main Road is not well-lit. Hence, we hardly notice these motorcyclists coming through the vacant plots,” says S.

The stretch comes under the jurisdiction of National Highways Authority of India.

P. Prabhu, a resident of Urapakkam, says, “Lack of illumination facility increases the risk of accidents on these stretches. Pedestrians, especially senior citizens and the differently-abled find it difficult to cross the stretch after sunset.”

At some points, though, there are commercial establishments, hotels and petrol bunks, but the light from them is not sufficient.

Given the capacity of vehicular traffic on this stretch in the late evening hours, lack of illumination facility poses a serious threat to road safety.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lack-of-illumination-on-portions-of-gst-road-troubles-motorists/article30478456.ece
362,2020/01/04,Unauthorised parking hinders traffic movement on arterial road,"Unuathorised parking of vehicles — most noticeably, cabs, private buses and autorickshaws — on a section of Mount-Poonamallee Main Road close to the Metropolitan Transport Corporation terminus in Iyppanthangal, is hindering free traffic movement during rush hour. Mount-Poonamallee Main Road, which comes under the maintenance of the State Highways Department, has now been widened between St. Thomas Mount and Sri Ramachandra Medical College cum Hospital (SRMC), which is located in Porur.

The stretch between Iyyapanthangal and Poonamallee, which accounts for around four kilometres of the road, has not been widened due to land acquisition issues. The narrow section of the road in front of the bus terminus witnesses chaotic traffic during rush hour, and unauthorised parking further compounds the problem. Commuters complain that they find it difficult to access the bus terminus due to the unauthorised parking near the facility. “Commuters have to walk on the narrow carriageway to reach the bus terminus as vehicles occupy empty spaces along the stretch especially in the evening hours,” says K. Mahalakshmi, a commuter from Kattupakkam, a village near Iyyapanthangal.

The Iyyapanthangal bus terminus operated buses to many parts of the city, and therefore enjoys a huge patronage. With the bus terminus in Poonamallee being congested, as it also serves as the halting point for mofussil buses, MTC commuters from areas such as Kattupakkam, Moulivakkam, Mangadu, Karambakkam, Periya Kolathuvancheri, Thundalam, Porur Gardens, Rajappa Nagar and Pattur board buses from the Iyyapanthangal bus terminus every day. Besides, the facility is of great use to people visiting the Sri Ramachandra Medical College Hospital, which is located around 200 metres from the bus terminus.

“Steps will be taken soon to prevent such illegal parking on the stretch,” say police sources.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/r83pg1/article30478453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05dctngrPoonamalleRoad2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unauthorised-parking-hinders-traffic-movement-on-arterial-road/article30478455.ece
363,2020/01/04,‘Safeguard the monument’,"Rich tributes were paid to Kaj Schmidt on the occasion of his 89th death anniversary at his memorial on Elliot’s Beach on December 30.

Alby John, Deputy Commissioner, South Region, Greater Chennai Corporation, placed a wreath at the monument along with S. B. Prabhakar Rao, Honorary Vice-Consul, Royal Danish Consulate, Chennai, and founders of Spark, a civic-forum.

People, who gathered at the edifice, paid tributes by placing battery-powered lamps at the facade of the monument.

One of the city’s landmarks built by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Frederick Stanley, the Governor of Madras, from 1929 to 1934, built in memory of a gallant Dane, who drowned in the beach while trying to save four girls.

At the anniversary ceremony, members of Spark, and residential welfare associations urged Alby John to take steps to protect the structure by deploying a security guard and illuminate the structure with white lights.

Recently, an anti-social element, climbed on the top of the structure and threatened to jump from the monument. It is said that he has damaged the top portion of the structure.

The top portion of the structure has been damaged. Moreover, the steel fences barricading around the structure have been damaged and corroded. Youngsters have scribbled on the walls of the structure. The Greater Chennai Corporation claims to have deployed a security guard. But, there is no security guard deployed at the monument. It is a common sight to see even children trying to climb the gate and the fences and gain entry into the memorial in broad daylight, members of Spark, and residential welfare associations, complained.

The monument has lost its dignity due to illumination of colour lights around the heritage structure.

Replying, Alby John, said, “ Steps will be taken to deploy a security guard and apply non-corrosive paint for steel fences.”

Residents say CCTV cameras should be put and warning messages should be displayed to prevent people from gaining entry into the monument.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/safeguard-the-monument/article30478397.ece
364,2020/01/04,Safety in focus on Surapet Main Road,"Surapet Main Road, opposite Puzhal lake, is getting a new safety feature — median. This section of the arterial road is extremely busy, partly because an Ayyapan temple there draws many devotees. The lack of safety features on the road is evident. To ensure the safety of pedestrians including devotees, a three-feet-tall concrete median is being built between the police check post and Bharat Petroleum pump.

Hundreds of motorists including drivers of container lorries and goods-laden vehicles use Surapet Main Road, which connects CTH Road at Ambattur with GNT Road in Puzhal, to reach the city and neighbouring districts like Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram.

The ongoing flyover work at Retteri has made Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N) Main Road chaotic especially during rush hour, therefore motorists from the city’s western outskirts find it convenient to use Surapet Main Road.

“This section of the road, especially near the temple, witnesses continuous flow of vehicles as devotees from other parts of the city and outskirts make a visit.

The new median will ensure safety of all road users including motorists,” says K. Sakthi, a motorist from Puzhal.

The Surapet and Puzhal stretch do not have adequate safety features including LED street lights, speed breakers, reflectors at narrow bends and barricades. At many points towards Puzhal, especially near the Metro Water pumping station, the stretch has stagnant rainwater after every downpour.

As container lorrries pass through the stretch between Surapet and Puzhal to reach the Chennai Bypass elevated highway and GNT Road, a medium was long needed.

“The new median on the stretch will be completed in the next few weeks,” says a State Highways Official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eydn0b/article30478176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05dcangrsurapetJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/safety-in-focus-on-surapet-main-road/article30478177.ece
365,2020/01/04,"Lamp at key junction in Ambattur ‘hides’ traffic signal, say motorists","The newly-installed high mast lamp at the intersection of Chennai – Tiruvallur High Road and Third Main Road in Ambattur Industrial Estate has not brought on a glow on the faces of some motorists.

They point out that the high-mast lamp has been positioned in a manner that blocks the view of the traffic signal located on the carriageway towards Madhavaram via the Chennai Bypass elevated highway. To get a clear view of the traffic signal, motorists have to crane their necks and this may not be helping the cause of safety on the road.

A Corporation official says that due to the lack of sufficient road space the high-mast lamp was installed a few metres before the traffic signal. It was placed in such a way that it did not come in the way of motorists navigating the junction. But, this arrangement seems to have ended up preventing motorists from having a clear view of the traffic signal. Often, some motorists can be seen waiting even after the green light comes on.

Among the major intersections, Telephone Exchange junction is the first to get a high-mast lamp, which has five pairs of LED lights.

“The new high mast lamp should have been positioned correctly to ensure it did not affect motorists’ view of the traffic signal,” says R. Suriyakumar, a motorist from Nolambur. This is a busy junction, marked by the movement of residents from surrounding areas on their way to various other parts in the city.

Besides, goods-laden lorries pass through the junction on their way to the industrial units in Ambattur, Pattaravakkam, Korattur, Mannurpet, Athipet and Ayyapakkam.

366,2020/01/04,Australian students come to Chennai for training in AI,"Fifteen students from Deakin University, Australia, have travelled all the way to Chennai for a short-term internship program on Artifial Intelligence (AI) in cyber-security, offered by K7 Academy, a division of K7 Computing. Deakin University, a public university in Australia has partnered with VIT, Chennai for a global exchange programme on AI in cyber-security.

Artificial Intelligence in cyber-security is an emerging technology that supports the detecting of threats and other potentially malicious activities. AI can rapidly analyse swathes of situations and behaviours to spot threat needles that correspond to malicious activity.

“Cyber-security is an emerging technology that opens up varied avenues for jobs in IT/ITES industries. We have been offering internship programs on cyber-security across various colleges in the country,” said K. Purushothaman, CEO of K7 Computing.

367,2020/01/04,Inside Chennai’s newest craze: drone racing,"﻿At the football ground of IIT Madras, the calmness of a pleasant Saturday morning is interrupted by the buzzing of small-sized drones that criss-cross the skies like insects, with some reaching a speed of more than 150 kilometres per hour..

The drones, operated by pilots, are made to pass through hurdles or ‘gates’ of different sizes designed, installed on the ground, for the drone racing event organised as part of IIT Madras’s annual technology festival, Shaastra.

The racing event, organised in the format of First Person View (FPV) drone racing, is a sport that is catching on fast in India, says Karan A. Kamdar, founder and president of the Indian Drone Racing League that is organising the racing at IIT Madras.

“We have around 2000 drone pilots registered across the country. We organise racing at almost all IITs and National Institutes of Technology. It is not just students, but drone enthusiasts and hobbyists as young as 12-year-olds are our participants,” he adds.

K. Ragul, a Masters student from Sri Krishna College of Technology in Coimbatore, says he has been participating in the event for two years now. “The design of the drone and skill of the pilot are equally important in this competition,” he says.

In this format of racing, the pilots do not navigate by looking at the drones, but instead wear eye-gear that feeds the visual from the camera mounted on the drone. “What we get is a view similar to that of a pilot from the cockpit. We navigate based on that,” he adds.

J. Janarthanan, an engineering graduate and a drone enthusiast, who also teaches drone design, says that what matters in terms of design is the weight and ability for quick manoeuvrability. “We buy components and assemble our own drones. You can fine-tune a lot of parameters in terms of speed and its ability to turn and tilt. We try to make it as lightweight as possible,” he adds.

Stating that these drones can reach a maximum speed of even 180-200 kilometres per hour, Ragul says that such drones are now being used to capture high-speed car and bike racing events.

Janarthanan says that high power batteries are used to achieve the speed. “Other drones used for certain utilities like food delivery or photography are heavy, but the basic design concepts are the same,” he says.

P. Jeevith, a student from IIT Madras and coordinator of the racing event, says that this was the first time drone racing was organised as a competition in the campus. “Previously, we had organised a show with professional drone pilots,” he said.

Mr. Karan says that night drone racing is also becoming popular as a show. “With colourful LED bulbs attached and with the kind of manoeuvring they do, the event is visually appealing. The previous event we organised in IIT Madras was one such event,” he adds

He says that China, North Korea, and Australia are some of the countries where drone racing is organised in a big way. “We have pilots who are participating in events in these countries,” he says.

In terms of regulation, he says that the drones used in the racing fall under micro (less than 500 grams) and nano (less than 250 grams) categories. “We do not need permission for these categories. For micro category, we just need to inform the police, which we do,” he adds.

“This is not an expensive sport. Interested persons can start building a good drone for around ₹10,000. However, there are people who spend amounts as high as ₹3 lakh,” he says.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/57avj8/article30477538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04JANTH-Dronejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/inside-chennais-newest-craze-drone-racing/article30477539.ece

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha rejected the petition filed by P.A. Joseph who contended that the web series should not be allowed during local body polls like how a Hindi movie on Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not allowed to be released by Election Commission of India during parliamentary elections last year.

However, the judges rejected his contention on the ground that the action taken by ECI would not apply to the facts of the present case where the web serial could be viewed only after downloading a particular mobile app. Further, the makers of the web series had carried a disclaimer that it was not a biopic.

Even otherwise, the web serial may not affect the voting pattern since people do not always vote purely on the basis of political affiliation but also on the basis of the capability of the candidate concerned. “It cannot be said that voters will exercise their franchise purely on the basis of a political personality who is no more,” the judges added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-dismisses-case-against-web-series-queen/article30474357.ece

Over 40 different breeds, including boxers, labrador retrievers, great danes and rottweilers, participated at The Madras Canine Club’s 132nd and 133rd All Breed National Championship Dog Show and Obedience Trials.

“We received over 504 entries this year,” S. Siddhartha, Secretary of The Madras Canine Club, said.

Police dogs too

According to him, over the last few years, the number of dogs participating in the show has increased and many new breeds have started coming in. Dogs belonging to the police department and RPF took part in the obedience trials. “We received 38 entries from police and RPF,” Mr. Siddhartha said. The Madras Canine Club’s Obedience Trials were judged by J. Rangarajan, who is one of the founder members of The Madras Canine Club. He has been a member of the Kennel Club of India for close to three decades.

The main objective of the show is to improve the quality and breeding of pedigree dogs and popularise some of the fast vanishing breeds, especially Indian breeds like the Rajapalayam, Combai, Chippiparai and Caravan Hound, among others. Jaisimha K.B., who has been attending these shows for over two decades, said that this is one of the best platforms for pets to socialise. “Otherwise your pet is always at home and the only outing that they go for is a walk.

As many as a dozen stalls had been devoted to defence expo. Students had a glimpse of some of the equipment used by the armed forces such as granade and missile launchers, rifles and radars.

There was a miniature version of the Brahmos missile which attracted much attention. A start up incubated at the institute’s research park has developed a drone that could be used by the armed forces.“It is a drone that uses GPS location to force other drones that are not allowed to be in the area to either land or move,” explained Vasu Gupta, an aerospace engineer manning the stall that displayed a model.

Apart from Indian Armed forces and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) companies such as Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems Ltd. (TASL) have put up stalls.

372,2020/01/04,Doctors mimic brain signals to spinal cord; help boy get back on his feet,"Ten-year-old Eric’s never-say-no attitude has surprised his doctors. Suffering a spinal cord injury that left him a paraplegic, the boy is now on an extensive road to recovery. Thanks to doctors who attempted to mimic brain’s signals to the spinal cord through Stimulation Movement Overground (STIMO).

Hailing from Tuvalu, a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean, Eric took a 20-hour journey across 10,000 km to Chennai last June. He suffered paralysis of the lower half of the body following a fall in February 2019. As a result of the injury to his spinal cord, he developed bladder and bowel incontinence.

At MIOT International, spine surgeons and neuro specialists examined him. “MRI scans showed that he suffered a fracture in D5 of the vertebral column with spinal cord compression. This interrupted signals from the brain to the lower part of his body. We took up his case in the neuro science board and came up with a decision to implant a neuro prosthetic bridge, a treatment called STIMO,” Shankar Balakrishnan, interventional neurologist told reporters on Friday.

STIMO combines three stages of treatment — epidural electrical implantation, neuro modulation and weight-suspended gait training. A small chip with 16 electrodes was surgically placed in the spinal cord below the site of injury. It is connected to a chargeable battery placed in the lower back region under the skin. The battery sends electrical signs to awaken the dormant spinal tissue through a process called epidural stimulation.

Stage two involves activating muscles with the help of technologies such as Electromyography that aids in confirming the accuracy of stimulation. Neurologists with the help of neuro modulation specialists map the electrodes, exploring combinations to obtain different stages of refinement that are mandatory to regain his skills. This is followed by systematic and intensive physiotherapy, he explained.

The results were not immediate, said doctors. “Here, we are trying to create a spinal brain. We are stimulating the spinal cord, moulding it in such a way that it turns into the brain,” P. Sathya, neuro intensivist, said.

“He can now walk on a parallel bar. His legs can make walking-like and cycling movements. It will take a year and a half for him to gain complete movement with training. In the process, he will also gain bowel and bladder control,” Dr. Balakrishnan added. Doctors claimed this was the first successful STIMO in the State.

As he trains for four to five hours a day, Eric cherishes his new-found love for Tamil. While he shyly sings a few lines from actor Dhanush’s “Po nee po” song, he says “Baahubali” before making every leg movement.

In the afternoon, many men and women from Muslim community gathered in large numbers in the Ice House area on Dr. Besant Road junction. It was organised by the Chennai Jamath Federation. Leaders of Muslim organisations and political parties took part in the agitation and expressed their solidarity with them.

While slogans of ‘Allahu Akbar’ rent the air, protesters also demanded that the Modi government withdraw the controversial law and desist from pursuing its divisive agenda. They also said they would not allow the division of people on communal lines.

Participating in the agitation, DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran said that the AIADMK government had betrayed Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils living in the country by supporting Modi Government to enact the controversial CAA. PMK too had indulged in doublespeak in this issue, he added. Mr. Maran said his party would continue to fight until the controversial law is withdrawn.

K.Amanullah Khan, organiser of Chennai Jamath Federation said, “The CAA, NRC, NPR are against the basic principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and secular fabric of the country. We passed resolutions demanding to withdraw all of those immediately, besides condemning the BJP government for bringing them.”

They also demanded that the AIADMK government pass a resolution in the State Assembly like Kerala against CAA.

374,2020/01/04,Cancer Institute organises memorial oration,"Cancer Institute (WIA) in collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University is organising the ‘Dr. S. Krishnamurthi Centenary Memorial Oration’ on Saturday.

According to a press release, the Cancer Institute was one of the few comprehensive cancer care centres in India. It has been a pioneer in many areas of cancer care and control.

The concept of population screening through the Kancheepuram Cancer Control Project was one of the visions of the institute under the leadership of Dr. Krishnamurthi. Sponsored by the World Health Organisation and initiated by the Cancer Institute, it had to be handed over to the Government of Tamil Nadu as the institute was a NGO in 1968.

Under the leadership of Dr. Krishnamurthi, the institute got the approval from the Medical Council of India recognising oncology as a speciality. In an effort that lasted for nearly 10 years, the institute got the final approval in 1984. The first super speciality college of oncologic sciences came into existence at the institute in 1984, and the first batch of specialists came out in 1986.

Realising the importance of indigenous technology and that technology and equipment should not be permanently imported, the institute designed the first Tele Caesium Unit in 1962. This was followed by the development of a treatment simulator in 1969 and designing of a brachytherapy unit for cervical cancer in 1990, the release said.

375,2020/01/04,"Plea to remove Governor not maintainable, says High Court","The Madras High Court on Friday held as not maintainable a public interest litigation petition seeking a direction to the Centre to remove Governor Banwarilal Purohit for not taking a decision on State Cabinet’s September 2018 recommendation to release all seven convicts involved in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha dismissed the petition filed by M. Kannadasan of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, on the ground that a court of law was not empowered to issue such a direction when the Constitution states that a Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.

The judges pointed out that Article 156 lays down the term of office of Governor. The provision states that a Governor would hold office during the pleasure of the President or until he/she resigns his post though the tenure as such for those holding the constitutional post would be for five years or until a successor enters the office. The Bench recorded that the PIL petitioner had insisted upon the removal of the Governor on grounds of arbitrariness, mala fide and partisan attitude, on the issue of releasing the seven convicts, “for the reason that he was a member of a particular political party [before assuming office] and a sympathiser of an organisation.”

The judges recalled the Supreme Court verdict in the B.P. Singhal versus Union of India (2010) said: “A Governor is neither an employee nor an agent of the Union Government... Like the President, Governors are expected to be apolitical, discharging purely constitutional functions, irrespective of their earlier political background.

“Governors cannot be politically active. Reputed elder statesmen, able administrators and eminent personalities with maturity and experience are expected to be appointed as Governors. While some of them may come from a political background, once they are appointed as Governors, they owe their allegiance and loyalty to the Constitution and not to any political party.”

The apex court went on to state: “A Governor cannot be removed on the ground that he is out of sync with the policies and ideologies of the Union Government or the party in power at the Centre. Governors need not be in sync with the policies of the Union Government. They are not required to subscribe to the ideology of the party in power at the Centre.”

In the same judgment, it was also held that judicial review of withdrawal of pleasure was limited in the case of a Governor and that only when a prima facie case of arbitrariness of mala fide was made out, could the court require the Centre to produce materials to satisfy itself that the withdrawal of pleasure was for good and compelling reasons.

Further, when S. Nalini, one of the seven convicts, filed a writ petition in the High Court last year seeking a direction to the Governor to accept the Cabinet recommendation and order her release from prison, a Division Bench of Justices R. Subbiah and C. Saravanan had held that no such direction could be issued to the Governor.

That Bench had held that Article 361 of the Constitution insulates the Governor from being questioned or made answerable before any court with respect to discharge of his duties. Therefore, the present plea seeking a direction to the Centre to remove Mr. Purohit from office could not be entertained, the Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-remove-governor-not-maintainable-says-high-court/article30474283.ece
376,2020/01/04,"Police chief fabricating stories, says activist","Social Activist Gayatri Khandhadai, who was one among those that spearheaded the ‘kolam’ protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Tamil Nadu, said Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan had ‘casually released her personal details’ to the media.

She said that he had compromised her privacy and safety. “He brought me to a vulnerable situation. I hold him personally responsible for my safety and security,” Ms. Gayatri

Strong rebuttal

Strongly refuting the police’s allegation that she was arrested because she drew anti-CAA Kolams (road art) in front of an elderly person’s house, Ms. Gayatri asked, “The police had reached the spot of the protest even before I was there. They had spoken to me the day before on December 28 as well. Then, how is it possible that they came to the spot because of a complaint?” Senior lawyer Sudha Ramalingam said the First Information Report did not make any mention of said incident.

Advocate Mohan said, “The 92-year-old resident opposing the protest does not exist in FIR registered on December 29.”

Human rights activism

Speaking about the recent press conference where references were made to the “possible links between activist Gayatri and Pakistan”, she said, “I had gone as an activist from India along with other activists in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. I had spoken about setting up a Commission through SAARC to protect human rights in the South Asian region. What’s wrong with this?”

This left doubts over whether matriculation schools will function on Saturday. Sources in the DSE said postponement was due to counting of votes of rural local body elections getting extended in many districts. “Infrastructural arrangements made in schools for counting have to be removed, which cannot be done overnight.

378,2020/01/04,T.S. Sridhar alias Bharanitharan passes away,"Cartoonist, playwright and traveller T.S. Sridhar alias Bharanitharan alias Marina passed away at his house in T. Nagar on Friday evening. He was 94 and was a bachelor. The multifaceted personality T.S. Sridhar was born to scholar T.N. Seshachalam and Rukmini on Christmas day in 1925. After his graduation in commerce, he found a calling in cartooning.

V.S. Srinivasan, alias VSV, his nephew and a writer, recalls how he initially started with cartoons under the name Cheeli and then started drawing as Sridhar in Swadesamithran. “He used to write travelogues and religious articles under the pen name Bharanitharan and he wrote dramas, steeped in humour, as Marina,” he says.

In 1956, he joined Ananda Vikatan and retired in 1986 as the journal's joint editor. “He was a very joyful person, but became serious when drawing cartoons. He was a very ardent devotee of Mahaperiyava of the Kanchi Mutt. He also had a troupe called Rasika Ranga. His plays were staged by the Kalanilayam troupe,” adds Mr. Srinivasan.

Cartoonist Keshav recalled how Mr. Sridhar brought him into the cartooning field. “I joined Ananda Vikatan in 1983 and he used to send me to the Music Academy to do music sketches. He was my source of encouragement for political cartoons,” says Mr. Keshav who recalls Mr. Sridhar as a good teacher. He adds that Mr. Sridhar was also very sharp in his observation. He had the knack of reading between lines. He would always catch hold of something a person would miss ordinarily,” adds Mr. Keshav.

Stage actor and television personality T.V. Varadharajen described him as a great playwright and a very humble person. “He was our guru. He taught us how to create family drama sans vulgarity. Seeing his drama, the audience would feel that they are sitting in their own house,” he explains. He recalls how he called him for a meeting in 2005 to discuss how to revive drama troupes.

After visiting many pilgrimage spots, Mr. Sridhar shared his experience through his articles in Ananda Vikatan, serialised as ‘Aalaya Darisanam.’ As many as 246 holy spots of Tamil Nadu were discussed elaborately.

He was was honoured with Kalaimamani in 1993. Mr. Sridhar was active until a few months ago. He is survived by his youngest brother T S Gopalakrishnan.

379,2020/01/04,Dowry harassment: panel advises police to arrest accused,"The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has ‘advised’ the Thanjavur police to arrest a man wanted in a dowry harassment case and produce him in the trial court.

The accused, Mahesh of Mannachanallur in Tiruchi district, was evading police action by staying in Singapore.

The case arises out of a complaint lodged by L. Nandhini with the All Women Police in Pattukottai accusing her husband and others of harassing her for want of dowry.

When no action seemed to be taken against Mahesh, the woman filed a petition under Section 6(1) of the Right to Information Act seeking copies of the police report on her complaint, immigration report that her husband had not visited India etc.

Not satisfied with the reply of the Public Information Officer/Additional Superintendent of Police, Thanjavur district, the petitioner filed an appeal before the First Appellate Authority and got no convincing response. She even wrote to the Chief Minister’s Cell seeking its intervention for relief. Ms. Nandhini moved the Tamil Nadu Information Commission seeking a direction to the public authority to share information sought by her.

No evidence

When called for his explanation, Additional Superintendent of Police S. Ravichandran appeared before the State Information Commissioner R. Dakshinamurthy and submitted the details of action taken so far. He said that the petition was referred to the District Social Welfare Officer, who conducted an enquiry and found no prima facie evidence of any dowry harassment.

However, the All Women Police registered a First Information Report against four persons on charges of dowry harassment and criminal intimidation.

They were produced in a court and released on bail. The police filed a chargesheet against the accused persons on completion of investigation and the case was pending trial. No action could be taken against Mahesh since he was living abroad and had not visited India after the complaint against him. No report was obtained from the immigration authorities or the Ministry of External Affairs on the travel details of the accused.

Passing orders, Mr. Dakshinamurthy directed the Public Information Officer to provide copies of the final investigation report, copy of the District Social Welfare Officer’s findings in the case, chargesheet etc., to the petitioner under the provisions of the Act.

380,2020/01/04,‘Coexistence of obesity and undernutrition a challenge’,"The increasing coexistence of overweight and obesity along with undernutrition, called the double burden of malnutrition (DBM), was becoming a major challenge for low and middle income countries (LMIC), said Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organisation.

Delivering the Dr C. Gopalan Memorial Lecture at M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation here on Friday, she suggested taxing high fat, high sugar and high salt products as a measure to address the issue.

“It is a sensitive issue as it affects industrial and commercial (interests) in a big way,” she said, adding that strong political will and commitment were needed to implement this.

Countries like Mexico and the United Kingdom, which levied such taxes, had shown reduction in instances of heart diseases and overweight, she said.

She expressed the hope that the ‘traffic light labelling’ for food products proposed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India would get implemented soon despite opposition. The labelling would classify products into red, yellow and green with red indicating foods that are not particularly good for health.

Highlighting the recent findings on DBM published in The Lancet titled ‘The New Nutrition Reality,’ Dr. Soumya said of the 126 LMIC, 38% faced DBM. Countries in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were particularly affected, she pointed out.

Dr. Soumya said just as the burden of undernutrition was coming down slowly with around 150 million stunted children in the world as of now, cases of overweight and obesity were increasing significantly with 2.3 billion overweight children and adults.

She cited exposure to ultra-processed foods, reduced physical activity and urbanisation as some of the contributing factors to overweight and obesity among children and adolescents, which can lead to non-communicable diseases in adulthood. Arguing for coherent policies to tackle both undernutrition and overweight simultaneously as outlined in the ‘Double duty action on Nutrition’ policy of WHO, she said.

Strengthening of data collection on nutrition, decentralised planning, awareness creation and push towards consumption of diverse diets were some of the needed measures, she said.

Lack of data

Importantly, with the closure of National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB), India lacked comprehensive data on nutrition consumption by families. She said that even the available data was kept in silos by different ministries and departments.

Pointing out that the Comprehensive National Nutritional Survey released last year showed disparity between different States in tackling undernutrition, she said that it stressed the need for decentralisation of policies at State and sub-State levels.

She said that States like Tamil Nadu, which had addressed undernutrition to a reasonable extent, must reassess its public distribution system to find ways of tackling overweight.

M.S. Swaminathan, founder, MSSRF, recalled the pioneering work done by late Dr. Gopalan on nutrition research and how he advocated biofortification of food to address deficiency of micronutrients when the concept was unfamiliar across the globe.

381,2020/01/04,"In 3 months, extraction of groundwater will be monitored","To assess variations in the city’s water table and the extent of extraction, Chennai Metrowater will soon launch a project for real-time online monitoring of the groundwater levels.

The agency will sink borewells at 200 locations across the city and monitor changes in the water table. Officials said borewells will be sunk according to soil conditions and digital water level recorders will be fitted. This will help Metrowater observe the levels at fortnightly and monthly intervals.

“It will help us to assess the level in different locations immediately after the rain and the level of extraction during and after monsoon. The observations will be uploaded on the Metrowater website for consumers to check the water table in their area,” said an official.

Metrowater engineers will also be able to plan drinking water distribution in accordance with the water table in a particular ward. If the level is low in a particular area, engineers may increase water supply accordingly. Similarly, audit of groundwater extraction in each ward and rainwater harvesting will also be done. The data will help in assessing the need for recharge and level of exploitation in an area and help check excessive pumping of water, officials said. Tenders have been called and the project may to be launched in three months.

Level up

On an average, city’s water table was at 4.38 m in December. The level has increased marginally compared to November, when it stood at 4.52 m. At present, the agency manually collates monthly data on water levels and quality through 145 shallow observation wells. Real-time monitoring of groundwater is one of the many schemes planned this year. The agency plans to map water supply and sewerage network on GIS platform. The ₹5.99-cr. project aims to gather information on maintenance of the network immediately and strengthen basic infrastructure for future needs. This year, plans are afoot to provide a water supply network to 12 added areas, including Mugalivakkam, Pallikaranai, Manali, Perungudi, Chinnasekkadu and Kottivakkam.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tukaco/article30474250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th04groundwater-levelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-3-months-extraction-of-groundwater-will-be-monitored/article30474251.ece
382,2020/01/04,HC calls for report on sanitary conditions at children’s hospital,"The Madras High Court on Friday called for a status report from the Director of the Institute of Child Health and the Hospital for Children in Egmore on the sanitary conditions prevailing inside as well as outside the hospital building.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by activist K. Amanullah Khan of Royapettah complaining about unhygienic conditions prevailing outside the hospital.

During the course of hearing, the senior judge in the Bench told the petitioner’s counsel that the condition inside the building might not be very different from what was prevailing outside and called for a report from the director by February 27.

In his affidavit, the petitioner stated that ICH was a very reputed institution which caters to the needs of not only the residents of Chennai but also those from other districts. He said, the institute provides affordable healthcare to the poor at State cost.

“It is needless to state that any hospital should be neat and clean. Not only its interiors but also the locality around the hospital premises should be maintained hygienically. Ironically, the surroundings around ICH is unhygienic,” he claimed.

The petitioner claimed that the Corporation had placed garbage bins right at the entrance to the hospital leading to severe stench in the hospital. Those bins were also acting as a breeding place for mosquitoes.

Not just the patients but also the pedestrians using the pavement adjoining the hospital campus as well as motorists were put to hardship due to the garbage bins having been placed at the entrance, his affidavit read.

Claiming to have made a representation to the hospital director as well as the Greater Chennai Corporation in this regard on November 25, the petitioner sought for a direction to the officials concerned to remove the garbage bins forthwith and maintain the hospital in a hygienic condition.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2iirzc/article30474141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THCHILDRENHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-calls-for-report-on-sanitary-conditions-at-childrens-hospital/article30474143.ece

385,2020/01/04,Defying the legalisation of the unjustifiable,"Widespread protests against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, 2019, have severely dented the image of the Narendra Modi government. Trying to repair the damage while pushing ahead with their divisive agenda, the regime’s spokespersons have repeatedly asserted that the recently approved National Population Register (NPR) is not new, not related to the NRC, and not something to worry about. Only the first of these three claims is partially true, and only in a literal sense.

A powerful instrument

It is indeed true that the NPR is envisioned in the Citizenship Act of 1955, and that it was revived by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government when it amended the citizenship Act and rules in 2003. It is also true that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) first implemented it in 2010 along with the 2011 Census. However, to say that there is nothing new about the NPR in today’s transformed context is to speak in bad faith. The addition of unnecessary intrusive questions — on the place and date of birth of each parent, place of last residence, and Aadhaar, PAN (Permanent Account Number), driving licence, voter card and mobile phone numbers – makes it far more potent as an instrument of surveillance and harassment. Add the statements linking it to the NRC made in the recent past by representatives of the present government, and it is obvious why, unlike its first incarnation, the 2020 avatar of the NPR is being seen as a rudra or terrifying avatar.

Violation of norms

Modern governance requires states to collect two broad kinds of data based on individuation and aggregation. Individuating data provides information on specific individuals, while aggregating data profiles groups or collectivities. Group-oriented data also begins with particular persons, but aggregation masks or “anonymises” them, thus yielding information only on collectivities such as illiterate persons or tax payers. Individual-oriented data is also pooled and consolidated, but the specific persons it covers remain identifiable. Norms of good governance dictate that the scope of individuating data be restricted, and that, on the other hand, databases with universal or wide coverage be confined to aggregated data that cannot identify individuals. The government’s relentless effort to push for maximum individuation along with maximum coverage violates and reverses established norms regulating the collection of social statistics.

The probable consequences of this reversal are illustrated by the contrary example of the Indian census, where the assurance of anonymity balances the coercive legal force of the state. The Census Act, 1948 requires all persons residing on Indian territory to truthfully answer the schedules canvassed by the enumerators of the Census of India — failure to do so is punishable with a fine. However, most Indians may not be aware that Section 11 of the same Act imposes even higher penalties on officials who falsify or disclose census data – they may also be jailed for three years. In fact, unpublished census data cannot be accessed by government departments, and Section 15 of the Census Act exempts it from the Indian Evidence Act so that it cannot be used in courts of law.

Weakening of anonymity

To appreciate the full significance of this commitment to anonymity, consider the fact that the 2011 Census revealed that, between 2007 and 2011, 74 lakh Indians were married below the legal age of 18. Under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, those responsible are liable to be fined up to ₹1 lakh and/or imprisoned for up to two years. And yet the Census data cannot be used to identify them — it can only tell us, at best, that the incidence of under-age marriages is the highest in districts like Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. In sharp contrast, the NPR, and especially the NRC offer no anonymity while collecting actionable personal data, but nevertheless impose coercive, census-like universal coverage.

To be sure, states do need to collect individuating data, which is usually justified by invoking national security or the efficient targeting of welfare benefits. We also know that throughout history, states have collected information on groups such as criminals or political rivals. However, such exercises are of limited scope; they do not compulsorily include the entire population. They also have internal safeguards and/or offer clear benefits for respondents. It is noteworthy that the NPR and the NRC include none of these features. Actually, the NPR is nothing like the Census – it is only logistical efficiency that makes the former use the proven field machinery of the latter. It is also a logically, practically and politically necessary precondition for the NRC, without which it is pointless.

Faith in the state

Ultimately, the key question is that of the people’s faith in the state. In ex-colonies such as India that have won their independence through a freedom struggle, the post-colonial state gains a priceless inheritance of popular trust. After all, most people are unaware of the safeguards for anonymity built into the census; and yet they freely provide information because they trust the government. It is this trust that the present government seems determined to squander.

What is all this for? Imagine that the NPR-NRC exercise has been completed successfully, and has identified ‘x’ lakh “non-citizens”. What then? The only “plan” the government seems to have is to convert these ‘x’lakh self-supporting persons, who have presumably contributed to their local economies, into permanent inmates of detention centres and eternal wards of the state. Since such a plan clearly makes no sense as policy, we have to turn to alternative explanations.

As Kautilya, Machiavelli and Foucault remind us in their various ways, the point of the law is to exercise power. Laws are not necessarily meant to abolish whatever they render illegal; they are meant to trap particular subjects and practices in zones of illegality where they will be most susceptible to power. Graded or hierarchical citizenship has been unjustifiable in our republic, though it has been integral to our social practice. The NPR-NRC and CAA initiatives seem designed to coerce us into legalising the unjustifiable and normalising indefensible prejudices.

And once the forces behind these initiatives have tasted victory, why will they stop? For there is no end to prejudices in our hierarchy-saturated culture.

But the nation-wide protests tell us that the story is far from finished. They remind those who think they are our rulers of two crucial truths. First, that civil liberties and democratic rights are defined by the inconvenient fact that they must also be granted to those whom we may fear, hate or despise. And second, that the most rudra of rudraavatars are a people who have lost faith in their state.

386,2020/01/04,Deaths in Kota,"The deaths of infants in Rajasthan’s Kota is been the matter of great concern. That more than 100 infants have died in a period of less than a week is a great jerk not only for the parents but also for entire country. This is similar to the Gorakhpur deaths in 2017, where many children died after oxygen supply ran out. The Ashok Gehlot government has claimed that deaths are due to reasons like winter and premature birth. Such irresponsible statements are truly condemnable. The Congress government must initiate an inquiry and bring normalcy. Congress leaders must handle the Kota issue first, before joining the anti-CAA protesters.

387,2020/01/04,Defecting to return,"One tends to agree with the observations by former Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi that defector MLAs, who leave their parties high and dry and throw in their lot with other parties, should cop a ban of at least six years before they are allowed to contest elections again. (Editorial page, “Where defection is a mere detour for an MLA,” Jan. 3). The ugly spectacle in Karnataka, which witnessed the resignation of as many as 17 MLAs, that led to the collapse of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government in the State is a case in point where their disqualification by the Speaker did not cost them much as the court allowed them to re-contest elections. Eleven of them are now back as MLAs after they contested on a BJP ticket and won from the constituencies which they had represented earlier and are in contention for Cabinet berths as well. A six-year ban from contesting elections may serve as a deterrent to such unprincipled politicians whose sole aim is to further their careers by opting for greener pastures, caring a fig for party loyalty or for ideology.

388,2020/01/04,The hegemony endures,"Events such as negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan, muted reaction to Iran’s provocations and Turkey’s invasion of eastern Syria’s Kurdish held regions are not due to the U.S.’s declining ability but due to conscious policy path taken by the President Donald Trump (Editorial page, “In the ruins of unilateralism,” January 3). As Mr. Trump came to power by promising to recall/withdraw American forces fighting wars abroad, he is unwilling to risk sending more forces for any new wars and is also pushing for a quicker withdrawal from Afghanistan. Though the phenomenal rise of China and signs of a comeback of Russia are a reality, the strength of the U.S. to shape the global politics remains as potent as ever as it is still the world’s mightiest military power. In spite of the flip-flops of Mr. Trump on the foreign policy front, the U.S. remains the only global power that has overarching influence over the global politics. China is still far away from reaching that position of influence and Russia is still farther away. It is true that “hegemony of a single power is temporary”, but as of now the end of this hegemony is neither imminent nor in sight.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

Hyderabad

True, the Taliban has been a difficult negotiating partner, Iran is becoming more reckless by the day and Turkey is causing tensions within NATO. But these are not reasons enough to predict the end of American hegemony. The U.S. still wields enormous clout and has the power to shape and influence events anywhere in the world. Unrest within NATO is not likely to cause any major fault-lines within the organisation. China poses a threat to U.S. in the economic front, but it has to go a long way before it can dream of supplanting Washington from its pre-eminent status. Any prognosis of the U.S. losing its significance is premature for at least the next two decades.

The DMK surpassed the AIADMK in rural local body elections. That it finished ahead in both panchayat unions and district panchayats was a good gauge of the M.K. Stalin-led party’s winning chances in next year’s Assembly elections. The DMK has claimed its victory as an endorsement of his leadership. The AIADMK could not capture a majority of the local bodies despite having the advantage of being the party in power. The voters’ electoral preference for DMK is attested by the fact that it did better than AIADMK even in areas considered to be the strong voter base of the ruling party. On the credit side, the AIADMK did not perform dismally in the absence of Amma. It is significant because the party has owed its existence to one unchallenged supreme leader and revolved around him or her; first MGR and then Jayalalithaa. It can also take comfort from the fact that its alignment with BJP did not turn out to be its undoing. This is not to say that the perception that the Edappadi Palaniswami government is acting as a proxy for the Modi government has not affected its image as a Dravidian party. Now that the DMK has proved that it is a party with mass support in Tamil Nadu, its opinions on issues are bound to carry greater weight at the national level.

389,2020/01/04,The Centre decides,"It is saddening that the CAA has evoked dissent and that the Opposition parties have not appealed for restraint. Providing citizenship and asylum is the prerogative of the government and there is no sign of any malice on the part of the ruling party in bringing out the law. Secularism is indeed part of the Indian Constitution. However, those who face persecution in other countries must have the right to seek refuge in the country of their ancestors’ origin. The Opposition can here rightfully demand that the rules are made public and are fair and proper. Same applies to the National Register of Citizens.

It strains public decency and logic of comity for the Prime Minister to exhort his people, especially the opponents of CAA, to carry out agitations against what he denounces as “oppressions of Pakistan against its minorities”. One cannot help but wonder whether it has become a sort of settled habit for Mr. Modi to play to the gallery by indulging himself in rhetorical flourishes at the cost of reason and forbearance, whenever analysis and objectivity don’t favour his dispensation. When a few countries and some foreign organisations sought to comment upon his government’s complete lockdown of Jammu and Kashmir, they were told off in no uncertain terms that it was an internal matter of a sovereign country. Is it acceptable, then, for our Prime Minister to speak and rouse his people in public against an issue in the neighbouring country that it is entitled to claim as its own internal matter?

It is time that our PM and his coterie stopped using Pakistan either as a bogey or a smokescreen for winning credibility. India has had enough of it. Instead, they are earnestly expected to confront and tackle the issues for the benefit of their redress and not for their accentuation. In the ongoing national discourse on CAA, our PM and Home Minister, as responsible stakeholders, are expected to address the genuine concerns of its opponents by first convincing them of their readiness to listen to them and then engaging them in plainspeak devoid of rancour and ulterior motives. Any other strategy would only exacerbate the general misgivings and fears about the government’s intentions vis-a-vis the CAA.

390,2020/01/04,Modi’s protest call,"The Prime Minister has called for protests against Pakistan’s atrocities on its minorities, ignoring that people from the largest minority community in his own country are oppressed, humiliated, jailed and even lynched on flimsy grounds (Front page, “Modi asks CAA opponents to protest against Pak. ‘atrocities’,” January 3). In a democracy, people have every right to protest, oppose and question such flawed and ill-conceived policies that affect their fundamental rights.

M.Y. Shariff,

If Pakistan has persecuted its minorities, as alleged by the Prime Minister, it certainly can be termed a crime against humanity — India need not and must not remain a mute spectator. However, it is unclear how protests in India, by those who are opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), against Islamabad will yield any tangible results. Instead, India has the option of taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), like Gambia has done against Myanmar, to expose the atrocities carried out by Pakistan.

A. Venkatasubramanian,

Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu

Mr. Modi went to Tumakuru to pay his respect at the ‘Gadduge’ (final resting place) of Shivakumara Swamiji at Siddaganga Mutt, and not to carry out his party’s outreach campaign in support of the CAA. It is unclear why the Prime Minister used the occasion, attended by thousands of students and seers of various Mutts, to make a political speech. He seems to be so much immersed in politics that he treats every forum as a platform to attack prime opponents. If the Congress Party is ‘dead’, as claimed by many of Mr. Modi’s supporters, why does the Prime Minister have to invoke its ghost so often? Moreover, those agitating against the CAA are not opposing the offer of citizenship to persecuted minorities from neighbouring nations; what they oppose is a law that has been given a religious colour by the Central government.

N. Nagarajan,

Secunderabad

It is inappropriate that Mr. Modi asked the anti-CAA protesters to raise their voice against the actions of Pakistan. The citizens of this country are concerned about the unity and secularism of India and not about the internal affairs of another country. Why should protests be carried out against Pakistan alone when minorities in other countries like Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar also face persecution?

391,2020/01/04,U.S.-Iran tensions,"The killing of Qassem Soleimani has raised the spectre of military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran. With the U.S. terming the killing a pre- emptive strike and Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowing to retaliate harshly, the stage is set for heightened tensions. The ascension of Donald Trump as the President of the U.S. saw the collapse of the much-acclaimed nuclear deal signed by his predecessor and also the imposition of fresh sanctions on Iran with an intent to usher in regime change. However, the strategy of weakening Tehran through punitive economic sanctions and force has its own limits and would hardly serve the cause of peace and stability.

Sunil Kumar Tripathi, professor and former head of department of institute of medical sciences, Banaras Hindu University, was summoned as a witness in the case as he and his team had carried out an analysis on the skeletal remains allegedly of Sheena.

Mr. Tripathi, during his deposition on Friday, told the court the digital superimposition of the photos of the skull and that of Sheena were a match based on facial landmarks, including teeth.

393,2020/01/04,More cities should make it to Swachh Survekshan top 10: CM,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray wants the maximum number of cities in the Swachh Survekshan top 10 list to be from Maharashtra, and has directed officials to come up with a detailed plan. He also wants to replicate the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) model across the State when it comes to ideas like urban forests, waste processing, hoarding policy, among others.

In the backdrop of the ongoing Swachh Survekshan, the CM held a meeting with senior bureaucrats in Mantralaya, wherein municipal commissioners and chiefs of municipal councils joined in via video conference. Minister for Urban Development Eknath Shinde and Cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray were among those who were present.

The CM wants cities from Maharashtra to work together to improve their Survekshan ranking, and directed the administration to create a detailed project report of solid waste management. He also directed the administration to create more open spaces in cities.

According to a press note shared by the CM office, Mr. Thackeray said, “Everyone is trying to improve their city’s cleanliness but all of us will have to work together to ensure maximum cities are in the first 10 ranking cities (sic) in India. Roads, footpaths, parks, hospitals should be clean.”

He directed officials to create a State-wide detailed project plan consisting of waste treatment projects and converting landfills into green patches, as also segregation at source. He said every city should have its own hoarding policy, and appreciated the Amrut Van project implemented in cities like Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Sangli, Achalpur among others. Mr. Thackeray directed that the concept be implemented across the State.

Mr. Shinde said, during the meeting, “Our cities should work so hard that they set an example for Indore.” He was referring to Indore’s consistent No. 1 rank in the Survekshan. He also laid stress on managing e-waste and biomedical waste.

“Along with clean cities, we need to focus on clean rivers,” said Aaditya Thackeray. The Urban Development, Rural Development and Environment departments need to come together to create a detailed plan for these, and efforts need to be taken to create urban forests where trees are planted using the Miyawaki technique, he said. He also stressed upon the need for a CM Urban Road Scheme along the lines of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, and a disaster relief centre in every district.

The concept of urban forests using Miyawaki technique, creation of public open spaces, waste segregation, hoarding policy, river clean-up are ideas the Shiv Sena has implemented in Mumbai over the years through the BMC.

394,2020/01/04,29-year-old from Howrah held for bar girl’s murder in Dahisar,"The Dahisar police on Thursday arrested a 29-year-old man from West Bengal in connection with the murder of a bar girl.

The 34-year-old victim used to work as a waiter at a bar and the police have withheld her identity. She was found dead at her residence in Shanti Nagar, Dahisar, at 4.30 p.m. on December 29 when her housemaid came to do her daily chores. The police had at the time registered an accidental death report.

“We went through her call records and identified one number that had been in constant touch with her for several months, including the day before her body was found. We started checking the cellular movements of this number and scanned CCTV footage. The footage showed a suspect entering the building late on the night of December 28 and leaving in the early hours of the next day,” an officer with the Dahisar police said.

The number, meanwhile, was found to be registered to one Swapan Rohidas, a native of West Bengal, who used to work in a gold jewellery manufacturing unit in Dahisar. A police team visited his residence in Howrah and brought him to Mumbai on Thursday.

Mr. Rohidas has allegedly told the police that he was a frequent visitor to the bar, and the two got into a relationship. Mr. Rohidas has a wife and two children in Howrah.

“Mr. Rohidas claims the victim had started asking him for money and was threatening to tell his family about their affair if he didn’t comply. In the early hours of December 29, Mr. Rohidas strangled her using a towel at her residence. He then made away with ₹40,000 in cash and gold jewellery worth ₹2 lakh to make her death look like a robbery gone wrong,” another officer said.

Mr. Rohidas took a flight to Howrah the same afternoon and had been staying with his family since then.

According to the Pant Nagar police, the incident occurred on Thursday evening, when the victim and her mother were shopping in the local market. The victim, with her mother’s permission, left the market to go home on her own around 7 p.m. while her mother continued shopping.

“When the victim’s mother reached home and did not find her, she came to the police station with her husband to file a complaint. However, even as she was telling us about the incident, she got a call from a relative informing her that the victim had come home. She was then called to the police station,” senior police inspector Suhas Kamble, Ghatkopar police station, said.

Pratap Thakkar’s family and the police are puzzled over his disappearance. The family has now put up a poster on the gate of the factory’s compound stating that Mr. Thakkar has been missing since the fire on December 27.

The Saki Naka police said Mr. Thakkar’s last mobile location was in the factory. They also said CCTV footage showed that he had entered the premises. “The CCTV footage does not show him coming out. But there is a back gate to the compound as well and he may have walked out through that,” Ankit Goyal, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone X, said.

Mr. Thakkar’s relatives said they are hopeful to get some positive news. “The rescue operation is over and fire brigade officials did not find him. We are hoping that he has escaped the blaze,” one relative said.

The fire, that was declared level 4 by the fire brigade, killed two people — Aarti Jaiswal (25) and Piyush Pitadia (42) — who succumbed to burn injuries and smoke inhalation. It took fire officials over 15 fire tenders and more than six hours to douse the flames.

The Saki Naka police had arrested four people from the factory in connection with the mishandling of inflammable paint substances which were stored in the factory’s godown without safety measures.

On December 9, the decomposed body of a man suspected to be in his 30s was found in bushes. While inquiring about missing people, the police learned that a couple who was staying with two children at Harigram chawl near the river had suddenly vanished.

The clothes and the finger ring on the body were identified by residents of the chawl to be of Imran Faheemuddin Khan (20), who did Plaster of Paris work.

“After the body was identified, we started working on the technical evidence. We learned that Khan hailed from Uttar Pradesh, and he was in a relationship with a married woman in his home town and had eloped with her. The 23-year-old woman, who had three daughters from her first marriage, had taken her two daughters aged one and 2.5 along with her,” Ashok Rajput, senior police inspector, Panvel taluka police station, said.

Investigations revealed that their affair had begun three years ago, and they had eloped a year ago to Hyderabad from where their families brought them home. Four months ago, they married in a court in Uttar Pradesh, and then eloped to Panvel a month later.

“After coming to Panvel, the duo started having frequent fights. Khan used to stay away from the house for work which made the woman frustrated. She contacted her first husband, Laltaprasad Pal (32), and asked to take her away from here and kill Khan,” Ravindra Gidde, assistant commissioner of police, Panvel Zone, said.

The woman threatened Mr. Pal that she would kill their two daughters and commit suicide if he did not come down to take her away. Mr. Pal had got married to the woman 10 years ago.

After Mr. Pal came to Panvel he secretly stayed near her house. On the night of December 1, the woman mixed rat poison in paratha and served Khan with an omelette.

“After he died of poisoning, Mr. Pal and his wife tied the face with a T-shirt and then with a polythene and stuffed the body in the suitcase. The river is at a walking distance from the chawl and they threw the suitcase in it and fled,” Mr. Rajput said. The duo had intended to throw the suitcase into the river but it was stuck mid-way due to which it was found on December 9.

Assistant police inspector Vijay Khedkar and sub-inspector Sunil Gurav, with the help of dump data, traced the accused to Tulsipur in Balrampur district of Uttar Pradesh, which is near the Nepal border.

398,2020/01/04,Wholesale onion prices finally drop,"The new year has brought good news for grocery shoppers with the price of onions dropping to ₹40 per kg in the wholesale market.

At the APMC market in Vashi, the best onions, priced between ₹60 and ₹80 till the end of 2019, are now available for ₹40-₹50, while the second best stock is being sold at ₹30-₹40.

However, retailers are still taking advantage of the price hike and selling onions for ₹60-₹100. “The old onions are out of stock and the ones being sold are the new produce,” said Manohar Totlani, an onion trader at the APMC market.

Around 100 vehicles laden with onions from Maharashtra and Gujarat have been arriving at the market since January 1. Mr. Totlani said, “The prices have dipped owing to increase in supply and fall in demand. People have learnt to limit their consumption of onions after the price hike.”

Raju Shelke, another onion trader, said it will take another month before prices drop to ₹15-₹20 in the wholesale market. He said, “Right now, even the export of onions has been stopped. We need to first cater to our people. Exports will resume when the price drops to ₹10-₹15.”

The onions imported from Egypt and Turkey cost ₹30-₹35 in the market.

Meanwhile, the price of garlic, which had shot up to ₹100-₹160 in the wholesale market in December, has dipped to ₹70-₹150.

Organised jointly by NGOs such as LABIA, a queer collective, and Forum Against Oppression, the rally aimed to unite marginalised communities who would face the brunt of the CAA, NRC and NPR. An Instagram post by artist Priyanka Paul, who was part of the protest, said permission was “denied at the last minute” by the Mumbai Police. She said, “The police have been systematically denying permission for rightful, democratic, peaceful protests by citizen groups. This is a direct attack at suppressing voices.”

‘Religious place’

The protesters alleged that Section 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) was invoked to deter them from holding the rally. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone V) Niyati Thaker said, “The only reason we did not let them protest at Chaityabhoomi is because it is a religious place and we never allow protests there. They then decided to shift to Shivaji Park. A notice under Section 149 was issued only to make them aware that any violation of law by them would result in legal action.”

The Joint Action Committee, which organised protests at August Kranti Maidan and Azad Maidan recently, had also accused the Mumbai Police and Commissioner of Police Sanjay Barve of sabotaging their rallies.

Later, about 300 people gathered at Shivaji Park to pay homage to social reformer Savitribai Phule on her birth anniversary and celebrate her friendship with fellow educator Fatima Sheikh.

Shweta Vaidya, another transwoman, said, “There is already much confusion regarding our existence. People need to understand that many transpeople have been abandoned by their parents and it is impossible to understand the intricacies of what the Centre wants us to do.”

Bandhuraj Lone, a former journalist and petitioner in the judge B.H. Loya death case, said, “The CAA, NRC and NPR are divisive in nature. They also divide the Hindu community. If I am asked to produce my mother’s documents, I don’t think I can. The Act displays the mindset today where authorities want to establish Brahmin supremacy.

While the incident is alleged to have occurred outside the office of the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) in Bandra on December 30, the complainant has said it originated from a dispute between her family and Mr. Satpute, on September 30.

“Mr. Satpute, who stays on the ground floor, has made a small garden in front of his house. In the society’s meeting on September 30, the option of replacing it with a park for children to play was discussed, which angered him. On November 2, when we were returning home after watching a movie, he told my husband to talk some sense to me. Shortly thereafter, he called me on my cell phone, abused me, and threatened me,” the complainant has said in her statement.

The complainant filed a complaint with the Mahim police and filed an application with the MSCW, which summoned Mr. Satpute. When he failed to appear for a hearing on December 16, he was again summoned on December 30, she said. “I was present at the hearing and on my way out, Mr. Satpute accosted me near the gate and spoke to me in filthy language, while also threatening me,” the complainant’s statement said.

The Kherwadi police booked Mr. Satpute for outraging a woman’s modesty under the Indian Penal Code. An officer with the Kherwadi police said no arrests have been made in the case so far.

Mr. Satpute was last in the limelight for helping an Uzbek woman register a first information report with the Chembur police against police inspector Bhanudas Jadhav for allegedly sexually assaulting her multiple times and also exploiting her. He later released a video of the senior police inspector of Chembur police station speaking to the complainant rudely and intimidatingly.

The protesters held placards and shouted slogans condemning Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for introducing the new citizenship law. They also lauded the courage of the students of Jamia Milia Islamia, who protested even in the face of police brutality in Delhi.

The protesters said their fight was not just to protect the interests of Muslims, but all minority communities. They lashed out at the government for engaging in divisive policies at a time when the country is facing pressing issues such as unemployment, lack of women’s safety and price rise.

Arish Kamal, one of the protesters, said, “This is just like demonetisation. This time, instead of apparently eradicating black money, the government will snatch your identity. These laws are not just against the Constitution but every Indian.”

One protester also read out lyricist Varun Grover’s viral poem, Hum Kaagaz Nahi Dikhayenge. Hargun Singh, a research scholar at Mumbai University, said, “This tyrant government is attacking India’s brotherhood. They did not choose us, we chose them. They cannot tell us what to do.” The protesters said such rallies will cause the law to be revoked and lead to the downfall of the Central government, which is driven by the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

When the king was travelling in Mumbai in 1974, a journalist asked him about the GDP of Bhutan and he responded that the GNH was more important, followed by the Constitution. GNH is the reason why we do not allow the single-minded pursuit of economic growth to destroy our environment The most important law in our Constitution is to maintain a minimum of 60% of Bhutan’s total land under forest cover at any given time. As of today, 72% of the country is under forest cover.”

Mr. Tobgay said Bhutan is now a carbon negative country because of its tropical location and small population, which is only seven lakh. He said, “Let us say that economic growth is important. But that growth must be equally distributed among the people and balanced with social progress. GNH is a holistic way of the government putting people at the centre of development and also laying emphasis on the environment.”

Meanwhile, Ms. Balan highlighted how the representation of women in Indian cinema is still skewed. She said, “The industry has female directors, writers, cinematographers and actors. However, if the protagonist of the film is a male, it will have a higher budget than a woman-centric film.”

On women she admired outside the film industry, Ms. Balan said she held writer Shakuntala Devi in high regard and described her as “the most fascinating woman I’ve known”. She said, “Everyone knows that she was a human computer. But she also wrote a book on homosexuality in the 1970s when very few people knew about the concept.”

Ms. Balan said her constant positivity came from the endless support of her family. She said, “My parents never put any pressure on me or my sister. We were just told to do our best and leave the rest to god, and that marks or performance is not a reflection of who we are.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nrzraz/article30473884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BMTECHFESTVIDYABALAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gross-national-happiness-bigger-concern-than-gross-domestic-product-former-bhutan-pm/article30473885.ece

404,2020/01/04,A Martian rover’s ‘Spirit’ed effort,"When you want to find out something, but can’t get to where the action is taking place, what’s the next best thing? You would probably entrust others with the task, asking them to report the findings to you. What if the place we want to study is way beyond anywhere human eyes have reached? We would probably have to employ rovers to get there and relay what it finds back to us.

The Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers built as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program. Also known as the Mars Exploration Rover 2 (MER 2, became MER-A), the Spirit rover was about the size of a golf cart and weighed nearly 185 kg.

Spirit goes first

Spirit and Opportunity were launched within a month of each other in 2003 and sent to opposite sides of Mars, in order to study the history of climate and water at those sites.

Spirit made its way first, launched on June 10, 2003 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. After initially being sent to an intermediary parking orbit around Earth, the spacecraft was thrust into a heliocentric orbit on a trajectory to intercept Mars. A number of course corrections later, Spirit approached Mars for landing.

Bounce, roll and stop

The lander, which was still inside a protective aeroshell, separated from the cruise stage only about 15 minutes before entering the Martian atmosphere. A parachute was deployed at an altitude of 6 to 7.5 km and four massive airbags were inflated, but as these alone would not suffice to reduce velocity (atmosphere on Mars is less than 1% the density of Earth’s), retrorockets were fired.

On January 4, 2004, the entire package hit the Martian surface at a velocity of 14 m/s. It bounced 28 times before rolling to a stop about 250 m from the point of first impact. The landing happened inside the Gusev crater, about 13.4 km away from the planned target.

Blessing in disguise

Even though Spirit’s original mission was scheduled to last only 90 Martian days – until about April 4, 2004 – mission planners were able to repeatedly extend the mission. One of the reasons for this was the passing of dust devils (strong, well-formed, short-lived whirlwinds) that swept dust from the top of the petal solar panels of Spirit, thereby increasing the power coming into the rover.

Even when Spirit faced stumbling blocks, it turned out to be to its advantage. For when its front wheel stopped working, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the non-functional wheel then scraped off the upper layer of Martian soil as the rover moved. This exposed bright silica-rich dust, an indicator of contact between soil and water.

Throughout its operating time on Mars, Spirit was able to discover a surprising variety of bedrock, churn up soil that contained more sulphur and a trace of water, unearth a patch of almost pure silica and find evidence of an ancient explosion. This, apart from the fact that the mast-mounted cameras provided never-before-seen images of our neighbouring planet and captured many movies of dust devils in action, helping us better understand wind effects on the Martian surface.

Loses contact

On May 1, 2009, Spirit got stuck in soft soil and after several attempts to get it moving failed, the mission was changed to a stationary science platform in January 2010. But after March 22, 2010, mission controllers were unable to regain contact with the rover.

Recovery efforts were officially concluded on May 25, 2011. The excessive cold is seen as the likely reason for loss of contact, as it would have made the rover’s survival heaters incapable of performing their duty. By the time it lost contact, Spirit had operated for six years, two months and 19 days, travelling 7.73 km across the Martian plains and collecting a treasure trove of data.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/sv3c54/article30401555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05istbspiritjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/a-martian-rovers-spirited-effort/article30401556.ece

The three-day endeavour, undertaken by the Forest Department in association with the Travancore Natural History Society (TNHS) a few days ago, witnessed 10 teams of experts recording the presence of 187 butterfly, 171 bird, 44 odonate, and 40 ant species in the 171 sq km sanctuary. Kattalapara, Kallar, Rockwood, Umayar Pandimotta, Alwarkuruchi, Idimuzghangan, Rosemala and Darbhakulam were the base camps selected for the survey.

Considered a haven for birds, the sanctuary witnessed the presence of the Sri Lanka bay owl, Northern pintail, Black-and-orange flycatcher, and the Green warbler for the first time, taking the number of bird species there up to 279. Among the other bird species sighted were the Great Indian Hornbill, River tern, Pratincoles and the Lesser fish eagle, considered rare.

The endemic species sighted included Blandford’s Laughingthrush, Wayanad Laughingthrust, Nilgiri wood pigeon, and Broad-tailed grassbird. While the Umayar region was found to have 117 bird species, 90 species were found in the Kattapalara region. The tally of other fauna in the region also went up — 286 butterflies, 96 odonate species and 41 ant species — following the survey. Among the butterflies, the interesting findings were the Southern Birdwing and the Oriental Grass Jewel, the largest and smallest butterfly species in the country respectively.

Lobed beak and Broad-tail Royal were additions to the butterfly fauna in Shendurney. The sanctuary is also abode to several endemic species including the Malabar Banded Swallowtail, Travancore Evening brown, Sahyadri Albatross, Banded Cats eye, Blue Nawab and Nilgiri tiger.

417,2020/01/04,Kerala to turn to Miyawaki method,"The Miyawaki method of afforestation, which has revolutionised the concept of urban afforestation by turning backyards into mini-forests, is to come up on the government office premises, residential complexes, school premises, and puramboke land.

The government intervention comes in the wake of the highly successful technique, pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, executed in the State by individuals to increase the green cover in urban and semi-urban areas.

The Forest Department is the nodal agency in the State. To take the initiative forward, each department had been asked to nominate nodal officers in the State and district levels. Even departments such as Port and Hydrographic Survey have stepped in and designated nodal officers. The departments have been asked to formally issue orders.

By promoting natural vegetation on land destroyed by natural calamities and man-induced mistakes along the coastline of Japan, Miyawaki managed to raise mini-forests. The replication of the model across Kerala, which has suffered floods, landslips and soil erosion, assumes significance with the Rebuild Kerala initiative on. The Miyawaki afforestation method has been adopted in 15 places with the support of the Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation (NGGF), an NGO. Developing each cent under the Miyawaki method is estimated to cost around ₹1 lakh.

The Forest Department has taken the first step already and has adopted the technique at Valavatti, near the Neyyar dam, in the capital, Nedumbassery in Ernakulam, and Mudikkode in Thrissur district. It is possible to grow a variety of native species in as little a space as 600 sq ft. Nature lovers have evinced interest in the model.

Initiatives

City-based nature lover M.R. Hari has converted his two-acre plot in the suburbs into a mini-forest to spearhead the initiative. It was on January 2 last year that Mr. Hari and others developed a Miyawaki forest on five cents on the Kanakakkunnu palace premises for Kerala Tourism with 426 saplings belonging to 120 species.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/xizwv0/article30481330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TVAKIRAMIYAWAKI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kerala-to-take-more-cover-under-miyawaki-forests/article30479463.ece

420,2020/01/04,Climate change in focus at meet,"Children displayed their creativity and scientific bent of mind during project presentations organised as part of 12th Children’s Biodiversity Congress at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Chala, here on Friday.

The district-level event was organised by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB) in association with the General Education Department.

Fifteen groups of children, in junior and senior categories, focussed on climate change and agro-biodiversity during their presentations. The projects were conceived by translating whatever they had learnt in class directly to the fields. Charts containing graphical and pictorial representations were used to shore up their case.

New techniques

Archa A.J. and Devika S. of St. Thomas Higher Secondary School clinched the first prize with a study on the plight of farmers in four panchayats of Palakkad district. They also presented a case study of a farmer who tries his luck on 45 acres of farmland, battling climate change. “The extra burden put on conventional farmers by climate change can be further eased by adopting new farming techniques,” they concluded.

Pragmatic ways of growing mangroves and taking up organic farming to surmount climate change was the crux of a study presented by Vijay Shankar and Swathi Satheesh of GB HSS, Pettah, who were awarded the second prize. Ali Fathima A. and Mahitha Manikandan of the same school were adjudged third in the senior group.

A study that won first prize in the junior category was on impact of climate change in places known for sesame farming in the State, such as Onattukara of Alappuzha and some parts of Kollam district. The study was conducted by M.S. Swagatha and Abhishek Ratheesh of Christ Nagar Central School.

Niranjan S. and Niya S.R. of Government HSS, Thonnakkal, came out with observations on the role of climate change in displacing some traditional tuber crops from local farms to bag the second prize.

The third prize in the junior category was bagged by Eiden Shiby and Adarsh S.M. of St. Thomas HSS, Thonnakkal.

Bindya R., lecturer, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Kerala; and Asha V.G., lecturer, Department of Zoology, M.G. College, were the judges.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/tekedo/article30473894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvtv-childrensbiodiversitycongress,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/climate-change-in-focus-at-meet/article30473895.ece
421,2020/01/04,Bicycle Brigade launched,"Mayor K. Sreekumar launched a ‘Bicycle brigade’ in the city as part of the city Corporation’s 100-day action plan at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thycaud, on Friday.

The civic body and the Indus Cycling Embassy, in association with the Haritha Keralam Mission, have launched the bicycle brigade with the objective of nurturing an eco-friendly and healthy generation of children.

The Mayor gave away cycles collected as part of a reuse programme and Bicycle Brigade citations.

V.K. Prasanth, MLA, and co-founder of the Green Army, was the chief guest. Health standing committee chairperson I.P. Binu presided.

The brigade aims at making children responsible for social and environmental protection without affecting their studies. It wants to underline that cycling is a low-cost, healthy, and environment-friendly means of travel.

‘No Burn’ campaign

With this, the Corporation has been able to promote activities in keeping with its objective of making the city the bicycle-friendly civic body in the State.

The project will be implemented in city schools as part of the Corporation’s ‘No Burn’ campaign.

In the first phase, the bicycle brigade will be piloted in Model school, Thycaud; Cotton Hill school; Karthika Tirunal school, Manacaud; Pattom Girls school; SMV school; Cordova school, and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kodunganoor. It will later be scaled up.

Besides teaching children to ride, it will make them aware of issues related to cycling such as reducing carbon footprint or depleting oil reserves so that there is a visible change in the children’s outlook and values and parents are motivated to send them to take part in the brigade activities.

The brigade will kick off its activities first at Model school.

One period a day will be dedicated to teaching 10 students at a time how to cycle. The target is to cover all the students by the end of March.

Cycle train

A cycle train is also planned, the city’s ‘bicycle mayor’ Prakash Gopinath said. Students cyling along a stretch from home to school will be joined by other students at various points. When cycling in a group, it will be possible to alert the traffic police so that signals are in their favour.

Other vehicles too will give them more consideration. In the initial period, the students will be accompanied by senior cyclists. The cycle train will first be implemented on less congested routes where maximum number of children are likely to turn up.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/jhb5ol/article30473931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvtv-bicyclebrigade,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/bicycle-brigade-launched/article30473886.ece
422,2020/01/04,Police come under withering criticism,"The City police came under withering public criticism on Friday for not yet identifying the vehicle involved in a road accident that injured a mother and child on December 28.

A car had slammed the two-wheeler driven by the mother. Her child was riding up front. The accident occurred at Gandhipuram, near Sreekaryam. The car driver attempted to extricate his vehicle and flee the scene.

However, two motorcyclists stopped him. They persuaded the driver to rush the injured family in his car to the hospital. He agreed to their demand but forced the family out of the vehicle a little away from the accident spot. A passer-by found the woman and child sitting by the roadside crying for help in blood-soaked clothes. He rushed them to the hospital.

The local police had allegedly not come to the scene of the crash or collected evidence despite several calls to various control rooms. They had also not attempted to trace the vehicle.

Reading the family’s plight in a newspaper, chairman of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission Antony Dominic registered a case on his own. He expressed dismay at the police department’s failure to hold the person responsible for the crash and the abandonment of the family accountable to the law.

Action promised

Mr. Dominic has sought a report from the Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, about the incident. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran termed the incident inhuman. He visited the family and promised prompt action.

The incident also triggered intense public criticism of the City police. Residents took to the social media in droves to point out that the police seemed keen on slapping traffic fines but uninterested in helping citizens in distress.

A police officer said a majority of the surveillance cameras in the city remained defunct, effectively blindsiding control room dispatchers and emergency responders.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/police-come-under-withering-criticism/article30473871.ece
423,2020/01/04,Revamp plan for Connemara market,"An overview meeting of the city Corporation’s Smart City project held here on Friday has decided to revamp the Connemara market in Palayam.

The project will consist of a three-floor complex and two additional floors underground for parking. Alternative arrangements will be made to temporarily rehabilitate around 500 shopkeepers during the duration of the renovation work.

Another decision in the meeting was on the proposed 100 m-long underpass at East Fort, which will be turned into a shopping area, with around 50 shops. The underpass provides easy access for pedestrians to the Chala market as well as the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, without negotiating the heavy traffic at East Fort. The Mayor directed the officials to get the clearance of the Archaeology Department for the proposed plan.

The Smart City CEO said that steps had been taken already to ensure the NOCs from Kerala Road Fund Board, Public Works Department, Kerala State Electricity Board, and Kerala Water Authority.

Housing project

The Detailed Project Report for a housing project in 2.5 acres of land at Rajaji Nagar has been prepared. The building, to be constructed at a cost of ₹55 crore, will have 250 flats.

As part of the Smart City project, a warehouse spread over 25,000 sq ft will be set up at Chala at a cost of ₹7 crore. After construction, the warehouse will be leased out to the State Warehousing Corporation.

The revised plan and estimate for a project to rehabilitate street vendors along the Museum-RKV Road was approved. The project is estimated to cost ₹2.42 crore.

An integrated command control centre will be set up at the Corporation office to streamline various government services to the public and to monitor all the other data gathered from the ground.

This will be the central point for all the information on Smart metering systems, information kiosks, smart parking, smart bus stops, and other similar things.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/revamp-plan-for-connemara-market/article30473869.ece
424,2020/01/04,No asbestos roof for places where children study: panel,"The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has said that no building, including madrasas, religious schools, and tutorials, in which children study should have an asbestos roof.

In case any such building has an asbestos roof, the Local Self-government Department should not issue licence or building number to them, and should initiate action against them under the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the Kerala Municipalities Act.

Plea to intervene

The commission’s recommendations came on a petition that called on it to intervene in the matter of a madrasa run by the president of the Madrassathul Mujahideen in Edavanna, Malappuram. The madrasa, the petition said, was functioning in a building that had an asbestos roof. No air or light entered the building. Even though the madrasa had its own building, it had been given on rent

In a report to the commission, the Edavanna panchayat secretary said the madrasa concerned functioned in two buildings, one with tiled roof and the other adjoining the first that had an asbestos roof. While the tiled-roof structure had three classrooms, the one with asbestos roof had four classrooms that functioned from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. The report said the madrasa authorities had informed them that steps were on to replace the asbestos sheet urgently.

The Urban Affairs Secretary’s report to the commission said that the president of the Madrassathul Mujahideen had informed the department that steps were being taken to remove the asbestos roof. Enough light and air entered the classrooms where the children studied, the madrasa authorities had added.

The commission order said asbestos was not conductive to the children’s health or comfortable environment in which they could study.

The High Court had ordered that asbestos should not be used for school buildings and should be replaced urgently.

It directed that the asbestos roof of the madrasa be replaced immediately. In case of any negligence in this regard, the Edavanna grama panchayat secretary should initiate immediate action against the president of the Madrassathul Mujahideen under the Panchayat Raj Act.

The commission also sought a report on the action taken within 45 days.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/no-asbestos-roof-for-places-where-children-study-panel/article30473820.ece
425,2020/01/04,No longer outsiders in their own land,"The relevance of a platform for non-resident Keralites to come together and communicate their ideas and needs with the government was the key thrust of an open forum on ‘Loka Kerala Sabha — experiences and expectation’ organised at the Legislative Assembly Complex on Friday on the sidelines of the summit.

Writer Benyamin saw the emergence of such platforms as part of a larger change in how society now views people who have migrated out of their homelands for better prospects.

Full voting rights

“In the past, such people were considered as outsiders in their native land, and as second-class citizens in the countries they worked in. Now, it is believed that their own countries have a responsibility toward these people. From being seen as mere sources of money, they are considered as individuals and as citizens. Ninety-six countries have now given non-residents full voting rights, with facilities to vote in the places where they reside. So many of those who have left this land for better prospects have ideas to share. Though some might see the LKS as utopian, this is the best platform for these people to interact with the government,” said Mr. Benyamin.

Writer Manasi said she after being part of the LKS, she now felt she had an address of her own in Kerala. “I left Kerala more than 34 years ago. Though only people who live outside the country are seen as ‘pravasis,’ even those living outside the State, like me in Mumbai, also have to face the same rootlessness. Also, there is a difference between the way the men and women experienced this, in those days. I was initially overcome with the fear of not knowing the language and of travelling alone. There was not even a woman to be seen in the literary meets of that time in Mumbai. Now, that has changed,” she said.

Filmmaker P.T. Kunju Muhammed said the non-resident Keralites, who migrated to the Middle East in the 1970s, were for long seen with contempt by society.

‘Persiakkar’ forge ahead

“We used to be known as ‘Persiakkar,’ those who migrated to Persia. Even those intellectuals whose Gulf sojourns and awards were funded by the NRKs, viewed them with contempt. But the NRKs did not let any of this affect them, and slowly worked their way to become the biggest economic force in Kerala,” he said.

Disaster management expert Muralee Thummarukudy called the LKS a unique experiment, which facilitates the communication between Malayalis anywhere in the world with the government here.

“If this becomes a success, it could become a model for the entire world. The evaluation needs to be done maybe after two decades, when the true impact of this initiative would be known. But, we need to look forward in our discussions here, by including subjects that matter in the 21st century,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/z6pr7l/article30473451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TVTVLOKAKERALASABHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/no-longer-outsiders-in-their-own-land/article30473813.ece

427,2020/01/04,Thanjavur farmers fear drop in paddy yield due to pest attack,"Anxiety has gripped farmers at Arasalankarambai hamlet in Pazhayanagaram village panchayat near Peravurani as their standing crop has suffered pest attacks.

Encouraged by water released in Grand Anaicut Canal and seasonal rain, they took up samba cultivation on a largescale, nearly after seven years.

However, their hopes of a good harvest have been jolted as the crop in some places has suffered yellow stem borer pest attack and grain fruiting disease during the past few days.

In some fields, the crops have been affected due to Gall Midge pest attack too.

In yet a few places, the crop has been hit by grain fruiting disease at a time when the ryots are gearing themselves for harvesting, causing immense stress, said Jayaraman of Anavayal near Pazhayanagaram hamlet.

“We have spent more than ₹25,000 per acre for cultivation. We can earn profit only if we harvest at least 30 bags of paddy or more. But in the current scenario, where the crop has been affected by these diseases, the yield can get reduced by six or seven bags an acre,” Mr. Jayaraman said.

The expenditure for harvesting, which may be in the range of ₹6,000 to ₹8,000, will push the overall expenditure incurred by ryots to ₹31,000 an acre or more.

Given the situation faced by farmers, most of them will be forced to sell their produce at the current market price of ₹850 to ₹900 per bag offered by traders and not to direct purchase centres of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation due to stringent moisture content level rule and other criteria.

Thus, if a farmer ends up with a harvest of 24 bags of paddy from an acre, he can get a maximum of ₹21,000, which will result in a loss, Mr. Jayaraman rued.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/jquvcj/article30483652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-THANJAVURCROP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-fear-yield-loss-due-to-pest-attack/article30479214.ece

430,2020/01/04,Smart Toilet for Tiruchi soon,"Tiruchi Corporation has roped in a Chennai-based company to set up fully automated toilets in the city. The first of many to come has been set up near the K. Abhishekapuram Zonal office, adjacent to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and will soon be thrown open to the public.

R. Sridhar, the contractor, said that the toilet would be fully automated, eliminating the need for cleaners and maintenance. “After a fixed number of users have used it, the toilet door will close, following an automated voice announcement asking other users to wait. Nozzles will spray water onto the floor and other areas. The entire process will only take 30 seconds after which users can use it again,” he said. Similar maintenance is also done for toilet seats, especially in ladies’ washroom where infections easily spread, he added.

The toilet structure is pre-fabricated and installed on site, Mr. Sridhar said. “The concrete external structure, weighing about 10 tonnes is ready-made and transported. The small fixtures are customisable and done on the location. In total, it takes 5-6 days for the toilet complex to be set up after which it is placed at the location,” he said. The design is made in such a way that it can be accommodated on platforms and footpaths, he said.

Mr. Sridhar's company is installing its first Smart Toilet in Tiruchi. The lightings at the toilet are sensor-based and switch on only when a user enters. This way, the civic body can save electricity. Addressing the common fear of theft of the fixtures, Mr. Sridhar said that if a fixture is removed by an unauthorised person, within 20 seconds, the CCTV camera fixed outside will capture photos and alert the control room. Similarly, in case of repairs, an alert will be sent to the company's service engineer and the corporation official in-charge. The cost of setting up the facility is ₹9.9 lakh. Corporation officials said that based on its utility, more unitgs wouldbe installed at other crowded locations in the city.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6n7grw/article30476960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TYCITY-SMARTTOILET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/smart-toilet-for-tiruchi-soon/article30476961.ece
431,2020/01/04,I-League | Real Kashmir grows on coach David Robertson,"For three years David Robertson has been coming to Srinagar as coach of Real Kashmir. It was like jumping into something completely “raw and unique”, he says, coming from the rarefied environs of the English and Scottish Premier Leagues.

Since that first visit in January 2017, when he almost quit and went back, the stays have only become longer to the extent of it becoming a “second home” for the Scotsman. “Everything was strange but the owners, Shamim and Sandeep, convinced me to come back and I am glad they did. From a few weeks to a couple of months to almost eight months this time, it has been increasing and now when I go back, I miss Kashmir,” Robertson said in an interaction here.

From winning the Second Division I-League to finishing third in the top flight last season, RKFC has gone from being underdog to contender in just three years. A lot of credit for that, the players feel, goes to the coach who brings a lot of positivity.

Handling turbulence

That positivity, Robertson admitted, was important when it came to handling the players during their recent outings amidst the communication clampdown. “We had just arrived in Kolkata (for Durand Cup) and weren’t sure of how the local players were going to get there. For the first time in their lives they couldn’t contact their homes. They didn’t know when they would go back and needed support. I know the Indian culture is of coaches being tough on players but I had to be different and let them know the coach had their back,” Robertson explained.

It was tough to keep the players motivated through the five months of pre-season even as the state continued to face struggles but Robertson prefers to look at the positives of the extended period of staying together on the road. “We played a lot of ISL teams — five of them — in our pre-season and it was great preparation for the season. But we were just relieved to get the first game out of the way!

Under pressure

“The game against TRAU was, in a way, the first time ever this club and players were under pressure. Even in second division, we were never the favourites to win. They are a promoted side and we have never played them before. But here we were expected to win and we did start well but then they fought back in the second half for a draw. To be honest, we thought we could lose the game but the players rallied around,” he admitted.

As for the season ahead, Robertson is only looking as far as Sunday. “With some clubs, you do pinch yourself. Like, 18 months ago you were in Second Division and now you are playing the oldest club in India, with the most history. It is an honour for them to come here. At the same time, we got to go out there and prove we are not a one-season wonder. It is not just about Kashmir any more, the whole world knows and is watching us,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/f5vvs7/article30487187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05DAVID,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/football-real-kashmir-grows-on-coach-david-robertson/article30479073.ece
432,2020/01/04,RKFC will look to cash in on home advantage,"Jammu & Kashmir is in the middle of Chillai Kalan — the 40-day period of the harshest winter that set in earlier than usual this time around. Locals call it one of the coldest Decembers in recent years with even day temperatures recording sub-zero figures.

On Sunday, Mohun Bagan would be hoping to ignore all of this, including the fact that it arrives from three home games in warm and sultry Kolkata, when it takes on host and favourite Real Kashmir FC for a shot at going top of the table.

After a pre-season lasting more than five months, RKFC had to wait till December 26 to play its first home match of the season. That was also the team’s first win for the season following two away draws and coach David Robertson admits the team is looking to get as many points from its home games as possible.

“We would like to use the home advantage as much as possible but they are a good footballing team and will be tough to stop if they get going. But we hope to get a win and go to eight points because it will only get tougher as the season goes on,” the Scotsman said on the eve of the game.

Unfamiliar territory

With almost 15 players retained from the side that finished third last season, co-ordination is one area Robertson is not worried about. What he is concerned about, though, is the unfamiliar situation of being a favourite in games this season.

“We have been doing well in the first half, attack well and take the lead but start the second half under pressure and falter, that is something we need to work on. Everyone expects us to do as well or better than the third position last year so there is that pressure for the first time for the club. But last year we had five points from four games while we have the same from three games this time so I think we are doing better,” he added.

Attacking flair

The addition of Kallum Higginbotham has added to the attacking flair of the team while the defence, marshalled by captain Loveday Enyinnaya and Muhammed Hammad needs to get tighter. With snowfall on the eve of the game and more expected on matchday, Mohun Bagan is likely to feel the chill despite an early 11.30 a.m. start.

Currently third but with an extra game played, Bagan arrived in the city a day earlier to get acclimatised. Coach Kibu Vicuna would be hoping new signing — Senegalese Papa Babacar Diawara — teams up well with the top-scorer so far —Fran Gonzalez. But he is unlikely to start the game.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bhvnjw/article30479841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th05foot,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rkfc-will-look-to-cash-in-on-home-advantage/article30478990.ece
433,2020/01/04,La Liga | Sevilla needs own-goal to draw 1-1 with Bilbao,"Sevilla needed an own-goal to salvage a 1-1 draw at home against Athletic Bilbao on Friday as the Spanish league resumed after the winter break.

Third-place Sevilla is four points behind leader Barcelona and two points behind second-place Real Madrid.

Barcelona visits last-place Espanyol on Saturday, while Madrid is at Getafe. Atlştico Madrid can pull level with Sevilla if it beats Levante, also on Saturday.

Bilbao controlled the match in Seville in the first half and went ahead in the 15th minute when right back Ander Capa received the ball on the side of the area and fired a shot under goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.

Sevilla increased the pace after halftime and got its reward when Bilbao defender Unai Nuũez deflected a low cross by Lucas Ocampos into his own net with half an hour left.

""They had one scoring chance and put it in,” Ocampos said. “We found our pace in the second half and got the draw. But we leave with a bittersweet taste since we couldn’t get the victory.”

Sevilla will not have Ocampos, its top scorer in the league with five goals, for next round’s match at Madrid after he picked up a fifth booking of the season for a foul in the second half.

Bilbao striker Iũaki Williams had to be substituted for what appeared to be a leg injury late in the match. He walked off the field.

Bilbao, which stayed in seventh place, also earned a 0-0 draw at Madrid in the previous round.

""We are playing well at the back. That is our strength and we need to keep that up,” Capa said. “The own-goal is just too bad.”

Also, Valladolid striker Enes Unal scored his second goal of a brace with 11 minutes left to earn a 2-2 draw at home against Leganşs.

Friday’s two games were the first in the Spanish league since it stopped for a winter break in late December.
