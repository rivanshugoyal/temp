0,2020/02/08,Premier Badminton League | Chan-Won duo clinches it for Raptors,"The mixed doubles pair of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won clinched the decider against Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock to help defending champion Bengaluru Raptors record a thrilling 4-3 win over Pune 7 Aces in the second semifinal of the Premier Badminton League here on Saturday.

With the scores tied 3-3, Chan and Won raised the bar to get the better of former the World championship medallists of Pune to the delight of the lustily cheering Raptors fans.

Earlier, in the first men’s doubles match of the evening, the 35-year-old Hendra Setiawan, former Olympic and World champion, and current World No. 10 Chirag Shetty gave a splendid start in what was the Trump match for Aces, outslugging Arun George and Rian Agung Saputro. In men’s singles, World No. 39 Brice Leverdez of Raptors put his team back in the hunt, warding off a spirited challenge from the 21-year-old World No. 131 Mithun Manjunath, a trainee of the Prakash Padukone Academy

The highlight of the match was the 49-stroke rally which Leverdez won in the third game when it was 6-12.

Aces then recorded the biggest upset of the day when World No. 73, Kazumasa Sakai, shocked World championship bronze medallist and Raptors skipper B. Sai Praneeth in the second men’s singles.

World No. 11 Sai Praneeth, the crowd favourite, was leading 11-8 in the first game before Sakai came back strongly with a fine blend of big smashes and solid defence to win seven points in a row. Sai Praneeth committed quite a few unforced errors and lost the momentum.

It was left to World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying to win the Trump for Raptors against the young Rituparna Das and take the contest to the decider. However, this was not before Rituparna continued her impressive show and made a fight of it.

In the final on Sunday, Raptors take on North Eastern Warriors.

The results: Bengaluru Raptors bt Pune 7 Aces 4-3 (Arun George & Rian Agung Saputro lost to Chirag Shetty & Hendra Satiawan (T) 12-15, 10-15; Brice Leverdez bt Mithun Manjunath 15-14, 9-15, 15-6; B. Sai Praneeth lost to Kazumasa Sakai 11-15, 13-15; Tai Tzu Ying (T) bt Rituparna Das 15-12, 15-12; Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won bt Chris Adcock & Gabrielle Adcock 15-13, 15-10).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/qzshn8/article30772352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09PBL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-chan-won-duo-clinches-it-for-raptors/article30772353.ece
1,2020/02/08,Cairns Cup | Koneru Humpy begins well,"Koneru Humpy opened her campaign in the Cairns Cup chess tournament with a win over American teenager Carissa Yip while World champion Ju Wenjun shared the honours in her first round game here on Saturday.

D. Harika, the other Indian in the fray, was held to a draw by Katernya Lango of Russia in 47 moves. Humpy and Dzagnide were the early leaders after posting wins in the first round.

Humpy, the reigning World rapid chess champion, was in for a surprise when the young American came up with her choice of the King’s Indian Defence. She, however, showed the value of experience by exploiting a positional error ruthlessly to win in 50 moves.

The day’s other winner was Nana Dzagnidze, who confidently beat last year’s champion Valentina Gunina after picking up a pawn on move 15.

3,2020/02/08,Senior National Squash Championships | Joshna and Saurav start again as favourites,"Joshna Chinappa and Saurav Ghosal will be the overwhelming favourites when the Senior National Squash Championships begin at the Indian Squash Academy (ISA) courts here on Sunday. The main draw begins on February 12, Wednesday, with qualification matches — which have attracted a record 402 entries — from Sunday (Feb. 9).

Thirty-three-year-old Joshna has won the women’s title a whopping 17 times and Saurav (also 33) has done it 12 times.

The multiple National champions, however, don’t want to take anything for granted and are keen to extend their vice-like grip on the Trophy. “For me, the Nationals is like any PSA tour event. I come prepared. I don’t take it for granted. Players like Tanvi Khanna and Sunayna Kuruvilla are regulars on the [World] tour and are improving,” said Joshna.

Saurav said he is focussed on doing well in Chennai. “It’s important and responsible on our part to play in the Nationals as much as possible to show the next generation what we are capable of. It is the biggest event on the domestic calendar,” he said.

Joshna’s main challenger will be Sunayna, seeded two. The 20-year-old is riding a wave, having achieved a career-high PSA World ranking of 67 this month, thanks to her stints with Ashraf El Karargui in Cairo and Malcolm Willstrop in England.

Sunayna, who reached the final of the previous Nationals in Pune, said she is not looking that far ahead. “I would love to win the Nationals. But I am taking it one match at a time.”

Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu (seeded 3/4) has been rather inconsistent after winning the coveted National title in 2014 in Mumbai. He had a back injury while playing in the semifinals of the 2018 Senior Nationals when he conceded the match to Vikram Malhotra, and he didn’t compete last year.

Now, the 30-year-old, one of the first trainees at ISA, is fighting fit and is quietly confident of taking on Saurav and Ramit Tandon (seeded two). “I am feeling good, We will see how it goes,” said Harinder.

It is a 16-player main draw with eight qualifiers each in men and women coming through.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/x871tn/article30771958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09JOSHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/senior-national-squash-championships-joshna-and-saurav-start-again-as-favourites/article30771959.ece
4,2020/02/08,Advantage Priyanka; K Priyanka on becoming a Woman International Master,"A collection of neatly arranged trophies occupy a wooden shelf at K Priyanka’s home. “I have more than 200. My father bought that shelf in 2008 after the prizes started to come in,” says the 18-year-old chess player.

Priyanka recently bagged the Woman International Master (WIM) title at the IIFL Wealth Mumbai International Chess Tournament, becoming the first person from the city to win it. She played against Mithil Ajgaonkar from Maharashtra in the competition. “He is a higher rated player than I am and it was a tough match. He played well, but I did better,” smiles Priyanka who started playing chess as an eight year old after watching her father and grandfather playing. “I would observe the game for hours. My dad taught me the rules and soon I was contesting in competitions. The first was a local championship and I came fourth.” In the next six months, Priyanka was competing in State tournaments and, in 2011, represented the country at the World Chess Championship in Brazil. “I was too young to understand its significance. But now, as I think back, I understand how big an opportunity it was,” she says.

It was not always easy. In 2012, her father passed away in an accident and that caused a gap in her playing. But, after a point, she missed the game and started to participate in championships again. “Those were dark times. It took me two years before I could bring myself to play chess again. I lost in most competitions and did not know how to handle failures. I was under a lot of pressure. It took me a while to realise that doing my best was all that mattered. This helped me get back on track,” she recalls.

Priyanka won the first norm — out of the three to win the Woman International Master title — in 2016 at the World Junior Chess Championship held at Bhubaneswar. “The second was in 2018 at the Goa Grandmaster Chess tournament. It took me three years to win the final norm. I missed it many times by minute point differences,” she says.

Being a Woman International Master gives her many privileges. She does not have to pay participation fee and also gets free accommodation at many championships, something that is of great help as she is yet to find a sponsor.

Priyanka works hard to stay in form. “I do not have a fixed schedule, but I usually practise for at least eight hours every day. I analyse games of other players and see how they plot their moves.” She trains under grandmaster Vishnu Prasanna from Chennai. “We do online sessions where he clears my doubts,” she says.

Balancing studies and chess is hard, admits Priyanka. “I am in class XII at Chinmaya Vidyalaya and it is an important year of my life. I have missed most of my classes and now I only have a month to catch up on my portions before the board exam. I plan to concentrate on my studies for the time being. I will be back in championships from April,” she says. Priyanka dreams of winning the coveted Grandmaster title. “Another dream is to be a civil servant. I know it is tough but it is also possible,” she smiles.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/8t8l47/article30769660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRIYANKA1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/k-priyanka-becomes-the-first-person-from-coimbatore-to-become-a-woman-international-master-in-chess/article30769661.ece
5,2020/02/08,"Kobe Bryant helicopter crash: engines showed no sign of ‘catastrophic internal failure’, says report","The two engines of the helicopter that crashed in hazy, cloudy weather on a California hillside last month, killing basketball great Kobe Bryant and eight others, showed no evidence of a “catastrophic internal failure,” federal investigators said on February 7.

The interim report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 12 days after the January 26 accident also said examination of both rotor assemblies found damage “consistent with powered rotation at the time of impact”.

The findings, while preliminary, pointed to no obvious signs of mechanical problems that may have contributed to the fiery crash in which Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and all seven others aboard the helicopter perished.

The death of Bryant, an 18-time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the world’s most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe.

The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the chopper were due to compete.

In one key new disclosure about the crash, the NTSB investigative update said: “viewable sections of the engines showed no evidence of an uncontained or catastrophic internal failure.”

The 11-page report did not rule out that mechanical issues might yet be identified when the engines and other parts recovered from the wreckage of the Sikorsky S-76B are disassembled and more closely examined.

Mist and clouds

NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said two days after the tragedy that clouds, fog and limited visibility reported in the vicinity of the crash would be a key focus of the investigation.

Friday’s report said videos and photographs taken by the public in the area depict fog and low clouds obscuring the hilltops around the crash site, including security video footage showing the helicopter disappearing into clouds moments before it went down.

The NTSB also quoted a witness from a mountain bike trail in foothills surrounded by mist who recounted briefly glimpsing the helicopter emerging from clouds as it rolled to the left before crashing seconds later a short distance away from him.

The pilot, an experienced aviator certified as an instructor, was navigating by visual orientation, not by instrument guidance, during the entirety of the ill-fated flight, the NTSB said.

While he was licensed to fly by instruments, the charter company that owned the chopper, Island Express Helicopters, was only permitted to fly by visual flight rules when carrying paying passengers, the report said.

Robert Clifford, a Chicago-based aviation disaster lawyer, said flying a helicopter in low visibility is ill-advised without two pilots, even if navigating by instruments.

“An experienced but nevertheless single pilot in bad weather is a bad formula for the safe operation of a helicopter,” he told Reuters.

Shortly before radar contact with Bryant’s helicopter was lost, the pilot had told air traffic control he was trying to climb above a cloud layer, the NTSB said.

Moments later the aircraft banked to the left and began to descend, slamming into the ground at more 72 kmph and bursting into flames. “The entire fuselage/cabin and both engines were subjected to a post-crash fire,” the report said.

The wreckage, strewn about an impact crater, was found in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains near the town of Calabasas, about 64 km northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The agency said the conclusions it reaches on the cause of the crash and contributing factors will be published in its final report, which is expected in 12 to 18 months.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yn9mgm/article30769400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HELICOPTERCRASHKOBEBRYANT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-engines-showed-no-sign-of-catastrophic-internal-failure-says-report/article30769401.ece

10,2020/02/08,Tata Open | Jiri Vesely claws back from the brink for a spot in the finals,"Jiri Vesely rose from the dead for the second day running, as he beat second seed Ricardas Berankis 6-7(8), 7-6(3), 7-6(7) to enter the final of the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium on Saturday.

In what will be his first tour-level summit clash in nearly five years (since Bucharest in April 2015), Vesely will play Belarus’ Egor Gerasimov who beat James Duckworth 7-6(2), 6-4. For Gerasimov it will be first-ever appearance in a final.

Vesely battled from a set and a break down but seemed down and out in the third set tie-break when Berankis had three match points at 6-3. But the Czech wiped off two by forcing his opponent into forehand errors before Berankis, so clincial at the net until then, was smitten by anxiety and met an easy volley a fraction early to put it into the net.

The Lithuanian did have a fourth opportunity to close out the contest at 7-6 but sent an inside-out forehand just wide. Vesely brought up his first matchpoint with a thunderous ace -- one of 28 he pumped -- and converted it when a Berankis backhand sailed wide.

Fighting spirit

“I am very happy with my fighting spirit,” Vesely said after the win. “I didn’t give up until the end and it paid off. He [Berankis] is a great baseliner, hits fast and flat. But I had a bit more luck today.”

From the outset, the match never settled into a proper rhythm. Berankis, sporting solid backhand, went up 3-1 only to let Vesely back. At 5-5 Vesely had a look at the Berankis serve at 0-30 but the latter raked up four points in a row, the last of which was a fine down-the-line backhand.

In the tie-break Vesely fluffed four set points, including two on his serve. Berankis’s backhand broke down at important moments but Vesely’s forehand fared worse including at 6-4, when he crashed an easy ball into the net with both his opponent and the court at his mercy. It was only apt that the set settled in Berankis’s hands following a Vesely double-fault.

In command

In the second set, Vesely’s serve was top-notch in five out of six holds as he lost just a single point. But when it wobbled, like it did in the fifth game, Berankis capitalised to break to 3-2. But the World No. 73 handed it right back, including a double fault on breakpoint, one of eight he served on the day. Vesely took the tie-break for the loss of just three points.

Like in the first two sets, the duo traded breaks early in the third before Vesely moved for the kill in the ninth game. But on breakpoint at 30-40, Berankis botched a half-volley pick up only to come up with a stunning reflex forehand at the net to clinch the point. Two forehand shanks from Vesely helped Berankis hold on and then drag the tie to another tie-break. Once there he nearly left Vesely ruing that missed opportunity but it was not meant to be his day.

The results: Singles (semifinals): Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Ricardas Berankis 6-7(8), 7-6(3), 7-6(7); Egor Gerasimov (Blr) bt James Duckworth (Aus) 7-6(2), 6-4.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/yndi0c/article30772302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09GERASIMOV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tata-open-jiri-vesely-claws-back-from-the-brink-for-a-spot-in-the-finals/article30772286.ece
11,2020/02/08,Federer tops Nadal in South Africa,"Roger Federer wasn’t going to lose this one to Rafael Nadal.

Not on what felt like a homecoming for Federer, who beat his great rival 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in an exhibition match at a soccer stadium here on Friday.

It was Federer’s first match in his mother’s country of birth, and the country Federer rates as his second home.

Almost everything was for Federer on the night. The caps and T-shirts with RF logos all across the crowd. The coin for the toss, a newly-minted 20 Swiss Francs with Federer’s image on it. Federer recently became the first living Swiss to be engraved on one of the nation’s coins.

Even South Africa’s biggest sports stars were in awe. Siya Kolisi, South Africa’s rugby World Cup-winning captain, came out pre-match to present Federer with a South Africa team jersey with Federer’s name on the back.

He was asked who he was supporting. “Definitely Team Roger,” Kolisi said. “Sorry, Nadal, I love you, too.”

Nadal smiled graciously on the other side of the net.

The exhibition at Cape Town Stadium was to raise money for the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports early childhood education in six southern African countries, including South Africa. The foundation was hoping to top $1 million from the exhibition. It raised $3.5 million.

Also, a crowd of 51,954 came to the Cape Town Stadium — built for the 2010 soccer World Cup — to watch Federer and Nadal turn it on. That’s the biggest crowd ever on record for a tennis match. Organisers said the demand for tickets was in the region of 200,000 requests.

“It was a magical evening,” Federer said.

The 38-year-old Federer, winner of a record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, and the 33-year-old Nadal, with 19 Slams, laughed and joked regularly between points.

But they were typically competitive when the ball was in play.

Federer won the first point with a high backhand volley, and broke in the first game on the way to taking the opening set 6-4.

Nadal broke back twice at the start of the second set and unleashed his big forehand winners, grunting loudly in the process, to level at one-set-all.

Federer won with a dainty drop shot on match point. Nadal gave everything to get there, and was going so fast he couldn’t stop in time and had to leap over the net.

“We tried our best as always,” Nadal said. “It’s a lifetime experience playing in front of such an amazing crowd in an amazing stadium. It was a big pleasure for me to be part of it.”

Ultimately, the match showed off the real friendship that lies beneath the fierce rivalry that began when Federer and Nadal played each other for the first time on tour at the Miami Open 16 years ago.

Federer also revealed that on the day of the exhibition, Nadal told him for the first time that he secretly cried for joy when Federer finally won the French Open in 2009.

Federer pulled in a couple of big-name friends alongside Nadal to help out on the night — Bill Gates and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah. Before the main match, Federer and Gates teamed up to beat Nadal and Noah 6-3.

Microsoft co-founder Gates played one pinpoint lob volley that the announcer described as “the billionaire’s touch.”

Comedian Noah did plenty of good-natured trash talking. He shares a similar heritage to Federer. Both have Swiss fathers and South African mothers.

“Roger’s at a disadvantage. We’re both half-Swiss, half-South African, so I’m in his head. I know what he’s going to do,” Noah, who wore a pink shirt and black headband to match partner Nadal, said before the doubles match.

Nadal has a 14-10 advantage over Federer in finals, leads 10-4 in their meetings at Grand Slams, and 24-16 in their career matches. Five years younger, the Spaniard may well go past Federer’s record of 20 Grand Slams.

“I hope I can still play for a bit longer,” Federer said. “We’ll see how much more. But there’s still lots to look forward to. In my dreams, I never dreamed this far. I hoped to win just one Wimbledon. If he (Nadal) catches me, it’s OK.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/mropgm/article30771827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09FEDEX,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/federer-tops-nadal-in-south-africa/article30771828.ece

Ankita, who had completed a doubles last week, could not enter the singles this week as she was scheduled to compete in the Fed Cup in Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan, which subsequently got postponed owing to the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Third win with Schoofs

This is the 18th career doubles title for the 27-year-old Ankita in the professional circuit, and the third with Schoofs.

The two had won their first title in Belgium in 2017.

13,2020/02/08,"Federer, Nadal play to record crowd in Cape Town","Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal attracted what organisers said was a world record crowd for a tennis match when they played an exhibition event in the Cape Town Stadium on Friday.

The organisers said an audited attendance of 51,954 beat the 42,517 who watched Federer play Alexander Zverev of Germany in Mexico City last November.

They also announced that the 'Match in Africa' raised $3.5-million for the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports educational and athletic programmes for children in Africa.

“To have 51,954 people in attendance at a tennis match, I never thought I'd be apart of something like that,” said Federer. “It's not something you dream about.

Federer, who was accompanied by his South African mother, Lynette, said his first appearance in South Africa was a special occasion.

“The first time here in Cape Town, in South Africa, means so much more than just tennis,” he said.

Federer won 6-4 3-6 6-3 in a match in which the players had to contend with cool, windy conditions in the stadium that was built for the 2010 football World Cup.

The arena was packed with eager fans who sang, clapped and did the wave throughout the match.

“It's an amazing crowd, an amazing stadium,” said Nadal, who was making his first appearance in South Africa since playing in the country as a junior.

“It's an unforgettable evening. We will probably never play again in an atmosphere such as this one,” said Nadal. “I can't thank enough the people here in Cape Town. They came here and created an unforgettable atmosphere.”

Earlier in the day, Federer and his doubles partner billionaire Bill Gates beat Nadal and South-African born comedian Trevor Noah in a match with more flexible rules.

The ceremonial coin toss was performed by World Cup-winning Springbok rugby captain Siya Kolisi, who presented Federer with a Springbok jersey. The coin used was a commemorative 20 Swiss Francs piece minted with Federer's face. He gave it to Kolisi.

Other high-profile South African sports stars in attendance included former Springbok captains John Smit and Jean de Villiers as well as Olympic swimmer Ryk Neethling.

The match is the sixth edition of the event organised by the Roger Federer Foundation and is the first to take place in Africa.

“There's so much anticipation that goes into it that the match itself almost gets forgotten,” said Federer before the match.

He said he spent childhood holidays in South Africa.

“The time spent here as a kid was amazing,” Federer said. “You would go on the road and you never come back for some reason because you've gotta chase that little tennis ball and you've gotta chase your dreams.”

Tens of thousands of fans showed up early and were ecstatic when Nadal and Federer hit practice balls into the stands.

One fan said she brought a wedding ring for Federer to propose to her. “I want to marry Roger,” she shouted.

Earlier in the afternoon, Federer and Nadal played tennis with children from townships in Hout Bay.

14,2020/02/08,Malaysian Hindus defy coronavirus fears to mark festival,"Hindus gathered in temples across Malaysia on Saturday to celebrate the annual Thaipusam festival, despite concerns about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Massive crowds descended on the Batu Caves temple complex on the outskirts of capital Kuala Lumpur to participate in the event, where Hindus showcase their devotion to the deity Lord Murugan.

Worshippers walked barefoot up 272 steps to reach the temple — an important religious site for Tamil Hindus — armed with gifts including milk pots which are eventually smashed as offerings.

Many displayed their fervour by carrying heavy ornate metal structures called “kavadis”, affixed to their bodies with sharp metal spikes that are hammered into the skin.

Some devotees appeared to be in a state of trance as they carried the kavadis, which can weigh as much as 100 kilogrammes (220 pounds).

Others pierced their faces with tridents or hung multiple hooks and chains from their bodies in an act of penance.

The crowd at the Batu Caves looked as big as in previous years despite worries about the new virus, and only a handful were wearing protective masks.

The pathogen has killed hundreds and infected tens of thousands in China and is spreading around the world. Malaysia has so far reported 16 cases, mostly in visiting Chinese nationals.

“We are quite worried about the Wuhan virus,” conceded devotee Navindran Arumugam, referring to the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak.

But he added he was not too concerned about picking up the illness at such a “holy place”.

Prior to Thaipusam, devotees will typically hold daily prayer sessions and stick to a strict vegetarian diet for weeks.

Most of Malaysia's roughly 32 million people are Muslim, but the country also has around two million ethnic Indians.

Most are descendants of labourers brought from ethnic Tamil areas of southern India by Malaysia's former British colonial masters.

Lord Murugan is particularly revered in southern India and among ethnic Tamil communities in Southeast Asia.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/44lq91/article30772078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirusjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysian-hindus-defy-coronavirus-fears-to-mark-festival/article30772054.ece
15,2020/02/08,Coronavirus | 5 British nationals test positive in France,"Five British nationals, including a child, have tested positive for the new coronavirus in France, the Health Minister said on Saturday, adding that they had all stayed at the same ski chalet. France has now detected a total of 11 cases of the novel coronavirus, and the new “cluster” is centred on a Briton who had returned from Singapore and stayed in Contamines-Montjoie, near Mont Blanc in the French Alps, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said. “They show no serious signs” of a life-threatening infection added Ms. Buzyn, herself a doctor. The Briton at the centre of the new cases is now in Britain and was not counted among the French tally, she told a press conference.

In addition to the five Britons who have tested positive for the virus, six other Britons staying in the same chalet in late January were also hospitalised for observation, the minister said.

Authorities in France and Singapore are now trying to contact people who came into close contact with the initially infected Brit, she said.

He was on a business trip and had stayed at a hotel for an event with 94 other foreigners, according to senior health official Jerome Salomon who attended the press briefing along with Buzyn.

Other “clusters” have been identified in Malaysia and South Korea around people who attended the same event, he said.

Most of the six previous cases in France appear to have been treated successfully, though all are still in hospital.

One man, an 80-year-old Chinese national, is nonetheless “still in critical condition” in a Paris hospital, Salomon said.

16,2020/02/08,"Coronavirus | China turns to Artificial Intelligence, big data","As Chinese authorities race to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 34,000 people and killed more than 700 in China, Beijing is turning to a familiar set of tools to find and prevent potential infections: data tracking and artificial intelligence.

Several Chinese tech firms have developed apps to help people check if they have taken the same flight or train as confirmed virus patients, scraping data from lists published by state media. In Guangzhou, southern Guangdong province, robots at one public plaza have even been deployed to scold passers-by not wearing masks, according to state-run Global Times.

In Beijing, one neighbourhood committee responsible for an apartment complex of about 2,400 households said they used flight and train data to keep track of everyone’s recent travel record.

“Use big data technology to track, screen priority (cases), and effectively forecast the development of the epidemic in real time,” China's National Health Commission (NHC) told local governments in an online statement Tuesday.

“Strengthen the information link between... public security and transportation, and other departments,” it said, urging them to share train, flight, communication, and medical data.

As Chinese authorities search for potential infections, a point of focus has been detecting fevers, a common symptom of the disease.

While neighbourhoods and office buildings rely primarily on hand-held thermometers, public transport hubs are also trialling fever detection systems that use artificial intelligence and infrared cameras.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e670gq/article30772135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirus-aijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-china-turns-to-artificial-intelligence-big-data/article30771991.ece
17,2020/02/08,"Sanders, Buttigieg face criticism from rivals in debate","Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the top finishers in Iowa’s first nominating contest, faced a barrage of criticism on Friday from rivals who said they did not have what it takes to beat Republican Donald Trump in November.

In a heated debate in New Hampshire just four days before the State’s pivotal primary, their Democratic rivals questioned whether Mr. Sanders’s democratic socialist views and Mr. Buttigieg’s relative lack of experience and lack of support with African-Americans and Latinos made them too much of a risk for the November 3 election.

Mr. Sanders, 78, a U.S. Senator and leader of the party’s progressive wing, and Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, finished in a virtual dead heat in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses earlier this week.

Former Vice-President Joe Biden, the one-time national frontrunner who finished a disappointing fourth in Iowa, delivered his most aggressive performance yet, a sign of possible desperation as he looks to rebound.

Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump would have an easy time ripping into Mr. Sanders in a general election campaign, and Mr. Sanders would drag down other Democratic candidates in federal and State races. “Bernie has labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that’s the label that the President is going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he is the nominee,” Mr. Biden said.

Call for big turnout

Mr. Sanders, who has called for a political revolution that will attract new voters, said “the way to beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.”

He said he could appeal to working class voters who have given up on the political process.

Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar also questioned whether Mr. Buttigieg had enough experience to face off with Mr. Trump. With controversy surrounding the Iowa caucuses — technical problems and inconsistencies delayed the results for days — New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday takes on added importance.

Democratic rivals also had moments of unity — when the subject of Donald Trump came up.

Mr. Biden criticised Mr. Trump’s firing on Friday of Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the White House’s National Security Council, two days after Mr. Trump was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial. Lt.-Colonel Vindman served as a star witness during the House of Representatives’ impeachment proceedings.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sddfxi/article30771972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09-US-PRESIDENTIALDEBATE4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sanders-buttigieg-face-criticism-from-rivals-in-debate/article30771974.ece
18,2020/02/08,Pakistani Taliban leader killed in Afghanistan,"The Pakistani Taliban has confirmed that one of its key leaders and another member of the group were killed in a clash with security forces in Afghanistan.

In a statement published by the SITE monitoring group Friday, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said Sheikh Khalid Haqqani, who served on the group’s consultative council and had been a deputy leader, had been killed January 31. “Haqqani embraced martyrdom while fighting with slaves of the United States”, the TTP said. Haqqani’s close confidant Qari Saifullah Peshawari was also killed in the clash that took place inside Afghanistan during a “mission”, said a senior Pakistani Taliban leader.

Haqqani was not thought to be related to the Haqqani network, which is also affiliated to the Afghan Taliban.

Both Islamabad and Kabul have long accused each other of allowing militants to shelter in the border regions. “Haqqani, also a writer of several books on different topics, was known for giving a befitting reply to so-called torch-bearers of democracy,” the TTP said in its statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistani-taliban-leader-killed-in-afghanistan/article30771898.ece
19,2020/02/08,Syrian Army overruns strategic town in Idlib,"The Syrian Army took control of the strategic northwestern crossroads town of Saraqeb on Saturday in the latest gain in an offensive against the country’s last major rebel bastion of Idlib.

The advance came shortly after Turkey sent additional troops into the region and threatened to respond if any of its military observation posts in Idlib, set up under a 2018 truce, come under attack.

“Army units now exercise full control over the town of Saraqeb,” state television reported, over footage of the town’s streets, deserted after weeks of bombardment.

Since December, government forces have pressed a blistering assault against the Idlib region with Russian support, retaking town after town despite warnings from rebel ally Turkey to back off.

Flight of civilians

The violence has killed more than 300 civilians and sent some 5,86,000 fleeing civilians onto the roads, seeking relative safety nearer the Turkish border.

20,2020/02/08,The rush to informal jobs,"Dona Cecilia’s alarm clock goes on at 5 a.m. Within minutes, she is in her kitchen, chopping onions and boiling water in big pans. As she steams rice and grills chicken, Ms. Cecilia makes little noise so as not to wake her husband and two sons sleeping in the bedroom. By the time they are up for coffee, Ms. Cecilia has prepared 20 boxes with rice, beans, chicken and salad. Then she puts them in a hot box and goes down to hand it over to a man who places the box on his motorbike and hurtles down the road to the city centre. Sometimes, the delivery man returns to picks another set of boxes that sell for 12 real ($3) at a square close to office buildings in downtown.

In a good month, Ms. Cecilia, 42, makes around 4,000 real ($950). Till October 2017, she made around 7,000 real as a senior technician in a diagnostics laboratory. “I was fired as the lab shut down. For a year, we survived on my husband’s salary, but then he too lost his job with an electricity firm,” says Ms. Cecilia, who lives with her family in a middle-class neighbourhood. With their jobs gone and savings dried up, the couple were forced to look for a way of making money — to put food on the table for their children. While she has become a caterer for low-income people, her husband works as part-time electrician.

Ms. Cecilia is among the millions of Brazilians who are working in the informal sector as the country fails to create full-time jobs even as the overall unemployment rate continues to fall. According to a survey published recently by the government’s statistics agency IBGE, the number of people in the informal sector has reached a new record — 39 million or 41.4% of the country’s workforce. Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 11.9% in 2019 and the number of employees with formal contracts rose by 1.1%. But, with close to 12 million people facing unemployment, new jobs are like a drop in the ocean. “We don’t know where these jobs are. I don’t know anyone who has been able to get a full-time job,” says Ms. Cecilia.

Slow recovery

Before the economic crisis gripped Brazil between 2015 and 2016, when the GDP fell for two consecutive years, Ms. Cecilia and her husband had well-paying jobs. Now, they have been pushed into the informal sector. “In the crises of 2003 and 2008, the job market started to recover starting from informal employment, which allowed the market to recuperate, and gradually the informal jobs were replaced by formal ones,” says IBGE analyst Cimar Azeredo. “But now, citizens are turning to self-employment and informal work, such as domestic workers.”

Due to slow recovery of the formal sector, Brazil today has more than 6.3 million people working in domestic services. A law, passed during then President Dilma Rousseff’s government in 2016, makes it mandatory for employers to sign a contract with domestic helps, guaranteeing a fixed salary, holidays and other benefits. Bu as the economic crisis continues, the number of domestic workers with contracts has fallen to 1.7 million as 4.5 million work informally in the sector. According to IBGE, women — mostly poor and black — represent 97% of domestic workers in the country. “They seek domestic service as the only alternative to escape unemployment,” says Mr. Azeredo.

Even as black women, poorly educated and historically disadvantaged remain trapped into the domestic service industry, the young and educated are not doing well either. As per an International Labour Organization report released last week, there is an alarming level of unemployment among youngsters in Latin America, where one out of five is failing to get a job. “It means that over 25 million people are actively seeking employment and are not getting it,” said the ILO’s annual report about the region.

This has forced many young people to turn to the so-called gig economy. Brazil today has more than 6,00,000 drivers working just for Uber. As two-thirds of them do not have their own cars, they are forced to hire vehicles from car-renting firms. “There is no job security in this work, no holidays and no labour laws protection. I have to give a fixed amount to the rent company whether I have good business day or not,” says Marcelo Campos, 25, who till two years ago was training to be a helicopter pilot. Now, with few opportunities, he drives Uber full time. “I am able to pay my bills but this uncertainty is very stressing. I hope I can get a formal job soon,” adds the aspiring pilot.

More than 12 million Brazilians hope so too.

21,2020/02/08,In the shadows of a nuclear disaster,"Japan is gearing up to take centre stage on the global arena as the host of the Olympic Games this summer, but it remains unable to shake off the long shadow of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011. A high-level advisory panel has just issued a report recommending that the Japanese government dispose of the growing cache of radioactive water from the defunct nuclear plant by releasing it into the ocean. If implemented, the move will likely alarm neighbouring countries like South Korea with whom Japan already has fraught historical relations. The affected region’s fishing industry is also strongly opposed to the idea.

Since 2011, when the Fukushima nuclear reactors were crippled by an earthquake and tsunami, over 1.2 million tonnes of contaminated water have been stored in giant containers on the plant site. This is the water that has been used to cool down and keep the reactors’ fuel cores from melting. About 150 tonnes of new water is added every day and storage space for it will run out by 2022.

The water is treated using an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS) before being stored in the tanks, but this does not remove an element called tritium, an isotope of hydrogen. And while it is common for nuclear plants located on the coast around the world to dump “treated” water laced with tritium into the sea, Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power), the plant operator, admitted in 2018 that the stored water in Fukushima contains other radioactive materials as well. The reason: Tepco had not changed the filters in the decontamination system frequently enough in the early years of cleaning the surge of water flowing through the reactors. The utility has since promised that the water will be treated again and all radioactive particles other than tritium removed prior to any release.

Practical option

The government has been considering several methods to dispose of the water, including injecting it deep into the ground, solidifying and burying it, and releasing it into the atmosphere.

The panel’s recommendation, however, is to dispose of it in the ocean as the most practical and safe option.

Japan’s Industry Ministry has said the health effects of ocean release will be minimal, amounting to between just 1/40,000 to 1/1,600 of the radiation levels to which humans are naturally exposed annually.

But not everyone is convinced. Fukushima’s fishing sector is particularly concerned about further blows to its image, given that its annual catch is still less than 20% of pre-2011 levels. The fact is that government assurances are not always believed by consumers.

Over 20 countries still have import restrictions on Japanese seafood and other agricultural products. Neighbouring South Korea not only retains the ban on seafood imports from Fukushima, it summoned a senior Japanese Embassy official in August last year to explain how the stored contaminated water would be dealt with. South Korean athletes are planning to bring their own radiation detectors and food to the Games.

Some Olympic events like baseball and softball contests will be held less than 60 km from the wrecked power plants. The Olympic torch relay will take off on March 26 from a football training centre, called J-Village, that served as a frontline operations base for workers battling the 2011 crisis. The relay will then pass through a number of areas near the damaged plant on its way to Tokyo.

In Japan, the Games have been dubbed the “Recovery Olympics”. The hope is that they will help kickstart a renaissance of Fukushima where in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, more than 1,50,000 people were evacuated. Only a small percentage of these have returned to their homes despite most areas being declared safe for habitation by the government.

The actual decommissioning of the affected nuclear plants will probably take upwards of 40 years. In 2016, the Japanese government calculated the total cost of plant dismantlement, decontamination of affected areas, and compensation to be 21.5 trillion yen ($195 billion) — roughly a fifth of the country’s annual budget at the time.

Clearly, the Olympics are only a way-stop on the path to recovery for Fukushima. But with storage space fast running out, the decision of how to dispose the contaminated water cannot wait long.

The government is widely expected to follow the advice of the expert panel regarding the method of release, it is only the timing that remains uncertain.

22,2020/02/08,"A promise, a policy decision and pending action","On January 14, on the eve of Pongal that is widely celebrated by Sri Lanka’s Tamil community in the north-east and in the hill country, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced his decision to increase the minimum wage of tea estate workers to LKR 1,000 (about ₹400), from LKR 700 now, with effect from March 1.

It was one of his first and major policy decisions, and two months into the country’s highest office, he was following up on his election promise. “It was also decided to take swift measures to develop all areas of the plantation sector, including infrastructure facilities,” his office said in a statement, adding that the government had taken “several initiatives such as tax exemption and fertiliser subsidy” to help the workers’ employers. The earliest reactions came not from workers, but from the private plantation companies who run and control the estates and workers living there, after the government divestment in the 1990s. Media headlines said they were “rattled” and “shocked”.

Opposition from companies

The Employers’ Federation of Ceylon said it was “deeply perturbed” by the salary increase proposed by the government for estate workers. “Financially, it will have a disastrous impact not only on the RPCs [Regional Plantation Companies] but also on the smallholders and eventually lead to the collapse of the industry. Therefore, we urge the authorities to refrain from going ahead with such proposal,” it said in a statement. However, it would be hard for President Rajapaksa, who has promised to lead an action-oriented government, to go back on assurance. Therein lies the challenge for the companies.

Even in the wake of a massive strike action from workers, who were relentlessly agitating for a wage hike up to LKR 1,000, the RPCs did not budge.

Citing a variety of reasons from low productivity to falling prices in the international market and a threat of the industry “collapsing” if they were to increase higher costs by way of a wage hike, the companies stubbornly held on to their positions.

In the last collective agreement with the estate workers’ unions, the companies agreed to pay LKR 700, giving workers a rather marginal rise in their basic wage. The 1,000 rupee-mark — which academic studies have found to be lower than a fair living wage — has remained elusive.

But Anusha Sivarajah, general secretary of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress, is hopeful. “The President has made this election promise. We are sure he will ensure that it is implemented, because he is looking at a comprehensive strategy in stages, looking at export pricing, tax concessions and subsidies for companies,” she told The Hindu. Her optimism perhaps stems from her party-cum-union’s alignment with the government. The CWC’s president, Arumugam Thondaman, is a Cabinet Minister in the Rajapaksa government.

Other unions are likely to be sceptical. After all, the nearly 150,000 estate labourers, mostly women, have heard the same poll promise from politicians of all hues in the past as well, but have not seen anyone keep it. Acting upon the assurance would essentially mean getting the companies, or the employers, to pay the amount that workers consider fair remuneration for their strenuous work.

Following President Rajapaksa’s announcement, the government has been holding discussions with the planters on possible tax concessions, fertiliser subsidy and measures to improve pricing.

“Discussions are taking place, nothing is finalised,” said Lalith Obeysekera, secretary general of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon.

According to Ramesh Pathirana, Plantation Industries and Export Agriculture Minister, talks are still on and a consensus is yet to be reached. “We have taken a policy decision, and the Cabinet has approved it. We have decided to provide that much-needed economic relief to the estate workers. We are discussing different modalities with the companies — including an out-grower model and a productivity-based incentive scheme for workers,” he told The Hindu.

A senior planter, requesting anonymity, said a wage hike would not only impact cash flow, but companies would also incur an approximate cost of LKR 2 billion a year if the wage is increased to LKR 1,000. Moreover, as many as 21 private companies have to come on board for this.

With the March 1 deadline looming, the government has only a month left to translate President Rajapaksa’s promise of better wage into action.

23,2020/02/08,Teaching Rohingya children in Bangladesh,"It is universally accepted that education plays a key role in every child’s development, but it is even more critical for the displaced Rohingya children, adolescents and youth. Without adequate opportunities for learning and hope for the future, they are more vulnerable to trafficking, child marriage, exploitation and abuse.

Rohingya children in Bangladesh camps are unable to follow a path to formal education, deprived of the skills they desperately need to prepare for an uncertain future. Until now, the government had resisted calls to grant those children access to education, limiting learning opportunities to a few provisional centres that offer playtime and early primary school lessons scattered across the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. A few children who managed to gain access to local secondary schools were expelled on the government’s instructions. Restrictions on formal education loomed as a major controversy. That now looks to change.

Last month, the UN and other aid agencies welcomed Bangladesh’s decision to expand access to education for Rohingya children and adolescents living in Cox’s Bazar, now home to about 1 million displaced people.

In line with the government’s decision, a pilot programme to introduce Myanmar’s curriculum in the refugee camps will begin in April, initially targeting 10,000 students in grades 6 to 9 with a team of 210 teachers and later expanding to other grades in a phased manner, according to the UN.

“These efforts will help to accelerate an expansion of education particularly to older children, make the content of education more relevant for refugees and allow us to more comprehensively meet the educational wishes of the Rohingya people,” the UN said.

In Myanmar’s Rakhine State, the UN and partners will also, to the extent possible, continue to provide educational support and assistance to Rohingya and other affected communities.

To date, informal education has been provided to 3,24,000 Rohingya children aged 4 to 14 years. In addition, over 10,000 Rohingya adolescents aged 15 to 18 years have received literacy, numeracy, life-skills and vocational skills training. That was far from adequate for a generation with lost hope.

Human rights organisations have been campaigning for the nearly half a million Rohingya children in Bangladesh to be allowed to enjoy their right to quality education. “The UN agencies will now have to work on the operational mechanism, including resources such as teachers, textbooks and infrastructure required to offer quality education to the Rohingya children. It is time for the international community to ensure that Bangladesh has the resources and support needed to deliver on its commitment, and that quality education is available to Bangladeshi children as well,” Saad Hammadi, South Asia campaigner at Amnesty International, said in an interview.

Call for support

Recently, Amnesty International launched a petition calling on governments to support Bangladesh in educating Rohingya children. It also released a music video on the occasion of the International Day of Education, appealing to the world to support the cause. Bangladeshi hip-hop lyricist and musician Mahmud Hasan, nicknamed Tabib, and child artist Rana Mridha, who became popular on YouTube for their songs promoting education of underprivileged children, lent their voices to the song. The video shot in the Rohingya camps has emerged as a compelling appeal for “education for all”, renewing global attention to the once-neglected issue.

“As humanity is not limited to the confines of any one race or border, supporting education of the oppressed Rohingya children is all of our responsibility,” Mr. Hasan, who studies Arabic language and literature at Dhaka University, said. Excerpt from the lyrics of the Bangla song released with English subtitles reads, “If all children today are enlightened with education, the future of the world will be bright. Otherwise, it will be a mistake, injustice will increase. They will be silenced by the rage of the sinners.”

After thousands of refugees descended on the border two-and-a-half-years ago, Bangladesh and the rest of the world immediately responded to the crisis with food and shelter.

However, as the refugee crisis is still dragging, children and young people are clamouring for more than survival; they want quality education that can provide a path to a more hopeful future.

24,2020/02/08,Thai soldier who killed 20 shot dead in shopping mall siege,"Thai security forces on Sunday shot and killed a rogue soldier who went on a rampage in a shopping mall in a northeastern city, ending an overnight siege after a series of attacks that left at least 20 people dead.

Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul confirmed the soldier had been shot dead at the Terminal 21 mall in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima.

“Thank you police and army for ending the situation. Shooter shot dead!!!” Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a post on Facebook. Police and the army also said he had been killed.

Police have identified the suspected shooter as 32-year-old soldier Jakrapanth Thomma.

The killings began at around 3 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday when the soldier opened fire in a house before moving to an army camp and then to the mall, posting messages on Facebook as he went.

Thai media said the suspected shooter had worked at an army base close to Nakhon Ratchasima, which is about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital Bangkok. Before the attack, Jakrapanth had posted on his Facebook account that he was out for vengeance -- but he did not say for what.

A provincial health official told a news conference that a total of 20 people had been killed and 42 wounded, revising down an earlier figure of 21 dead given by other officials.

'It appears he went mad'

“We don't know why he did this. It appears he went mad,” Defence Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit told Reuters.

Overnight, soldiers and police stormed into the mall and escorted hundreds of trapped people to safety.

“It was frightening because I could hear the occasional gunshot...we waited a long time for the police to come and help us, many hours,” said Suvanarat Jirattanasakul, 27, after she emerged.

The mall was busy with shoppers on a long weekend for the Buddhist Makha Bucha holiday.

CCTV footage from inside the mall posted on social media showed the gunman dressed in black and wearing a mask, his gun slung over his shoulder with no sign of other people around.

Facebook said it had removed the suspect's account.

“There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack,” a Facebook representative said in a statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xkuqi5/article30771531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jakrapanth-Thomma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/soldier-kills-many-in-thailand-mass-shooting-say-police/article30770552.ece
25,2020/02/08,Coronavirus | 60-year-old American dies in Wuhan as British nationals in French ski resort show signs of infection,"A 60-year-old American has died of the new coronavirus, the first confirmed non-Chinese death of the illness, U.S. officials said, as millions of Chinese began returning home after a Lunar New Year break that was extended to try to contain the outbreak.

While the vast majority of cases have been in China, the virus has spread to some two dozen countries abroad, with the latest such cases including five British nationals infected in a French ski resort.

The American man died on Thursday in Wuhan, epicentre of the virus outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, a U.S. embassy spokesman said in Beijing on Saturday. “We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” he told Reuters. “Out of the respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.”

A Japanese man in his sixties and hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan also died after suffering symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan’s foreign ministry said. The death toll in mainland China rose to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Most of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 31,774 as of Saturday.

The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside of mainland China — in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. The latest patients include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski resort in Haute-Savoie in southeastern France, health officials said, raising fears of further infections as British families head for the Alps during the school half-term holidays. The five had stayed in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. They were not in a serious condition, the officials said.

Return to normalcy

The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday, as millions return from the provinces to the big cities after the biggest holiday of the year. The holiday was extended, but many workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar workers will continue to work from home. U.S. electric carmaker Tesla’s factory in Shanghai will resume production on Monday, a government official said on Saturday.

Apple Incorporated said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call centres and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. But Chinese authorities have blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn to resume production from February 10 over concerns about the spread of the virus, Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.

The virus has been a blow to China’s already-slowing economy, with Goldman Sachs cutting its first-quarter GDP growth target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying a deeper hit is possible. “It’s certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “The longer this disruption continues the higher the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit on the economy,” he said.

‘Hard to Say how lethal’

Health officials are still uncertain how deadly the illness is. “It is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is,” Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.

“While the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have been infected that haven’t been tested...We probably won’t know the true case fatality for some time yet.”

News of the death on Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by the police for raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about the SARS outbreak. Beijing’s communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, a response that has had ripple effects globally for financial markets and businesses dependent on the world’s second-biggest economy.

Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. While China is bearing the brunt of the virus, anxiety is increasing across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising number of cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling out of an international air show in Singapore, and Thailand losing money as Chinese tourists stay home.

Another three people on the cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan’s health ministry said. Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited on Friday banned “any guests holding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they were there last” from boarding the company’s ships. The World Health Organization warned on Friday warned against the “unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/hsyv2c/article30770369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31JANCHINA-HEALTHWUHAN-STILLS-UGC-8feb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-60-year-old-american-dies-in-wuhan-as-british-nationals-in-french-ski-resort-show-signs-of-infection/article30770362.ece
26,2020/02/08,ISIS bride Shamima Begum loses appeal over U.K. citizenship,"London-born Islamic State (ISIS) recruit Shamima Begum lost an appeal against the U.K. government’s revocation of her British citizenship on security grounds.

Ms. Begum, who was 15 years old when she secretly fled her home in east London in 2015 to join the terrorist group in Syria, is living in a camp run by Kurdish forces in northern Syria.

A special British immigration tribunal ruled on February 7 that she was a Bangladeshi citizen by descent which meant that she had not been rendered homeless by former U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to revoke her British citizenship.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), a specialist tribunal that hears challenges to decisions of removing British citizenship on national security grounds, said Ms. Begum was in the situation “as a result of her own choices, and of the actions of others, but not because of anything the Secretary of State [Javid] had done”.

Ms. Begum’s solicitor, Daniel Furner of Birnberg Peirce, said the now 20-year-old will take her case to the Court of Appeal “as a matter of exceptional urgency”.

“The logic of the decision will appear baffling, accepting as it does the key underlying factual assessments of extreme danger and extreme unfairness and yet declining to provide any legal remedy,” said Mr. Furner.

“As matters stand, Ms. Begum’s right to pursue an appeal against the Home Secretary’s deprivation of her citizenship has been, in effect, rendered meaningless,” he said.

She had been tracked down in northern Syria in February last year by The Times newspaper, when she was nine months pregnant with her third child.

Bangladeshi citizenship

Mr. Javid stripped her of citizenship soon after, on the grounds that she could claim Bangladeshi nationality through her parents.

His successor as the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, also backed that decision and ruled out the prospect of her return to the U.K.

“We cannot have people who would do us harm allowed to enter our country — and that includes this woman,” said Ms. Patel, in reference to Begum, who had pleaded with the authorities to allow her to return to her family in the U.K.

Under U.K. law, a person can legally have their citizenship revoked but cannot be made stateless.

The U.K. government maintains that Ms. Begum has access to Bangladeshi dual citizenship through her parents, even though the Bangladesh government has since denied any such rights.

Ms. Begum left the U.K. in February 2015 and lived under ISIS rule for more than three years.

She became known as a so-called ISIS bride because she was married to Yago Riedijk, a Dutch ISIS fighter, soon after arriving in Syria.

Anyone appealing to SIAC, usually remains anonymous, but Ms. Begum waived her right to anonymity.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1pm3vb/article30770227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FSHAMIMABEGUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/isis-bride-shamima-begum-loses-appeal-over-uk-citizenship/article30770228.ece
27,2020/02/08,Pakistan considering proposal for passport-free entry of Indian pilgrims to Kartarpur corridor: Interior Minister,"Pakistan is considering a proposal for allowing Indian pilgrims to enter the Kartarpur corridor without passport in order to attract more visitors to the revered Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Interior Minister Ijaz Shah informed the country’s Parliament.

In November last year, Pakistan and India separately inaugurated the historic corridor on their sides of the border. The corridor provides the shortest route to Indian Sikh pilgrims to the revered Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur area of Pakistan’s Narowal district, where Guru Nanak spent last 18 years of his life.

Interior Minister Mr. Shah told the National Assembly during the Question Hour on Friday that at present, passport-free entry of Indian pilgrims to the Kartarpur corridor was not allowed in accordance with a memorandum of understanding signed between Pakistan and India, the Express Tribune reported.

However, he added, a proposal for giving the entry without passport, in order to attract more visitors, was under consideration, for which detailed input might be sought from the foreign affairs ministry.

As per the procedure, pilgrims could visit the corridor from dawn till dusk after producing Indian passport or overseas citizen of Indian-origin card along with the passport of resident country, he said.

He added that the movement of Indian visitors was regulated through a combination of physical and electronic security systems by the Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) along with other law-enforcement agencies.

Visitors are strictly kept inside the Gurdwara complex by using turnstile gates to avoid their exit toward the Pakistani side. All the activities in and around the corridor are monitored through surveillance cameras,” he was quoted as saying.

Details of issuance of the national identity cards to foreigners was also presented in the House. The interior ministry said that 1,637 foreigners were issued the national identity cards during 2009-2012, while 474 were issued the cards from 2013 to 2018.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/51xgl5/article30021780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-SANDEEP-BRG9P6O2T1P3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-considering-proposal-for-passport-free-entry-of-indian-pilgrims-to-kartarpur-corridor-interior-minister/article30769863.ece
28,2020/02/08,Pakistan court defers verdict against Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed,"A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Saturday deferred its verdict against Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed in two terror financing cases on his “request” and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday.

Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta had last week reserved the verdict against the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief in the two terror financing cases for Saturday.

“The ATC judge on Saturday took up the application of Hafiz Saeed requesting the court to club all terror financing cases against him and announce the verdict after the trial is completed,” a court official told PTI after the hearing on Saturday.

The official said the deputy prosecutor opposed to Saeed’s plea, arguing that the trial in the two cases against him has already been completed and the court may announce the verdict under the law.

The ATC, however, adjourned the hearing till February 11, issuing notices to both prosecution and defence lawyers for arguments on Saeed’s plea.

Saeed was produced before the ATC in high security.

The prosecution had produced some 20 witnesses in the ATC to testify against Saeed and his close aides for their alleged involvement in terror financing.

The ATC indicted Saeed and others on December 11 in terror financing cases in day-to-day hearing. He has already recorded his statement before the court in two terror financing cases against him in which he pleaded “not guilty”.

The cases of terror financing have been registered against him in Lahore and Gujranwala cities on the application of Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police.

Cross examination of prosecution witnesses against Saeed and his three close aides by the defence counsel has already been concluded.

The CTD had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of Punjab province and arrested him on July 17. He is held at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.

Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The US, since 2012, has offered a $10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.

29,2020/02/08,Ireland starts vote in ‘three horse race’ to form next government,"Ireland began voting in a general election on February 8, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar hoping to secure a new term on the back of Brexit but voters likely to judge him more on his domestic record.

Polls opened across the country at 0700 GMT (12.30 p.m. IST), although a small number of islands off the west coast voted on February 7 to allow for rough seas that could disrupt the transport of ballots by boat.

Some 3.3 million people are eligible to vote to elect 159 members of the Dail, the lower chamber of parliament in Dublin.

Mr. Varadkar’s Fine Gael party has been in power since 2016 but polling suggests they are trailing centre-right rivals Fianna Fail and republicans Sinn Fein.

On February 3, Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA paramilitary group, were out in front on 25%, with Fianna Fail on 23% and Fine Gael on 20%.

“This election is wide open,” Mr. Varadkar said at his final campaign stop in the western town of Ennis on February 7. “It’s a three horse race, three parties, all within shouting distance of each other.”

Helped broker a deal

Mr. Varadkar launched his campaign after successfully helping to broker a deal cushioning Britain’s EU exit on January 31 by avoiding a hard border with British-run Northern Ireland.

An open frontier was a key requirement of the 1998 peace agreement that largely ended three decades of violence over British rule in the north, which left more than 3,000 dead.

Mr. Varadkar has warned voters that Brexit is “not done yet”, as London prepares for talks with Brussels to secure a longer-term trade deal in record time before the end of this year.

Failure to do so could present an “existential threat” to the Irish economy, he said.

But experts suggest he may have miscalculated the public mood with surveys indicating Brexit was a low concern among the electorate.

Other parties have hammered Fine Gael over failings in health care, housing and homelessness. Mr. Varadkar acknowledged he understood that on Friday.

Focus on domestic issues

“You want us over the next three years to focus on issues like health and housing with the same passion and intensity that we’ve focused on Brexit in the past three years,” he said.

Mr. Varadkar is Ireland’s first mixed race and openly gay premier who has come to represent a more socially progressive Ireland after years of dominance by the Roman Catholic church.

But despite Brexit, and landmark votes to overturn strict abortion laws and introduce same-sex marriage, some predict he could be on his way out. .

“Varadkar is young, he’s gay, he looks like part of the new Ireland,” Eunan O’Halpin, of Trinity College Dublin, told AFP.

“Yet his personal popularity appears to have dipped, and that of his party has dipped very significantly.”

Polls close at 2200 GMT (3.30 a.m. on February 9, IST) and votes start being counted at 0900 GMT (2.30 p.m. IST) on February 10.

Three-way race

A three-way race led by left-wing Sinn Fein is a new dynamic for the Republic, where governments have been historically dominated by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.

Since 2016 Fianna Fail have propped up Fine Gael in government with a confidence and supply arrangement that could implicate them in the perceived failings of the government.

“(Young people) blame the current government and coalition of parties in government for this mess,” said O’Halpin about the housing shortage.

Despite its opinion poll lead, Sinn Fein, which wants to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic, is only fielding 42 candidates and cannot form a majority government even if they all win.

Both Mr. Varadkar and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin are adamant they will not form a coalition with Mary Lou McDonald’s party.

On Friday, Mr. Martin said Sinn Fein, which was once led by Gerry Adams, “have not cleaned themselves from their bloody past”.

“The only party who can lead an alternative government is Fianna Fail,” he said in his home city of Cork.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2z16y8/article30769647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRELAND-POLITICS-VOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ireland-starts-vote-in-three-horse-race-to-form-next-government/article30769648.ece
30,2020/02/08,"IMF says Lanka’s economy recovering from Easter Sunday attacks, projects 3.7% GDP growth in 2020","The IMF has said that Sri Lanka’s economy is gradually recovering from Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019 with GDP growth projected at 3.7% in 2020.

Issuing an end-of-mission statement, an IMF staff mission to Sri Lanka estimated the Real GDP growth at 2.6% in 2019 but expected the GDP to bounce back in 2020 with 3.7% on the back of the recovery in tourism while inflation to remain at around 4.5 per cent, the Colombo Page reported.

However, it also said that Sri Lanka has sizably missed IMF’s targets concerning its fund facility in 2019.

An IMF team was on a 10-day visit to Colombo from January 29 - February 7 to meet the new administration and discuss its policy objectives.

The slip in achieving targets has been attributed to the newly implemented tax cuts.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government as soon as it was elected mid November introduced sweeping tax cuts in order to grant economic relief in view of the parliamentary elections due late April.

Mr. Rajapaksa anticipates two thirds parliamentary support or 150 seats in the 225-member assembly to introduce constitutional reform, more targeting the abolition of the 19th amendment which has curbed presidential powers.

The opposition this week argued in parliament that tax concessions given by the government would cause a shortfall in revenue between Rs 500 billion and Rs 600 billion annually, which converts to 25% of annual state revenue and about 3-4 per cent of GDP.

The primary deficit could widen further to 1.9% of GDP in 2020 due to newly implemented tax cuts and exemptions , the IMF release said.

Sri Lanka’s net international resrves had fallen short of by about $100 million by December end, the IMF estimates.

The team noted that given risks to debt sustainability and large refinancing needs over the medium term, renewed efforts to advance fiscal consolidation will be essential for macroeconomic stability.

The mission concluded that ambitious structural and institutional reforms are needed to anchor policy priorities, bolster competitiveness and foster inclusive growth in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is on a four-day state visit to India where he would hold talks with the top Indian leadership on a number of key areas including trade, defence and maritime security cooperation.

The visit is the Rajapaksa senior’s first overseas trip since his brother Gotabaya was elected President in November.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4e7syr/article26960070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THRDSRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imf-says-lankas-economy-recovering-from-easter-sunday-attacks-projects-37-gdp-growth-in-2020/article30769316.ece

32,2020/02/08,Pakistan court says marriage with underage Christian girl valid as she’s had her 1st menstrual cycle,"The parents of a 14-year-old Pakistani Christian girl, who was abducted, forcibly converted to Islam and married off to her abductor, will approach the Supreme Court after a lower court ruled that marriage with an underage girl is valid as per the Sharia law if she has had her first menstrual cycle.

Huma was 14 when she was abducted in October last year and forced to marry her abductor Abdul Jabbar after being converted to Islam, according to her parents Younis and Nagheena Masih.

Their counsel Tabassum Yousuf on Friday said they would seek justice from the Supreme Court after the Sindh High Court, as per the Sharia law, said earlier this week that even if the girl, Huma, was found to be underage, the marriage between her and her alleged abductor, Jabbar, would be valid as she has already had her first menstrual cycle.

After they approached the Sindh High Court to see their daughter, the court, in a hearing on February 3, ordered the police to oversee the tests to confirm her age.

However, Judges Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Irshad Ali observed that under the Sharia law, the marriage would be valid even if Huma was underage.

Tabbasum said that the ruling was not in accordance with the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act passed in 2014 which outlawed marriages of girls under 18 years, in a bid to stop forced marriages of minors in the province, primarily of Hindu and Christian community.

“The girl’s parents were convinced that the police investigating officer was supporting Abdul Jabbar and his family. They also fear that the test results of Huma’s age could be falsified and she might be sent with her husband,” the lawyer said.

The parents had requested to keep Huma at a women’s shelter away from her alleged husband until her age was determined.

Tabassum said the parents produced documents including church, school documents confirming Huma’s age to be 14.

On the website of the Independent Catholic News, the girl’s mother has appealed to the international community to support them.

The latest case has emerged amidst an increasing number of forcible conversions of girls belonging to the minority communities in Muslim-majority Pakistan.

In the last one month, at least two cases of forced conversion and marriage of Hindu girls after abduction have emerged in the province.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e09x8t/article30458480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BreakNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-court-says-marriage-with-underage-christian-girl-valid-as-shes-had-her-1st-menstrual-cycle/article30769139.ece
33,2020/02/08,"For decades, American politicians put special interests ahead of national interests: Trump","For decades, American politicians put their special interests ahead of the interest of the country, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday, asserting that he has done away with some of the “disastrous” trade deals of the past.

Launching a new nationwide campaign in North Carolina to revitalise underserved cities and towns all across America, Mr. Trump said the U.S. is in the midst of the single greatest comeback that it has ever had. This is a comeback. We were doing poorly, he said.

For decades, Washington politicians put special interests ahead of American interests. They enacted disastrous trade policies. Like, it’s unimaginable, frankly. I looked at some of these deals; I said, ‘Who the hell would have done this? Who would have done this? A child wouldn’t have agreed to this stuff.’ Unbelievable, Mr. Trump said in his address at a business meeting.

“For years, I heard that China will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. I kept hearing that. I hated it because I said, ‘If I run, 2019 is not so far away.’ We are so far ahead. We are so far ahead now. We became a rocket ship, taking in billions and billions and billions in tariffs, giving a lot of it to our farmers and different people that were targeted, he said.

Now, we have a deal with China. I just spoke to [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] last night, and we’re working on problem, the virus. It’s a very tough situation. But I think he’s going to handle it. I think he’s handled it really well. We’re helping wherever we can, he said.

His administration, Mr. Trump said, has signed the Mexico deal and Canada deal: USMCA and has signed trade deals with Japan and South Korea.

Our economy is now the envy of the entire world. You have to see when leaders come to my office -- this beautiful Oval Office. I’ve had people walk into the office -- it’s beautiful -- but they have more beautiful, in many cases, I guess. But it’s what it represents, he added.

“China is working very hard. Late last night, I had a very good talk with President Xi and we talked mostly about the coronavirus,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “I think they are doing a very professional job.”

The death toll in China due to coronavirus continues to goes up as it jumped to 722 on Friday, while the number of confirmed cases rose to 34,546, Chinese health authorities announced on Saturday.

The Chinese, Mr. Trump said, were in touch with the World Health Organization and also the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

35,2020/02/08,"‘Take him down on the economy, stupid’: quotes from the Democratic presidential debate","Seven candidates vying for the Democratic nomination to take on President Donald Trump in November participated in the eighth presidential debate on Friday.

Here are quotations from the contenders on stage in New Hampshire:

Former Vice President Joe Biden

“Bernie has labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think thats the label that the president is going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he is the nominee.

“Imagine youre going unite the country, walking into Congress and saying, I got this bill. Its going provide healthcare for everybody. I dont know how much its going cost. Well figure it out later.' Who do you think is going get that passed?

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders

“Donald Trump lies all the time. It's a sad state of affairs, it really is. ... At the end of the day, we defeat Donald Trump, and everybody up here by the way is united; no matter who wins this damn thing, we're all going to stand together. I believe the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of his country.”

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar

“It is easy to go after Washington because thats a popular thing to do. It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions,” Klobuchar said to rival Pete Buttigieg.

But what you said Pete as you were campaigning through Iowa as three of us were jurors in the impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons.

Billionaire Activist Tom Steyer

“We're going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy. Because if you listen to him, he's crowing about it every single day, and he's going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid. And that's the issue here is not about who has the best healthcare plan. All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better. The question is, who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump, who can take down Mr. Trump, because he's the real threat to the country.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang

“Donald Trump is not the cause of all our problems, and we're making a mistake when we act like he is.

36,2020/02/08,Cyclone barrels towards Australia’s west coast with damaging winds,"Western Australia was lashed by destructive winds on Saturday as a tropical cyclone neared landfall while much of the bushfire-battered east coast faced flood warnings due to heavy rain.

Severe tropical cyclone Damien was expected to make landfall on the west coast near Port Hedland, the world's largest iron ore port, on Saturday afternoon. Operations at ports in the region were suspended.

In this December 2, 2013 file photo, Fortescue Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nev Power climbs a pile of iron ore at the Fortescue Solomon iron ore mine located in the Valley of the Kings, around 400 km (248 miles) south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, December 2, 2013. | Photo Credit: Reuters

At 10 a.m. AWST (0200 GMT), Damien was a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 150 kilometres per hour and gusts of 205 kph, the Bureau of Meteorology in Western Australia.

Residents of some coastal areas were urged to seek shelter.

“Very destructive winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surge are expected as Damien crosses the coast near Dampier early this afternoon,” the agency said on Twitter.

Sparsely populated Western Australia was also facing several severe fire warnings with hot temperatures expected in most of the state.

After months of destructive wildfires that have razed millions of hectares of land, Australia has been hit in recent weeks by wild weather that has brought heavy downpours, hail storms and a heat wave.

New South Wales, an east coast state where nearly a third of Australia's population lives, saw some areas drenched by the heaviest rainfall in almost 20 years, with severe weather and flash flood warnings.

37,2020/02/08,"Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest doubled in January 2020 compared to 2019, says govt data","Aggressive deforestation is starting earlier this year in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, environmental enforcement agents say, with government data on Friday showing destruction doubling in January compared with a year ago.

More than 280 square kilometers of rainforest were destroyed last month, according to preliminary statistics released by space research agency INPE. The agency released data only for the first 30 days of the month, without explanation.

Deforestation surged last year in Brazil and right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro drew condemnation at home and abroad from environmentalists for policies seen as weakening environmental protections and for rhetoric that they say has emboldened illegal ranchers, loggers and land speculators.

Bolsonaro has said he is unfairly demonised by environmentalists and that Brazil remains a model for conservation.

Destruction is down from highs of more than 1,000 square kilometers per month in July through September, due to the onset of the rainy season, when the forest floor turns to mud, making ground transport difficult in places.

But instead of falling to the same low levels as in past years, deforestation remains unseasonably high, with illegal loggers and land speculators still acting aggressively, three field operatives for environmental enforcement agency Ibama told Reuters.

“We see a huge difference,” said one agent, recently deployed to try to curb the destruction. “We thought there would be a drop off because of the weather and all that, but it didn't happen.”

A second agent said that normally there is not much enforcement work needed in January, but this year “deforestation is higher so we're out in the field earlier.”

The agents spoke on condition of anonymity, after the government banned Ibama from responding to media requests last year.

Ibama and the Environment Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest, absorbing vast amounts of the greenhouse gas that causes global warming. Scientists say its protection is vital to avoiding catastrophic climate change.

The two agents said they have found loggers with heavy machinery, even “mobile lumber mills,” in protected areas such as indigenous reserves, which is highly unusual this time of year.

The agency remains severely underfunded and understaffed, which the agents say prevents them from stopping the surge.

Bolsonaro has previously railed against Ibama for what he says are excessive environmental fines.

“The situation continues to be very bad. It's getting more dangerous and the population is increasingly encouraged to resist enforcement,” a third Ibama agent said.

Last week, a man who was caught illegally deforesting opened fire on police and Ibama agents, eventually dying in the shootout. Deadly confrontations of that kind are typically rare, with a police officer last killed in such an operation in 2016.

Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of deforestation monitoring group MapBiomas, has warned that deforestation will accelerate in 2020 unless the government steps up conservation.

“We are worried over the trend because we do not see the government taking concrete actions to combat deforestation,” one of the agents said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bonrli/article30768609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBRAZILAMAZONCROSSROADS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/deforestation-in-brazils-amazon-rainforest-doubled-in-january-2020-compared-to-2019-says-govt-data/article30768610.ece

Another 86 people died from the virus, according to the national health commission, with all but five in hard-hit Hubei province, where the disease emerged in December

In its daily update, the commission also confirmed another 3,399 new cases. There are now more than 34,500 confirmed infections across the country.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease in the same family as the new coronavirus, left nearly 650 people dead in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. More than 120 others died around the world.

China has struggled to contain the current virus despite having placed some 56 million people under effective lockdown in Hubei and its provincial capital, Wuhan. Other cities far from the epicentre have also taken measures to keep people indoors, limiting the number of individuals who can leave their home.

Friday’s death of a 34-year-old Wuhan doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the virus in December sparked an outpouring of grief and anger over the government’s handling of the crisis.

The virus has spread to two dozen countries, prompting several governments to ban arrivals from China and urge their citizens to avoid travelling to the country. Some have recommended their citizens leave China. Major airlines have suspended flights to and from China.

“This commitment—along with the hundreds of millions generously donated by the American private sector—demonstrates strong US leadership in response to the outbreak,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

“We encourage the rest of the world to match our commitment. Working together, we can have a profound impact to contain this growing threat,” he said.

Mr. Pompeo, who has frequently criticized China on issues from human rights to its overseas infrastructure spending, said the United States would provide the assistance either directly or through multilateral organizations.

He said the spending would come out of unspecified funds that have already been allocated within the U.S. government.

The aid pledge comes after Beijing criticized the U.S. response to the health crisis, saying that Washington has been spreading “panic” by banning the entry of foreign nationals who traveled to China.

42,2020/02/08,Beijing in the time of Corona,"Winter in Beijing is often marked by a kaleidoscope of stark colours: a monotonous grey that swaddles bare trees dotted by fragile bird nests; a shroud of white that covers the city on the rare days of snow; the deep olive-green winter uniform of guards who stand motionless outside government buildings; and the indelible red of the flag that flutters atop buildings.

This winter, yet another colour has enveloped the normally bustling capital of the middle kingdom — the pallor of emptiness.

As cases of the Wuhan novel coronavirus rise by the day, Beijing has fallen silent. And empty. Its 23 million people have either left the city or are in a self-imposed quarantine in their homes.

I live in Beijing, in a stereotypical expat bubble — a sterile cocoon of tennis courts, dog parks, Pilates afternoons and coffee mornings. Ever since news of the virus broke, the complex has been emptying out rapidly. Some residents have escaped to their home countries; yet others, already out for the spring festival holiday (known as Chinese New Year to the outside world) that coincided with the start of the epidemic, have decided not to return for the foreseeable future. A government order closing all schools has made the exodus easier. Some embassies and companies have even ordered their citizens and employees out.

The decision to flee Beijing seems to be led more by a palpable sense of paranoia than plain common sense. There is a relentless, often unforgiving frenzy of social media posts that is spreading faster than the virus itself. For those of us who have chosen to stay, there is intense pressure from loved ones back home to leave at the earliest opportunity. But we are here. This is now our home.

Eager to bear witness to these extraordinary times facing the city, I decided to break my self-imposed house arrest and take a walk along the city centre. It was a cold Saturday afternoon, with clear skies, a perfect day for being outdoors. Yet, alley after alley looked deserted; swathes of concrete stretched endlessly on empty main streets with only a trickle of traffic, as I struggled to make peace with my new accessory, the ubiquitous surgical mask, a requirement for all outdoor travel in the city and the most visible symbol of the epidemic in China.

The late afternoon sun cast long eerie shadows of me and a few masked passers-by, all of us trying to make sense of this new normal in our lives, hopefully a temporary one. We were the veritable extras, walking our measured walk, on the sets of a sci-fi thriller, a cross between the Hollywood hits Contagion and The Quiet Place.

Not far away lay the expansive Tiananmen Square, exaggerated by its emptiness. Chairman Mao’s unsmiling portrait loomed large; his was the only unmasked face in the entire square. A few tourists walked about, eager to tick Tiananmen Square off their travel itinerary, hurriedly posing for masked selfies as bemused guards looked on.

Everyone’s gone

At the far corner, Qianmen Street, usually a delightful pedestrian stretch, looked almost abandoned, with empty stalls and shuttered shops plastered with government notices about the temporary closure of public places. Red lanterns — decorations from the abruptly cancelled spring festival celebrations in the city — swayed listlessly from lampposts. The Year of the Rat seemed all but forgotten in the wake of the epidemic.

I sipped my watery but much welcome coffee at an empty McDonald’s café, one of the few still open in the area, absorbing the starkness around me. A young couple sat at the other end, unmasked and abashed in their togetherness, almost thankful for the space this populous city had suddenly given them.

A few public buses drove past, carrying only a smattering of passengers who looked out vacantly from behind their masks. Public transport is active, but the passengers have stayed away. On my way back home, I passed by one of the largest general hospitals in the city. A fleet of ambulances was parked outside, on red alert, ready to attend to any call for medical help. A few nurses hung around by the sidewalk, sharing a light moment, eager to escape the cacophony of their work and soak in the silence on the streets.

Around the city, bright red banners previously carrying nationalistic messages were now replaced by exhortations to people to maintain personal hygiene. “Wash your hands frequently,” reminded one, “Always wear a mask,” admonished another. A lone kuaidi (Chinese for express delivery) van stood parked outside my compound, its driver standing alongside, as if on a never-ending smoke break. China’s kuaidi population, the backbone of its vibrant e-commerce industry, suddenly finds itself left with very little work.

Yet, in the midst of all the hysteria — the daily updates on fatalities and recoveries, the unabated series of cancelled flights and closing of borders — there is a strange sense of connectedness in the city, something I have never felt before.

The masked grocer down the road smiles from her eyes as she deftly bags the things I have bought; the security guard at the gate is happy to greet me, one of the few still left in the ghost compound he protects. Even strangers I meet on the street hold their gaze just a bit longer. It is as if our eyes are searching for some form of slight camaraderie even though our brains warn us to steer clear of human contact.

43,2020/02/08,The time of orange towels: An IPS officer’s rise and rise,"Imagine what it might be like to be a high-ranking police officer in north India today. There you are, a bright boy, good at both sports and studies, adept at languages, and also perhaps science or economics. You do well in school and college and then sit for the Public Service exams. You want to contribute to society, you want a steady job and you also want an interesting life. So you opt for the Indian Police Service. You pass and are sent for training. You graduate and get commissioned into a State cadre. After donning your uniform you salute the Tiranga and take your oath on the Constitution of India. It’s a proud day for you.

As your career progresses, there are more ups than downs. You are a good officer, brave, intelligent, but some cases go wrong — maybe there are a couple of deaths in custody — not your fault directly, just that your subordinates got a bit over-enthusiastic. However, these are handled; you handle it for your boys and your superiors handle it for you and all is good. You crack a few good cases, manage a few tricky situations and you climb up the promotion ladder. You are a smart guy and very much a team player; your colleagues have their needs; so do you; so yes, you take your normal share of bribes but nothing too outrageous.

An honourable man

And you know which side your parantha is buttered so you also do the bidding of whichever politicians happen to be in government; but again, nothing too extreme, almost always within limits, as far as possible keeping the law and general ethics in mind, not to mention preserving your self-respect. And of course the strong possibility that the people you are persecuting today might be in power after the next elections.

After a long innings, you find yourself in the upper echelons of your State police force. You didn’t get here by being naïve but neither did you make too many compromises — or so you feel. Essentially your honour is intact and you are a good man — or so you feel. The roulette wheel of politics spins and there appears in the country and then in your State a very different kind of regime. In many ways it looks and acts the same as other governments, except these people push the legal and moral envelope to such an extent that it goes into the shredder.

The chief minister of your State proclaims he is giving orders that criminals should be shot without trial. Quickly you realise this is not empty rhetoric — Shri CM-ji actually expects you and your colleagues to produce a body count of extra-judicial killings.

That’s when it begins, The Time of The Towels. You do what your boss tells you to, knowing full well that this is not effective for actually countering crime. Even as the executions increase, so does the crime level in the State, but certain powerful sections are happy, never mind boring legalities and ideas of justice. You suddenly understand that neither the CM nor anyone else in his party is worried about ever being replaced by a different government. You are working day and night but you also find the scope of your duties has widened.

The CM travels constantly. Among the things you must ensure is that each place he stays at is supplied with towels of his favourite colour, a chemical orange. A couple of times, the towels end up a different colour and you nearly lose your job.

Dreams in orange

Currently, you are focused on making sure your men shoot down innocent working class Muslims as often as possible: coming out from namaaz, crossing a maidan after work or school... no signs of any trouble but no matter, boom! You are also co-ordinating with leaders of the Friends of Police gangs that accompany your men as they regularly rampage through poor Muslim neighbourhoods, smashing up businesses, looting shops and entering houses, threatening and molesting the women.

It’s a dirty job but someone has to do it. If you don’t, several of your colleagues are waiting to pounce on your post. If you show a sliver of unwillingness, you know this regime is psychopathically vindictive and you will suffer. But at night, when you wake up from your nightmares, the dreams are not about shooting down small boys or forcing people to cremate their dead instead of burying them. The dreams are about folding towels and stacking them in neat piles in time for the CM’s arrival at some guest house. As you sit up in bed, wiping your sweat with an orange face-cloth, you realise, yet again, that this is where you’ve arrived as a senior police officer in the Republic of India.

44,2020/02/08,IRDAI revises stewardship code for insurers,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has come up with revised guidelines on the Stewardship Code for Insurers, or the set of guidelines for insurance firms on their engagement with companies in which they have invested.

“All the insurers need to review and update their existing stewardship within three months,” IRDAI Member (F&I) Pravin Kutumbe said, issuing the revised guidelines, which, among other aspects, favoured an oversight role for the insurance companies in the investee firms.

“Insurers should have mechanisms for regular monitoring of their investee companies in respect of their performance, leadership effectiveness, succession planning, corporate governance, reporting and other parameters they consider important,” the regulator said.

Setting a three-month deadline for the insurers to update their stewardship policy and get the same approved by their board of directors, IRDAI sought to highlight how insurance companies ought to have an active role in the general meetings of investee companies and engage with the management to improve governance.

Eye on better returns

“This will result in informed decisions by the parties and improve the return on investments of insurers, which will ultimately benefit the policyholders,” the communication said.

The insurance regulator had issued a code for stewardship in March 2017, which the insurance companies needed to adopt from 2017-18.

Noting that it had been decided to review existing guidelines based on experience in implementation, compliance and the recent developments in this regard, IRDAI said it wanted insurers to formulate a policy on the discharge of their stewardship responsibilities and make it public. The monitoring and engagement of the investee companies should cover strategy, risk and capital structure. The policy may also stipulate the threshold, based on the level of investment or any other criteria determined by the insurance company board, for intervention.

Advising insurers to exercise their own independent judgment with regard to voting decisions on resolutions and not automatically support the proposals of the investee company’s board, IRDAI said insurance companies with Assets Under Management up to ₹2.5 lakh crore have to compulsorily vote if their holding is more than 3% in the investee firm’s paid up capital. Insurers with AUM above ₹2.5 lakh crore should compulsorily vote if their holding is more than 5% in the investee firm’s paid up capital.

Other aspects emphasised, under the revised guidelines, are insurers having a clear policy on how they manage conflicts of interest, such as the investee firm being an associate; intervention; collaboration with other institutional investors; voting and disclosure of voting activity; as well as report periodically on their stewardship activities.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-revises-stewardship-code-for-insurers/article30772224.ece
45,2020/02/08,IHCL reposes faith in spiritual tourism for growth,"Having built a portfolio of 35 hotels in cities of religious significance and with more hotels in the pipeline, Tata Group’s Indian Hotel Company Ltd. (IHCL), which runs Taj hotels, among other brands, has identified spiritual tourism as a thrust area to grow its business.

Since spiritual tourism in India accounts for 60% of the total domestic tourism, IHCL has set up hotels at key locations like Tirupati, Varanasi, Amritsar, Madurai and Rishikesh, to name a few.

With this, Taj Hotels is well-positioned to capture the demand at these key spiritual destinations, executives said.

IHCL, with all its brands, is a dominant player in many other cities of spiritual significance including Nashik, Ajmer, Katra, and Dwarka with a footprint of 35 hotels with over 4,000 rooms.

“Religious tourism is often considered the oldest form of tourism, dating thousands of years back. Today, with better infrastructure support, this segment is growing rapidly. Being pioneers in tourism, we are is committed to growing and strengthening footprint in this sector which is growing exponentially,” said Puneet Chhatwal, MD & CEO, IHCL.

“Religious and spiritual tourism within domestic tourism is a largely untapped market. IHCL currently has a portfolio of 35 hotels across locations with religious and spiritual significance. Our pipeline includes hotels in Dharamshala, Haridwar, Katra, Mecca, to name a few,” he added.

Recently, IHCL signed up for Vivanta Dharamshala, a 100-room hotel offering panoramic views of the Dhauladhar mountains in the Himalayas. It is a short distance away from McLeodganj, famous the world over as a hub of Tibetan Buddhism and home to the Dalai Lama. It is a greenfield project slated to open in 2023.

For the comfort of its guests, IHCL is assisting tourists with pre-bookings for darshan/aarti and providing guides for hassle free visit to the religious shrines

IHCL was also behind the famous Ganga Arti that takes place in Varanasi.

As per IHCL’s research, destinations like Varanasi, Ajmer, Amritsar, Goa and Kerala are visited more by domestic travellers while international travellers are inclined towards Amritsar, Nashik and Madurai, more from a cultural exploration perspective.

“Religious and spiritual tourism within domestic tourism is a largely untapped market. IHCL is committed to filling the gap in this sector which is growing exponentially. The opportunities across market segments and price points are immense,” the company said.

Meanwhile, Taj Hotels has launched ‘Divinity Trails at the Taj’ across key destinations in India.

Renu Basu, senior vice-president – Global Sales and Marketing, IHCL, said, “Divinity Trails at the Taj is our way to encourage travelers to explore self-fulfilling and spiritual experiences while enjoying a luxurious break.”

46,2020/02/08,Capacity issues at top airports will continue as flyer count rises,"Congestion at India’s top four airports Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad will continue in the medium term as the number of air passengers has seen a rise despite the slowdown in the economy and closure of Jet Airways, Crisil Ratings said in a study.

These four airports handle more than half of air passenger traffic in India and currently operate at over 130% of capacity utilisation. With healthy traffic growth projected in the near future, this operating rate is expected to rise further in next 12 months, it said.

This, despite a ₹38,000-crore capex being undertaken by operators between 2020 and 2024. The capex, the highest to be incurred in any continuous five-year period, is largely debt-funded.

“Capacity at these four airports will increase a cumulative 65% to 228 million annually [from 138 million now] by fiscal 2023. However, traffic is expected to grow strong at up to 10% per annum over the same period,” Manish Gupta, senior director, Crisil Ratings, said.

“Because the additional capacities will become operational in phases only around fiscal 2023, high passenger growth will add to congestion till then,” he added.

High utilisation will ride on pent-up demand (accumulated in 2019 as traffic was impacted with the grounding of Jet Airways) and one-off issues with new aircraft of certain airlines. Further impetus will also come from improving connectivity to smaller cities and reducing fare difference between air and rail, Crisil Ratings said.

Ankit Hakhu, director, Crisil Ratings, said: “These airports operate on a hybrid till model, where non-aero revenue stream partially subsidises the airport user fee. Hence rising traffic and increasing monetisation of non-aero assets will pave the way for a more balanced regulatory regime.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/capacity-issues-at-top-airports-will-continue-as-flyer-count-rises/article30772188.ece

We have to see whether the car will give the same performance lap after lap.”

Mr. Agarwal said that Lamborghini had showcased the vision off uture mobility with the electric version of Terzo Millennio in 2017. On the domestic market, he said it was a strategic market for Lamborghini and that it would continue to invest in marketing, networking and after-sales.

48,2020/02/08,‘Economy revival is around the corner’,"Even as the country’s economy is under pressure amid the slowdown, Vedanta Resources chairman Anil Agarwal believes that a revival is just around the corner.

“The way the government is taking bold decisions, I am confident that the economy will bounce back over the next 12 months. I would urge my fellow countrymen to give this government a chance and let them continue with the good work,” Mr. Agarwal said in an interaction with The Hindu.

Lauding the government for recognising the role of entrepreneurs in nation building, Mr. Agarwal said that the Union Budget’s focus on transparency and reducing tax litigation would go a long way in propelling India to become a $5 trillion economy.

“The FM has also shown willingness to settle tax disputes and create a conducive environment for business. This move to settle tax disputes will give India a big push with regard to ease of doing business and making it a $5 trillion economy,” Mr. Agarwal said.

He also welcomed the government’s thrust on disinvestment, while stressing that public sector companies and banks needed to be run independently for better productivity.

“There is a lot of value erosion that is happening right now. I am sure that the productivity of these public sector units can increase threefold if they are allowed to function independently. And for this to happen, the government needs to bring down their stake in these companies to 50%,” he said.

On the Budget’s disinvestment target of ₹2.1 lakh crore, Mr. Agarwal said: “The government is on the right track. They are looking to sell stake in Air India and BPCL. Hindustan Zinc disinvestment is also on the cards.”

Stating that the rules of doing business have changed, Mr. Agarwal lauded the government for creating an ecosystem where only sound business ideas become successful today. “India is the largest start-up in the world, and the focus on transparency is a big boost for the younger generation,” he added.

Pitch for oil exploration

Making a strong pitch to boost oil exploration, Mr. Agarwal said: “India has huge oil reserves. Except Cairn, there is no other oil producer in the private sector. We need at least 50 more companies. If any major crisis hits the Gulf, [the country] will have no supply of oil. So, it is important that we produce at least 50% of our oil requirements.

“The government should bring in a regime of self-certification wherein companies can start off with exploration activities once they get the environmental clearance. Also, it is important that explorers get international price for their output,” Mr. Agarwal said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/llqco9/article30772177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBUANIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/economy-revival-is-around-the-corner/article30772178.ece
49,2020/02/08,"Utilise shift in orders from virus-hit China, textile exporters urged","With several businesses said to be affected in China due to the coronavirus, the Indian textile and clothing sector should seize the opportunity in global trade, T. Rajkumar, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said.

“We expect China will take 3-4 more months to return to normalcy [following the outbreak of the coronavirus]. Indian textile and clothing exporters should be aggressive and tap overseas orders that will shift from China,” he told mediapersons here.

Higher orders expected

“We hear that several businesses have been hit in China, especially during the last one week. Indian exporters are beginning to get enquiries from importers in different countries as they cannot source from China now.

“I expect higher orders for apparel and made-up exports from India even before the end of this financial year,” he added. Countries such as Bangladesh that are strong in garment exports may also face challenges as they import raw material. For Indian exporters, the entire textile value chain is available. They should reach out to buyers and tap opportunities, he said.

On the announcements in the Union Budget, Mr. Rajkumar said that abolition of anti-dumping duty on PTA would lead to 20-25% of textile mills switching over to synthetic yarn production from cotton. The anti-dumping duty on PTA was $26 to $160 a tonne depending on the country from where it was imported.

With removal of the anti-dumping duty, the raw material for production of MMF (man-made fibre) will be available at international price. At present, cotton yarn production in India is higher than synthetic yarn. Several mills will move to MMF now, he said.

Textile Secretary Ravi Capoor will visit Coimbatore on February 12-13 and hold meetings with representatives of textile associations from the southern State, Mr. Rajkumar said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/bhlhun/article30772375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/utilise-shift-in-orders-from-virus-hit-china-textile-exporters-urged/article30772176.ece
50,2020/02/08,M&M net slumps 73% on sluggish sales,"Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M), along with its 100% subsidiary Mahindra Vehicles Manufacturers Ltd. (MVML) reported a 73% decline in net profit at ₹380 crore for the quarter ended December 31, due to sluggish vehicle sales. This compares with a ₹1,396 crore net profit a year earlier.

Revenue declined 6% to ₹12,120 crore. During the quarter, the company sold 1,23,353 units compared with 1,33,508 units in the same period last year, down 7.6%. Tractor sales fell 6.4% to 81,435 units. Exports, including vehicles and tractors, were down 22% to 9,633 units. “The results of Q3 FY2020 include a net loss on account of exceptional and one-off items ₹554 crore compared to a net gain on account of exceptional and one-off items of ₹519 crore in Q3 F2019,” the company said in a statement.

The company said that in Q3 FY2020, both the Indian auto and tractor industries had shown signs of trend reversal and have seen moderation in the double digit de-growth seen in the two immediately preceding quarters. “Good monsoons, the festive season demand, improved liquidity conditions, new launches, especially in the utility vehicle (UV) segment and special schemes offered by OEMs for the auto industry were the key reasons for this moderation in de-growth,” it said.

“The unseasonal rains in the month of October 2019 did cause some damage to the kharif crop, but the sentiment in the agri and rural economy is fairly upbeat with good sowing of rabi crops supported by very good water reservoir levels and the government’s announcement for thrust on infra projects,” it said. For the the quarter ended December, M&M, on a standalone basis, reported revenue of ₹12,345 crore as compared to ₹13,070 crore in the same period last year. Net profit was ₹307 crore compared with ₹1,077 crore a year earlier.

Chairman to continue

The company also said that following the Securities and Exchange Board of India deferring the deadline for compliance with norms relating to the post of chairman, M&M’s board had requested Anand Mahindra to continue as executive chairman till his original term of appointment ended on November, 11, 2021.

51,2020/02/08,Exports won't be key driver of India's growth: Expenditure Secretary Somanathan,"T.V. Somanathan, Secretary (Expenditure), Union Ministry of Finance said that exports would not be the main driver of India's growth in the next three years which will have to be led by domestic investment and consumption.

During panel panel discussion on Indian Economy — on the road to recovery? organised by the United Way Chennai, Mr. Somanathan cited the difficult external trade environment and the tariff war between U.S. and China as the key reasons.

On the positive side, one advantage India has over other South East Asian economies is its potential investment and domestic consumption is bigger than theirs, he pointed out.

“Our demography is different, when compared to shrinking population across the world. We still have an opportunity at least for a decade where domestic demand and domestic infrastructure investment can drive a fairly high rate of growth. We have to pull up our socks and make sure that domestic investment and consumption grows faster than it was in the immediate past,” Mr. Somanathan said.

On protectionism

He also dismissed views that the increase in custom duty on certain goods in the budget as protectionism.

Mr. Somanathan pointed out that it is not possible to be unilaterally fair, when the other side is adopting to protectionist measures.

The government is fine with building an open economy, however, it is also cautious about safeguarding its interest especially when the other side is not fair, he said.

Mr. Somanathan added that the Finance Minister has announced measures to strengthen the export-oriented sectors which are labour intensive such as textiles.

Earlier, delivering the key note address, he said there were a few themes that underpinned the Union Budget, including promoting the growth of the economy without sacrificing macro economic stability.

There is a major thrust on agriculture and rural development where the provisions have increased very substantially, Mr. Somanathan said.

“There is also an initiative to double the farmers' income. A lot of people are confused about this doubling, asking when the growth rate of agriculture is 2.5%, how will you double farmers income. The aim is not doubling farm output but is doubling farmers income,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dqgp1m/article30769001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSOMANATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/exports-wont-be-key-driver-of-indias-growth-expenditure-secretary-somanathan/article30769002.ece
52,2020/02/08,"I didn’t storm into the well, says Manickam Tagore","A day after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan accused Congress members of trying to assault him and snatch his papers, Manickam B. Tagore, the man at the centre of the controversy, said he didn’t storm into the well of the Lok Sabha with the intention of assaulting the Minister.

“If the original CCTV footage from the Lok Sabha is released to the public, it will be clear that it was never my intention to assault the Minister. He was sitting in the second row, and I had only gone to plead with him to stop making such a disgraceful statement,” Mr. Tagore, sitting for Virudhunagar, told The Hindu.

The trouble started when Mr. Vardhan was replying to a starred question from former Congress president and Wayand member Rahul Gandhi. “Sir, please excuse me. Before I begin answering this question of dear Shri Rahul Gandhiji, I want to condemn, in no uncertain words, the outlandish language that he has used against the Prime Minister...,” he said. Mr. Gandhi had reportedly said: “6 mahina baad, iss desh ka yuva, Narendra Modi ko dande maar maar ke desh se bahar karenge” [After six months, the youth of the country will beat [Narendra] Modi with sticks and throw him out].

Mr. Tagore said he did not think it was a mistake to walk into the well. “If our voice is not heard in a democracy, going to the well is the only option available to us.”

After the scuffle, he met Speaker Om Birla, who assured him that the CCTV footage would be scanned before any action was taken. Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, along with party chief whip Kodikunnil Suresh, met Mr. Birla too.

Sources said the Congress had proposed that Mr. Tagore express regret for his actions, only if Mr. Gandhi was allowed to speak and Mr. Vardhan also apologised for his comments.

Mr. Tagore also submitted a complaint to the Speaker, alleging that BJP member Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh pushed him and threatened to kill him. “He pushed me and told me in Hindi, ‘main tujhe goli maar dunga’.”

He said the government had tried to use the Budget session to improve the BJP’s prospects in the Delhi Assembly election. “The treasury benches wanted to make this session Delhi-centric.

53,2020/02/08,Women Army officers criticise Centre’s note,"Serving women officers in the Army have condemned the Centre’s written note in the Supreme Court, which said they were physically weaker than men and not suitable for command appointments, as evidence of a “regressive mindset” within the establishment.

The women officers, represented by senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati, filed written submissions before the Supreme Court countering the note of the government about how women were not suitable for command appointments, compared to their male counterparts. The government tried to justify its argument by putting forth reasons of national security, operational effectiveness, battlefield scenario and capture by enemy etc.

The officers termed the note “misconceived and based on misleading and erroneous basis”.

“The argument that women officers are not trainable in specialisation envisaged for permanent commission of women officers, skewed cadre structure, lower physical capabilities etc. are grounds/excuses that follow the pattern of regressive mindset, rather than being based on experience or statistics,” said their 19-page written submissions.

They said demonstrated record, experience and quantifiable statistics provide quite a different picture from the “regressive and obstinate reasoning given in the note of the Union of India”. The written submissions refer to Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal.

“She is a Fighter Controller with the Indian Air Force. She was part of the team that guided Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman during the 2019 Balakot airstrike carried out by the IAF.

Mr. Mahinda told The Hindu about his hopes for debt-restructuring, and also about projects now on the anvil, although his government will not carry forward the projects agreed to by the previous Sri Lankan government.

You have had discussions at some length with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but no agreements were announced, especially on the $400-million Line of Credit offered by India for infrastructure. Tell us about the talks.

We did speak about several agreements and we have agreed to some of the projects that [the Indian side] were interested in. It was a fruitful and successful meet, for both sides, I would say. The housing project is something that is a priority area for us, and we asked for more funding for that. We have a new initiative, to cover the whole country, every village, and we should like to get some support for that. Apart from housing, there were several projects we discussed.

In April 2017, the previous Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also signed a MoU on economic cooperation for infrastructure projects, including energy and oil projects in Trincomalee that India has been keen on. Were those discussed?

We didn’t discussed the Trinco projects, but we did talks about the Eastern Terminal [in Colombo] which India and Japan are jointly investing in, and the LNG terminal. Whatever was signed [in 2017] was not even pursued by the last government. President [MRS Sirisena] actually rejected all the projects PM [Wickremesinghe] had signed. We are not responsible for those projects. The Mattala [airport] project is also out. Our government has a firm policy on not allowing any national resources to be given to foreign control.

An additional $50 million from the LOC have been earmarked for security cooperation, especially after the Easter Sunday bombings last year. What was decided about that?

We have decided that we must have more intelligence sharing now, and increase the technical assistance [from India], as well as training. On the Easter bombings, we have an ongoing investigation into the conspiracy, and a commission is looking into it. We hope that India will continue to help us on that. In addition, we want to continue our earlier [pre-2015] project for trilateral terror and security cooperation between Maldives-India- Sri Lanka. We might have the meeting for that as soon as possible, possibly in the Maldives and discuss how to take the trilateral idea forward.

Your defence secretary has also spoken of security and intelligence sharing Pakistan. Won’t the balance prove difficult, given India’s concerns about terror emanating from Pakistan, which has also held up the SAARC process?

Yes, but we are friendly country and we have friendly ties with all countries in the region. We are friendly with China too. But the Indian relationship is much stronger and very important for us. I couldn’t discuss the SAARC process with [PM Modi], as I know that India is not very interested in the summit, especially since the next meeting is due to be held in Pakistan. I do believe that we have already gone a considerable distance with building SAARC and that should be continued. Now there is also the BIMSTEC grouping.

Both PM Modi here and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, when he visited Colombo have made a point of their concerns for the Tamil population in Sri Lanka, and the expectations India has from your government. How do you respond?

We have always understood these concerns. Soon after the war ended [in 2009], we had elections, and we allowed the North to select their own Chief Minister. We held those elections despite knowing we would lose them. But nothing moved after that. We are now expecting to hold our parliamentary elections this April, and after that the provincial council elections. We will appoint a team to go to Jaffna to discuss the way forward.

The way forward on devolution of powers, as was promised in the 13th amendment?

Well, it all has to be discussed. We want to go forward, but we need to have someone to discuss, who can take responsibility for the [Tamil] areas. So the best thing is to hold elections, and then ask for their representatives to come and discuss the future with us. At the moment the TNA (Tamil National Alliance) is not interested in talks. They are asking for things, which the majority community in Sri Lanka will not accept.

President Gotabaya has prioritized development over devolution as the way forward. Is there a difference between your positions?

No, no. People need development. They have suffered for 30 years without it. So first they have to develop the area.

There has been a controversy over the decision to drop the National Anthem in Tamil during Sri Lanka’s national day ceremony. How can you reassure Tamils if this is the signal sent out?

But if you look around the world, the national anthem is sung primarily in one language. In India, you have so many languages, yet on your national days, you sing it one language. Our structure is the same. When I go to Jaffna, to a Tamil school, they sing the anthem in Tamil. We have no objection if people want to sing it in their way. Some political figures are raising this issue; the general public is not interested in this issue.

Your biggest challenge this year will be servicing the domestic and foreign debt, which totals about $60 billion. How do you plan to deal with this issue?

Yes, it is a worry. This is something we discussed with the Indian government as well, and have asked if we could get a moratorium on all loan repayments for three years, until we can revive the economy. If the Indian government takes this step, then other governments might agree to do the same thing, including China. The previous government took so many loans, they beggared the economy, and it is a mess. It all depends on the stand India takes.

This year alone, you have to pay about $5 billion to service the debt, the highest in Sri Lankan history. Will you be able to do that?

We have to do it, and we will manage somehow. We don’t want to default on our debt no matter what happens.

At the same time, you have said that you want China to give back its control of Hambantota port. Is that something President Gotabaya will raise when he goes to Beijing?

We are discussing it, but it is difficult, as the previous government had already completed the handover of control. I think China may agree to our request on some terms, and we will keep the negotiations going.

During a visit to Colombo, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China will ensure that there is no outside interference in Sri Lanka…What did he mean? Was it an indication to the US, or to India or some other country?

I don’t know, you will have to ask him that (laughs). We didn’t take the statement too seriously, as no one has yet tried to interfere in our matters… other than during the last elections [2015]. Then, all the countries got involved in [the elections]. But now we would like to have good relations and work with all the countries.

You mentioned upcoming parliamentary elections. Assuming that you win, as the recent Presidential election results indicate, will you move forward on the 19th amendment, that shifts power from the Presidency to the PM and parliament?

First of all, we have to get rid of the 19th amendment. Then we will think about how we will move forward. [Former Law Minister] G.L. Peiris is already studying it, and we will take opinions on what to do. At the moment, neither the President nor the Parliament has clear powers. So we do have to decide on the division of power. The majority of voters in Sri Lanka voted for President Gotabaya, and that means people want him to have some control of the country’s development and governance, and we must respect that.

Given that the President is also your brother, could the tussle over the 19th amendment cause problems between you?

No, no, no. The way the present constitution is structured and the confusion with the 19th amendment, only two brothers like Gota and I can handle this (Laughs). Otherwise no President and PM will ever agree on this issue.

Finally, what does it feel like to be back here as Prime Minister, after five years, when you visited, but were out of power?

Well, I am grateful to PM Modi for inviting me and receiving me both when I was out of power and now. I never felt the difference, in that sense. Whenever he is ready to visit Sri Lanka now, we are ready to welcome him.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s17s6g/article30771753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJAPAKSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/if-india-agrees-to-postpone-debt-by-3-years-we-can-convince-others-too-says-mahinda-rajapaksa/article30771755.ece
55,2020/02/08,"Ensure domestic airlines modify faulty engines immediately, says Congress RS member Bajwa","Congress Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa has written to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri to take proactive steps in ensuring that domestic airlines flying Airbus A320-Neo aircraft modify their faulty engines immediately.

Mr. Bajwa said the approach of the safety regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is half baked.

“The DGCA is already aware of the reliability issues with the Pratt and Whitney engines in these aircraft. I am astounded that the solution was to have one modified engine installed to ensure that the plane can land if the other the engine develops a technical issue,” he said.

The MP said instead of sticking to its deadline of January 31 for airlines to modify engines, the DGCA extended the deadline by another five months.

“They have allowed this despite the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) putting out a stern warning in December 2019 that using these aircraft with one modified engines is based on the belief that it would never fail and both engines would not stall at the same time. This half-baked approach to safety puts lives at risk,” Mr. Bajwa said.

“The IndiGo, for example, has 106 of these aircraft operating at the moment and the GoAir 41. Reports suggest that IndiGo still has to install these new engines in about 70 of their aircraft....” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v6pdb3/article30771620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PARTAPSINGHBAJWA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ensure-domestic-airlines-modify-faulty-engines-immediately-says-congress-rs-member-bajwa/article30771622.ece
56,2020/02/08,"Keep agri, dairy products out of trade deal with U.S., govt. told","Farmers groups and lobbies, which successfully protested the agricultural and dairy free trade provisions of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) leading to India pulling out of those talks, are now urging the Centre to ensure that agricultural products stay out of the ongoing Indo-U.S. trade negotiations as well.

Reports suggest that with U.S. President Donald Trump set to visit India later this month, Amercian negotiators are pushing hard for the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to facilitate access to the Indian market for major crops including corn, cotton, soybean, wheat and nuts. The U.S. is also keen on reaching a deal to open up the Indian dairy market, which had been hindered by the fact that the U.S. cattle feed often includes non-vegetarian elements.

Indian farm lobbies worry that this could have a disastrous impact on domestic farmers, already facing a struggle to get remunerative prices for their produce.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to show the same political will that he displayed during the RCEP talks and continue to stand firm for the interests of small and marginal farmers,” said S. Kannaiyan, who heads the southern chapter of the Indian Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements. “American dairy farmers receive heavy subsidies. How can there be a level-playing field if they are allowed to dump their products?” he asked, noting that 15 crore livestock farmers — many of whom own only one or two animals — depend on dairy for their livelihood.

Ashwani Mahajan, convenor of the RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch which was vocal in defending the dairy interests during the anti-RCEP protests, expressed confidence that the BJP-led government would protect the farmers now too. “This is a political issue as well. We have expressed our concerns to the government,” he said.

While there are reports that the U.S. has been pushing for amendments to the Indian intellectual property laws, which do not allow for patents on seeds or plants, Mr. Mahajan said this should be a “non-negotiable” issue. “The government of any colour cannot change this,” he said.

Cotton farmers could be especially threatened by an adverse deal, says Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swaraj Vedika in Telengana. “Cotton farming is already in crisis. Farmers are unable to get remunerative prices and a large section of suicides comes from their ranks,” he said. “If U.S. cotton farmers enter India, they can afford to sell at very low prices and undercut the domestic farmer.”

The import of genetically modified crops is also a thorny issue. “Most of the U.S. cotton, soy, corn is GM. While Indian farmers also grow GM cotton, India is yet to allow any GM food crop to be grown here. There are concerns about bio-safety,” said Afsar Jafri, an expert on agricultural trade issues.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bq68uy/article30772185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9TH-COTTON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/keep-agri-dairy-products-out-of-trade-deal-with-us-govt-told/article30771606.ece
57,2020/02/08,Narendra Modi flags Tamil concerns; Mahinda Rajapaksa non-committal,"Sri Lanka wants India to allow debt repayments by Colombo to be deferred for three years, visiting Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said in order to help the country deal with its massive debt burden. The issue was at the top of the agenda when Mr. Rajapaksa met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Saturday and discussed plans to utilise a $400 million Line of Credit extended by India.

“If the Indian government takes this step, then other governments might agree to do the same thing, including China. The previous government took so many loans, they beggared the economy, and it is a mess. It all [now] depends on the stand India takes,” Mr. Rajapaksa told The Hindu in an interview, when asked about plans to service the approximately $60 billion total foreign and domestic debt his government faces, with about $4.8 billion to be paid this year.

Mr. Rajapaksa said he had also requested further financing from India for his government’s nationwide housing project, and discussed other Indian investments planned, including an LNG port, and a joint Indo-Japanese bid for building an oil terminal in Colombo’s Eastern port. However, he made it clear that his government would not carry forward the oil projects in the eastern Trincomalee port that had been agreed to in an MoU signed by his predecessor Ranil Wickremsinghe in April 2017, or an Indian government plan to develop Mattala airport in the south, saying that those had already been “rejected”.

Speaking to the media after their bilateral talks at Hyderabad House, Mr. Modi said he had raised the issue of post-LTTE war reconciliation with Sri Lanka’s Tamil population.

“I am confident that the Government of Sri Lanka will realise the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace, and respect within a united Sri Lanka. For this, it will be necessary to carry forward the process of reconciliation with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka,” Mr. Modi said.

However, in an exclusive interview to The Hindu, Mr. Rajapaksa gave no firm commitment on the way forward for the 13th amendment, which prescribes the devolution of powers to the Tamil minority north and eastern provinces, and ruled out any resolution that was not acceptable to the “majority community” of Sri Lanka. Once parliamentary elections are completed in April this year, which his party is expected to win, the government plans to hold provincial elections, and engage with whomever the Tamil population chooses, he added.

“We want to go forward, but we need to have someone to discuss, who can take responsibility for the [Tamil] areas. So the best thing is to hold elections, and then ask for their representatives to come and discuss the future with us,” Mr. Rajapaksa said. told The Hindu.

India and Sri Lanka discussed enhanced security cooperation and intelligence sharing, especially after the ISIS-inspired Easter Sunday terror attacks last year. According to Mr. Rajapaksa, the two leaders agreed to hold a meeting with the Maldives leadership “as soon as possible” to re-operationalise a security cooperation trilateral arrangement amongst them.

58,2020/02/08,US is India’s preferred trade partner in journey to be $5 trillion economy: Sandhu,"America is India’s preferred trade and business partner in its journey to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, the country’s new envoy to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said.

Addressing a gathering of American business community at a reception hosted in his honour by US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum on Friday, Mr. Sandhu said that the potential for cooperation between the United States and India is limitless.

He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set the goal for India to grow from a $3 trillion economy today to a $5 trillion economy by 2024 and a $10 trillion economy by 2030.

“In this journey, Prime Minister Modi has made it clear that the US is a preferred partner for trade and business,” said the country’s new ambassador to the US.

“The relations between our governments has found a new momentum, getting its energy from the warm friendship between our leaders. US President (Donald Trump) and our Prime Minister (Modi) have met four times last year,” he said.

Observing that people from the business community across both the countries contribute so much to this relationship, he said, adding that entrepreneurs, businessmen and women have been the key stakeholders of India-US ties.

More than 2,000 US companies have a presence in India. Over 200 Indian companies have invested $18 billion in the US, creating more than 100,000 direct jobs. Two-way investment between India and the US reached $60 billion in 2018, Mr. Sandhu said.

Bilateral trade is growing at 10% on a year-to-year basis and reached $160 billion in 2019, he said.

“This makes me bullish about our relationship. The best is yet to come. When US capital and expertise meet the Indian market and Indian mind, we should aim for nothing less but the sky,” Mr. Sandhu said in his address.

Referring to his first stint in Washington DC as a young Indian diplomat in 1997, Mr. Sandhu said he always sensed the potential of the US-India partnership and wondered how it could move forward.

“We are both vibrant democracies, open and multi-cultural societies based on the rule of law. Our partnership today is as natural as it is seamless, based on the strong people-to-people connections. We have become global strategic partners and our collaboration cuts across spheres of activity which was unimaginable two decades ago,” said the top Indian diplomat.

Mr. Sandhu, a 1988-batch Indian Foreign Service official, has had two successful stints at the Indian Embassy in Washington DC - the last one being Deputy Ambassador from July 2013 to January 2017.

59,2020/02/08,"States not bound to make reservation in promotions, says Supreme Court","Reservation in promotion in public posts cannot be claimed as a fundamental right, the Supreme Court reiterated in a judgment.

A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta observed that State governments are not bound to make reservations. Even the courts could not issue a mandamus directing States to provide reservations.

“There is no doubt that the State government is not bound to make reservations. There is no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions. No mandamus can be issued by the court directing the State government to provide reservations,” the apex court observed in its February 7 verdict.

Citing Constitution Bench precedents that had settled the law, the court said Articles 16 (4) and 16 (4-A) of the Constitution did not confer individuals with a fundamental right to claim reservations in promotion.

The Articles empower the State to make reservation in matters of appointment and promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only “if in the opinion of the State they are not adequately represented in the services of the State”.

“The inadequacy of representation is a matter within the subjective satisfaction of the State,” the judgment said.

Thus, the State government has discretion “to consider providing reservations, if the circumstances so warrant”.

“It is settled law that the State government cannot be directed to provide reservations for appointment in public posts. Similarly, the State is not bound to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of promotions,” the apex court explained.

However, if a State wishes to exercise its discretion and make reservation in promotions, it has to first collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a class or community in public services.

If the decision of the State government to provide SC/ST reservation in promotion to a particular public post is challenged, it would have to place the data and prove before the court that reservation was necessary and does not affect the efficiency of administration.

The judgment was based in a batch of appeals pertaining to the reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotions in the posts of Assistant Engineer (Civil) in Public Works Department of Uttarakhand.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egsxj2/article30679238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/states-not-bound-to-make-reservation-in-promotions-says-supreme-court/article30769357.ece

62,2020/02/08,Budget 2020 | Dip in funds for major govt. hospitals in Budget,"Despite increasing patient load, growing cost of healthcare and 100% utilisation of allocated budget in 2019, major government institutes and hospitals across India, catering to the poorest sections of the society, have seen a sharp dip or a minimal hike in the 2020 Budget.

Among the worst hit are PGIMER (Chandigarh); JIPMER (Puducherry), and NIMHANS (Bengaluru). AIIMS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia hospitals in Delhi, which take the bulk of patients from across the country, have seen only a marginal hike in allocation.

As per the proposed Budget for 2020-21 against the revised estimates of 2019-20, PGIMER has seen a ₹333 crore reduction; the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (Imphal) ₹105 crore; JIPMER ₹53 crore and NIMHANS ₹18 crore. AIIMS has seen a hike of only ₹5 crore, Safdarjung ₹3 crore and RML hospital ₹2 crore approximately.

The allocation for the National Health Mission (NHM) has remained the same over the last few years and this year it has been allocated ₹33,400 crore. This is less than last year’s revised estimate of ₹33,789 crore.

Focus on insurance

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced an outlay of about ₹69,000 crore for the health sector in the 2020-2021 Budget. Health, which is at 1.6% of GDP, has ₹6,400 crore earmarked for the Centre’s flagship health insurance scheme, Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), which will also see 20,000 more empanelled hospitals under the PMJAY.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is to get ₹65,011.8 crore, up from ₹62,659.12 crore in 2019-20. The Ministry of AYUSH has been allocated ₹2,122.08 crore, while there is an allocation of ₹2,100 crore to the Department of Health Research.

“While the allocation to the health sector has seen a hike, when we look into the details we can understand that for government hospitals and institutes across India — which are grappling with escalating patient load, treatment costs and larger number of patients needing more expensive treatment — the money allocated is not enough,” said a senior physician at AIIMS, Delhi.

“There is also pressure on building more infrastructure. Primary healthcare, which is the backbone of the healthcare system, hasn’t seen additional proposed allocation, which is another cause of worry given that in India the average cost per hospitalisation varies and is upwards of ₹17,000,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5e1kdf/article30765137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8TH-JIPMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/budget-2020-dip-in-funds-for-major-govt-hospitals-in-budget/article30765138.ece
63,2020/02/08,Boeing to display F-18 compatibility with Indian aircraft carriers,"Boeing will soon demonstrate the compatibility of its F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to take off and land from the decks of Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers. A Navy team is likely to visit the U.S. in the first half of this year to witness the demonstration from a land-based ski jump facility at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.

“Super Hornet Block III is fully compliant with and ideally suited for the Indian Navy’s carrier deck. Demonstrated in flight trials, it can take off from Indian aircraft carriers via ski jump,” Thom Breckenridge, Vice President of Strike, Surveillance & Mobility, Global Sales and Marketing, Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said at Defexpo. Boeing officials at Defexpo indicated that a demonstration would be held without getting into the specifics.

Extensive simulations

The F-18 is in the race for the Indian Navy’s tender for 57 carrier-based fighter jets and competing with Dassault Aviation’s Rafale. Boeing officials said they had done extensive simulations and it would be demonstrated to the Indian Navy when required. One Boeing official said the F-18 could land on Indian carriers without the need to change the arrestor wires.

Steam catapult system

The F-18s are currently launched by a steam catapult system on U.S. aircraft carriers and never operated from a ski jump, which is the mechanism on the INS Vikramaditya and also the indigenous Vikrant that is in advanced stage of construction.

The Navy currently has 45 Russian Mig-29K aircraft which fly from INS Vikramaditya and in future from Vikrant as well. While a third aircraft carrier is still on the drawing board, Navy officials said that once the Navy inducts the second carrier, there would not be enough aircraft to operate from both at the same time as all aircraft are not available all the time.

64,2020/02/08,"Public health policies must be kept out of Indo-U.S. trade talks, say doctors, patients groups","Policies meant to protect public health must be kept out of the purview of trade agreements, Indian medical professionals, researchers, patients and public health activists have said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

They were especially concerned about U.S. demands for removal of price caps on medical devices and the strengthening of intellectual property rights for foreign pharmaceutical companies in the ongoing trade negotiations. A trade deal may be on the cards as U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to visit India later this month.

In mid-January, the Commerce Ministry held a meeting with stakeholders to review India’s patent and IPR laws. “During the meeting, participants from law firms representing their foreign multinational pharmaceutical companies insisted on removing public interest safeguards in the Patents Act such as provisions restricting the scope of patentability, local working as a ground for granting of a compulsory license, pre-grant oppositions,” said the letter. The over 30 signatories included the Campaign for Access to Medicines, All India Drug Action Network and the Delhi Network of Positive People.

They noted that the U.S. has been the biggest critic of the public health friendly provisions enshrined in the Indian IPR laws, and warned that conceding to Washington’s demands would undermine the availability of affordable generic medicines and have a “devastating impact” on all national health programmes.

Removing price controls on medical devices and regulating only trade margins, as the U.S. has demanded, would allow manufacturers to fix very high introductory prices and compromise access to medical devices, the letter said, calling it a “back door attempt” to neutralise the price caps.

“There is no precedent of India negotiating price control policies in trade and it is critical that policies meant to protect public health are kept outside the purview of trade agreements,” it added.

In what is in effect a deposit to be paid into court pending a full trial in the case, Judge David Waksman has set a six-week timeline for such a payment to be made as he concluded that he did not accept Mr. Ambani’s defence that his net worth was nearly zero or that his family would not step in to assist him when push came to shove .

In my overall conclusion, Mr. Ambani has not satisfied me that he can’t make any payment at all, said Judge Waksman, as he expressed particular criticism of a lack of candour and transparency on the part of Mr. Ambani’s defence in reference to his financial means.

The Reliance Group indicated that it plans to appeal against the ruling, which will involve a process of seeking permission to appeal.

Mr. Ambani is reviewing the order of the U.K. Court and will take legal advice as to further remedies in appeal, a spokesperson for Anil Ambani said.

The order pertains to an alleged personal liability of Mr. Ambani and will have no bearing on the operations of the Reliance Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Power Limited and Reliance Capital Limited, the spokesperson said.

The banks — Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Mumbai Branch, on behalf of itself, China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China — welcomed the order and said they remain confident of their claim succeeding at trial.

This is a straightforward debt claim to recover outstanding loans made to RCom (Reliance Communications) in good faith and secured by a binding personal guarantee given by Mr. Ambani, which he has refused to honour, a statement on behalf of the banks said.

We remain very confident in our claim. We hope that Mr. Ambani will comply with the court’s order and look forward to the swift resolution of the case at trial, the statement said.

Another senior Reliance Group official added that based on the legal advice, the RCom chief intends to seek further remedies in appeal and is confident that he will have the opportunity to establish that the Chinese claim is without any merit .

Earlier, during a half-day hearing, the court was told that Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani was a wealthy businessman and now he is not as a result of a “disastrous turn of events” in the telecom market in India.

The Chinese banks had sought summary judgment against Mr. Ambani over an alleged breach of a personal guarantee on a debt refinancing loan of around $925 million in February 2012.

Mr. Ambani, 60, denies providing authority for any such guarantee, resulting in the High Court action in the U.K. — the jurisdiction agreed to as part of the terms of the loan agreement.

At the hearing at the Commercial Division of the High Court of England and Wales in London to set the terms for the “conditional order” granted to three Chinese banks last year against the Reliance Communications (RCom) boss, his legal team sought to establish that his net worth was zero once his liabilities were taken into account.

“The value of Mr. Ambani’s investments has collapsed since 2012. The Indian telecom sector in particular has been dramatically hit by the Indian government’s change of policy in relation to the grant of spectrum,” notes his defence.

“Whereas Mr. Ambani’s investments were worth more than $7 billion in 2012, they are now worth $89 million, and his net worth is zero once his liabilities are taken into account... Quite simply, he was a wealthy businessman, now he is not,” said his barrister Robert Howe.

The banks’ counsel called Mr. Ambani’s claims into question and repeatedly referred to his “lavish lifestyle“.

“So, Mr. Ambani’s assertion is that he is massively personally insolvent, is bankrupt. Has he filed for bankruptcy in India,” questioned Justice David Waksman during the course of the half-day hearing.

Ambani’s legal team, including leading Indian lawyer Harish Salve, responded in the negative, followed by a brief reference in court to India’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) only recently coming into play.

“The evidence overall is that Mr. Ambani could not come close to paying a sum of $700 million into court,” said Mr. Howe.

The banks, represented in court by barrister Bankim Thanki, sought to establish that Mr. Ambani had been “at best economical with the truth” in his evidence statements to the court in relation to his financial means.

They also pointed to a series of instances where Mr. Ambani’s family members had stepped in to bail him out, even as Mr. Ambani’s defence sought to establish that their client had no access to the assets and shares under the name of his mother Kokila, wife Tina Ambani and sons Anmol and Anshul in the form of loans.

“Are we seriously to believe that his own mother, wife, and sons can’t help him in his hour of need for the purpose of complying with a conditional order,” said Mr. Thanki, who claimed Mr. Ambani’s evidence was akin to the proverbial “glossy lipstick on the pig” in terms of some “blatant” lies despite the burden of proof lying with him in the case.

“ADA’s (Anil Dhirajlal Ambani) brother Mukesh is widely regarded as the wealthiest man in Asia and is ranked by Forbes as the 13th richest person in the world and by Bloomberg as the 14th richest person in the world. He has an estimated net worth of $55 to 57 billion,” notes the banks in court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sfpasq/article30766405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THANILAMBANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anil-ambani-to-pay-100-million-in-conditional-order-for-chinese-banks-uk-court/article30766406.ece
66,2020/02/08,"Narendra Modi attributed wrong quote to Omar Abdullah, says Sitaram Yechury","The Opposition parties on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of attributing a wrong quote to former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, saying it was picked from a satire website.

“PM Modi, while replying to the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, in Parliament claimed that statements made by two J&K ex-CMs were not acceptable. It has now been shown that these statements have been taken from satire website Faking News,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote on Twitter.

The party’s Polit Bureau accused Mr. Modi of using false charges to frame Mr. Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti. “That the Modi government should take recourse to such false news for slapping the notorious Public Safety Act (PSA) belies the claims that everything is normal in J&K...,” it said.

On February 6, Mr. Modi said Mr. Abdullah had said dilution of Article 370 would cause a massive earthquake that would divide Kashmir from India.

Hours later, Mr. Abdullah and Ms. Mufti were booked under the PSA. Both have been under arrest since August 5 when the Rajya Sabha approved the withdrawal of the special status from Jammu and Kashmir.

Writing on Twitter, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien indirectly referred to the use of Faking News by Mr. Modi.

He said: “If an MP quotes #FakeNews to mislead #Parliament these options are available. Rule 222. Question of Privilege, Rule 380. Expunction Direction, 115. Write to Speaker Rule 376 Point of order for violation of Rule353 (defamatory) Rule 377 and raising a matter that’s not a point of order.”

67,2020/02/08,Coronavirus | 15 students stranded in China brought to Kochi,"A group of 15 students from Kerala, who were stranded at Kunming airport in China following coronavirus outbreak, landed at Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) around 11 p.m. on Friday.

A communication said the group had been ferried by Air Asia via Bangkok. “Five sterilised ambulances and a team of doctors are arranged at the airport to transport them to Kochi Medical College isolation ward,” the communication, issued an hour ahead of their landing, said, adding that the decision to admit them or advise home-quarantine would be decided after examining them.

Dr. S.

Once the students are at the hospital, we will screen them, collect their blood samples and throat swabs and see whether they need admission,” she said.

68,2020/02/08,"Credit, debit card details of 4 lakh Indians up for sale on dark net","A whopping 98% out of a large packet of sensitive credit and debit card details, that have been put up for sale on the dark net, are those of Indian customers, Group-IB — a Singapore-based cybersecurity company — has revealed.

According to Group-IB’s statement released on Friday, the stash of 4,61,976 card payment details went up for sale on Wednesday on Joker’s Stash, one of the most secretive portals on the dark net for buying such information. Group-IB has already informed Indian authorities about the leak.

The company has also observed that the data is suspected to have been collected from phishing rackets, which are on the rise in India over the last few years.

Superintendent of Police (Maharashtra Cyber) Balsing Rajput said, “We are studying the information and the data and will soon be issuing an advisory in this regard.”

Group-IB’s statement said, “The underground market value of the database is estimated at more than $4.2 million. The source of this batch currently remains unknown. Upon the discovery of this database, Group-IB has immediately informed the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) about the sale of the payment records, so they could take necessary steps.”

Group-IB's threat Intelligence Team has found that the details are comprehensive in nature, and include card numbers, expiration dates, CVV/CVC codes and, in this case, some additional information such as cardholders’ full names, their emails, phone numbers and addresses.

Second major leak

“This is the second major leak of cards relating to Indian banks detected by Group-IB Threat Intelligence team in the past several months. In the current case, we are dealing with so-called fullz — they have info on card number, expiration date, CVV/CVC, cardholder name as well as some extra personal info. Such type of data is likely to have been compromised online — with the use of phishing, malware, or JS-sniffers — while in the previous case, we dealt with card dumps (the information contained in the card magnetic stripe), which can be stolen through the compromise of offline POS terminals, for example,” Dmitry Shestakov, Head of Group-IB cybercrime research unit said.

JavaScript or JS-Sniffers are programmes used for stealing credit and debit card information from e-commerce websites, and are among the latest concerns when it comes to cybersecurity and theft of sensitive card details.

In October 2019, Group-IB Threat Intelligence team had detected the first such database of over 1.3 million credit and debit card records, mostly of Indian customers.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qar6ff/article30766137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9th-card,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/credit-debit-card-details-of-4-lakh-indians-up-for-sale-on-dark-net/article30766138.ece
69,2020/02/08,Government set to host another visit by foreign diplomats to J&K,"The government is making preparations to organise a second visit of diplomats, including several European Ambassadors to visit Srinagar and Jammu next week, sources confirmed here.

According to the sources, about 20 to 25 envoys from “different geographical regions” are being invited to join the delegation.

Unlike the last visit in January, when European Union (EU) members declined to travel, and asked to be sent as a combined group of 27 members, this time, several members of the EU have agreed to visit, sources said.

Meeting with EU heads

On Friday, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met the EU Heads of Mission (HOMs) in South Block, where he is understood to have discussed his upcoming visit, the planned visit of envoys to Jammu and Kashmir as well as concerns against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which are likely to come up during his visit to Europe.

“We received a lot of positive feedback from the last visit,” said one official source, referring to the delegation, which included U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster, who travelled to Jammu and Kashmir on January 9-10.

“While all the Ambassadors expressed their concerns about issues like political detentions and Internet restrictions, they were able to see that there was normalcy on the roads, and the entire Union Territory is not under lockdown as they had expected,” the source added.

He explained that the government now intends to take diplomats to the Union Territory on a regular basis.

Other sources confirmed that logistical planning and security arrangements for the visit, which will repeat the schedule of the previous visit of the envoys, is being finalised. Helicopters will also be kept on standby, in case there are difficulties in road travel at any point.

Briefing by Army

The visit will include a briefing by Army officials, and meetings with civil society members and politicians chosen by the government.

Diplomatic sources said negotiations over the scope and schedule of the proposed visit have been on for the past month, and had run into issues over the specific demands by the European diplomats to meet detained former Chief Ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah.

It is unlikely that these demands would be met this time either, as the government has just charged all of them under the stringent Public Safety Act.

Both the officials and diplomats said they would aim to avoid some of the controversies that cropped up during previous visits by the diplomats, as well as one by a delegation of MEPs to Kashmir in October 2019.

The visit would be timed just before the visit by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to Germany for the Munich Security Conference next weekend (February 14-16). He will then travel to Brussels to meet with European Union (EU) officials on February 17, where he will discuss Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Brussels for the EU-India summit on March 13.

On Friday, Mr. Jaishankar met with the EU Heads of Mission (HOMs) in South Block, where he is understood to have discussed his upcoming visit, the planned visit of envoys to Jammu and Kashmir as well as concerns against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which are likely to come up during his visit to Europe.

Last month members of the EU Parliament (MEPs) held a debate on a resolution that was deeply critical of India for actions against the anti-CAA protestors, and the “risk of statelessness for millions” from a possible NRC survey. However, the MEPs agreed to hold off on voting the resolution until after visits by Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Modi, who would meet them and engage with them on the issues involved.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tlbte5/article30766042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08KASHMIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-set-to-host-another-visit-by-foreign-diplomats-to-jk/article30766043.ece
70,2020/02/08,Mehbooba Mufti was working with separatists: Public Safety Act dossier,"The Public Safety Act (PSA) dossier, based on which former Chief Minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has been booked include public remarks allegedly made by her against the Army, pro-militant tweets and attempts “to collaborate with separatists”.

The Hindu has learnt that the dossier against Ms. Mufti underlines that there were “confidential reports” suggesting she was “collaborating with the separatists”.

It also mentions tweets, where she called for “dignity to militants after death” and accused “the Army of using chemical weapons against them”. The dossier also mentions her tweets opposing the triple talaq law passed by the BJP-led government and critical remarks over the lynching of Muslims in the country.

Public speeches made by Ms. Mufti and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah of the National Conference on the issue of Articles 370 and 35A are also listed in the dossiers compiled against them.

Terming Ms. Mufti “a vocal voice” against the Centre’s move reading down Article 370, the dossier accessed by The Hindu listed a number of speeches made by her and specifically mentioned two controversial speeches.

Explained | What is Article 35A?

In a speech in July 2019, she is cited as having said: “Article 35A kay saath cheed chaad karna barood ko haath laganay kay barabar hoga. Jo haath 35A ke saath chhedd chaadd karne ke liye uthenge wo haath hi nahi wo saara jism jal ke raakh ho jaega.” Asserting that tampering with Article 35A would be akin to lighting a powder keg, she is said to have warned that any such tampering would engulf the hands making such an attempt.

In another speech, she is claimed to have said: “No one will be left in J&K to unfurl the tricolour if Article 370 goes”.

Explained | The Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act

The dossier used to justify Mr. Abdullah’s detention under PSA also mentions speeches made by him in defence of Articles 370 and 35A in the past few years and warning that any revocation would reopen the debate on the Instrument of Accession.

“Mr. Abdullah and Ms. Mufti haven’t been jailed for ‘provocative comments’,” said Ms. Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti. “Their crime was to question the Centre for its illegal actions in J&K. Just because BJP intentionally conflates itself with India doesn’t mean it is India. The message is clear. Criticise BJP at your own peril,” she added.

NC leader and Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi said, “These PSAs belie the claims of normalcy. The PSA is being used to stifle dissent and disagreement, which is at the core of democracy.”

PDP spokesman Firdous Tak said the conscientious people of the country and the world should take note of these undemocratic measures. “Will they now book all those who have filed petitions and challenged the Centre’s move to revoke Article 370 and Article 35A?” asked Mr. Tak.

Separately, official sources said security agencies and magistrates were preparing dossiers to book more mainstream politicians under the PSA in the coming days. About 11 political leaders including Ms. Mufti’s close confidant, the PDP’s Naeem Akhtar, and J&K Peoples Movement chief Shah Faesal are still lodged in Srinagar’s MLA Hostel. Many of them will complete their six months of preventive detention under Sections 107 and 151 of the CrPC on Sunday. Sources said another four leaders were likely to be released soon.

NC’s Ali Muhammad Sagar’s ability to mobilise people to visit polling booths during boycott calls given by the separatists has been made a ground to slap PSA against him. Similarly, PDP’s Sartaj Madni’s ability to influence locals to protest, like in 2009 and 2016, and his having allegedly authored a document on ‘self rule’ are listed as the key grounds for using PSA against him.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fb5ifu/article30764980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8TH-MUFTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/omar-mehboobas-speeches-on-article-370-cited-as-grounds-for-psa/article30764981.ece

Mr. Yadav received the award from Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, at the 23rd National Conference on e-Governance held in Mumbai.

Mr. Yadav said that the RPTMS project was effectively implemented under the guidance of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Special Chief Secretary Neerabh Kumar Prasad, resulting in an improved environment.

As part of reforms introduced by the Pollution Control Board, the RTPMS was designed to curb pollution in the State. Under this system, when an industry exceeds the stipulated pollution standards, an SMS alert is automatically sent to the respective industrial unit and the local officials to take immediate remedial measures, and notices are served on the units that fail to comply with the standards.

The national e-Governance award is announced after scrutiny by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances under the Union Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.

The conference was conducted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), Directorate of Information Technology (DIT) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

Addressing the gathering, former Minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao said it was strange that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had endorsed the idea of developing the Vijayawada-Guntur region as the capital, changed his stance after coming to power.

His proposal to have three capitals was irrational, and he seemed to be least bothered about the concerns of the farmers who had given their valuable land for the future of the State, Mr. Rao observed.

He expressed regret that those resisting the shifting of the capital from Amaravati were being portrayed as opposed to the development of the Uttarandhra and Rayalaseema regions.

74,2020/02/08,China’s coronavirus crisis rattles granite barons in Prakasam,"Granite barons back home are worried about a decline in exports as China, a major market, continues to battle the coronavirus epidemic.

Chinese nationals visiting granite units in the district has been a regular sight. They usually visit several units in search of high-quality granite blocks which will be exported to Chinese cities. Now, their footfalls have dwindled as a fallout of the deadly epidemic that has gripped the central Chinese city of Wuhan, with local granite barons in Chimakurthy fearing a slump in business until the eastern neighbour gets on top of the nCoV situation.

Much of the world-famous granite mined in the district finds its way to Beijing and other Chinese cities. Exports of rough blocks began ahead of the Summer Olympics held in Beijing in 2008. Now, the granite industry is keeping its fingers crossed, waiting for the dreaded virus to be rooted out.

China accounts for at least 80% of about 1.30 lakh cubic metres of rough blocks quarried per year, according to sources in the Mines Department.

While exports to China will be impacted in the short run, now is a good time for domestic granite processing units to step up exports of value-added granite slabs to the United States, Europe and West Asian countries, feel industry veterans at the Gullapalli Growth Centre who are looking forward to cash in on the trade war between China and the U.S.

“We are hoping that the coronavirus is tackled quickly. A clear picture is likely to emerge only after a couple of months as rough granite blocks that have already been shipped off are anchored in ports or have not been lifted,” they said.

Silver lining

Experts said that while exports to China have halted, there is the possibility of finding new markets across the globe as importers might be wary of sourcing value-added household surfacing material from China and can turn to India instead. This can prove to be a blessing in disguise for exporters of processed granite slabs, said an official at the Building Products Special Economic Zone which is promoted by the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) at Gullapalli.

“We hope to see an encouraging demand for natural-coloured material from overseas buyers this year,” Jyothi Granite Exports Chief Operating Officer M. Shivaram said in a conversation with The Hindu here.

Export of natural stone material like Black Pearl, Steel Grey, Viscount White, Moon White and River White from the SEZ is likely to go up by more than 20% from 60,000 cubic metres of processed material from the 100% export-oriented units in the SEZ and elsewhere in the district last year, feels Krishnasai Granites executive director Bharat.

Meanwhile, local granite cutting and polishing units, who have been facing a shortage of quality slabs for processing, hope to get it in the wake of the dip in demand from overseas players.

“We have been requesting successive State Governments for 40% quota of rough blocks for domestic consumption but have failed to get a positive response. Now, the situation is likely to improve to our advantage,” Granite Industries’ Association president Y. Koteswara Rao said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/itarrb/article30772380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-VJ-GRANITEMINING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chinas-coronavirus-crisis-rattles-granite-barons-in-prakasam/article30772381.ece
75,2020/02/08,Rice cards will be given on saturation basis: Minister,"The government is keen on giving rice ration cards on a saturation basis, Minister for Civil Supplies Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) has said.

In a press release here on Saturday, Mr. Rao said that it would be a continuous process starting from April.

The cards would be issued within five days of making an application at the ward and village secretariats during the Spandana programme that would be held every day.

“The rice cards are not linked to pension, fee reimbursement, Aarogyasri, or any other scheme,” the Minister said.

The rice card holders were identified by the ward and village volunteers in the ‘YSR Navasakam’ survey, and a social audit was done to ensure that the cards did not end up in the hands of ineligible persons.

The list of selected beneficiaries would be displayed at the secretariats and things would be finalised after duly taking any objections and pleas into account.

Of the 1,47,23,567 white ration card - holders, 10 lakh were not taking rice and a large number of others were found to be ineligible to possess the cards.

‘Focus is on quality’

The focus of the government was to distribute quality rice.

The rice, which was given under the PDS during the TDP rule, was unfit for consumption, he said. As a consequence, a substantial quantity of rice used to be sold by the card-holders against norms, the Minister added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rice-cards-will-be-given-on-saturation-basis-minister/article30772376.ece
76,2020/02/08,YSRCP begins campaign on English medium ahead of local body elections,"The State government, which is keen to introduce English medium education in all government schools from the 2020-21 academic year, has launched a campaign to get mileage on the issue ahead of local body elections.

Though the Bill in this regard is yet to be passed in the AP Legislative Council, YSRCP leaders are hopeful that all hurdles would be cleared in a couple of months with the abolition of the Council itself.

In this backdrop, the party has been holding a series of meetings across the State by sending delegations comprising senior retired bureaucrat P.V. Ramesh, actor R. Narayana Murthy, former MLC Jupudi Prabhakara Rao and others to explain the benefits of English medium education for the children of Dalit and backward class families.

The teams have already toured Kurnool, Chittoor, Tirupati, Nellore, Ongole, Rajamahendravaram, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and other towns and have held seminars and interactions with intellectuals and teachers’ associations. R. Narayana Murthy, protagonist in many revolutionary movies and now a film producer, said that the denial of proper education for many years has been the main reason for the continuous backwardness of many sections of society.

“Fortunately, education is now available for free for all downtrodden sections. While it will help them get a livelihood, a significant change in their lives is possible only with English medium education. A remarkable change can be achieved in generations to come. That is why I am touring several places in support of the move to introduce mandatory English medium education in all government schools,” Mr. Narayana Murthy said.

‘Equal footing’

Former MLC Jupudi Prabhakara Rao said that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, who made invaluable contributions to the uplift of Dalits, had strongly advocated education for children in English as it would offer them an equal footing with other sections of society and prevent discrimination and exploitation of human resources.

“Many TDP leaders are shedding crocodile tears over the possible neglect of the Telugu language. Nothing would happen to the mother tongue as Telugu will continue to be a mandatory subject as promised by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Mr. Prabhakara Rao said.

77,2020/02/08,CM launches ‘Disha App’,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was on Saturday dismayed at the scale of atrocities against women and children reported since 2014.

Addressing a gathering after launching the ‘Disha App’ here, Mr. Reddy said that 5,046 cases of rape and 21,510 cases of sexual assault on minor girls had been reported in the State between 2014 and 2018.

The Chief Minister, however, was of the view that none had the right to eliminate the accused, however gruesome their atrocities might be, as law should ultimately takes its own course.

Giving a break-up of the number of sexual assault cases, he said, it was 4,032 in 2014; 4,114 in 2015; 4,477 in 2016; 4,672 in 2017; and 4,215 in 2018.

Referring to the number of rape cases, he said, it was 937 in 2014; 1,004 in 2015; 963 in 2016; 1,046 in 2017; and 1,096 in 2018.

“A whopping 5,840 mobile teams have been deployed across the State for the rescue of women in distress,” said Mr. Reddy.

Each of the 18 Disha Police Stations in the State will have a dedicated team. The total strength at each police station will be between 36 and 47, and half of the personnel will be women.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/odg1xq/article30772354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-vj-disha-appcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cm-launches-disha-app/article30772355.ece
78,2020/02/08,CAA does not discriminate against Indians: Venkaiah,"Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) did not discriminate against Indian citizens, and was only about people who were discriminated against in the neighbouring countries, which were theocratic.

“India is a country of ‘sarva dharma samabhava’ (secular) and has not persecuted anyone. It is neither expansionist nor colonial. It believes in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, and sharing and caring is its core philosophy,” Mr. Naidu said here on Saturday while addressing a meeting at GITAM (Deemed to be) University after a book titled, ‘A Child of Density - An Autobiography’, authored by its Chancellor Koneru Rama Krishna Rao, was released.

If people who were originally Indians were persecuted, it was the country’s duty to take care of them, he said.

“If you read the Act, there is no mention of discrimination and any Act, whether it is CAA, Triple Talaq, or abrogation of Article 370, it must be studied thoroughly and understood,” Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said.

‘Disinformation campaign’

Lot of disinformation campaign was going on, and there were people interested in creating negative opinion about India, he said, asserting that Kashmir was an integral part of India and there was no question of giving an inch (of Kashmir) to anybody, however loud they might shout.

Article 370, which was a temporary clause for 70 years, was abrogated by Parliament.

It was the discussion some countries were indulging in that forced me to make a statement on the Floor of the House, and I am reiterating it, “No country has any business to interfere in the internal affairs of India, and we are capable to decide.”

Parliament had already announced that PoK was also a part of India, he added.

Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, who is Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, said that he was saddened and deeply disturbed by what had happened in Parliament on Friday, and expressed anguish over the fall in the level of debate in the legislatures and the kind of language used.

New curriculum

The Vice-President said the new curriculum to be worked out based on the recommendations of the Dr. Kasturirangan Committee should utilise look into the history, culture and tradition, and bringing about considerable changes even while utilising the new technological opportunities.

Mr. Naidu said there was a need to learn several languages, particularly English, in the competitive world, but the focus should be on laying foundation in the mother tongue.

The Vice-President showered praise on Prof. Rama Krishna Rao, calling him a multifaceted genius, an accomplished scientist, and a steadfast Gandhian.

He recalled his contribution to parapsychology, his services as Vice-Chancellor and as Chairman of the A.P. State Council of Higher Education under former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao. He also recalled the vision of GITAM founder M.V.V.S. Murthy.

Prof. Rama Krishna Rao said youth should work with the motto of service.

79,2020/02/08,Centre cannot poke its nose into State’s policies: GVL,"Calling the concept of three capitals “fallacious,” BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao made it clear on Saturday that his party could not do anything beyond a political fight for retaining the seed capital in Amaravati because the Central government would not take decisions as per the convenience of the State party leaders.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s plan, which anyone could see through, was to take everything to Visakhapatnam, which would reduce Amaravati to a namesake capital for legislative functions till he got over the legal tangles, Mr. Rao observed.

What was passed in the State BJP’s core committee meeting on January 11 was only a political resolution (for continuing the capital in Amaravati), and the Central government had nothing to do with it.

“There is so far no official communication from the State government on the proposed development of three capitals,” Mr. Rao said, and insisted it did not add any economic value.

‘Wishful thinking’

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu here, Mr. Narasimha Rao said the BJP favoured Amaravati as the capital city of Andhra Pradesh as there was a political consensus at that time.

It was against shifting the capital because things had to be started all over again, and huge tracts of fertile land on the banks of the Krishna had been pooled for the construction of the much-hyped greenfield city, he said.

To expect that the Centre would intervene was nothing but wishful thinking, as it cannot intrude into the affairs of any State.

“The Central government may have the power to get into matters concerning the States. But it will intervene only when there is a constitutional breakdown, or in extreme cases. This is because there is a clear line between the Central government and the party,” Mr. Rao observed.

“There are States that challenged the authority of the Central government in deciding the citizenship of an individual though they have no say in it. Similarly, States have the right to develop their capital cities and take other policy decisions, in which the Centre cannot poke its nose. If we intervene on some pretext or the other, where will it all end?” Mr. Rao wondered, pointing out that if and when the Central government’s views were sought on the three capitals, it would state that in the constitutional scheme of things, the Centre could not meddle with the States’ policies.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cr2jb5/article30772276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-vj-gvl-quotecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-cannot-poke-its-nose-into-states-policies-gvl/article30772277.ece

81,2020/02/08,BSNL to finalise services outsourcing soon,"Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited(BSNL) in Anantapur district lost 200 of its employees on February 1 when they decided to take voluntary retirement accepting the offer given by the telecom giant. Now, BSNL is eagerly waiting for the finalisation of outsourcing of the maintenance of last-mile section through external agencies.

While the BSNL is going the extra-mile to maintain its services - both landline and cellular with existing staff, it expects to get the new agencies to take up the Pillar to Sub-office portion maintenance after doing the fault analysis and resolving it within the shortest possible time. Saturday is the last day for bidding the contracts, which have been floated with an upset price of ₹35 per connection and the lowest bidder gets the contract.

Entire district has 540 cellular towers at 345 locations and their maintenance has also become a herculean task with shortage of staff. The BSNL Senior General Manager Y. Siva Sankar Reddy told The Hindu that tenders have been called for the maintenance of the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS).

4G cellular services

“These tenders are likely to be finalised by February-end and new agencies might start working from the first week of March to share the burden of the BSNL staff, especially at the lower / ground level,” he said.

While the BSNL does not support 4G cellular services, if the government takes the decision, 135 of the existing cell towers are capable of supporting 4G services in the district. District has been divided into five zones depending on the density of telecom subscribers and tenders have been called for maintenance of towers based on the need.

Out of the 20 Customer Service Centres all over the district only 15 are functional now and manpower is being awaited to make the others also operational at the earliest. In many of the 15 CSCs only one person is handling all the requests.

The Fibre To Home internet connections in Anantapur are slowly growing and 1,700 people have opted for it compared to 11,329 of the slower broadband connection through copper cable. Two other private internet service providers also offer Fibre To Home internet connections in Anantapur city by taking the bandwidth from the BSNL.

83,2020/02/08,Efforts on to create world-class auto ecosystem in State: Minister,"Hoping that the Indian automobile industry will produce world-class and affordable electric vehicles by emerging from the shadows of trailblazers like Tesla, Minister for Industries and Commerce Mekapati Goutham Reddy has said efforts are under way to create the kind of ecosystem in the State that the private sector requires to make their impression in the global arena.

Andhra Pradesh is focusing on building the automotive ecosystem by engaging the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) along the Visakhapatnam-Chennai and Chennai-Bengaluru industrial corridors, according to the Minister.

Speaking at the 2020 Auto Expo in New Delhi on Saturday, Mr. Goutham Reddy said potential suppliers of KIA Motors which has a plant in Anantapur district, and other large automakers were enquiring about the opportunities for establishing their component manufacturing units in the State, where Isuzu Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, THK and others have already invested over $4.50 billion.

He observed that A.P. was the first State in south India to offer 24X7 electricity to industry and has a dedicated policy for incentivising electric mobility. Besides, A.P. has targeted the phase-out of all fossil fuel-based commercial fleet and logistics vehicles from the top four cities.

The Minister further said indigenising and adapting to the local market needs was the key to success in the highly lucrative and competitive Indian auto market and its example was right in A.P., i.e. KIA Motors.

‘KIA plans expansion’

He informed the gathering that KIA Motors was planning to scale up its capacity from two lakh units per annum to three lakh at the existing plant in Anantapur by the end of this year or early 2021. Though KIA Motors was a recent entrant to the emerging automotive ecosystem in India, it has a strong multiplier effect for A.P. due to forward and backward linkages to diverse segments of the State economy.

86,2020/02/08,Transport Department unearths major vehicle scam by JC brothers,"The Andhra Pradesh Transport Department has announced that it has unearthed a major scam by former Anantapur MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy’s brother J.C. Prabhakar Reddy’s family. They were alleged to have got Bharat Standard (BS) III vehicles illegally registered and brought them to Anantapur from Kohima in Nagaland.

Joint Commissioner Transport S.A.V. Prasad Rao (Road Safety) at a press conference here on Saturday said a case was filed in Anantapur I Town Police Station on Saturday with regard to 66 trucks plying in Anantapur and Kadapa districts, that were not BS-IV compliant. The BS-III vehicles were illegally registered in Kohima (Nagaland) and transferred to Tadipatri within two to 15 days with an NOC (No Objection Certificate) from Nagaland.

Driving fraud

Following a complaint received by the Department, it conducted its own investigation by sending officers to Kohima and found some ‘shocking’ details. When the Department officers digged out the permanent and temporary addresses of the persons/companies that got them registered there, they found details with certified copies of the original documents submitted at the time of registration in August - September 2018, related to six lorries (160 bhp capacity, 10, 12 & 14 wheelers), which were purportedly bought from Hosur and Uttarakhand dealers of Ashok Leyland.

When cross-checked with Ashok Leyland on January 10 about the Chassis and Engine Numbers of these BS-III vehicles, the company replied through e-mail on January 23 that they were sold as scrap, as they were unregistrable and ‘no’ records were uploaded onto the Vahan portal. From the Kohima Road Transport/Registration Office, the A.P. officials got documents that showed as if all of these 66 vehicles were BS-IV compliant and Purchased from dealers in Hosur and Uttarakhand for a business in Kohima.

Family involvement

Signatures on the registration documents pertained to J.C. Prabhakar Reddy’s wife J.C. Uma Reddy and C. Gopal Reddy representing C. Gopal Reddy and Company and Jatadhara Industries Private Limited, with headquarters at Tadipatri. These vehicles (NL01AC - 1087, 1077, 3680, 3676, 3679 and 1066) were brought to Anantapur with NOCs from Kohima within 15 days of registration and re-registered in Andhra Pradesh at various times.

All these vehicles reportedly ply in Tadipatri and Kadapa regions to carry goods related to cement factories. Anantapur Deputy Transport Commissioner N. Sivaram Prasad lodged the complaint with the police seeking a probe against manufacturers, dealers or the buyers to find out who was primarily responsible for the alleged fraud.

Giving details of the case, Mr. Prasad Rao said: “As per the Supreme Court directive, from April 1, 2017, BS-III vehicles were not to be registered and 50 per cent less polluting BS-IV vehicles only registered. But C. Gopal Reddy and Company and Jatadhara Industries Private Limited, with permanent address at Tadipatri got 66 of them registered as BS-IV vehicles and sold them to several people after bringing them to Anantapur, thus selling BS-III scrap as BS-IV original vehicles.”

Scam could be bigger

The size of the scam unearthed so far will be determined by the Police Department and the Mr. Prasad Rao does not rule out more number of such vehicles plying in the country.

This illegal method could be another potential danger in the coming months when BS-VI emission norms become compulsory from April 1 all over the country for registration of new vehicles, officials point out.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-transport-dept-unearths-major-vehicle-scam-by-jc-brothers/article30770366.ece

Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, ahead of the Durgadevi Jatra at Bommasamudra in Gadag district, the swami said owing to superstitions, temples were being converted into slaughterhouses particularly during annual jatras (fairs).

The seer said that while the district administrations of respective districts should take measures to prevent animal sacrifice around temple premises, Hindutva outfits and Dalit organisations should come forward to sensitise people against sacrificing animals in the name of religion.

He said that while there was a law to prohibit animal sacrifice, unless people were sensitised, such practices would continue. Quoting the order of the Karnataka High Court dated September 2019, he said the State was bound to take action in accordance with law, in view of the mandate of Article 51A of the Constitution of India and the provisions of Prevention of Animal Sacrifices Act, 1959 and Karnataka Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

The seer said that he had held a first round of meeting with the district administration of Gadag and the authorities were taking steps to prevent animal sacrifices during the mahotsav at Bommasamudra, which will be held from February 10 to 15.

“However I would urge the administration to set up checkposts at various points on the roads leading to Bommasamudra and also distribute pamphlets against animal sacrifice and make public announcement on the same in all the towns and villages in the region. I will also request the administration to speak to the temple committee and give suitable directions to prevent animal sacrifice”, he said.

To a query, the seer said that apart from taking action against violators, more impetus should be given to awareness. “Along with volunteers, we will tour villages in Gadag from Sunday to convince people to not to make the temple a slaughterhouse. The ‘Ahimsa Prani Daya Yatra’ will begin from Gadag and we hope to cover as many places as possible,” the seer said.

Ibrahim has said that the BJP is deliberately trying to create a wrong narrative to make the stir against CAA look like a Hindu-Muslim issue.

“We see people from cross-sections of society are against CAA, yet the BJP is making every effort to project it as Hindu-Muslim fight,” he said.

Addressing presspersons on Saturday, Mr. Ibrahim said after having lost all communal issues such as Ram Mandir and triple talaq, the BJP was harping on CAA to give communal colour to the stir. Stating that the BJP planned to change the constitution to remove reservation given to Dalits, he wondered why all BJP MPs of the Dalit community were keeping quiet. “The constitution has given reservation to Dalits and not Muslims, therefore, if the Dalits wants to protect their future, they must raise voice against the BJP” he said.

Accusing the BJP of failing on all fronts of development, Mr. Ibrahim said that according to the CAG, the government had not given quality food and clothing to soldiers in Siachen. “PM Narendra Modi gives long speeches, but he never mentions promises of two crore jobs, bringing back black money from foreign banks, and ‘Acche din’ to people. All he talks of Kashmir, Pakistan etc. The BJP seems to be obsessed with Pakistan, which is why its keeps chanting only Pakistan all the time”,” he said.

110,2020/02/08,"CESC proposes power tariff hike, industry cries foul","The manufacturing and industrial sector in Mysuru is bracing for a showdown with the Chamudeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) which has sought a hike in power tariff.

The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) will conduct a public hearing at the Deputy Commissioner’s office on February 11 in this connection and the stakeholders have joined hands to oppose the proposed hike.

The Mysore Industries Association and the Karnataka Laghu Udyog Bharathi are among the various stakeholders who will table their objections to the proposed hike as it affects their financials.

“Contrary to the hike proposed by the CESC we will seek a reduction in the fare by 60 paise per unit as there is surplus power in the State. In addition, there was copious rains and hydel generation was high and the State was tapping alternative source of energy like solar and wind to generate power’, said Suresh Kumar Jain of Karnataka Laghu Udyog Bharathi.

There is a general perception that the hike tends to be ‘nominal’ and the industry can afford to meet it. But contrary to the popular belief, the burden is immense on the industries as the power consumption is high depending on the size and scale of the unit. “In case of a unit consuming 15,000 to 20,000 units per month the additional burden will be in the range of ₹9,000 to ₹12,000 over and above the existing fare and will eat into the bottomline’’, said Mr. Jain.

Another member of the MIA said the industrial sector was still reeling due to the impact of the economic slowdown and had not yet come out of the doldrums. There is a proposal to increase the water tariff as well. This being the case there is no scope for a hike in power tariff, said the member. This adds to the production cost which will be passed on the consumer who has to bear the burden in the final analysis, he added.

CESC has sought a hike on the grounds that there is a mismatch between the revenue receipts from the existing tariffs and the revenue requirement and the hike was a must to bridge the deficit.

It said the revenue deficit was to the tune of ₹113.26 crore for the financial year 2018-19 which increased to ₹630.74 crore during 2019-20 and has projected a revenue deficit of Rs.475.50 crore for 2020-21.

The CESC has also claimed that the average cost of supply of power was more than the average rate of realisation and the deficit per unit was 68 paise per unit during the financial year 2020-21.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cesc-proposes-power-tariff-hike-industry-cries-foul/article30769961.ece
111,2020/02/08,"Portfolio allocation will be done on February 10, says Chief Minister Yediyurappa","Amid growing pressure from newly inducted ministers for plum ministries, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday said the portfolio allocation will be done on February 10.

“Everything is ready but since today (Saturday) is a holiday, we will allot portfolios on Monday morning,” he said. While rewarding with Cabinet berth 10 defectors who helped the BJP bring down the Congress-JD(S) coalition and come to power, Mr. Yediyurappa on Thursday announced that the portfolios will be allotted before Saturday.

He also ruled out going to Delhi to decide filling the remaining six vacant ministerial posts. “At present I am not going but the portfolio distribution will happen on Monday,” Mr. Yediyurappa told reporters here on Saturday.

According to BJP sources, the Chief Minister apparently deferred the portfolio allocation allegedly due to pressure from Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi, who has been insisting on the Water Resource Department portfolio, while the party leadership wanted to give him the portfolio of Public Works Department.

Mr. Jarkiholi had a detailed discussion at Mr. Yediyurappa’s house till the early hours of Saturday and left the place displeased, the sources claimed. The Cabinet expansion on Thursday led to discontent among a section of “native” BJP leaders who were left out of the exercise as the party sought to contain dissidence in the face of intense lobbying for berths by several contenders.

The expansion has taken the strength of the Cabinet to 28, with six vacancies now.

Khader,"Citing many issues in which the State has not received support, from the Mahadayi water dispute to flood relief and devolution of funds, former Minister and Congress leader U.T. Khader on Saturday alleged that the Centre was treating Karnataka as an “enemy”.

Speaking to presspersons here, he said the State had got a raw deal despite electing 25 BJP members to the Lok Sabha and having three Ministers in the Union Cabinet. “The budget document announced ₹18,600 crore for suburban railway in Bengaluru. But ultimately, the amount earmarked for the project is ₹1 crore. How can any BJP leader justify this?” he asked.

He also came down heavily on the State police for registering a sedition case over the staging of a skit at a school in Bidar. “In contrast, they did not act when a school in Kalladka in Dakshina Kannada exhibited a dance-drama depicting the demolition of Babri Masjid. I understand that the police are under pressure. But they should uphold professional ethics,” he said.

‘BJP leaders afraid’

Meanwhile, former Minister D.K. Shivakumar said BJP leaders have kept quiet despite the “grave injustice done to Karnataka” out fear of the party high command. He demanded to know what had happened to the notification of the Mahadayi tribunal verdict and how the promised railway coach factory at Kolar had been downgraded to a composite workshop.

The court was also informed that these 205 candidates had been identified by a committee headed by Deputy Commissioners of respective districts and their selection had been approved by the Principal District Judge of the districts concerned.

These candidates were selected taking into consideration their aggregate percentage of marks in the LLB examination and the final list had been submitted to the Department of Prosecution, which would soon issue appointment letters.

An affidavt in this regard was filed before a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, during the hearing of a PIL petition initiated suo motu by the HC on the issue of severe shortage of public prosecutors (PPs) in various taluk and district courts across the State as non-availability of prosecutors had delayed trial of criminal cases.

115,2020/02/08,Readers should be evaluators: HSV,"H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, president, 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, had to face questions on some of the contentious issues of recent times, during an interaction with selected individuals on the concluding day of the three-day event on Friday.

Srishaila Nagaral wanted to know Mr. Murthy’s stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The writer said in response, without spelling out his stand in black-and-white, “There is a need to make people clearly understand it. We should ensure that the country continues to be united. We should have faith in the all-inclusive policy as Amartya Sen said. We need to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar.”

Kalaburagi-based journalist Shivaranjan Satyampet asked Mr. Murthy to describe the logic behind his proposal to make Sanskrit, a language that was kept away from the majority of the toiling masses, as a possible link language. The president said he was opposed to making a language of one State or region a link language. “It was my suggestion to develop either Sanskrit or Prakrit which had an all-India presence as the link language. If the majority disagrees with me, let them develop their preferred language as a link,” he said.

Journalist Jogi asked Mr. Murthy whether writers should confine themselves to the creation of literature or if they should take to social activism. “A writer can be an activist. But it cannot be mandatory or a precondition. A writer should show his commitment more towards writing than towards activism. He should write in such a way that it comforts and does good to society,” Mr. Murthy said.

When writer Vasudhendra asked Mr. Murthy’s about his stance on the trend of the State banning literary works, he held that writers should be free to write and express their minds. “The duty of the writer is to write. Evaluation and criticism should be left to the readers,” Mr. Murthy said, also without spelling out his stand on the State banning books.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e6wqpa/article30766693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGMURTHYSAMMELANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/readers-should-be-evaluators-hsv/article30766696.ece
116,2020/02/08,"Now, spreading rumours on paper leakage can get students debarred","Students who spread rumours about paper leakage for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) or the second year pre-university examinations to be held in March and April this year will be debarred from the examination. This includes forwarding messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

For several years now, copying during the examination, helping other students, and so on, has been considered a malpractice. Now, students who indulge in rumours will also be considered as having committed malpractice and will not be allowed to appear for the examinations if found guilty.

At a press conference on Friday, S.R. Umashankar, Principal Secretary of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said that students are put to hardship as they fall prey to rumours. “In an attempt to put an end to this practice, we are planning to include spreading rumours as a malpractice,” he said.

Instead, students who hear rumours can alert the department so that an investigation is carried out, an official said. “Several times students take an old question paper and change the date and circulate it and tell other students that it is the question paper of the ongoing exam. This leads to panic among students and affects their preparation,” said Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar.

This decision was taken after a meeting was convened by Mr. Kumar with Rajneesh Goel, Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department, and several other officials. The department has decided to take the help of the cyber crime department to keep a track of the rumour-mongering. “They will track activities of several stakeholders to ensure that there is no paper leakage,” said Mr Suresh Kumar.

Cyber cafés and tuition centres

118,2020/02/08,Budget an alternative model to tide over downturn: CM,"The Budget proposals presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Friday represent an alternative model to tide over the economic downturn in the country and the State’s efforts to overcome the Centre’s hostile attitude to it, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

Reacting to the Budget proposals, he said the State had tried to balance development needs and welfare activities even in the face of the trying circumstances due to two successive floods, the Centre’s refusal to raise the borrowing limits and the cut in the State’s share of taxes. Mr. Vijayan said the Budget proposals indicated the government’s will to usher in major reforms in the higher education sector. “The coastal development package and the special packages for Kuttanad, Wayanad and Idukki would help to revive the agricultural and fisheries sectors and address the social inequalities and development imbalance in the three regions,” he said.

Thrust on agriculture

Highlighting the government’s thrust on agriculture, he said the Budget was an exercise to make farming a remunerative venture and attract more youngsters to the sector. Mr. Vijayan said the Budget was also focussed on the revival of the traditional industries sector. “The welfare of the expatriate community, which forms the backbone of our economy, is another thrust area,” he said, pointing to the proposals to rehabilitate returnees.

The Chief Minister added that the Budget had earmarked 18.4% of the Plan outlay for welfare of women. “The enhanced allocation for the Kudumbashree Mission reflects the government’s focus on empowerment of women and improving their livelihood.”

“Overall, the Budget has tried to sustain the development initiatives launched by the government, provide an impetus to key sectors of the economy and ensure the welfare of women, children, the differently abled and the elderly,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bn6n3m/article30772546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TVTHOMASISSACCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/budget-an-alternative-model-to-tide-over-downturn-cm/article30772541.ece

120,2020/02/08,Storytellers to enliven Kottayam village visits,"The Responsible Tourism Mission has introduced a story-telling package for visitors. The initiative envisages narrating stories, including folk tales and myths relating to each village destination in Kottayam, to tourists.

The project is being implemented through a batch of 16 community tour leaders, who have undergone sessions on language and storytelling.

“They are trained in narrating stories about the local communities and their traditions. For instance, if the visitors are in Vaikom, they will be told about the history of the temple town and the epic struggle against untouchability, whereas in Kumarakom, it could be about Alphred George Baker and the king of erstwhile Travancore,” explained K.

Mani moving closer to the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the rival faction under working chairman P.J. Joseph has kick-started consultations with the Kerala Congress (Jacob) group on a possible merger.

The latest move comes even as the Election Commission of India is expected to take a decision on the dispute between the two factions on the party symbol on February 13.

According to party sources, the Joseph faction seeks to strengthen its base by bringing the Jacob group into its fold. The initial round of discussions in this regard, however, failed to reach a consensus in the wake of strong opposition from KC (Jacob) chairman Johny Nelloor.

“We have been trying for the unification of all Kerala Congress factions for quite a long time but the talks held between some of our leaders with P.J. Joseph group were without the party chairman’s knowledge. Considering my objection in the party forum, the party leadership resolved to continue the talks in proper channels,” Mr. Nelloor told mediapersons on Saturday.

In view of the party chairman’s objection, party MLA Anoop Jacob too came out with a statement that any formal discussions on the proposal were yet to take place. The party leaders, on the other hand, asserted that the discussions were up and running.

Responding to reports on the merger of the Kerala Congress groups, Mr. Mani said he had no idea as to whether any such discussions were indeed taking place.

“Their intention is not to strengthen the KC(M) but to weaken it and drive out a section from the organisation,” he said.

He also sought to dispel the rumours over the LDF government allocating ₹5 crore for the K.M. Mani Foundation from the State Budget. “As far as the Kerala Congress (M) is concerned, we are an integral part of the United Democratic Front and this position is clear to everyone,’’ he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-congress-factions-seek-to-realign/article30772465.ece

There have been no new cases reported in Kerala since February 3.

127,2020/02/08,More laboratories sought for AMR programme,"Besides the 10 laboratories which have helped the State implement an action plan towards antimicrobial resistance (AMR) so far, the government needs to strengthen at least 17 more laboratories it has identified in various institutions to implement the plan effectively.

Institutions such as the Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences, Regional Cancer Centre, and many private medical colleges and laboratories have joined the programme from September 2019.

Funds

More funds are required to set up laboratories in institutions under the ambit of the Kerala Antimicrobial Resistance Strategic Action Plan (KARSAP), says Sarada Devi K.L., the State nodal officer for the AMR programme.

A six-point programme in implementing the action plan was discussed at a regional workshop here recently.

The six points discussed were awareness and understanding, labs and surveillance, infection prevention and control, optimising use of antimicrobials, research and innovation, and collaborations.

“It was a small step in the realm of combating a global public health concern,” said Dr. Sarada Devi.

Representatives from the Health departments of six States and one Union Territory took part in the workshop. “Kerala has to make private health-care institutions a part of the AMR programme as majority of the population seek treatment in these institutions,” Dr. Sarada Devi said.

It has to be tackled as One Health – bringing together animal health, fisheries and human health together – as use of antibiotics and their impact on society was vast. Infection control activities in a health-care institution was the beginning, she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/yuamli/article30774919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tv-drugcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/more-laboratories-sought-for-amr-programme/article30772311.ece
128,2020/02/08,Kerala teachers told to avoid govt. criticism,"Around three months after the State government asked schoolteachers not to use social media during work hours, the Director of General Education has warned higher secondary school staff of disciplinary action without notice if they are found to criticise the authorities through those platforms.

Citing Rule 60(a) of the Kerala Government Servants’ Conduct Rules, 1960, the circular issued on February 3 says: “No government servant shall, by any utterance, writing or otherwise, discuss or criticise in public or at any meeting or association or body any policy pursued or action taken by the government nor shall be in any manner participate in such discussion or criticism.”

However, some teachers and non-teaching staff in higher secondary schools were found to have expressed their opinion in violation of the rule and criticised the actions of the government and the department through social media. “...stern action will be initiated against such staff without notice,” the circular said.

Mobile phone ban

In November last year, the government had banned mobile phones in schools after concerns were raised about their adverse impact on students and teachers. Teachers were told not to use Facebook and WhatsApp when they were in classrooms.

A circular was issued then claiming that though there had been a similar order to this effect earlier too, its implementation had been tardy.

Higher secondary teachers, meanwhile, have termed the latest circular “a violation of democratic principles.”

Association charge

Joshi Antony, vice chairman, Federation of Higher Secondary School Teachers’ Associations, a joint platform of higher secondary teachers, said here on Thursday that the Left Democratic Front government was trying to suppress critical voices.

“It can be argued that someone receiving government salary should not criticise the government. But, how fair is it to bar organisations from doing it,” he asked.

Similar order

Mr. Antony claimed that a similar order banning high school and primary school teachers had been issued around a decade ago.

“This could also be part of the attempts to harass higher secondary school teachers, 90% of who are not part of the Left-backed teachers’ union,” he pointed out. The federation would convey its concerns to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath on Monday, Mr. Antony added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7yfh7p/article26143086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Social-Media,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/teachers-told-to-avoid-govt-criticism/article30772294.ece
129,2020/02/08,New norms to hit roadwork in State,"Coming close on the heels of a drastic cut in the State share of Central taxes, the new criteria for allocation of funds for the development of State roads under the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) Act, 2000 will put the State in further hardship.

Henceforth, the allocation will be made by giving 30% weightage to fuel consumption and 70% weightage to geographical area.

Of the funds thus allocated, 10% will be earmarked for road safety.

Other works

The Centre can earmark part of the fund meant for road safety for other works, depending on the progress of the project.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has informed the Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary, Public Works, that the criteria had been approved by the Department of Economic Affairs and would be applicable with immediate effect, official sources said.

Quarterly instalments

A 10-point guideline has been issued for allocation of funds in quarterly instalments based on submission of utilisation certificates.

Roads connecting economic corridors, ports, commercial hubs and those under Bharatmala can be funded under CRIF.

In cases of complaints of poor quality of roads, the funds sanctioned will be withheld till rectification of the defects.

The State has been asked to identify and prioritise projects for release of funds as per the new criteria.

The State should release the funds to executing agencies within seven days of release of the funds by the Centre.

A list of projects to be taken up has to be submitted with a roadmap indicating the boundaries of various roads.

The specifications for the roads should be similar to those of NH works.

Cost overrun

No excess cost beyond 10% of the approved amount will be permissible. Additional financial implications, if any, should be borne by the State.

Inventory

130,2020/02/08,VACB to summon Kunju after Budget session,"The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) will question former Public Works Minister and IUML legislator V.K. Ebrahim Kunju in connection with the flyover construction scam at Palarivattom in Kochi.

It wants to examine whether he had illegally channelled public funds to unduly aid the private firm responsible for the shoddy construction of the now decommissioned overpass and overlooked cautionary reports about the tawdry nature of the work.

The VACB is armed with an authorisation by the Governor to prosecute Mr. Kunju. It is likely to summon him for questioning when the Assembly concludes its Budget session.

The anti-corruption focus on Mr. Kunju in the run-up to the local body polls has discomfited the UDF, which is struggling to defend him in the high-profile corruption case. The arrest of former Public Works Secretary T. Sooraj in August 2019 had brought the probe to Mr. Kunju's doorstep.

It marked a turning point in the case that caused a groundswell of public anger and became emblematic of political sleaze. Mr. Sooraj told investigators that Mr. Kunju had ordered the release of ₹9 crore in advance to the private builder as ‘mobilisation fund’ at a nominal rate of interest much less than that charged by nationalised banks. He pointed out the advance payment was outside the terms of the contract and illegal.

The VACB told the High Court later that the questionable ‘advance credit’ to the construction firm on terms favouring the private entity had caused the State exchequer an estimated loss of over ₹60 lakh.

The agency had argued in its affidavit that the Minister responsible for ‘suspiciously’ channelling public funds to assist a private entity in executing a civil work was in legal jeopardy under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The VACB has also found that PWD officials had fast-forwarded the payment of work bills submitted by the firm, allegedly overlooking reports from PWD supervisors warning against the low-grade nature of the construction.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kunju has sought to take defence behind the argument that as Minister, he could not possibly examine the quality and amount of concrete and steel used in the construction at the field level daily.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-to-summon-kunju-after-budget-session/article30771814.ece
131,2020/02/08,Armed Maoists spotted again in Wayanad,"Suspected Maoists, including women, staged a demonstration at Kambamala near Thalappuzha in the district here on Saturday noon.

The seven-member team, including three women, reached the area around 1.30 p.m. on the day and they spent nearly 20 minutes with workers of the Kambamala tea estate, a rehabilitation project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation for Sri Lankan refugees, District Police Chief R. Ilango told The Hindu.

They covered their face with clothes and four of them carried guns, Mr. Ilango said. They pasted posters on the walls of a toilet block in the estate and raised slogans before returning to the adjacent forest under the North Wayanad forest division, he said.

The posters, pasted on behalf of the Kabani Dalam, an armed force unit of banned Communist Party of India (Maoists), said the Tamil-speaking workers in the estate were not Sri Lankans, whereas they were the citizens of the country now.

It asked the people to challenge physically the officials who would reach the area to collect details of the workers for the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

It also called upon the people to express solidarity with the protests launched by various organisations against the NRC and Citizens (Amendment) Act (CAA). They also wanted them to foil the attempt of the government to evict the workers from the area on behalf of the tourism industry.

The police attached to the Thalappuzha and Mananthavady stations made a quick search in the region. The Kambamala tea estate, bordering Kottiyoor and Periya forest ranges in Wayanad and Kannur districts respectively, was started in the 1970s to rehabilitate refugees from Sri Lanka, and close to 200 refugee families have been staying in the estate.

132,2020/02/08,KIIFB is State’s growth engine,"The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) continues to be the growth engine of the government. The State Budget, presented in the Assembly by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Friday, lays stress on this anti-recession package which is expected be an elixir to boost the State’s economy. Steps have been completed for spending ₹20,000 crore for its projects in 2020-21.

The Budget reaffirming the government’s commitment for bettering the lot of indigent sections, accelerating resource mopping, enhancing expenditure efficacy and containing splurge.

Anticipating a shortfall of ₹10,113 crore in tax income and a drastic cut in Central transfers, the Budget lays accent on scaling up expenditure for developing infrastructure facilities, stepping up power generation and creating more jobs to ward off the chilling impact of economic slowdown.

Hike in honorarium

A ₹100 hike in all welfare pensions, ₹50 increase in daily wages of school catering employees, ₹500 increase in the honorarium of ASHA workers and proposal to open 1,000 food courts for providing meals at ₹25 are aimed at the weaker sections.

The plan to step up the production of anti-cancer drugs and essential medicines for post-organ transplant surgery from Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited at affordable prices would be a solace for those who exhaust substantial sums for medical bills.

Construction works for ₹6,000 crore have been proposed for Kochi.

A package has been announced for start-ups. Loan without collateral security has been mooted for start-ups executing government orders.

A second Kuttanad package of ₹2,400 crore, a coastal package of ₹1,000 crore and packages of ₹1,000 crore for Idukki and ₹2,000 crore Wayanad are some of the highlights of the Budget.

Power sector reforms, mainly the Kochi-Edamon corridor, would help seamless transmission of power equivalent to 2,000 MW of installed capacity and on completing the Transgrid project Phase II power requirements up to 2040 could be fulfilled. Sale of CFL and filament bulbs will be banned from November.

Tourism has a shoe-string allocation. A sum of ₹320 crore has been earmarked for the tourism sector that has survived the ravages of two floods. The government’s thrust on the industries sector has reaped dividends. Its share in the State’s domestic revenue has risen from 9.8% in 2014-15 to 13.2% in 2018-19.

Payments for local bodies have been exempted from treasury curbs. About 4.98 lakh ineligible beneficiaries will be weeded out of the list of welfare pensioners and it would help gain ₹700 crore.

. Redeployment of staff is also on the anvil. Scrutiny of Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns and an amnesty scheme has been announced to collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) arrears.

Amendments to the Kerala Stamp Act and Registration Act have been mooted.

133,2020/02/08,"Kerala Budget 2020 | ₹6,000-cr. projects for Kochi","The emphasis given in the State Budget to usher in seamless ‘Green Mobility’ in Kochi has been welcomed by stakeholders even as uncertainty looms over funding for the long-overdue development of Thammanam-Pullepady Road and Seaport-Airport Road in order to decongest the city.

Speaking of the Kochi Green Mobility Zone in his Budget speech, Finance Minister Thomas Isaac referred to the Union Urban Development Ministry recently giving an award to Kochi’s seamless-mobility project (for arraying around 1,000 private buses under seven companies and for a unified prepaid card for Kochi Metro, buses, and water transport). “An eco-friendly and integrated urban transport system will thus evolve in Kochi,” he said, referring to infra projects totalling ₹6,000 crore for the region, which include roads and overbridges.

The projects to be implemented in 2020 include Kochi Metro’s Infopark and Tripunithura extensions, which entail expenditure worth ₹3,025 crore. The 76-km integrated ‘Water Metro’ project in which 78 modern ferries would operate in 16 routes in the Greater-Kochi area, linking 38 jetties would incur expenditure worth ₹682 crore. Solar boats for the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) too found mention, what with the department operating Aditya, India’s first solar-powered ferry, in the Vaikom-Thavanakadavu route.

A sum of ₹26 crore has been set apart in the Budget for augmenting the department’s solar and conventional-ferry fleet in Kochi and Alappuzha. “We intend to launch two or three solar ferries such as Aditya, since they do not cause air or noise pollution. They also have rock-bottom operational cost,” said Shaji V. Nair, Director of SWTD. Yet another plan is to launch an electric roll in-roll out (RoRo) vessel, to ferry containers from Kochi Port to Bolghatty Island, he added.

The Budget has allocated ₹2.5 crore for Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority, which would supervise seamless inter-modal integration of different commuting modes. Responding to funds allocated for the Kochi Metro, KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sarma said the Thykoodam-Petta extension would be commissioned in March.

“Construction of the Petta-SN Junction stretch is fast progressing. KMRL had catalysed introduction of e-autos in Kerala, in line with the government’s commitment for green and electric mobility.”

The Budget has set apart ₹1 crore as the government’s share in the ₹12-crore project to rejuvenate the Ernakulam Public Library. “The rest of the money will be raised from CSR funds, MP/MLA (constituency) funds, and public contributions,” said V.K. Prasad, treasurer of the library.

According to the plan, a new building will be built on 20 cents of land behind the existing one. Meanwhile, V.D, Satheeshan, MLA, said the budget lacked credibility since the same projects announced last year or projects which got administrative sanction during the UDF regime and whose work was under way were portrayed as fresh ones.

Moreover, the Finance minister was unable to cite the funding source of many projects.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udhavb/article30768960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki08budgetr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-budget-2020-6000-cr-projects-for-kochi/article30768962.ece
134,2020/02/08,Local body creates online marketplace in Kerala,"The Thanneermukkom grama panchayat has launched a mobile app for promoting commercial activities in the local body.

Thadhesh will help farmers and micro- and small-scale industries to sell directly, while consumers can buy fresh and reliable products locally from the comfort of their homes. People can buy a host of products online: vegetables, fruits, coconut, dairy, spices, non-vegetarian items, pets, plants, livestock, traditional medicines, biofertilizers, farm machinery, seeds, and saplings.

Officials say the app is a community-based online marketplace and a social media platform, which would strengthen the local market structure and economy.

“Farmers, small-scale industries and others can register and list their products in the app. Customers can buy the products listed in the app directly from the seller. This will ensure a good price to the sellers. In the future, we will upgrade with an aim to use it for online food ordering and delivery,” said panchayat president P.S. Jyothis.

Mr. Jyothis says the local body has created a labour bank and the app would connect employers and employees. Members of Kudumbashree units or individuals could be entrusted with delivering products at the doorsteps. Apart from individuals, shop owners and businesses can buy products from a farmer/producer by registering as a merchant.

It will also help tourists and others visiting Thanneermukkom, a backwater tourist destination, to find local sellers of indigenous products and crafts. “Craftsmen and producers of indigenous products can use this platform to increase their income,” said an official.

A unique social media feature, ‘My Village’, in the app delivers local news, information about government schemes, and policies. The feature enables the public to interact with local authorities such as ward members, the Agriculture Department, community development officials, among others.

Athul Krishna and K.J. Dinesh, sixth semester electrical engineering students of GPTC have come out with the prototype of a robot for rescuing children from bore wells in the context of bore well deaths becoming frequent and rescue measures falling short most of the time in the country. They said that the robot could rescue the trapped child, irrespective of the depth of the well.

Polymer science students of Government Polytechnic College, Kottayam, presented a model, explaining how the natural composite could solve bund failures. Bund failure is a major threat to farmers in Kuttanad and conventional or concrete bunds had proved ineffective. But bunds constructed with the natural composite could prevent bund failure, they claimed.

137,2020/02/08,Kerala Budget 2020 | Not much to cheer for public health sector,"The public health sector does not have much to cheer in the 2020-21 State Budget.

There are no major announcements for the sector this year and even the statement by Finance Minister T.M. THomas Isaac that the benefits of the old Karunya scheme [Karunya Benevolent Fund (KBF)] will continue to be available for families who are outside the integrated health insurance scheme Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati (KASP) and not included in any other health schemes is fraught with confusion.

Last year, the KBF was integrated into the KASP, which offers an annual health insurance cover of ₹5 lakh to ₹47 lakh families. Following the furore over the “stopping” of the scheme, the government had later announced that applications for KBF benefits would continue to be accepted till March 31 this year.

The government already owes the KBF arrears payment of at least ₹120-150 crore to government hospitals apart from hundreds of KBF applications that are pending.

When Dr. Isaac mentions that the KBF, which used to be run by the Department of Lotteries, would continue alongside the KASP, he fails to mention whether he has made any allocation for the scheme this year or which department — Lotteries or Finance — will run the scheme.

“The announcement that the KBF will continue to be run seems to have been made with an eye on the upcoming local body elections,” a public health expert said.

Cancer drugs

Dr. Isaac announced that the Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (KSDP) was increasing its facilities for in-house drug production and that it would be able to provide immunosuppressant drugs and cancer drugs at reduced prices.

The Minister spoke about creating a comprehensive support system with the help of modern technology and Artificial Intelligence to monitor elderly patients.

In addition to the ₹1,102 crore earmarked under the Plan scheme, Dr. Isaac said at least ₹3,500 crore could be expected under non-Plan for maintenance, new roads, and clearing bills of contractors.

Construction works at ₹25,000 crore, including ₹13,358 crore and ₹4,500 crore from earlier Plan schemes, ₹1,100 crore from Central Road Fund, ₹1,400 crore from Rebuild Kerala, and ₹800 crore from the KSDP were being carried out by Public Works Department.

The transformation of age-old methods used by the PWD into designed roads using modern technology envisaged in the last budget was being realised in the State, Dr. Isaac said.

Modern techniques such as full-depth reclamation, cold recycling, thin white topping, geo-textiles, mixtures of plastic and rubber added to bitumen would be utilised, the Minister said.

Silverline

The 531.45-km greenfield semi-high-speed rail (SHSR) corridor from Kochuveli to Kasaragod will be completed in three years once land is acquired and the 585-km West Coast Canal (WCC) from Kovalam to Bekal, the main arterial waterway, will be opened for transportation in 2020-2021.

He said 95% of transportation in Kerala depended on roads at present, which is not at all desirable. “There will be an eco-friendly fundamental change in the transport structure when the waterway and rail development are added,” Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said in the 2020-2021 Budget.

Silverline, the SHSR announced in the previous budget, was going to be a reality and it would be the work requiring the highest investment, Dr. Isaac said. Its aerial survey had been completed and the alignment would be finalised soon. Land acquisition procedures for the corridor would start in 2020.

International agencies were keen to invest in the SHSR that would have a new service road and five townships.

Renovation of ancient temples, such as the Mahadeva temple at Koothattukulam, will be taken up by Kerala Tourism in association with the Devaswom Board and ₹5 crore has been allocated in the Budget.

An autonomous hotel management college at international standards will be set up at Dharmadom, which is represented by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the Assembly. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said effective marketing helped Kerala Tourism overcome two floods and achieve 18.5% growth in the number of domestic tourists and 8.24% for foreign tourists in 2019.

Of the ₹320-crore allocation, ₹63 crore is for marketing, ₹20 crore for the CBL and jalamelas, ₹5 crore for the Thatwamasi circuit, and ₹10 crore for the Travancore heritage scheme.

Dr. Isaac said the CBL would be highlighted as the main attraction in this year’s tourism marketing plan. Financial assistance would be given to ‘jalamelas’ which did not come under the CBL.

“When future possibilities are taken into consideration, the Spices Route project is the most elaborate project.

141,2020/02/08,"Kerala Budget 2020 | Building tax to go up, vehicles to be costly","The fees levied for services provided by the Motor Vehicles, Registration and Stamp Duty, and Land Revenue Departments will go up as part of resource mapping plans for 2020-21.

Motorcycles and cars will turn costly from April 1, 2020.

The annual luxury building tax levied on residential buildings, one-time building tax, fees for transfer of registry, location map, and record of right (thandaper) have also been increased.

To encourage electric vehicles, tax on electric autorickshaws will be exempted for the first five years. The rebate on the first five-year tax of new petrol and diesel autorickshaws will go.

One-time tax at 5%

The one-time tax on new electric cars, motorcycles, private service vehicles for personal use, and three-wheelers has been limited to 5%. The tax on motorcycles not exceeding value up to ₹2 lakh has been increased by 1% and that of cars and private service vehicles for personal use not exceeding value of ₹15 lakh by 2%. The Finance Minister expects additional revenue of ₹200-crore on this score.

The tax on buses of educational institutions, excluding that of government and aided institutions, has been increased after 23 years. Quarterly tax at ₹50 a seat will be levied on buses having up to 20 seats. For buses above 20 seats, tax will be levied at ₹100 a seat per quarter. Dr. Isaac expects additional revenue of ₹6 crore.

A 10% reduction in tax has been announced for stage carriages. The fee levied for displaying advertisement has been revised as ₹5 per 100 sq cm for one month and ₹10 for digital advertisements. Vehicle owners need to pay tax in Kerala only from the date on which NOC is issued from other States for change of address of vehicles.

To avoid stamp duty tax evasion, amendments will be made to the Kerala Stamp Act to value such buildings as per CPWD rates. An additional revenue of ₹225 crore is expected from it.

To narrow down differences between the fair value fixed by the government and market value, a 10% increase will be made in the existing fair value. The Minister expects ₹200 crore through this measure.

Notified land near mega projects will be valued at a maximum of 30% above the declared fair value and the exchequer expects ₹50 crore. Suitable amendments will be made to the Registration Act to make registration compulsory for title deeds.

Rebate announced

The annual luxury building tax levied on residential building has also been hiked. A 20% rebate will be allowed for those who pay luxury tax in advance for five years or above, fetching an additional revenue of ₹16 crore.

The one-time building tax will be re-fixed rationally with an upper limit not exceeding 30%. Henceforth, the tax rate will be categorised into grama panchayats, municipalities, and corporations. The fees for transfer of registry has been revised and amendment will be made to treat each schedule in the deed as a separate unit . Location map will cost ₹200 and record of right ₹100. An additional revenue of ₹50 crore each is expected.

142,2020/02/08,Centre usurping States’ powers: Isaac,"In his Budget speech, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac flayed the Centre for usurping the powers of States in all areas with unilateral decision-making, which is leading to the federal nature of the Constitution getting diluted every day.

“The incursion of the Central government into the State lists, nullifying the Seventh Schedule has become so rampant. Executive power is also being misused. The GST Council, the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the 15th Central Finance Commission all seem to have deprived the State governments of their entire fiscal freedom,” he said.

State stifled

Accusing the Centre of having an economic policy aimed at strangling the States financially, he said Kerala has been denied the scope for availing itself of any loan during the last quarter of the current financial year.

“Out of the internal revenue of the State, 3% is allowed as loan. Based on this, an amount of ₹2,4915 crore was earmarked in the State Budget. But by the middle of the financial year, the Centre informed that ₹5,325 crore would be cut off from the loan amount. Even by this criteria, we had the right to borrow ₹4,900 crore in the last quarter. But from this, ₹3,000 crore was again slashed arbitrarily. Hence we now have permission to take loan only for ₹1,920 crore. From this amount, ₹1,400 crore has to be paid to the Central government as repayment of loan availed in 2009,” he said.

Grants from the Centre are also being cut short. The Centre is not ready to give the GST compensation due for December 2019. The arrears will cross ₹3,000 crore in February. In addition to this, there is an indication that ₹6,866 crore received as tax share for the last quarter of the previous financial year would come down to ₹4,525 crore during the current financial year. Thus, there will be a shortfall of ₹8,330 crore in the Central assistance, putting unprecedented financial constraints on the State exchequer, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-usurping-states-powers-isaac/article30766254.ece

Thomas Isaac providing a special financial assistance of ₹1,000 crore in the Budget.

In addition to the special assistance, Dr. Isaac said another ₹109 crore has been earmarked in the Plan for the State transport undertaking.

Although the Minister has not spelled out how the ₹1,000 crore in the Budget would be utilised, the crisis-ridden KSRTC will use the funds for paying the salary and wages to those on the rolls. The KSRTC had received ₹1,000 crore in the last Budget also to overcome the crisis.

The Finance Minister has provided to the water transport sector an allocation of ₹111 crore and ₹26 crore out of it has been earmarked for State Water Transport. An amount of ₹75 crore has been provided for the Coastal Shipping and Inland Navigation Department.

146,2020/02/08,Out of gas,"What is the meaning of ‘running on fumes’? (KV Satish, Madurai)

When this rather informal expression is used with a person, what it suggests is that the individual is continuing to work even though he has little or no energy left; he is exhausted, and as a result, is working without any enthusiasm. He is like a vehicle that has more or less run out of petrol. When you say that an organisation is running on fumes, what you mean is that it has used up most its resources; it has very little money left to continue to operate. It is likely to close down soon.

It was obvious to everyone that Federer was running on fumes in the last set.

The company that Sunitha works for has been running on fumes the past six months.

What is the difference between ‘council’ and ‘counsel’? (B Mukund, Nellore)

As far as the pronunciation is concerned, there is no difference; both words have the stress on the first syllable. In terms of meaning, both words refer to the act of giving advice. ‘Council’ is mostly used nowadays as a noun to refer to an appointed group of people who meet, discuss and offer advice on a matter — it could be to an individual or an organisation. In the past, every King had his own council; today, every college has a student council. ‘Counsel’, on the other hand, can be used as a noun and a verb. As a noun, it means ‘advice’ or ‘guidance’, and as a verb, ‘to give advice’. In law, ‘Counsel’ is also used to refer to a lawyer. After all, what is it that a lawyer does? He gives advice.

When it comes to matters of money, I always seek Devi’s counsel.

The teacher counselled me not to waste my time by joining the protest.

The council deliberated over the matter for several hours.

Is it okay to say, “According to my father’s opinion, she’s very bright”? (T Sailaja, Ongole)

No, it is not. Usually, ‘according to’ and ‘opinion’ do not go together. You cannot say, “According to my father’s opinion”. If you wish to use ‘according to’, then you will have to say, “According to my father, she’s very bright”. If, on the other hand, you wish to use ‘opinion’, then you will have to say, “In my father’s opinion, she’s very bright”. It is also possible to say, “My father thinks she’s very bright”. Remember, it is always “according to” someone else.

But, being an average student, I worry that if I am not able to clear the exams, I will be left without a secondary plan. My family cannot financially support me for long. What should I do to ensure I get a job, without letting go of my dream? – Himanshu

Dear Himanshu,

Eight lakh students appeared for the UPSC last year, out of which, 759 made it to the IAS and IPS services.

This statistic is not to demotivate you. You could be one amongst the 759, certainly, but what if you don’t make it? It is imperative that you start consciously thinking of a plan B and C to fall back on. See what else comes closest to the IPS for you.

You must toil for the next two years now and pass the written tests and subsequent interviews. This, of course, requires self-discipline, patience, punctuality, commitment, self-confidence and above all, a fire to really make it happen. Work hard and smart, build your physique and body and work on your stamina as well. Keep a healthy mind and stay time conscious and away from naysayers. Sky is the limit. Good luck.

First things first — Know the CAT exam pattern and syllabus in detail. Ensure that you get the right study material. Sign up to physical or online coaching classes if possible. Take online mock tests. Find like-minded friends and create a study group. Stay determined, confident and motivated. Good luck.

148,2020/02/08,Student activism is not a dirty word,"Thousands of students across India have been on the streets, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) ever since the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was passed in both houses of Parliament and enacted into an act. There have been protests on campuses in several higher education institutions including the IITs and IIMs. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students were on strike protesting fee hike for over a month, and the protest attracted the attention of national and international media. The incidents of student protests and activism in several parts of the country have sparked a wave of fierce debate on whether students taking part in protests can be justified. Is ‘student activism’ (SA) a dirty word? What form of SA should be encouraged? What is the purpose of education?

It is unfortunate many educated people equate ‘student activism’ with protests, violence, damage, and unruly behaviour. What is SA? It is vigorous action of students as a body in support of or opposition to any issue that leads to reforms or brings about some change in the system. Students boycotting classes to protest against anything that they feel is unjust, issuing a statement in support of or opposition to some controversial issues, campaigning for or against something, staging demonstrations demanding a rollback of fee hike, raising slogans condemning police violence, and so on, are examples of student activism. It is always for a good cause.

For or against?

Recently, when I initiated a discussion on the topic whether student activism can be justified, Francis Sebastian, an educator who is actively involved in youth formation, commented, “Activism is always good and it depends on how we understand it. Every human being should be an activist and work for change and development of their society. Young people should be activists for the development of the nation. Nation means people and their rights and development...”. Yes, it is every student’s moral responsibility to be an engaged citizen, express his/her views on social issues, and work towards the betterment of society.

Student activism is not new in India. The All India Student Federation (AISF) that was founded on August 12, 1936 was involved in the Indian freedom struggle. Initially, AISF had this slogan: “Freedom, Peace and Progress” and in 1958, it came up with the slogan “Study & Struggle”. In the past, the country has witnessed some remarkable student protests including Nav Nirman Andolan Reconstruction protests (1974), Anti-Sri Lanka protests (2013), and protests over Suicide of Dalit Scholar Rohit Vemula (2016).

In January 2017, students across Tamil Nadu boycotted classes and took part in pro-jallikattu protests in a peaceful manner and succeeded in making the state government pass a bill exempting jallikattu from the prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, thus legalising the bull-taming sport. The pro-jallikattu student protests proved to the world that students can bring about social change.

Informed choices

A few months ago, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish student activist Greta Thunberg, young students in several countries boycotted their classes and took part in Global Climate strike. They expressed their protest against governments’ callous attitude and inaction against climate change.

The purpose of education is to help students become informed and engaged citizens who are aware of what is happening in their society and respond responsibly to the challenges they face. Student should be trained to look at issues critically and encouraged to take an active role in creating a better society. They should be educated to dissent in a reasoned manner and fight for a right cause. Student activism should be in line with the purpose of education. Peaceful protests and non-violent campaigns are an effective way to achieve social change. Student activism is a beautiful word and responsible citizens should make it more beautiful by understanding students, helping them channelise their energy in the right direction and sustain their interest in the society and humanity.

149,2020/02/08,Agree to disagree,"We are going through a charged political climate, a time where people have taken to the streets to publicly voice their views in a way that hasn’t been witnessed by our country in a long while. Every day, we witness debates, sometimes handled peaceably, and sometimes provoking violence, as people try to convince each other about the validity of their position.

Changing someone’s mind isn’t an easy thing to do. You are in essence asking them to admit that their original way of thinking about something was flawed.

An opinion tends to get nurtured during our early years and become further bolstered every time we experience events that validate it, read articles or watch videos that are favourable to it, or interact with like-minded individuals.

Debate starter pack

So, how do you influence someone to change their opinion, without having to wave a gun about or start a Twitter war? Here are some ideas:

Do your research:

Make sure that you have read up on your position and have all the facts at hand. It is also helpful to study the other individual’s position, if you know what it is, so that you can pre-empt what arguments they are likely to make to counter your own.

Pick the right time:

Perhaps your listener has had a bad day, is preoccupied about something, or has skipped their lunch (never underestimate how irrational a person can be on an empty stomach). If you know about her/his situation, demonstrate empathy and put off talking to them, until they are in a better frame of mind to listen and engage in a dialogue with you.

Consider your audience’s likes:

What will make a compelling argument for your listener? Maybe they respond positively to videos and other media; or, they may like to know what public figures, who they admire, think about the issue. Or better still, perhaps, their own self-interest and well-being could be impacted by the issue you are discussing; in this case, you could draw a more personal connection to your argument when trying to win them over, and help them look at the issue from a new lens.

Avoid focusing on the other’s wrong:

Emphasise on why you could be the right one, rather than focussing on why the other person is wrong. When someone changes their mind, they inherently accept that their initial position was flawed, but they wouldn’t like to be reminded of it.

Use logic with the right audience:

We often like to quote data and facts to convince people of our position. However, sometimes, people don’t care what the data says, even if you think the truth is staring them in the face. So, spend more time in crafting an argument that interests the individual. The tactic of throwing numbers and reports at everyone who opposes your views can only get you so far.

If you hit a stalemate, take a break:

There will be situations where you might be unable to change someone’s mind; your arguments may even have the opposite effect, and end up pushing them to hold on to their beliefs even tighter. In times like this, there is no harm in putting a pause in your efforts, taking a breather and trying again later.

You may not always be successful at influencing someone’s opinion; but at least, you will know that you tried your best in a civil discourse.

150,2020/02/08,Sea of opportunities,"The two-day International Education Fair (IEF) 2020 by The Hindu Chennai edition, began with the inaugural keynote by Robert G Burgess, US Consul General. The opening witnessed a number of college and high school students.

The event was power-packed with seminars, ranging from Rhea Cheryl Shivan’s session (Manager, Campus France, Embassy of France, Chennai) where she talked about study options in France, to Sudha Sudeep, Managing Director (Marketing and Communications), Beyon Education, who talked about how the Netherlands as the upcoming study destination, among many others. The seminars provided insights into how to make the right choice about courses, colleges, and most importantly, the right country.

“I always tell students to choose the university, and not the country. The university and quality of education matters. Do not jump to PR (permanent residency). First study and gain experience,” said Sudeep.

The stalls saw an attendance of Indian and foreign universities, visa and education consultancy firms, GRE/GMAT/IELTS coaching institutes and few banks. Representatives helped students and parents clear their doubts in their respective fields.

Expert speak

Talking about why The Netherlands is an upcoming study destination, Sudeep said, “It is one of the English-speaking countries in Europe which is a big aspect to consider, when students choose a university. English is the official language of all Netherland universities, and the locals too can speak English. So, this helps students feel comfortable and allows them to settle down smoothly. It is also one of the safest countries for students.”

“There are many government and university-sponsored scholarships for international students — they also get 16 working hours in a week, which helps them earn their bread,” continued Sudeep.

Amity Global Institute, Singapore, attracted huge crowds. “We are based in Singapore, but our awarding bodies are University of London, University of Stirling and University of Northampton. So, students get double benefit,” said Elisavet Georgaki, Marketing Manager, Amity Global Institute.

Students’ dreams

“We want to explore job opportunities abroad in finance. We would like to step out of our comfort zone, which is India. So, we came to this fair to seek advice on how to explore our options,” said CA students Lakshmipriya and Ganita.

Aravind, a data science aspirant, has his heart set on studying in the land of dreams. “I want to pursue a postgraduate programme in Data Science from the U.S., or Canada. Although I want to settle down in India, I want to head abroad to gain experience, and considering there are more job opportunities in the U.S., I am applying there. I came to this fair to gain some more information on these two countries in my field and it has been useful.”",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/a4qlkc/article30769423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EDUFAIR3,https://www.thehindu.com/education/sea-of-opportunities/article30769425.ece
151,2020/02/08,Entrepreneurship should begin in school,"Startups are one of the strongest engines for wealth creation, employment and economic growth. India is aspiring to be a $5 trillion economy in the next five years. There is also a need to create 300 million jobs by 2040, which is roughly 10 million jobs a year. These aspirations and needs of India cannot just be fulfilled by the existing large enterprises alone. Startups can act as a vehicle to achieve the next level of economic growth and social development.

India has begun its journey to becoming one of the fastest growing startup hubs in the world, and today, it is the third largest in technology-driven product startups, after the U.S. and the U.K. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor estimates some 20% of Indians (aged between 18 and 64 years) intend to start a business in the next three years, while more than 11% are nascent entrepreneurs.

As entrepreneurs, innovators, academicians, and mentors to startups, in this third wave, Indians have an opportunity to rapidly prosper and put India on the path to becoming a developed nation. For this, we must explore new areas of entrepreneurial opportunities, develop new approaches, acquire relevant skills and mindset, and offer complete ecosystem support to successfully build deep-tech, IP-driven innovative platforms, products and solutions from India, for the world.

Industry 4.0

The new technology of microprocessors and integrated chips opened opportunities for nations in creating a new industry. The Indian IT industry leveraged these technological developments and made a significant contribution to make India a global economic power. Today, India is the world’s largest sourcing destination for the IT industry, which employs about 10 million professionals.

Now, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is well underway. The manufacturing industry is undergoing a major technological revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured and distributed. This rapid, end-to-end digitisation of all physical assets and their integration into digital ecosystems is a part of Industry 4.0. It promises a new frontier in the manufacturing and other sectors, with enhanced value creation through higher productivity and efficiency throughout the value chain. The technologies that enable Industry 4.0 include smart sensors, automation devices, advanced robots, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, location detection technologies, human-machine interfaces, augmented reality, 3D printing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and mobile devices, among others. India has achieved strong leadership in IT.

Entrepreneurial education

The preparation for the third wave of the entrepreneurial journey should begin at schools and universities in India. Unlike in the U.S., universities in India are not at the epicentre of the entrepreneurship ecosystem. They need to build a strong foundation of innovation and entrepreneurship to empower aspiring entrepreneurs to successfully incubate high-impact ventures. Educational institutions must create entrepreneurial culture where students are...

1- Explicitly encouraged to question, experiment, observe, and network to generate novel ideas where they are not afraid to take chances and fail. They must show tolerance to failure, as failure is a natural part of innovating.

2- Challenged through structured ideation efforts around specific topics, themes, or problems, and rewarded for taking smart risks in their pursuit of innovation.

3- Provided opportunities to discover new solutions, experiment, refine and validate solutions, and empower to present their ideas and utilise the collective wisdom to validate and refine ideas.

4- Given opportunities for hands-on experiential learning to build innovation capabilities and skills, which might include simulated exercises or real projects. Students get access to successful innovators, creative people, and entrepreneurs as mentors.

5- Given access to platforms and facilities through which ideas can be submitted, shared, developed, prototyped and piloted.

Supportive ecosystem

The Indian government has funded several organisations to establish incubation centres while major corporates have established startup accelerators. One of the challenges of deep tech entrepreneurs is access to advanced technological laboratories and experts. In the third wave of entrepreneurship, India needs to establish global Centres of Excellence (GCoEs) in exponential and Industry 4.0 technologies, in partnership with academia and industry from around the world. These centres should support entrepreneurs in (a) evaluation and implementation of state-of-the-art technologies; (b) development of products, prototypes and patentable solutions; and (c) developing industry acceptable platforms, products and solutions. GCoEs can also provide practical use cases, make concrete recommendations, and provide a test bed for startups and the industry.

CxO-level mentorship

Mentoring is at the core of creating high-impact entrepreneurs, and it is the weakest link in the Indian ecosystem. It is important for aspiring entrepreneurs to have access to CxOs from different startups, companies, technology domains, sectors and geographies for regular mentorship. In addition, they should get an opportunity to shadow successful entrepreneurs/founders of high-impact startups. The guidance from leading business experts from multiple domains offers a synergistic view of developing a business model and the challenges of developing and launching new products.

Global immersion

Aspiring entrepreneurs and innovators need to have access to global and local immersions to gain deeper insights, newer perspectives and global connects for successfully building products and solutions for India and the world. These immersions not only provide experience entrepreneurial ecosystem, but will offer inspiration to connect ideas that lead to disruptive and breakthrough products and solutions. It also provides an opportunity to collaborate and partner with individuals, institutions and create global teams.

India’s opportunity to rapidly progress in this decade is built on the ecosystem that is developed to promote high-impact entrepreneurship. Using this opportunity will require us to develop an education system that is focused on entrepreneurial culture and establish the pillars that allow Indian entrepreneurs access to advanced technology laboratories and experts to accelerate product and venture development. Through this, India can create a new generation of high-impact entrepreneurs and ventures based on IP-driven, deep-tech, and innovative platforms, products and solutions for its progressive future.

The Los Angeles County coroner’s office confirmed Bean’s Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a “traffic-related” fatality. The coroner’s office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from local news outlets.

A man was walking in the Venice neighbourhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Captain Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn’t identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.

Bean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

“Mr. Bean’s face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar,” The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed “a quality of being likeable even when his jokes fall flat.”

‘Because it sounded funny’

Born in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean “because it sounded funny.”

In a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of “me — master of ceremonies, comedian and magician — maybe a dog act, and a stripper.” It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like “Roger Duck” or Orson Bean. His quick wit and warm personality made him a favourite panellist for six years on To Tell the Truth.

The game required the panellists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said- “Will the real (notable’s name) please stand up?”

Bean’s style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on The Tonight Show more than 200 times. But his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the Cold War. “Basically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend,” he explained in a 2001 interview. “I stopped working on TV for a year.”

The blacklist didn’t stop him in the theatre. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod’s 1955 Hollywood spoof Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O’Sullivan in Never Too Late and with Melina Mercouri in Illya Darling, based on her hit film Never on Sunday.

Bean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the U.S., and after a period as a self-described “house-husband”, resumed his career. “I got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything,” he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.

In the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on the long-running drama Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as Desperate Housewives, How I Met Your Mother and Modern Family.

Conservative politics

Meanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. He became related to a leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Breitbart, when his daughter, Susannah, married him. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart’s eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.

Bean wrote a memoir called Too Much Is Not Enough and a book about a non-traditional therapy called Me and the Orgone. “I said to myself, we have to start with the children. Why not start a school?” he told The New York Times.

That same year, he co-founded the Sons of the Desert, an organization dedicated to comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with chapters around the world. More recently, income from Dr. Quinn and other voice and acting work allowed Bean to finance the Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble in Venice, where he appeared with his third wife, actress Alley Mills.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/d0s137/article30771123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8FEBTHOBITORSENBEAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-comedian-orson-bean-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-los-angeles/article30771124.ece
153,2020/02/08,Kartik Aaryan: ‘Ayushmann does films about men with defects; I do films about women with defects’,"Kartik Aaryan is currently promoting his next film with Sara Ali Khan, the Love Aaj Kal reboot directed by Imtiaz Ali.

During a recent interview with Radio City, the actor was asked about comparisons with Ayushmann Khurrana.

Kartik replied that their movies are based on different ideologies and answered, “It happens that Ayushmann does films about men with defects, while I do films about women with defects!”

Sara appeared confused by the answer, even as Kartik laughed over his answer and then explained to her that he was referring to the characters in his previous films like Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety. Sara went to ask him what was the ‘defect’ in her character in Love Aaj Kal, to which Kartik answered with the title of a song from the film: Haan Main Galat.

Twitter did not take kindly to the actor’s answer, as he had even earlier come in for criticism for the themes in his films. His previous flick Pati Patni Aur Woh also faced controversy for a scene that made fun of marital rape, which was then later removed.

Love Aaj Kal is scheduled to release on February 14, Valentine’s Day. It is touted as a spiritual remake of the 2009 film of the same name, starring Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone in lead roles.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kuy91q/article30770802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1172020000224A,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kartik-aaryan-ayushmann-does-films-about-men-with-defects-i-do-films-about-women-with-defects/article30770803.ece
154,2020/02/08,Oscars 2020: Who are Indian filmmakers and actors rooting for?,"Come Monday and a section of young cinephiles in India will perform an annual ritual. It will wake up at 6 am to catch cinema’s grandest celebration, and everything will go according to the unchanging script — the red carpet will be discussed threadbare and many contentious contemporary issues will get ticked on stage in several fabulous acceptance speeches — from race relations to diversity to gender as Trump’s hate politics.

Thereafter every award would be scrutinised and debated on. Who got their deserved place in the sun and which films were unfairly forced to go away with the wind? The celebration of showmanship, its scale and grandeur, will colonise our minds and conversations yet again.

Will the members of the filmmaking community in India also tune in? What are they looking forward to and who is it that they are going to root for on February 10? How far does their Oscar obsession go?

Vasan Bala

Vasan Bala, filmmaker

I started watching it from 1992, when Satyajit Ray was awarded an honorary Academy Award. But it was when Nayakan went as India’s submission in 1987 that the Oscars came to Tam Brahm homes. Since then, our conversations have been fuelled by Jeans and, recently, Visaranai.

Voting for: I’m not rooting for anyone. I only wish they’d nominated Lulu Wang and Greta Gerwig. If they’d been part of the debate, the discussion would have been nicer… especially since they are filmmakers in a relationship who’ve made it on their own might (Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig; Barry Jenkins and Lulu Wang).

Unforgettable: For some odd reason, it is Denzel Washington. For the intensity on his face whenever his name was announced as a nominee.

Onir

Onir, filmmaker

The actor who excites me the most this year is Antonio Banderas in Pain and Glory. He is incredible and beautiful. I have a contrarian opinion on the popular nominees. The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood disappointed me — not everything they [Scorsese/Tarantino] make needs to make it [to the awards]. I think Parasite is the strongest of the lot, the one I would root for as a story. A nomination I’m happy about, however, is For Sama [a journey into the female experience of war], in the documentary feature category. It talks about an issue of importance in the world today. It is shot in a basic way but is all the more powerful for it.

Lack of diversity: Parasite and Pain and Glory are perhaps the only films that bring in diversity. Otherwise, everything this year is white. There is zero representation of blacks, women or the LGBTQIA community.

Unforgettable: It is inspiring to see film people use the ceremony as a political platform. Especially when seen in the light of how professionals in India maintain silence on important issues. Everything is promotion driven here. They say something before the release of a film and then go silent. They won’t stand up for their own audience. [I recall how] Tom Hanks’ acceptance speech for Philadelphia had me in tears. The way he identified and remembered the people who died for the [gay rights and AIDS activism] cause. I get emotional even now, just thinking about it. There’s also something very dignified about the industry coming together to celebrate their films and talent. The way they acknowledge the entire industry as a family. Not one award in India has this sense of gravitas.

Deepti Gupta

Deepti Gupta, filmmaker

It is shocking that no women were nominated this year in the best direction category or even best cinematography. It is surprising in a country where the #MeToo movement has been more successful than others. The Oscars doesn’t see the responsibility that they have to put women in the forefront — [they must realise] equal opportunity creates equal representation, not just vice versa. Though I am a big fan of Rodrigo Prieto (The Irishman) and Roger Deakins (1917) in the cinematography category, I would personally have loved to see Natasha Braier’s name, who shot Honey Boy.

It is ironic that only last week I met Jonas Holmberg, director of the Goteborg Film Festival in Sweden, where my documentary, Shut Up Sona, was invited for its Swedish premiere. It is one of the first A-list film festivals to have a 50-50 policy starting this year. In spite of the initial discussions, and reservations about quality versus gender-equal film selections, Holmberg said it wasn’t hard to find great films made by women. Other countries are inspiring. I agree with Beth Janson from the National Film Board of Canada who says that gender equality is essential in shaping storytelling. Telefilm Canada has promised that half of the movies will be directed or written by women. I hope this permeates to the Oscars soon enough.

Juhi Chaturvedi

Juhi Chaturvedi, screenwriter

It has been such a superior year for cinema, be it Marriage Story, The Two Popes or The Irishman. I mean, how do you decide between 1917 or Parasite? In Parasite, the way [director] Bong Joon Ho deals with the ever-existing inequality in society, allowing one to hold on to hope, but still ending it in such a piercing, almost uncomfortable, way that you can’t escape the introspection it demands — that’s what cinema should do.

While I have my fingers crossed for Parasite, I’ll also be satisfied if Once Upon A Time In Hollywood or Marriage Story wins. The latter is such an honest and beautiful observation of a collapsed relationship. I laughed, I cried.

The show must go on: While people may debate the Oscars’ exaggerated existence, I relish every bit of it. Who wore what, said what... Despite the pomp and show, at the end what is put out there is genuinely superior content.

(L to R) Rakul Preet Singh, Adivi Sesh and Chinmayi Sripada

Rakul Preet Singh, actor

I am rooting for 1917 to win Best Picture. I watched a late-night show; I went in thinking it would be another war film, but I was in awe of how it was shot and edited to make it appear like a single-shot film. In the Best Actor category, my choice is Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. It is tough to put forth a performance where you empathise with a negative character. And I really liked Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story and hope she wins in the Best Actress category.

Behind the hype: People can debate if it is worth the hype…to each his or her own. If you can stay up and watch Bigg Boss, why not follow the Oscars?

Chinmayi Sripada, singer

Representation has been an issue at the Oscars, which is predominantly white and doesn’t give a lot of prominence to women. But what I like about the Academy Awards of late is that it is recognising OTT platform films. This gives an opportunity for films that are not releasing on the big screen to get global attention.

While I need to watch The Irishman, I’m rooting for the wonderful 1917. It should win, at least for the cinematography. I’m also of the opinion that Kumbalangi Nights should have been sent from India for the Oscars; Malayalam cinema is churning out some fantastic stuff in the last few years, and they deserve recognition.

Adivi Sesh, actor and writer

I’m aware that Joaquin Phoenix is the front runner for Best Actor for Joker. He’s my favourite, too, though I would rate Heath Ledger’s performance a notch above.

The big winner: Roger Deakins, I think, will win the best cinematography award for 1917. There were moments when the film stirred me emotionally, but rather than being absorbed in the experience, I observed the technicalities and wondered, ‘wow! It’s still the same shot’. Maybe Sam Mendes will win the best director [for 1917] but, to me, Dunkirk was a better war film.

Unforgettable: Among the speeches, I thought Adrien Brody was incredible while winning Best Actor for The Pianist (2002).

(L to R) Nimisha Sajayan, Roopa Rao and Lijo Jose

Nimisha Sajayan, actor

Joker is going to sweep the Oscars. I think Joaquin Phoenix will win the Best Actor award; he cannot be ignored this year. It is such a well-made film, be it the colour palette, sound design, performances or the direction. After watching it, I was on a high for days.

Lijo Jose Pellissery, director

I feel Joaquin Phoenix deserves the best actor award. I loved the performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Marriage Story, but Joker looked more exclusive to me.

Roopa Rao, director

The history of the Oscars sets it apart. It has been around for 70+ years, so the gravity associated with it and the world of opportunities it opens up for the winner [is big]. While any award is a great encouragement, it is not right to compare the Oscars with what we have in India. They slot the films from the rest of the world in one category, so it is not even our field to play in. Moreover, the issues surrounding the Oscars are not for us to debate. We have a thousand issues here that we should be focussing on. What happens at the Oscars can’t be my priority when [there’s plenty] in my immediate space staring me in the face. Gender representation is our biggest task to work on here as well. Isn’t it so?

Ashwin Saravanan, director

My favourite is Parasite. You cannot box it into one genre; it is a thriller, family drama and black comedy at the same time.

The big winner: The obvious choice would be Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, although I liked Adam Driver in Marriage Story. Scarlett Johansson gave a breakout performance in Marriage Story, too. It was so subtly done. She does the big tentpole movies and then something simple like Jojo Rabbit or Marriage Story. Another movie that deserves equal love is Ford v Ferrari, for its vintage Hollywood-style filmmaking.

What’s missing: Stunts is a category that deserves representation. People are risking their lives just so you enjoy Fast and Furious and other tentpole movies that rely on action. The Academy needs to act on this.

(Clockwise from top) Ashwin Saravanan, Radhika Apte, Rima Das and Sriram Raghavan

Radhika Apte, actor

Jojo Rabbit is one film that blew my mind; it made me cry. Another incredible film was 1917. Of course, I liked Joker too, and I am looking forward to watching Little Women. As for rooting for a winner, I don’t know which one to go for, but Jojo Rabbit is a remarkable watch.

Rima Das, director

I am rooting for Parasite to win. I found the film very unique; it surprises you, exposes you to conflicting thoughts and moves you. The Oscars give films global recognition, but where we fall short is the visibility. Indian films suffer due to lack of marketing and publicity at the global level. Whether your film will win the Oscars or not is secondary, to have a fair chance, a good marketing campaign helps. Village Rockstars had a dream run, being an underdog and then going all the way to the Oscars. The Oscars journey is a memory I will always cherish.

Sriram Raghavan, director

1917 will sweep the Oscars, and Phoenix for Joker is a foregone conclusion. Parasite will get the award for Best International Feature, and is a good contender for its script. I loved Ford vs Ferrari and Knives Out; the latter could win for the script. I also liked Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, but only Brad Pitt will get an Oscar for it. It is too indulgent and personal a film [for the Academy]. The Irishman, I thought, was too much of deja vu. I am up at 5 30 am to watch the Oscars. Slumdog Millionaire winning the award was a big moment, more so, because I too wanted to make an adaptation of Vikas Swarup’s Q & A [on which the film is based].

I don’t watch the red carpet, but the ceremony itself. It’s out of sheer habit, but I get such a thrill out of it. I have to watch it live and not later in the news. Earlier there used to be more time spent on lifetime achievement award and speeches but now it has become more cut to cut. I remember Billy Wilder, Akira Kurusawa and John Huston, all on one stage together.

155,2020/02/08,WarnerMedia close to deal with ‘Friends’ cast for reunion on HBO Max,"Warner Bros is finalizing deals with the cast of Friends for a reunion special that will likely be used to launch the HBO Max streaming service this spring, the Wall Street Journal reported.

There have been a flurry of media reports about a potential reunion since Jennifer Aniston, who portrayed Rachel in the hit sitcom series, hinted that something might be underway.

The Journal reported that under terms being discussed, each of the six Friends cast members Aniston, Matt LeBlanc (Joey), Courtney Cox (Monica), Matthew Perry (Chandler), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe) and David Schwimmer (Ross) would receive between $2.25 million and $2.5 million.

Hollywood website Deadline said that the stars will be paid between $3 million to $4 million for an unscripted reunion special.

AT&T Inc’s Warner Bros Television told the Journal there is no deal. A WarnerMedia spokesman did not immediately respond to Reuters queries related to the reports.

HBO Max secured the rights to all 10 seasons of Friends for its streaming service scheduled to launch in April.

The series has found a new lease of life on Netflix where it was the second most-watched show in 2018, according to Nielsen data.

Last year, Aniston spoke to talk show host Ellen DeGeneres about a possible new Friends project saying: “We would love for there to be something, but we dont know what that something is. So we’re just trying. We’re working on something.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i9tqva/article30769593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/friends-1-gty-er-190919hpMain16x91600,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/warnermedia-close-to-deal-with-friends-cast-for-reunion-on-hbo-max/article30769594.ece
156,2020/02/08,"‘Birds of Prey’ review: Girls, guts and glory","When Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) wants another pet, that is including her tutu-clad, one-eyed taxidermied beaver, she picks a hyena from an exotic animal shop. Freshly single, after being dumped by her psychotic paramour, Mr J aka the Joker, Quinn needs closure. What better way to do that, than to annihilate the spot where their love proclaimed? So she drives a truck into Ace Chemicals, the plant where she pledged her love to him. In all her yesteryear Hollywood pin-up twang, smacking chewing gum with a deranged smile, Quinn is quite obviously certifiable. Without Joker’s protection, her consequence-free days are over and everyone she’s ever wronged is out for their pound of flesh.

At the centre of it all is a diamond, encrypted with a key to more riches than anyone could possibly imagine. The jewel is in the hands — actually inside the guts — of a young pickpocket, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). Crime lord Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) recruits Quinn to retrieve the diamond in lieu of her life and soon cop Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) inspired by the 80s, vigilante with hypersonic screams Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and mafia heiress Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) all enter the picture.

Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) Director: Cathy Yan

Cast: Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, Chris Messina, Ella Jay Basco, Ali Wong, Ewan McGregor

Storyline: Newly single Harley Quinn is in hot water with all her foes, but crime lord Roman Sionis will only spare her life if she brings back a diamond he desperately desires

Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) doesn’t quite have that intricate a plot to get your brain’s cogs churning. The film entirely relies on flash, style and suave action to lasso those eyeballs. But because its ruse is apparent doesn’t make it any less entertaining. That said, director Cathy Yan could have exercised some economy in painstakingly introducing every character. With a non-linear structure, the narrative swiftly oscillates from past to present and many a neon marker graphic drawing on screen. Sporadic narration with cheeky innuendos and schticky comedy keep the pace going. Yan crafts a spunky young film that will not allow an audience succumb to distraction. It’s important to mention that in spite of Quinn’s highly sexualised outfit and demeanour, Yan doesn’t resort to pandering to a male gaze, even if she includes a combat scene amidst a downpour of sprinklers.

As is expected from the trailers itself, Robbie is mesmerising in a character that could very well become grating. Yan elicits the essence of each role from the other actors as well, propelling their best to the forefront. Huntress’ awkwardness, Montoya’s upstanding righteousness, Black Canary’s vulnerability, Cassandra’s innocence and even Sionis’ high-pitched eccentric villainy. Credit is due to the film’s writer Christina Hodson too. It’s great to see a film about women, written and directed by women. No wonder then, that there’s no titillating of the audience with visual cues and cringe dialogues. With R-rated superhero films gaining traction at the box office, after Deadpool’s runaway success, it’s heartening to see that effected by women too. DC has been lagging behind with more misses than hits, but Birds of Prey is definitely the latter.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/uuk71k/article30769498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/birds,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/birds-of-prey-review-girls-guts-and-glory/article30769499.ece
157,2020/02/08,"‘Malang’ movie review: Strip the film of its 'style', and it's just an archaic revenge drama","When you drive down winding roads in Ladakh, you often see creative signposts that keep you entertained when the drive gets pretty nauseous. The warning lines flashing on-screen during Malang serve a similar purpose. In this drug-fuelled revenge saga, every time someone snorts, injects or puffs, there’s a warning in the corner of the screen: “Don’t be insane, drugs ruin the brain”, “Addicts don’t get old, they die young”, “drugs cost more than just money”, and my favourite, “Nashe ki maar barbaad kare aadmi aur parivaar (drugs ruin you and your family)”. These lines are often more engrossing and funny than all the over-the-top drama in the film.

Malang Director: Mohit Suri

Cast: Aditya Roy Kapur, Disha Patani, Anil Kapoor, Kunal Khemu

Story line: A heartbroken Advait gets out of the jail to seek revenge and meets a bunch of good and bad cops.

The film opens with a chiselled Aditya Roy Kapur doing pull-ups and then makes his way out of the cell and single-handedly pulps fellow prisoners for a really long time. This machismo is only the beginning of all the ‘mard’ and ‘naamard’ (emasculated) sentiment lying at the core of this film. Every character is on their own trip, committing violent acts in Goa for a variety of reasons, of which the most unsatisfactory ones are the big reveals. Sara (Disha Patani), a free-spirited NRI cliché, who comes to Goa for a cheaper version of Eat Pray Love, is caught in a murderous misunderstanding. All she wanted was the answer to the big mystery of life: “Tumhe sukoon chahiye ya mazaa? (Do you want peace or love?)” and go from “one high to another”. But she ends up getting pregnant after doing “wild wild with a stranger” (a euphemism for sex), and ultimately finds sukoon in, well, Christmas. So the present day and some of the flashback takes place over Christmas Eve, when there is a carnival, a football match in a stadium and Goan villagers running on a bridge after Christmas mass, all in the same evening.

As stretched and basic the first half is, the second half goes all out to prove you wrong – no matter the logic. The high-pitched aesthetics of this film (rife with filmmaker Mohit Suri’s favourite visuals of things falling from the sky in slow-motion) can be overlooked but what is most bothersome is the unsubstantiated violence that rises from strange notions of misogyny and masculinity. Sexual violence and male commitment phobia are ascribed to traumatic childhoods and women exist only to be raped, take revenge or be the motivation for revenge.

Is it too much to ask for filmmakers and writers to refrain from using rape and sexual violence as plot devices in thrillers? Strip the film of all its “style” and you end up with an archaic revenge drama that is made more ridiculous by obvious misunderstandings. At points the film seems to be made just so Kapur and Patani can show off their sculpted bodies and market GoPro cameras on beaches that look more Mauritius than Goa. Even Anil Kapoor, who usually manages to salvage the worst of scripts, is reduced to a beaten-down, revenge-hungry cop. The film is unintentionally funny at points, mildly clever in its second-half and there is a hint of pertinent discussion about encounters and justice within the system but all that is eclipsed by the multitude inane reasoning in the film, that gives you neither sukoon nor mazaa.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nbpiww/article30769236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Malang,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/malang-movie-review-strip-the-film-of-its-style-and-its-just-an-archaic-revenge-drama/article30769237.ece
158,2020/02/08,Former Chief Secretary P. Rama Mohana Rao to enter politics,"Former Chief Secretary P. Rama Mohana Rao on Saturday expressed his intention to launch a political party to give more meaning to inclusiveness among all classes of people in politics which alone, he said, would ensure social justice and overall development of the State.

The former bureaucrat, who was in the city on an invitation from the Tamil Nadu Naidu Mahajana Sangam to participate in the 437th birth anniversary celebrations of Mannar Thirumalai Naicker, told The Hindu that he wished to introduce a new approach to politics/public life where every section of society would have an opportunity to serve the society and contribute to growth.

Classifying his concept in five broad aspects, he said that he would stand as a voice of the unrepresented community in the political spectrum, be a part of the under-represented segments in public life, bring into mainstream politics excluded groups, give hope to these communities to join the forefront and identify the professionals in the unorganised sectors, such as construction workers among others.

Mr. Rao served as Chief Secretary and before that was Principal Secretary to then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for a few years.

He said that communities which had more than a million voters in Tamil Nadu, had no political representation in the Legislative Assembly. Likewise, communities which had a population of 40 to 50 lakh voters, had just two MLAs in the Assembly. He further said that excluded groups, which had a voter population of about 20 lakh or less in the State, continued to be neglected by the Dravidian parties.

Agreeing that it was a Herculean task to instil confidence among various sections on the society, the former IAS officer however, said that he was determined to take his idea forward so that the next generation in all communities would not only benefit, but also be empowered in public life with a new leadership.

During the last six to nine months, Mr. Rao said he had been meeting people from different walks of life in Chennai, Erode, Salem and in Madurai. The interactions have been smooth. The participants welcomed the idea. “As of now, it looks like the goal is achievable...” he said in a confident tone and did not rule out allying with political outfits.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/um8e6w/article30769456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08FEBTH--RAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/former-chief-secretary-p-rama-mohana-rao-to-enter-politics/article30769457.ece
159,2020/02/08,Senior police officers’ homes searched in connection with suspected irregularities in equipment procurement,"Officers of the Department Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) are conducting searches at more than 15 places including the home of a senior police officer M. Anbuchezhian as well as the homes of other officers, in connection with suspected irregularities in the procurement of equipment for the State Police.

Twelve teams have fanned out for the searches across the State, which have been taking place since Saturday morning.

The move comes after the State Home Department’s order of a probe against top police officials for ‘criminal misconduct’ and potential ‘pecuniary loss’ to the government on September 19 last year.

Subsequently, a preliminary internal investigation by the Deputy Inspector General (Technical Services) and Inspector General (Crime) allegedly revealed serious irregularities in the tenders floated for the purchase of CCTV cameras, Digital Mobile Radios (DMR), and the eligibility criteria set for the procurement of these products, among others. On the orders of the State government, the DVAC last year launched a probe into these alleged irregularities, reportedly worth ₹350 crore.

164,2020/02/08,"Haldia Petrochemicals set to invest ₹50,000 crore","Following up on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the Tamil Nadu government earlier, representatives from Haldia Petrochemicals called on Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday to discuss investments to the tune of ₹50,000 crore in Cuddalore district.

A senior official said the meeting of company representatives with Mr. Palaniswami was a follow-up on the MoU signed during Mr. Palaniswami's visit to New York last year.

Haldia Petrochemicals has submitted bid for Nagarjuna Oil's refinery unit in Cuddalore, which is facing liquidation. “The company is likely to get it. In that regard, the company representatives called on the Chief Minister in his camp office on Thursday,” the official said. Although Nagarjuna’s was a refinery, the new plant would be one of petrochemicals.

The outlay is estimated at ₹50,000 crore for converting the facility in Cuddalore into a petrochemical complex.

The team from Haldia was represented by its Chairman and Managing Director Purnendu Chatterjee.

165,2020/02/08,Court dismisses VCK leader’s election petition,"The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed an election petition filed by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol Thirumavalavan challenging the victory of his opponent N. Murugumaran of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) by a margin of 87 votes from the Kattumannarkovil Assembly constituency in 2016.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan also awarded costs of ₹2,000 to Mr. Murugumaran. He pointed out that in the event of dismissal of an election petition, Section 119 of the Representation of the People Act of 1951 grants a discretion to the High Court to award payment of costs incurred by the returned candidate to contest the petition.

Security deposit

Further Section 121 states that the costs should be awarded from the security deposit made by the election petitioner at the time of filing of the case. Since Mr. Thirumavalavan had deposited ₹2,000 as stipulated under Section 117 of the Act, the judge ordered that the amount be appropriated and paid to the sitting MLA.

In the penultimate paragraph of his 129-page judgment rendered on merits and after a full fledged trial, the judge said: “I also understand that the election petitioner has now been elected as a Member of Parliament from Chidambaram constituency in the parliamentary elections held in the year 2019. This court wishes him well.”

Though the main ground raised in the election petition was the rejection of 102 postal votes by the Returning Officer, the judge ordered production of the rejected votes, perused them and expressed satisfaction over the decision to not count them since the attestation forms appended to those votes were not in a proper format.

In so far as the other allegation that the agents of the election petitioner were chased away by the police on the day of counting and the claim that the incidents were recorded by closed-circuit television cameras, the judge said: “Unfortunately, For the reasons best known to the election petitioner, he had not summoned the recordings.

“He had summoned the Returning Officer as a witness, but even then he did not seek for a direction that the witness must produce the copies of the recordings in the CCTV camera. In the absence of proof, this court cannot assume and presume facts... In view of the above discussion, I hold that the election petition necessarily has to suffer an order of dismissal.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/court-dismisses-vck-leaders-election-petition/article30766420.ece
166,2020/02/08,Crop loans: where ‘aberrations’ are the norm,"With the State’s farmers expected to receive crop loans of at least ₹1 lakh crore for yet another year in 2020-21, there is a renewed debate over the efficacy of crop loans, in view of “aberrations” that characterise the pattern of this type of loans.

Institutions in charge of farm credit hold the view that Tamil Nadu is one of the States which have converted crop loans into “agricultural jewel loans (AJLs),” even though the loans are required to be provided only against land documents. Estimates vary regarding the proportion of AJLs in the overall crop loans, which are invariably provided outside the Kisan Credit Cards (KCC). A maximum of ₹3 lakh can be provided as crop loan.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), in its State Focus Paper (SFP) for 2020-21, which was released here on Thursday, identified the “predominance of agricultural gold loans” and “low share of agriculture term loans” as major issues faced by banks in the State.

A report of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) internal working group, made public a few months ago, mentioned that 88% of the loans in the State were given outside the KCCs, despite the cards emerging as a preferred credit instrument all over the country for disbursing crop loans. The report attributed this feature to the AJLs.

Cheap credit

It is widely acknowledged that a chunk of crop loans go for non-farm purposes. A former banker says there have been cases of people taking crop loans to fund higher education of their children.

The main draw is cheap credit — the annual interest rate on AJLs is 4% if repaid within a year. It is to address this problem that the Centre has decided that interest subvention would be available only if the loans were linked to the KCCs. This had come into effect from October last year.

V. Sathyanarayanan, a veteran farmer from Tiruvarur district, says there are many issues that come in the way of crop loans being provided against land documents. More often than not, those taking agricultural lands of temples on rent manage the lands in an informal arrangement. This is widespread in the Cauvery delta. “Any insistence on land documents will only make the crop loans inaccessible to them,” he points out. Moreover, KCCs have not been adequately distributed.

A win-win deal

A senior banker, whose organisation has a huge presence in rural parts of the central districts, justifies loan against jewellery. Ordinarily, the banks, whether private or public sector, provide up to ₹1 lakh as crop loan, taking gold as collateral security.

The level of comfort is “very high” on the part of both banks and the borrowers. Any loan given beyond this figure was extended only against land documents.

As for the projections of credit outlay worked out by the Nabard for the coming year, the crop loans would be to the tune of about ₹98,000 crore and term (medium and long) loans, around ₹35,000 crore. The total would be nearly ₹1.33 lakh crore. The projected figures will be revised subsequently. For instance, the category of crop loans itself is expected to go up to nearly ₹1.3 lakh crore at the time of finalising the target for the coming year, in view of the target of over ₹1.18 lakh crore fixed for 2019-20. Eventually, the disbursal may exceed the target, which has been the case for many years.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sbpzr0/article30766409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Agricultural-credit-disbursal-in-TNcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/crop-loans-where-aberrations-are-the-norm/article30766410.ece
167,2020/02/08,Govt. shielding the accused in Group 1 exam scam of 2016: Stalin,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday termed the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) as “public service corruption” and said he suspected that the cheating in the examinations took place with the knowledge of the ministers and even the Chief Minister.

Mr. Stalin questioned as to how S. Jayakumar, prime suspect in the case, had surrendered before the Saidapet court.

“There is a conspiracy behind this. That is why we have been asking for a CBI inquiry into the case,” he said at a function in Chennai on Friday.

Mr. Stalin, in another statement, charged that the seeds of the current scam in the TNPSC Group-II A and IV examinations were sown in 2016 during the Group I exams.

“I am accusing the AIADMK government of trying to save those who were working completely for the ruling party, the AIADMK,” he charged.

Detailing the investigation into the Group I examination scam, Mr. Stalin said the case filed in 2017 was stalled in January 2018. In 2019, the investigating officer filed a report in the High Court that out of 74 persons, 65 had written the exams in one centre, Mr. Stalin said.

The DMK leader said the investigation officer was then transferred and that a new officer, assistant commissioner Subramaniya Raju, is likely to file the final report.

Mr. Stalin said the government had transferred three investigating officers and waited till three judges had changed only to save a few persons. He demanded that full facts in the case must emerge.

Mr. Stalin expressed his condolences to the family of Dr. Lakshmi Narasimhan, one of the convenors of the Federation of Government Doctors Association, who died on Friday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7yrbuy/article30766407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-shielding-the-accused-in-group-1-exam-scam-of-2016-stalin/article30766408.ece
168,2020/02/08,Panellists enlighten students with words of wisdom,"Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore organised ‘Spotlight’ on Friday, as a prelude to the annual cultural and sports extravaganza ‘Riviera 2020’ which is coming up in next few days.

Eminent speakers from different fields enlightened the students with their words of wisdom to go beyond boundaries.

The programme titled ‘Spotlight’ which provided the platform for the panellists for breaking the stories for the next decade to the students.

In his inaugural address, former Supreme Court Judge, Swatantar Kumar asked the ‘technocrats of tomorrow’ (students) to work towards protecting the natural resources. He reminded that already people area facing the impact of global warming and dumping huge quantum of plastics and other waste into the ocean would make the impact more worst in the future. People have to change their mindset and they should give up the attitude of ‘not in my backyard’ to bring about changes in the environment in India and also Globally, he said.

Additional Director General of Police, Sandeep Rai Rathore moderated the panel discussion on ‘Role of Youth in Current Scenario’ and said that education system in India and in foreign countries cannot be compared as it was based on different culture. Comparing teacher-student relationship with other countries one cannot claim Indian education system is poor. One has to develop clean habits and qualitative technical skills to excel in their career, he said.

VIT Assistant Vice-President, Kadhambari S. Viswanathan said that environment education has been brought into curriculum now. With that effort one can see school children coming out with projects on protecting the environment, which is a welcome sign, she said.

170,2020/02/08,TNPSC orders internal probe to identify corrupt employees,"Stung by one scam after another in the recruitments held in recent times, the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) has ordered an internal inquiry to identify employees who connived with the suspects who took money from candidates.

The Commission has introduced a series of reforms to bring about more transparency and fool-proof methods of conducting examinations in future.

Aadhaar mandatory

As part of the reforms, Aadhaar has been made compulsory for candidates who will be permitted to write the examination after verification of fingerprints.

Admitting that some irregularities occurred in some examinations despite reforms, TNPSC Secretary K. Nanthakumar said it had been decided to publish names of all successful candidates on the official website. After the selection, answer scripts (OMR and written scripts) will be made available on the website for a fee.

Where candidates are selected through personal interview, the details of the posts filled and vacancies under various categories would be published online.

According to a senior TNPSC official, an in-depth investigation was on to identify employees who connived with the suspects. The scam could have been detected at the initial stages had the check-list been followed scrupulously. Had the damaged seals of answer scripts bundles or those on vehicle locks been noticed, the scam could have been detected much earlier.

“Whoever is involved and however high he or she may be placed in this organisation, firm action as per law will be taken. We will roll out reforms to ensure that the system gets fool-proof,” the official who preferred not to be quoted said.

VAO arrested

The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police on Friday arrested M. Narayanan, alias Sakthi, Village Administrative Officer of Ariyur in Villuppuram district, who paid ₹3.5 lakh for himself and ₹34 lakh for five others to pass the VAO examination conducted by the TNPSC in 2016.

The prime suspect in the case S. Jayakumar took the money and helped all of them clear the examination and get into service as VAOs in the Tamil Nadu Ministerial Service.

Efforts were on to arrest the other accused VAOs in the case, sources in the agency said. Mr. Narayanan was accused of paying ₹73 lakh to Jayakumar to help Mr. Narayanan’s wife Mahalakshmi and seven others to clear the Group-IIA services examination held in 2017.

A city court on Friday granted the CBCID seven days custody of Jayakumar.

171,2020/02/08,Centre opposes release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts,"The Centre on Friday stoutly opposed the plea of S. Nalini, 52, convicted in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case, to release her forthwith from prison on the ground that she had been kept in illegal detention since September 9, 2018 when the State Cabinet made a recommendation to the Governor for releasing all seven convicts in the case.

In a counter-affidavit filed before Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs said that it had already rejected two proposals, mooted by the State government in 2014 and 2016, to release the convicts and that the latter decision was taken after consulting the CBI, which had probed the case.

Referring to an order passed by the Supreme Court on September 6, 2018 that the Governor would be at liberty to take a decision on a pending mercy plea of one of the convicts, A.G. Perarivalan, the Centre said, “Governor is a constitutional functionary and he has discretion to decide on the petition under the powers conferred upon him by the Constitution.”

The counter- affidavit, filed through Central government senior standing counsel K. Venkataswamy Babu, was however silent on the validity of the recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the Governor pursuant to the Supreme Court order. It also did not state whether the Governor was bound by the recommendation made by the Council of Ministers or not.

Referring to these anomalies, the petitioner’s counsel M. Radhakrishnan and P. Pugalenthi said that the Centre had absolutely no role in the present habeas corpus petition filed solely on the basis of the State Cabinet’s September 9, 2018 decision. They pointed out that the rejection orders referred to by the Centre were prior to the recent decision taken by the Council of Ministers.

It was on February 19, 2014 that the State government first decided to release all seven convicts and requested the Centre to convey its views since the case had been prosecuted by a central agency. Aggrieved over such a move, the Centre moved the Supreme Court challenging the “arbitrary” decision taken by the State government.

A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court allowed the case in favour of the Centre on December 2, 2015 and ruled that the term ‘consultation’ found in Section 435(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure would in reality mean concurrence and therefore the State government could not unilaterally release the convicts without prior approval of the Centre.

Thereafter, the State government sent a fresh proposal to the Centre on March 2, 2016 seeking concurrence and it was rejected by the latter on April 18, 2018. It was only after all these developments that the State Cabinet had on September 9, 2018 advised the Governor to release all seven convicts involved in the assassination case, Mr. Radhakrishnan pointed out.

Since the Governor was yet to take a call on the Cabinet recommendation, the petitioner, in her affidavit, said: “Since the advice of the Council of Ministers is binding on the Governor... my detention in prison with effect from September 10, 2018 is illegal.” She sought a direction to Vellore prison authorities to produce her in court and set her free.

174,2020/02/08,MoEF wants TS-Genco to phase out 5 more units of KTPS by March-end,"The installed capacity of thermal power generation of the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco) will come down to 2,963 MW from the existing 3,383 MW in the next seven weeks as the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has directed the power utility to phase out five units in its Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (KTPS) by March-end.

Actually the five units — three of 60 MW capacity each and two of 120 MW capacity each — were supposed to be phased out latest by December-end 2019 as part of a condition stipulated by MoEF while giving environmental clearance for the expansion of KTPS with a 800 MW super-critical unit in July 2015. With the closure of the five units with a capacity of 420 MW together, the installed capacity of KTPS will come down to 1,800 MW from the present 2,520 MW.

Three units of KTPS — one with 60 MW and two with 120 MW capacity each — have already been phased out in May 2017, January 2019 and February 2019, respectively.

In response to the TS-Genco’s plea to MoEF seeking amendments in the environmental clearance given to KTPS expansion, an expert appraisal committee of the MoEF which met during the last week of January has allowed the utility to continue the operation of the five units till March-end. The panel also made it clear that the five units are required to comply with the emission norms during the interim period.

The power utility has sought extension in view of the shutdown of the 800 MW super-critical unit on November 28, 2019 following damage of strainer in its turbine. “We have sought the extension of operation of the five units citing the increased demand for energy in the State during the rabi cultivation season as the 800 MW unit is under shutdown for repairs. The power demand on the system is being clocked around 11,500 MW every day for the last two weeks with the peaking of rabi operations,” a senior official of TS-Genco explained.

Supplier of the 800 MW generation unit BHEL has initially sought 30 days for rectification of the problem but later several other snags were noticed in the thermo-wells and turbine and they have asked for 60 to 90 days time for the repairs. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA), in its letter dated January 21, recommended extension of the five units either till March-end or till completion of repairs to the 800 MW unit, whichever is earlier.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/t2vve4/article30772325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09KTPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/moef-wants-ts-genco-to-phase-out-5-more-units-of-ktps-by-march-end/article30772326.ece

177,2020/02/08,Telangana police deploys AI technology at Medaram,"Medaram Jatara which was visited by about 1.5 crore devotees passed off without any untoward incidents thanks to the artificial intelligence used by the Telangana State Police for the first time in the country.

As every devotee who visits the ‘Gadde’ — the holy place of Godesses Sammakka and Saralamma — and duly submit their offerings ‘Mokkulu’, this point of monitoring and maintenance has been been the biggest challenge for the forces deployed at the place of event, a release of the DGP’s office said.

In line with Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s instructions to conduct the popular event without any unsavoury incident, Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy decided to use modern technology during the Jatara at an optimal level.

First he directed the IT wing officials and other senior officers to look into the technology used during the Prayag Raj Kumbh Mela which believed to have attracted the highest number of devotees and the steps taken by the local administration in allowing the pilgrims to go for the holy bath in the River Ganga.

Kumbh Mela

Then the DGP involved the IT officials in the study of artificial intelligence over the last six months. In Prayag Raj Kumbh Mela, urban and upper middle class groups formed the major proportion of devotees while in Medaram, 90 % of devotees comprised of tribal and rural folks.

The officials used the previous related experiences of local crowd management and applied them to the current technology and installed 14 high definition cameras of AI to estimate the crowd by monitoring the inflow of devotees along the route which leads to ‘Gaddelu’ from Jampannavagu, RTC bus stand, Orattam. All these cameras were connected to the ‘Command and Control Centre’ exclusively set up at the Police Camp, Medaram. The DGP visited Medaram twice to review arrangements and measures taken up on an unprecedented scale.

Estimated time

From there with the data gathered by the AI technology, the crowd destiny was estimated based on the incoming devotees and instructions were given then and there to the point officers deployed at the Jatara. The system gave alarms as and when devotees in a square metre area exceeded above 3.6 devotees. Thus it became easy for the State police in maintaining the orderly movement and prevent stampede-like incidents.

Not only the crowd and queues at the festival venue but even the traffic leading to Medaram was effectively regulated with no single instance of congestion, by allotting route-specific parking lots where not a single vehicle was allowed to park on the roads. The entry and exit points were separated to avoid collisions and shopkeepers and vendors were given definite place to set up their kiosks. All this was achieved by working in coordination with other wings of administration.

Enthused with the success, the State police officials said that similar technology and methodology would be deployed for upcoming festivals like Bonalu and Ganesh immersion that attract huge crowds.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/aqt6by/article30771678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09JATARACROWD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-police-deploys-ai-technology-at-medaram/article30771680.ece
178,2020/02/08,Land issues delay head works of Palamuru-Rangareddy project,"Inordinate delay in the acquisition of land has hit the progress of head works of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme, particularly in Package-III in which over 302 out of the required 489 acres land is yet to to be acquired due to farmers not agreeing to the quantum of compensation.

Head works of the project comprise three packages, including excavation and construction of an approach channel for 2.205 km from the foreshores of Srisailam Reservoir, nearly 900 meters length of tunnel and a pump house with nine pumps of 145 MW capacity each (including one spare pump) to lift water for 104 meters as Package-I and put into Anjanagiri reservoir (Package-II) with a storage capacity of 8.51 tmc ft.

Package-III includes construction of an approach channel for 2.650 km from Anjanagiri Reservoir, construction of a head regulator and open canal for 5.675 km length. According to the project engineers, they have secured stage-two forest clearance for 514 acres of forest land required for Package-I and Package-II works. A small extent of private land was yet to be acquired for Package-II.

However, over 302 acres out of 489 acres land required Package-III is yet to be acquired. “The 302 acres land yet to be acquired includes some 290 acres of private patta land mostly in Kudikilla village (250 acres) in Nagarkurnool district. The private patta land is being acquired as per the provisions of GO 123 issued under the Land Acquisition Act with compensation of about ₹5.3 lakh per acre and other rehabilitation benefits,” an engineer supervising the package-three works stated.

Of the 302.54 acres patta land to be acquired, nearly 263 acres lies within the limits of Kudikilla village, where work on about 3 km length of canal work is yet to begin. “Till the last elections to Assembly, a leader in the Opposition was promising the farmers higher compensation and now another leader in the Opposition is doing the same,” a senior project engineer, unwilling to be quoted, said.

Echoing a similar view, Ramulu, a farmer of Kudikilla, said: “Some of the farmers were ready to settle for the compensation offered by the government initially due to their disinterest in fighting the establishment. However, support from some politicians has made us stand firm demanding higher compensation.”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/djyj1s/article30771601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09ANJANAGIRIRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/land-issues-delay-head-works-of-palamuru-rangareddy-project/article30771602.ece

180,2020/02/08,‘Declare Medaram Jatara a national festival’,"The State Minister for Forests and Environment and Endowments A. Indrakaran Reddy has represented to the Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Arjun Munda to declare Medaram ‘Jatara’, organised in Mulugu district, as national festival.

Mr. Arjun Munda visited Medaram to offer prayers to the presiding deities Sammakka and Sarakka on Saturday and he was received by Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, ministers Indrakaran Reddy, Errabelli Dayakar Rao and Satyavathi Rathod.

In a representation submitted to the Union Minister, Mr. Indrakaran Reddy explained the significance of the tribal festival. The festival commemorates the valiant fight of a mother and daughter — Sammakka and Sarakka — against an unjust law imposed by the then reigning rulers.

Many tribal devotees from various States — Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka and parts of Jharkhand — as well as from other countries come to participate in the Jatara, which is organised once in two years. It is believed that after Kumbh Mela, Medaram Jatara attracts the largest number of devotees, he said.

While 80 lakh pilgrims visited the Jatara in 2014, the number rose to 90 lakh in 2016 and 1 crore during 2018. This year, the pilgrims who visited Medaram already crossed 1 crore, he said. “It is time to recognise the great tribal congregation as a national pride and it fulfilled all the criteria to be declared a national festival,” Mr. Indrakaran Reddy said and urged the Union government to support the festival. It could become a national tourist attraction for the world travellers.

The Telangana government had been requesting for national festival status for Medaram Jatara but did not get any response from the Centre so far, he said and urged the Union Minister to take measures to declare Medaram Jatara a national festival.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/declare-medaram-jatara-a-national-festival/article30770907.ece

The flood of devotees continued even on the final day and mostly officials and public representatives came in large numbers expecting less rush. Though the queue lines were sparse, the rush at the altar was heavy.

The priests of Sarakka took the deity to her temple at the Kannepalli which is six kilometres from Medaram and the priests of Sammakka took the deity back to Chilkalgutta hillocks two kilometres from the village. They were accompanied by the police and revenue officials.

Mr. Karnan said the actual work begins after the jatara as over 1,000 sanitation personnel were engaged to spruce up the area for the next 10 days. “We are all show people but sanitation people are real unsung heroes. They clean up the human excreta and animal waste risking their lives. They clean and sprinkle bleaching powder. The medical camps here will continue for one more month and will be on surveillance to check any epidemic,” he said.

184,2020/02/08,Officials told to gear up for smooth conduct of Inter exams,"The State government has exhorted the officials of the Board of Intermediate Education and the district Collectors to be geared up for the smooth conduct of Intermediate public examinations.

Education Minister Sabita Indra Reddy, accompanied by Education Special Chief Secretary Chitra Ramachandran, held a video conference with the officials concerned to review the preparedness of the administration for conducting the examinations to be held between March 4 and 21. In all, 9.65 lakh students are expected to take the examinations being held in 1,339 centres and they would be manned by 24,750 invigilators.

The BIE had decided to deploy 200 sitting and 50 flying squads to monitor the conduct of the examinations. The practical examinations are already underway and the district Collectors should take steps for the effective conduct of examinations for the theory papers. The government had also decided to set up a control room with telephone numbers 040-24601010/24732369 (fax no.: 040-24655027) for receiving complaints, if any.

She wanted the Collectors to review the situation as well as arrangements with senior officials time to time to ensure that students are not put to inconvenience.

Ms. Chitra Ramachandran said the Intermediate examinations are turning point in the lives of students, and arrangements should accordingly be made for their smooth conduct.

‘Prepare route maps’

The officials concerned should prepare the route maps for the examinations in advance while focus should be on setting up of CCTV cameras at the examination centres. Special focus should be on ensuring the safety of the question papers and steps should be taken to enforce Section 144 in the vicinity of the examination centres.

Officials concerned should assess the requirement of sitting and flying squads and deploy the personnel accordingly.

185,2020/02/08,People urged to prune edible oil consumption,"Director General of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Trilochan Mohapatra has stated that apart from improving the production and productivity of oilseeds in the country to meet the growing demand for edible oils, another way out was to reduce the demand by controlling the consumption to a healthy extent.

Speaking at a two-day seminar on “Technological Innovations in Oilseed Crops for Enhancing Productivity, Profitability and Nutritional Security” jointly organised by Indian Society of Oilseeds Research (ISOR) and ICAR-Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research here on Friday, he said it was the responsibility of the citizens to reduce the per capita consumption of edible oils, at least to 6 kg, not only to reduce the huge import bill but also for their better health.

The support of the government in establishing 36 seed hubs for meeting the quality seed supply was a significant step towards achieving higher oilseeds production, Mr. Mohapatra said adding that there was a need to make further value addition in castor to increase export of castor products. By reducing the gap from lab-to-land and value chain from seed to industry and technological interventions such as genome editing, speed breeding, marker associated breeding and others was required to break the yield barriers.

Import dependent

Explaining the status of the vegetable oils in the country, Director of IIOR A. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said more than 60% of the edible oils needs were met by imports — 15 million tonnes worth of about ₹69,000 crore. There was a significant achievement of increase in oilseeds production by 5.5 times to reach to 32 million tonnes from 6 million tonnes in the 1960s.

It was commendable given the fact that more than 70% oilseed cultivation was rain-fed and done in small farm holdings in the country. The present per capita consumption of 18 kg of edible oil was far exceeding the healthy limits.

Vice-Chancellor of Professor Jayashnakar Telangana State Agricultural University V. Praveen Rao favoured clear policy framework for adopting precision agriculture practices and gadgets such as sensors and drones. Former Director General of ICAR Mangala Rai, another former D-G of ICAR Panjab Singh and general secretary of ISOR M.

186,2020/02/08,Hopes for Jakranpally Airport rekindled,"It’s a more a decade-old dream of the locals that has been rekindled following a proposal in the Union Budget 2020 that was presented on February 1 — to construct 100 airports by 2025. The idea to build the airport at Jakranpally had first been mooted 12 years ago under the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government.

In fact, surveys were done twice, and official teams from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) also visited the site in 2008, and later in 2019. In 2008, the then Jakranpally MPP president Ananth Reddy, through the then Minister S. Santhosh Reddy, had presented a report to the government with details of availability of sufficient land in the mandal. Subsequently, authorities identified 1,200 acres of assigned land and 800 acres of patta land. Authorities from the Civil Aviation Department also declared that the land was convenient for the construction of an airport.

Umpteen Gulf fliers

People are expressing happiness over the fresh move as they feel it would enable scores of local migrant workers working the Gulf besides others to travel in comfort from anywhere. According to unofficial sources, about five lakh people from the old integrated districts of Adilabad, Karimnagar and Nizamabad are working in the Gulf.

Located 25 km east of the district headquarters, the site is well connected with all parts of North Telangana. It is just 2 km from NH-44, closer to Armoor Railway Station, NH-63 and Telangana University. The identified land is plain and spread over Jakranpally, Argul, Terlikonda, Kolipaka and Manoharabad villages.

Interested party

Greenfield Project, a private player had reportedly come forward to construct the airport in 2016, and the State government once again sent the proposal to the Centre. “An airport at the site would be suitable and economically viable as many people from the integrated districts travel to Gulf countries every day,” averred former sarpanch of Manoharabad, Tirupathi Reddy.

Better connectivity

To get an idea of the traffic, check this. Everyday 30 flights operate from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad to Gulf countries.

If the airport is set up at Jakranpally, it would be useful for the poor migrant workers from North Telangana districts and also Maharashtra. They can travel to their native places after landing at the airport, taking connecting flights.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2jibg5/article30766094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07-JAKRANPALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hopes-for-jakranpally-airport-rekindled/article30766089.ece

189,2020/02/08,"RJD’s revamp focusses on EBCs, Dalits","With State Assembly polls just months away, Bihar’s Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Saturday held a preparatory strategy meeting that featured a revamped list of district presidents. With the RJD now gearing up for the upcoming elections, scheduled to be held in October-November, the party has rejigged its organisational hierarchy with an increased focus on the Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs) and Dalits, while retaining the emphasis on its traditional M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank.

All senior party leaders, MPs and MLAs attended the meeting at former chief minister Rabri Devi’s official residence at 10, Circular Road, to mull over the likely strategy for the upcoming elections and the Budget session of the legislative Assembly beginning from February 25. Leader of the Opposition and party chief Lalu Prasad’s heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav too was present at the meeting. “Though, there was no fixed agenda to discuss in the meeting, we mulled over the party’s strategies for the upcoming State Assembly election,” said a senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Speaking to reporters as they exited the meeting, senior leaders said the coming days would see a large number of ruling JD(U) leaders joining the RJD as most of them were “unhappy with the party leadership’s stand on the CAA and NRC”. On Saturday JD(U) MLC Javed Iqbal Ansari met the imprisoned Mr. Prasad at the government hospital in Ranchi and questioned party president Nitish Kumar’s leadership.

“About 30-35 JD(U) leaders are in touch with our party chief Lalu Prasad and party leader Tejashwi Yadav,” asserted RJD MLA and former minister Shiv Chandra Ram. “Most of them are unhappy with their party leadership’s stand on CAA and NRC,” he added.

Earlier, on Friday, the RJD revamped the list of its district presidents with added focus on EBC and Dalit leaders. The party, however, maintained its core M-Y representation intact in the list. Out of a total 50 district presidents, the party released the names of 49 while not announcing an appointment to the post of Patna district president. Only 12 district presidents could manage to retain their posts in the new list, while 37 new faces were inducted. In the new list of RJD district presidents, 14 are from the EBC, 8 from SC/ST, while 13 are Yadavs and 12 from the Muslim community. In the previous list 23 were from the Yadav community and 16 were Muslims. This time the party has also created a new post of principal general secretary in each district.

Political observers in the State interpreted the RJD’s move as an attempt to woo the EBC and Dalit voters. “This also shows RJD’s marginal shift from its traditional M-Y core strength and an attempt to make a dent into the JD(U)’s EBC vote bank,” observed political analyst Ajay Kumar.

However, JD(U) leaders took a swipe at the RJD over its revamp. “RJD is still grappling with caste politics while we contest elections on development,” said JD(U) leader and State minister Niraj Kumar. “People of the State know who has done what for the development of the State,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rjds-revamp-focusses-on-ebcs-dalits/article30771998.ece

“Being the Chief Minister, I’ll not allow the RSS to go ahead with its plan, at any cost, of coercing the innocent tribals, having the largest population in Madhya Pradesh, ... into declaring a particular religious identity during the census,” he was quoted as saying in a note released by the government. The note was in response to media reports on the plan.

Rejecting the basic identity of tribals, the RSS was referring to them in its literature as ‘vanvasi’ (forest-dwellers), the note said. “The Chief Minister will not allow anyone at any cost to spew venom in the lives of peace-loving tribals.”

When the RSS failed to get the National Register of Citizens implemented nationwide, it was attempting to take its “dangerous plans” through another route, the note said. “This is another of the divisive plans of the RSS that has come before the country.”

191,2020/02/08,BJP leader felicitates Mumbai cab driver who took poet to police for anti-CAA comments,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) city chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha on Saturday felicitated an Uber driver who took a passenger to the police station after overhearing him talk about the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests last week.

Mr. Lodha also gave Rohit Gaur the “alert citizen award” for taking Bappadittya Sarkar, a 23-year-old poet from Jaipur, to the police on February 5, after he heard the latter talk about some anti-CAA protests.

Mr. Sarkar, who was in the city to participate in the Mumbai Bagh protest, told the police he was merely talking to a friend from new Delhi about people’s general discomfort with such protests as against ‘anti-national’ activities Mr. Gaur had suspected him of.

Mr. Lodha told The Hindu he was thankful to the driver for being socially responsible and wanted to felicitate him on behalf of the citizens of the financial capital. According to the BJP leader, Uber should have felicitated the driver instead of putting him off duty.

“I had a long chat with the policemen who told me Mr. Gaur even recorded the suspicious conversation of the passenger during the journey. Whether the police found anything suspicious is a different thing, but what is important is that the driver was aware of his social responsibility. The company had thrown him out of work for 72 hours, and I just wanted to encourage him for supporting the police,” Mr. Lodha said. He said Mumbai needed alert drivers like Mr. Gaur, and he would continue to look after alert citizens in the future.

As per the statement given by Mr. Sarkar at the Santa Cruz police station, he had hired a driver between Juhu and Kurla at 10.30pm on February 5. During the journey, he spoke to a friend about people’s discomfort with ‘Laal Salaam’ slogan at the Shaheen Bagh protest.

Mr. Gaur, however, told the police the passenger was plotting ‘anti-national’ activities in the cab. On overhearing the conversation, the driver stopped the cab and told Mr. Sarkar he wanted to withdraw money from ATM but later came back with policemen who took both of them to the police station.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/apnvjf/article30771947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bm-Alert,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cab-driver-who-took-poet-to-police-felicitated/article30771948.ece

194,2020/02/08,Transgenders roped in to collect tax in Bhubaneswar,"The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has taken the help of members from the transgender community to collect holding tax from defaulters.

Swikruti, a transgender self-help group, began the collection of holding tax with the tagline ‘Tax dijiye, dua lijiye’ (Give tax and take blessings).

The BMC has set a target of collecting tax to the tune of ₹11 crore from major defaulters and members from Swikruti will earn 1% of the collected tax amount. On Friday, the first day of the initiative, members collected a total outstanding holding tax amount of ₹66,264.

“By engaging the transgender community in tax collection, we want to create a source of income for the community,” said BMC Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary.

Members from Swikruti were issued identity cards and proper uniforms for the collection of pending taxes in Bhubaneswar, Odisha’s the largest urban local body.

195,2020/02/08,"CBI books advocate, two others for using forged papers to file petitions","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked three persons, including an advocate, for allegedly using forged papers to file petitions in the Allahabad High Court in a bid to grab about 57.55 hectares of land acquired by the government in Lucknow.

The agency has registered two cases, in which main accused Ashok Pathak, his associate Kapil Pratap Rana and advocate Vinayjit Lal Verma have been named.

The land located in Lucknow’s Sarojini Nagar was transferred to Gram Samaj in November 2002 and taken over by the government vide a District Magistrate’s order on May 10, 2016. The next month, a writ petition was filed against it in the High Court’s Lucknow Bench purportedly by one Khursheed Agha.

However, Mr. Agha denied having filed the petition. Accordingly, in June 2019, the court directed the CBI to identify the person involved. In September last year, the agency was told to probe a contempt petition filed in Mr. Agha’s name.

The CBI found that the writ petition was allegedly prepared by Mr. Verma at Mr. Pathak’s instance and a forged voter card was used for filing it. Mr. Agha’s name was used, as an earlier petition moved by the accused was rejected with the court observing that the original claimant (Mr. Agha) had better rights on the land.

The CBI found that an “assignment deed” for the land shown to have been executed in 1997 — between Mr. Agha (as a manager of Waqf property) and Mr. Rana (as secretary of one Aadhunik Sahkari Grih Nirman Samiti) — was also forged. The latter never held such a post, as alleged.

In December 2015, for a part of the land, a sale deed was signed between Mr. Rana and a company, in which Mr. Pathak was a director. The proceeds were allegedly diverted to him, his family members and a friend.

A contempt petition was then filed in Mr. Agha’s name, through the advocate, as some temporary work done on the land was demolished by the authorities.

The company, through Mr. Pathak, engaged a firm for selling a portion of the land. About ₹11 crore of booking amount was collected for 270 plots. While ₹1.81 crore was paid in commission, the rest was diverted via a company’s account opened allegedly at Mr. Pathak’s instance. The other directors were not in the know.

When the land was not developed, suspecting something amiss, the firm stopped receiving payments from customers and also refunded about ₹3.50 crore.

It is also alleged that cheques for ₹20 crore issued by Mr. Pathak to the company’s other directors, as part of a settlement deed signed after the whole matter came to light, had bounced.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kv1a0s/article30635400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-CBI-headquarters,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cbi-books-advocate-two-others-for-using-forged-papers-to-file-petitions/article30771646.ece
196,2020/02/08,Over a dozen activists from north Kashmir join BJP in Jammu,"More than a dozen political and social activists from north Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Saturday joined the BJP here, pledging to “strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the development of the Union Territory.”

Nine of the new entrants into the BJP are from the Uri constituency, including joint secretary of youth National Conference Mohammad Akram, People’s Conference Organiser Ishfaq Ahmad Lone, sarpanch Sofiya Begum and Panchayat chairman Javid Hussain, a party release said.

It said former vice zonal president of PDP (Tangmarg) Abdul Ahad Malik, Panch Mohammad Shafi Najar and several other social workers from Rafiabad also joined the party.

“We have come to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister for the welfare of the region. Modi’s mission of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ has touched the lives of the minority communities and every section which was neglected for the past seven decades,” the statement said quoting the new entrants.

They said that Mr. Modi’s policies have benefited everyone from every region.

“Today new hope and confidence is infused in common Kashmiri as Kashmir now progresses on the path of peace and development. People of Kashmir have seen enough bloodshed and violence and now it is the time for development,” the statement said.

Welcoming them into the party fold, BJP General Secretary (Organisation) Ashok Kaul said their joining will further strengthen the BJP in the valley and asked them to render their whole-hearted services for the benefit of common masses as representative of BJP in their respective areas.

“The BJP has gained confidence of every person cutting across the lines of region or religion. Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are fast moving on the path of peace and progress and BJP is here to ensure this,” Mr. Kaul said.

He said the Modi-led government has won hearts of minorities in the country, while other political parties in the past misused them and considered them as a mere vote bank.

The police are issuing notices to these protesters, an official said on Saturday. An assistant commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) lodged a complaint at Nagpada police station in central Mumbai on Friday evening. It stated that the civic body could not carry out construction work on Morland Road as the protesters have set up a stage and put chairs on the road and also obstructed traffic, the police official said. Nagpada police registered a case under IPC Sections 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) as well as under relevant Sections of the BMC Act, the official added.

A women’s protest, on the lines of the ongoing sit-in at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, is under way on Morland Road since Republic Day against the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). It is also attracting activists from other parts of the city as well as the country, celebrities and others. Normal traffic on the road has stopped for the last two weeks, the police official said.

After registering the offence, the police are noting down names and addresses of participants and have issued notices under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code to 16 persons including women, warning them not to violate law. The section empowers the police to take action to prevent a crime.

Some protesters refused to accept notices, the police official said. The police also took a ‘bond of tranquillity’ from activist Feroz Mithiborwala who was present at the protest, he said. “We are doing all this for safety and security of the people who are protesting and to maintain law and order,” the official said, adding that the protesters should cooperate with police. “If any individual disobeys the orders, does not cooperate or argues with the police personnel doing their duty, we will register a case against him or her,” he added.

The police were also recording the protest on video, the official said. Two days ago, a photojournalist covering the protest was allegedly roughed up by two policemen.

Virar police registered the case under the Section 67B of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, based on the complaint forwarded by Facebook, said Palghar Police PRO Hemant Katkar.

“Child pornographic videos were posted on Facebook accounts of 17 IP addresses from the Vasai-Virar belt in Palghar district during April 23 and May 8, 2019. The case under IT Act was registered on the complaint of Facebook,” he said.

An official said Mr. Akhtar, considered a close confidante of party president Mehbooba Mufti, was shifted from the MLA Hostel sub-jail to M-5 government accommodation here on Saturday morning after the PSA notice was served on him.

Mr. Akhtar was a government spokesman of the PDP-BJP alliance in 2015-18 and faced several attacks, including petrol bombs attack on his house, for the party decision to ally with the ideologically opposite party BJP.

Detained on August 5, 2019 during the clampdown against the mainstream leaders in the wake of the revocation of J&K’s special status, the extension of detention of Mr. Akhtar under the PSA would mean he could be held behind the bars without a trial up to two years and his release depends on the charges levelled against him.

The development comes just two days after four mainstream leaders including two former Chief Ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah also faced the PSA.

However, two NC leaders, ex-speaker Mubarak Gul and political advisor to Mr. Omar Abdullah, Tanvir Sadiq, were released from the MLA hostel and shifted to their residences. Only eight leaders now remain detained in the MLA Hostel, including J&K Peoples Movement chief Shah Faesal.

The police claimed that two persons, including an LLB student, were held in Bandipora for pasting provocative posters of the banned militant outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba in Hajin area.

201,2020/02/08,Don’t need anybody’s permission to visit temples: Pawar,"After an organisation of warkaris (pilgrims) criticised Sharad Pawar for “promoting atheism” and urged the community members to stop inviting him to religious events, the NCP chief on Saturday hit back saying that there was no need for anybody’s permission to visit temples.

Rashtriya Warkari Parishad had recently issued a statement in which it had urged the community members to stop inviting today’s “atheist rulers” for religious functions or for events like inaugurations or lectures.

“Honourable Sharad Pawar saheb says there is no need of ‘Ramayana’. He supports those who indulge in insult of gods, saints, Hindu religion...Therefore, warkaris should remain cautious in future and always remember that they are Hindu first,” the Parishad had said.

It also urged the warkari community to stop inviting those politicians to religious functions, inaugurations or to give lectures, who promote atheist thought.

Addressing a gathering in Alandi, a popular pilgrim town in Pune district, Mr. Pawar said there was no need to seek anyone’s permission to visit Lord Vitthal’s temple in Pandharpur and pray there.

“If you want to worship Lord Vitthal, you visit Pandharpur. If you want to worship Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, then you visit Alandi and Dehu respectively. There is no need to take permission from anyone to visit these places,” he said.

“Therefore, if anyone says that you don’t have permission to visit these places, then I think they don’t understand the thought of the warkari sampraday (sect),” he said.

“A true warkari will never take such a stand.

203,2020/02/08,Opposition NPF urges Nagaland govt. to come clean on status of Naga peace talks,"Opposition Naga People’s Front (NPF) has lambasted ruling People’s Democratic Alliance (PDA) of Nagaland for allegedly misleading the public on the status of the Naga peace talks and urged the State government to come clean.

Initiating the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address delivered on the first day of the budget session of the Assembly on January 17, NPF MLA Imkong L. Imchen on February 7 said in the House that the State government was creating confusion among the public regarding the talks between the Centre and the Naga political groups.

He said that Governor R.N. Ravi, in his speech to the members, had made conflicting statements by saying on one hand, that the talks “have concluded” and on the other, sought the support of everyone for “successful conclusion” of the negotiations.

Mr. Imchen urged the State government to clarify whether the talks had concluded, asserting that the Naga people are desirous of an early solution.

NPF MLAs Y. Vikheho Swu, Chotisuh Sazo and Kuzholuzo Nienu supported Mr. Imchen’s demand.

Mr. Swu said the final settlement, how the Centre wants to design it, entirely depends on the Union government.

He urged the Centre not to use the “excuse” of not getting a “favourable response” from neighbouring States of Nagaland to prolong the final settlement of the Naga peace talks.

Mr. Sazo said the negotiating parties must take all sections of people in confidence to avoid dissensions in the future.

“The solution should be inclusive and honourable whereby durable peace shall reign in our land.”

“We (legislators) have to appeal to all the Naga political groups to come together and put the Naga political issue forward...to prepare a common landing ground,” he said.

MLA Nienu said the Governor’s address was confusing since he said “we are very close to the solution” and also that the talks have “concluded”.

“The entire world knows that the Naga peace talks are yet to be concluded, and hence, the government must spell out the actual status of the ongoing negotiations,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/x0f93e/article30769344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DECRAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/opposition-npf-urges-nagaland-govt-to-come-clean-on-status-of-naga-peace-talks/article30769345.ece
204,2020/02/08,"Maoist bastion in Odisha’s Malkangiri ‘crumbling’, say police","Securitry forces in Odisha claim to have established ‘domination’ in 70% of the area in Swabhiman Anchal in the State’s Malkangiri district, which was considered a bastion of the outlawed CPI (Maoist).

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a press conference to announce the State’s biggest ever arms and ammunition seizure in a Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected area, a senior police official asserted that the Maoists’ hold in the region formerly known as ‘cut-off area’ appeared to be crumbling.

Also Read Where Odisha is galloping to progress

“Early January we had launched a big composite operation in cut-off area involving Odisha police, Greyhound Force of Andhra Pradesh, BSF and CRPF,” said Director General of Police Abhay. “It gave us a lot of inputs as to how Maoist extremists operate. The arms and ammunition recovered during the operation was probably one of the biggest seizures made in LWE theatre across India,” he added.

Swabhiman Anchal was considered as a ‘liberated zone’ by the CPI (Maoist) extremists similar to the area in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh.

The cluster of 151 villages in Malkangiri district is encircled by water from three sides, while a land mass is connected with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. About a year-and-a-half ago, the Odisha government constructed a bridge over the Gurupriya River, formally establishing road connectivity to the cut-off area.

In 2008, as many as 39 security personnel, most of them belonging to Andhra Pradesh police’s Greyhound Force were killed in a Maoist ambush in the Balimela reservoir. The Maoist citadel was in the news again in 2011 when Malkangiri district collector R. Vineel Krishna was abducted. BSF personnel were also killed in a landmine explosion triggered by the ultras.

“We have managed to bring 70% of Swabhiman area under our control,” said a senior police officer involved in anti-Maoist operations in Odisha, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Roads are being laid. We will shortly set up a police station at Jodambo village which was under control of the Maoists,” the officer added. The upcoming Jodambo police station would be the second police establishment after Papermetal, currently the sole functional police station in the cut-off area.

Based on voice intercepts as well as intelligence inputs, the security forces had learned that the CPI (Maoist) extremists were on the back foot in the area, the officer asserted.

As per the seizure list, an INSAAS light machine gun, three INSAAS rifles, three carbine sten guns, SLR rifles, pistols, 202 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition, LMG magazines and explosives were among the weapons recovered. The arms haul is said to be major jolt to the Maoists in this area.

The composite operation code-named Swabhiman was conducted between January 8 and 13. During the period, security personnel kept vigil round the clock. A total of 32 teams had participated, with force movement guided by GPS-based technology. Since the area was small there was a real risk of security personnel losing their lives in ‘friendly’ fire incidents.

The operation was aimed at providing security coverage in the cut-off areas for road construction, an activity that was opposed by the Maoists. Connectivity in the area is expected to bring development to the remote area.

The composite operation had also instilled a sense of self confidence in the local tribals who, on January 25, picked up a rare brawl with the Maoists, who were opposing development projects.

According to the police about 300 CPI (Maoist) cadres are active in Odisha with a majority of them, about 200, coming from Chhattisgarh. Some 30 or so ultras are believed to be from Odisha, while the rest are from Andhra Pradesh.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/u9ppcf/article30769065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMALKANGIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maoist-bastion-in-odishas-malkangiri-crumbling-say-police/article30769066.ece

208,2020/02/08,‘Art from waste’ museum opens in Ganjam,"The open air ‘art from waste’ museum being developed by students of the Odisha government-managed Industrial Training Institute, Berhampur, was dedicated to the public on Friday.

In record book

The museum has more than 20 large artefacts created from metal waste by the institute’s students. Four of these artefacts — 33-foot-high giraffe, 22.1-foot-high fishing lure, 26-foot-high iron-man and 70-foot-high guitar — have already got a mention in the Asia Book of Records. According to institute principal Rajat Kumar Panigrahy, the giant fishing lure and iron-man sculptures may be included in the Guinness World Records.

Among the artefacts is an old bus that has been converted into a hall of glory for female alumni of the institute. An olive ridley turtle and a blackbuck deer depict the natural heritage of Ganjam district. These artefacts, ranging from seven feet to 70 feet, have been designed, fabricated and installed by the students.

The ceremony to dedicate the museum was named ‘the mind, heart and hands show’. Masood Hussainy, head of Aero Structure and Aero Engines of Tata Advanced Systems Limited; Subrato Bagchi, chairman of the Odisha State Development Authority; several government officers and a TASL team attended the function.

210,2020/02/08,The long wait for maternity benefits: How red tape drowned a central scheme in Gujarat’s Dahod district,"Protest songs and slogans on their lips and toddlers cradled in their arms, nearly 70 women march in single file into the three-storied District Panchayat office in Gujarat’s Dahod. Confidently, the women climb the first two floors and park themselves outside the office of the Chief District Health Officer. While many young mothers sit along the corridor tending to their young infants and nursing them, others dance in circles to impromptu renditions of folk songs that are aimed at shaming the government officials for nine recent maternal deaths in the district and prevalence of malnutrition. The primary refrain, though, is that the officials are forcing the mothers, who live in remote villages, to travel for hours to demand their rightful benefits, when they should actually be caring for their young ones. “Sisters have been pushed around and forced to come to the district panchayat,” they say.

Also Read The mother of non-issues: on maternity entitlements

Dahod is primarily a tribal district bordering Madhya Pradesh. “74.3% of the population [is] from the Scheduled Tribes such as Bhil, Nayak, Rathwa, Bhabhor; people travel to different parts of the State in search of work. Poverty, early marriage and illiteracy with higher family size is the typical profile of the rural areas of Dahod,” explains Neeta Hardikar, co-founder of ANANDI, an NGO which works for poor rural women in Gujarat.

These are also the reasons cited by the Population Foundation of India for a high decadal growth in the population of Scheduled Tribes in the district between 2001 and 2011 which, at 34%, was nearly double that of the rate of population growth in the country. For Dahod as a whole, this figure was 30%, and for Gujarat, it was 19.28%. On the ground, too, four to five children in a family seems to be the norm.

A 120-km travel for young mothers

The mothers are here to demand their maternity entitlements under the Central government’s Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and the Gujarat government’s Kasturba Sahay Poshan Yojana (KSPY). Coming from the remote villages of Piplod, Dabhva, Bara, Fulpura and Juni Bedi in Devgadh Baria taluka, they have travelled for nearly three hours and covered a distance of about 120 km in jeeps.

The protest by the women is timed to coincide with the third anniversary of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s televised address, in which he promised a sum of ₹6,000 to pregnant women and young mothers across the country, on the birth of their first child. This programme was later christened Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana. The scheme promises a total sum of ₹5,000, to be given in three instalments to pregnant women and lactating mothers. Those who receive similar benefits from their employers and government employees are excluded from the scheme.

The benefit is provided only for the first live birth and the money is to be credited to the beneficiary’s Aadhaar-linked savings account in different intervals over a period of nearly 14 months. Each instalment is paid after the mothers meet certain conditions — the first instalment after early registration of pregnancy; the second instalment after six months of pregnancy on the completion of at least one ante-natal check-up; and the third instalment after the registration of child-birth and the first cycle of immunisation of the child.

The government has clubbed this with the Janani Suraksha Yojana, which provides a benefit of ₹700-₹1,000, to claim that women will get “on an average” ₹6,000 for every first child.

In Dahod, among those occupying the second-floor corridor is a grief-stricken and expressionless 26-year-old, Ushaben Girishbhai Naik. While she does not join the chorus of protest, she is here to mark her presence nevertheless. On December 12, she lost her 20-month old daughter, Vilasben, after a severe bout of diarrhoea and vomiting.

Back at her home in village Juli Bedi, the girl’s grandfather pulls out from an iron trunk among the few memorabilia he possesses — a piece of paper on which is scribbled Vilas’s date of birth, April 3, 2018; and date of death, December 12, 2019. The infant’s father brings a framed photo of hers neatly wrapped in a red and white gamcha and the entire family breaks down in a collective outpouring of shared grief.

When Vilas was 14 months old, an examination by a local health worker affiliated with ANANDI, the NGO, revealed that she weighed merely 5.2 kg, (i.e.) 30%-45% less than her ideal weight. As per the World Health Organization (WHO)’s child growth standards, this placed the toddler in the ‘red’ or ‘severely underweight’ category, while the local anganwadi worker had marked her in green on her growth chart, identifying her as a child with healthy growth levels. At the NGO’s intervention, the child was admitted to the local Child Malnutrition Treatment Centre for 14 days, where she showed signs of recovery and gained two kg. But when her last follow-up was conducted on August 22, not only did she have fever, it was found that her progress had retarded and she had begun to lose weight again.

The year 2019 was a difficult one for the family. Their entire maize cultivation on an approximate 1.5-bigha land was washed out in heavy rains and there was very little to eat. Ushaben and her husband left for Navagam near Rajkot, like every year, for two months. Here, they toiled hard at cotton fields, earning ₹100 for every 20 kg of cotton plucked. But when the news of their daughter’s ill-health reached them, they had to leave lock, stock and barrel for their village with the little money they had been able to earn. Despite these hardships, Ushaben stood disqualified from PMMVY on the grounds that Vilas was her second child. Top government officials have admitted that this is among the flaws of the scheme, linking it with a paucity of funds.

High child malnutrition rate

As per the National Family Health Survey 2015-2016, 44.4% of children in Dahod can be categorised as ‘stunted’; 24.9% as ‘wasted’; and 50.8% as ‘underweight’. Approximately 58.9% of children in the age group of 6 months-59 months and 56.3% women in the age group of 15 years-49 years are anaemic. Around 44% of women have below normal Body Mass Index.

While the Gujarat government’s scheme KSPY was revised after the announcement of PMMVY to cover second and third birth, it is dogged by cash crunch. According to the testimonies of village-level health workers at Juni Bedi Health Sub-Centre, no cash benefit has been provided to beneficiaries after August 2018. As a result, as many as 19 women have not received a single paise.

This is why a scheme like PMMVY can make all the difference, but beneficiaries say that the process is tedious and makes it very difficult for women to claim the benefits. Those few who are able to finish the documentation work have to often wait for several months, at times for years after their child is born, before they receive the cash benefit.

Kailash Shailesh, 32, and her husband had applied for the scheme on January 22, 2018, nearly a month after their daughter was born. At the District Panchayat office, records show that her registration was successful and her application was approved, but a response from the Public Financial Management System, the e-platform for payment of government subsidy, was “pending”. The money arrived nearly a month later on January 27, 2020, after their daughter had turned two. “Even though ₹5,000 is too little a sum, I could have used the money when I needed it the most —immediately after my child was born. I had to take a loan to buy fruits, ghee, almonds and milk. For two to three months after the delivery, my monthly expenditure went up by ₹1,700-₹2,200. We should get the money at least four months after childbirth, but in almost all cases that never happens. The scheme does not fulfil the purpose it is meant for,” explains her husband Shailesh Kumar Saiba.

An arduous process

Saiba, with an MA and a B.Ed, is among the few literate residents of the village and also a local activist; but even for him, filling in the application was a lengthy and arduous chore that called for nearly four visits to the local bank, 20 km from his home, to link his wife’s Aadhaar card with her account. He was also asked to bring his heavily pregnant wife to provide her thumb impression.

Saiba’s neighbour, 21-year-old Patel Parvati Ben Aditya, submitted her documents for the scheme more than a year ago, but on this visit to the Zilla Panchayat office, she has been told that there is no record of her application. Members of the local women’s collective inquired in their village and found out that her application was sent by the anganwadi worker but was not processed at the taluka office. It emerged that the computer operator couldn’t feed Parvati Ben’s information in the system because the computer had been lying unrepaired for several months. The money would have been a substantial help for the family whose total monthly income is a mere ₹2,000-₹3,000.

The lengthy documentation work includes filling up six documents, totalling 32 pages — an application form to be filled for each of the three instalments; an application for linking the Aadhaar card with bank account; another one for linking the Aadhaar card with the post office account; and a feedback form. Applicants have to also submit at least nine other documents for verification. These include an Aadhaar card (or enrolment slip when there is no card), an identity proof, a voter ID card (as age proof). Each of these documents have to be submitted by the woman beneficiary and her husband. Apart from these, there must be a copy of the ration card issued to the husband’s family, a bank passbook and the maternal and child protection card. To top it all, the woman’s Aadhaar card must have the husband’s name on it. Most young mothers have their first child in the first year of their marriage. Just collecting the documents can take six to seven months.

Patriarchy at play

Sample this — a woman has to first obtain a new election card because of the change in her address after the marriage and after that she places a request for adding her husband’s name to her Aadhaar card. Once this is done, she can have her name added to the ration card of the marital family. These require visits to the local taluka block-level officer deputed at a primary school in the village, to the Aadhaar Kendra in the taluka and then to the magistrate. “This is patriarchy at play. A woman has to be married and living with her husband to avail the benefits under PMMVY. If she is abandoned and she returns to her natal family, she can’t provide her husband’s Aadhaar card and she is left out of the purview of the scheme. When a woman is pregnant, it is visible to everyone. She should be able to provide her own Aadhaar card and demand the cash incentive owed to her,” says Seema Shah, from the NGO ANANDI.

Women protesting at the panchayat office in Dahod.

While in New Delhi, senior Union Ministers and top bureaucrats have time and again underlined that the purpose of an Aadhaar card is to enable the availing of government benefits and checking pilferage and that no one can be denied access to a scheme for not possessing an Aadhaar card, in reality, not owning this identity document can prove to be punitive. Further, there are several clauses that are likely to exclude many. For instance, an applicant has to be at least 19 years old, which leaves out younger brides who hesitate to get their marriages registered as the legal age of marriage is 18 years. In Dahod, at least 32.8% of girls are married before the age of 18. The application form also requires separate undertakings from the woman and her husband that the child for whom they are seeking the benefit will be “the first living child for both of them”, further making it prohibitive.

At ‘anganwadi number one’ of Juni Bedi village, it is lunchtime and young children and pregnant women flock to the centre for their daily meal. Among the six pregnant women present, three are expecting their first child, but none of them have been enrolled under PMMVY, admits anganwadi worker, Savitaben. She explains, matter of factly, that this is because they don’t have an Aadhaar card. Rewali Rakesh Naik and Jentaben Ramesh Bhai Naik either don’t have an Aadhaar card, or don’t have one with their husband’s name on it; they have no address proof for their marital home; and haven’t added their name to their marital family’s ration card. The third, whose identity is being withheld, is visibly a minor. She is married to a boy younger to her as is the practice locally. She does not have an identity proof either, nor is she likely to get her marriage registered to apply for identity documents for fear of the law.

At the local district office, there is no record available of how many women have benefited from the scheme. There is, however, data available for the total amount of money disbursed. Extrapolation of the data shows that between April 2018 and December 2019, a total of 2,042 women from Devgadh Baria taluka received the first instalment; 2,012 received the second instalment and 1,534 received the third instalment. From the start of the scheme in 2017 and till December 31, a total of 2,921 women have received at least some benefits. The taluka has a population size of 2.49 lakh of whom 1.24 lakh are women according to 2011 Census.

Chief District Health Officer R.R. Parmar meets the protesters and promises that the backlog of applications would be cleared and funds transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. However, he is more concerned about the “large size” of some families and explains that the district has “directions to spread awareness about family planning, encourage birth spacing and use of contraceptives”. Meanwhile the Child Malnutrition Treatment Centre is full. Records show that in any given month, it has 120% occupancy, i.e. an average of 24 children per month where it expects 20 children. Activists say there have been nine maternal deaths and eight infant deaths in Devgadh Baria in the past three months — the data is collected through a network of women volunteers across different villages.

Low coverage

Nationally, 38.3 lakh women, or 61% of 62.8 lakh beneficiaries registered under PMMVY between April 2018 and July 2019, received the full amount of ₹5,000 promised under the scheme, according to an RTI application filed by economists Reetika Khera, Jean Dreze and Anmol Somanchi. The researchers assert that the scheme failed to reach at least 49% of total 123 lakh mothers who are estimated to have given birth to their first child and, therefore, it was able to benefit only 31% of its intended beneficiaries. Worse, the economists contend, since the total number of births in 2017 was 270.5 lakh, the number of births covered stands at 23% of the total number of child births that year, and the proportion of those who actually received the cash benefit is a paltry 14%.

Ms. Khera explains how the scheme can be improved: “The PMMVY needs to be brought in line with the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, by removing the arbitrary restriction that permits a cash benefit only for the first-born. Second, the amount of cash benefit also needs to be increased. Both of the above are violations of the NFSA. In fact, the government should emulate the example of Tamil Nadu, which offers ₹18,000 under its State scheme. Third, mandatory use of Aadhaar should be removed. Any government identity document should be acceptable so that beneficiaries are not forced to run from pillar to post. Instead, make the banking system more robust and widespread. NEFT is an effective way to transfer money electronically, whereas linking Aadhaar with bank accounts has created new problems.”

Erode and Vellore Corporations and Hosur Municipality were identified as Model Cities in the State for implementing the ‘Model City’ pilot project under the Tamil Nadu Sustainable Urban Development Project that is funded by the World Bank. The project aims at improving urban infrastructure and services and e-governance for a specific area in the city.

A Chennai-based consultant had carried out the study and submitted a report in which 1.03 sq. k.m. in Panneerselvam Park area and Periyar Nagar were selected for carrying out plan. The project area comprises 5,397 households with a population of 19,455 who are mostly upper middle income groups and mostly merchants.

Details of the project include, development of major roads and smart streets, improving the junctions at GH Roundabout, Panneerselvam Park, Kalaimadu Statue, E.V.N. Road – Chennimalai Road and Surampatti Four Roads, developing the SKM Park and Periyar Nagar Park, and construction of 13 smart bus stops with intelligent transport system integration that displays GPS location of the bus and bus arrival timings at the stops.

213,2020/02/08,One foot in front of another,"Running can get boring after some time and runners are often on the lookout for new ways to motivate themselves. There is only so much weight one can lose through running and only so much improving on speed. Some gravitate towards other fitness routines and there are others who do other things like:

Run with friends/family

Take time out to accompany friends or family members who running for the first time. In motivating them to run, one re-motivates oneself. It will also be a reminder on how far you have come. Such initiatives build better relationships and brings good health to everyone.

Be a pacer

A pacer is an experienced runner who guides other runners to finish within the time limit. To become a pacer, a runner chooses a pace slower than his/her comfort level and foregoes personal aspirations to help others achieve theirs. It is altruistic and widely appreciated by fellow runners.

My recent experience of pacing at the Mumbai Marathon got me unprecedented applause that was worth more than all my medals. Training to run at a slower pace than usual is an experience and feels like learning to run yet again.

Pick a cause

Apart from running events organised to raise funds for specific causes — the Coimbatore Marathon, for example, is about cancer awareness — runners can raise money for a cause that they are passionate about. Major running events have exclusive registrations for runners opting to raise funds for registered charities. Those participants who ran for a cause in the New York Marathon raised over $40 million in 2018 for various charities. This gives the runner another dimension. It is no more about personal achievement. The cause takes centre-stage. Every donation brings additional motivation to see the distance through. Although still a nascent concept in India, runners in the recent Chennai Marathon raised over ₹27 lakhs to restore the city’s lakes.

Be a volunteer

Volunteers are the back-bone of marathons. It is practically impossible to organise an event of such magnitude without their support. Be it cheering for the runners, helping them with water, controlling traffic, or just guiding them through the finish areas, they provide extraordinary support. Volunteering takes a significant amount of energy and can sometimes be more tiring than running. Besides, there is nothing more motivating than watching people run. As Katherine Switzer once wrote, “If you are losing faith in human nature, go out and watch a marathon.”

Spread the good word

By writing and talking about running, one becomes an evangelist for running. The medium of broadcast is much wider and accessible, thanks to the Internet. Share your views, experiences and ideas and learn from those of others. It helps you explore many unknown facets about running and the positive changes that it brings to many lives. Every runner has a story and the stories of my fellow runners have inspired me to do more.

Running starts as a fitness activity and ends up as a way of life. It has enriched lives by improving not only physical health but also mental well being. There is a lot that one can do by just simply putting one foot in front of another and forging ahead.

221,2020/02/08,Crafts Council seeks corporate support,"Sixty members of Crafts Council of India (CCI) from across the country met at the Kumaraguru College of Technology here. The event, hosted by Crafts Council Tamil Nadu after nearly two decades, began with the inauguration of Thambaalam, an exhibition of platters and trays, some over a century old, and others more contemporary made of brass, copper, wood and stone incorporating various art forms like Gond art, miniature painting, Pilkhuwa block painting, Pichwai, copper enamel and minakari work. Some of the exhibits were from private collections, while others were specially commissioned for the event.

In her inaugural address, Gita Ram, Chairperson, CCI, said, “Lack of funds is a very serious concern and we are completely dependent on corporates for help. We need their support to keep craft alive and to keep the next generation of craftspeople still interested.”

Partnerships with corporates was the underlying theme, and Sharda Gautam of Tata Trust and Manish Saxena, who leads the CSR initiatives of Aditya Birla, spoke of the corporate role in sustaining, nurturing and growing crafts, making them relevant without tampering with authenticity.

Praveen Naik shared the success story of Sandur’s Kushala Kala Kendra that works with 500 artisans. CCI’s Sudha Ravi spoke of how CCI, with help of a corporate, stepped in to help the Aranmula Kannadi makers of Kerala post the devastating floods. K. Kanchana from Andhra Pradesh spoke of the Kondapalli Project.

Former director of National Institute of Design, Ashoke Chatterjee, summed up the discussions. He said global was out, local was in and the younger generation demanded socially responsible products.

222,2020/02/08,"Prime Minister lying about CAA, NPR: CPI(M)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who accused the opposition parties on Thursday in Parliament saying that they were speaking lies on CAA and NPR, is actually lying about the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Population Register, said G. Ramakrishnan, Politburo Member of Communist Party of India (Marxist), here on Friday.

“Yesterday (Thursday) when Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in the Lok Sabha on the CAA and NPR, he said the opposition parties are lying. It is the Prime Minister who spoke lies,” he told presspersons.

In 2003, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister and Advani was the Home Minister, the Citizenship Act was amended and based on it rules were framed for NPR.

It was implemented only in 2010 for various reasons. It is not that the Congress or the UPA government introduced it and are objecting to it now.

Further, there is no relationship between the NPR and implementation of welfare schemes for the citizens.

The NPR rules were framed based on CAA. But, the Prime Minister tried to create an impression that implementation of the schemes will be affected if the NPR is not updated. The CPI (M) and the opposition parties are urging the citizens not to answer the questions when NPR is updated as if they do not give clear answers even for a few questions, they may be put in detention camps, he said.

K. Balakrishnan, State Secretary of the party, said actor Rajinikanth speaks for CAA now. Recently the IT cases against him were withdrawn. He has become the voice of the BJP, Mr. Modi and Amit Shah. Mr. Rajinikanth only says what the Prime Minister and Amit Shah say on the CAA. He does not speak anything new.

223,2020/02/08,Maintenance of traffic signals in limbo,"Maintenance of tariff signals and power to light up 12 new signals hangs fire as the Coimbatore Corporation and the Tangedco seemed to be sparing over tariff structure. The impact of the difference between the two government departments is that road users are forced to guess the signal at several junctions to drive ahead.

The problem arose in March 2019 after the Corporation removed the advertisement boards following a Madras High Court verdict.

The removal of advertisements resulted in the advertiser stopping maintenance. After a few months of negotiations among the Corporation, Coimbatore City and Rural Police and other agencies, the District Road Safety Committee took up the issue to find a solution.

Finally, the Corporation took up the responsibility to maintain the traffic signals by agreeing to pay the power charges to the Tangedco.

But the problem did not stop there. The Tangedco that had been charging tariff under category VI (temporary supply, lavish illumination) at ₹ 12 a unit changed it to tariff V (commercial).

This has become a point of contention between the Corporation and the Tangedco, with the former arguing that the power distributor was wrong in categorising traffic signals under the commercial tariff category as there was no advertisement.

It urged the Tangedco to recategorise traffic signals under tariff II-A (public lighting). Further, the Corporation had also argued against paying deposit under the commercial tariff category.

Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said the civic body had taken up the issue with senior Tangedco officials in Chennai to arrive at a solution.

In this turf war between the two agencies, the 12 new traffic signals that NGO Uyir had installed in the city have become the victim.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon, who is working to resolve the issue, says that not just the traffic lights, but the cameras attached to the signals are not powered on. The result, the ₹ 3 crore that the NGO invested remains under utilised.

Mr. Jatavath said that with the Tangedco delaying a decision in this regard, the Corporation was thinking of taking it up with the State Government to resolve the issue.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the government was yet to take a decision on who should maintain traffic signals in the State – the police or local body. This was the situation across the State except in Chennai, where the Chennai city police maintained the signals. The government that recently concluded the Road Safety Week celebration should seriously look into the issue to put an end to it.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uu3knm/article30766160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB08TRAFFICSIGNALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/maintenance-of-traffic-signals-in-limbo/article30766161.ece
224,2020/02/08,30 persons with China travel history under observation in Coimbatore city,"Thirty persons with Chinese travel history in the city are under observation in the backdrop of Novel Coronavirus outbreak there, Coimbatore Corporation officials say.

Medical officers in urban primary health centres, whose service area covers the residence of the 30 persons, call on them at least once a day to check if they show symptoms of the virus.

The 30 persons included four foreign nationals. But, fortunately, none of the 30 has shown symptoms of fever.

And, none has any connection to Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

Nevertheless, the Corporation has asked them to remain at home for 28 days, twice the mandatory period just to be on the safer side. To ensure that the people remained indoors, the doctors have reached out to the 30 persons’ families, neighbours or friends to ensure that they do not step out. This is more a precautionary measure that the civic body has adopted, the sources reckon.

To the city’s residents the Corporation has reached out by creating awareness programme at public places – bus stands and railway junction. It has begun by cleaning objects or surfaces that people often touch in public places like handrails, the interior of elevators, doors, etc. to improve hygiene on its premises.

It has, similarly, asked the managements of cinemas, malls and places where public gather to improve the standard of cleanliness.

Likewise, it has reached out to the School Education Department and its officers in the education wing to ensure that students and also teachers clean hands as many times a day as possible.

The Corporation is keeping a close tab on movement of people and is in a state of preparedness to address any issues.

They add that in the district there are 74 persons, including the 30 in the city, with Chinese travel history and the Department of Public Health has kept them under observation.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/30-persons-with-china-travel-history-under-observation-in-coimbatore-city/article30766132.ece
225,2020/02/08,College students sensitised to novel coronavirus infection,"Even as the novel coronavirus is slowly turning into a pandemic, the Department of Public Health took steps to allay misconceptions about the virus by organising an orientation programme for college students in Krishnagiri on Friday.

The programme, in a bid to disseminate information on the basic precautions to be followed in the face of any communicable infection, underlined the basic rules of public health and sanitation that needed to be adhered to by the public to safeguard themselves from infection.

Symptoms

Given the availability of little information on the nature of coronavirus that had its origins in Wuhan province in China and is slowly spreading globally, the public health officials listed out the symptoms to be mindful of to seek medical help. Novel coronavirus causes cold, cough, fever, respiratory problems and fatigue and these are symptoms that the public should look out for to seek medical help, said the resource persons speaking at the orientation.

The virus spreads through fluids from sneezing or by coming into contact with such fluids.

The Department of Public Health has highlighted “handwashing” as a significant deterrent to the spread of virus. People are advised to follow basic etiquette of covering their mouth with handkerchief while sneezing, and washing hands with disinfecting soap to prevent infection.

Further, persons with symptoms of cold, cough, fever are advised to visit hospitals for medical help. Hospitals have been directed to maintain cleanliness with regular use of disinfectants to prevent any communicable infections. V.Govindan, Deputy Director of Health Services, Krishnagiri, B.C.

226,2020/02/08,Site inspection begins for buildingcheck dams across River Bhavani,"Officials of the Public Works Department (PWD-Planning) have started inspecting various spots in River Bhavani where five check dams are to be constructed at a cost of ₹ 18 crore.

The 217-km-long River Bhavani originates in The Nilgiris and enters Silent Valley National Park in Kerala and flows back towards the State and through Mettupalayam reaches Bhavani Sagar Reservoir. Water from the reservoir is released into River Bhavani that flows through Kodiveri Anicut and joins River Cauvery at Kooduthurai. During monsoon, surplus water from the reservoir remains unutilised and mixes with River Cauvery.

Hence, farmers were demanding construction of barrage or check dams to conserve water. Water from the river could serve the drinking water needs in town panchayats and panchayats in the district apart from irrigating agricultural land. The river flows for a distance of 91 km in the district.

The State Government proposed to construct check dams and a team from Tamil Nadu Water Resources Development Cell inspected eight spots in the river to conduct a feasibility study. It was decided to finalise five places for constructing check dams.

On Thursday, a PWD team inspected a spot near Jambai village and surveyed the river. Officials said that all the spots would be inspected for finalising the construction area.

But farmers wanted barrages instead of check dams, as more water could be stored. Subi. Thalapathy, president of Thadapalli – Arakankottai – Bhavani River Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam said that checks dams could store only meagre quantity of water and hence the government should go for barrages.

He wanted the government to hold discussions with farmers’ associations before finalising the project.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/s7th3y/article30766078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER08CHECKDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/site-inspection-begins-for-buildingcheck-dams-across-river-bhavani/article30766079.ece

Under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) of the Central Government for urban distribution system strengthening, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) is implementing the scheme in Erode, Karungalpalayam, Market, Surampatti, Sathy Road, Veerappanchatiram, Collectorate, Marapalam, Periyar Nagar and Fire Service areas to benefit 91,275 service connections at a cost of ₹ 58.96 crore.

Uninterrupted supply

Under the scheme, the existing overhead electric cable lines were removed and converted into underground cables so as to reduce transmission loss, reduce faults and provide uninterrupted power supply to the electricity consumers. High Tension lines were converted into underground cables for 69.11 km, overhead lines of 92.33 km were converted apart from conversion of 617.48 km of house service connections as underground cables. Work began in August 2018 and is nearing completion. All the street light electric poles in those areas were removed completely where the corporation would be installing tubular street light poles at a cost of ₹ 13.50 core.

After inaugurating road re-laying works at Vasathapuram in Tiruchengode, the Minister said that there are 5,512 Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited shops in the State with 2,000 bars. Increase in liquor price came into effect on Friday. Asked about the price hike when the State’s policy was total prohibition, the Minister said that former Chief Minister Jayalalitha had closed 500 Tasmac shops and Chief Minister Edappadi K.

“Price hike is to improve revenue and to create awareness among the people, after which Tasmac shops will be closed in a phased manner,” he said.

Mr. Thangamani said that there would be no power cuts in the State during summer as the electricity board can meet a demand of up to 17,500 MW.

About transmission power loss, he said it has been reduced from 14% to 10% and various steps were being taken to reduce it further.

229,2020/02/08,NZ vs IND ODI | Kohli plays down defeat,"The high-flying Indians have been brought down by the Kiwis in the ODIs, but an unperturbed Virat Kohli says this format is not much relevant this year, referring to the fast-approaching T20 World Cup and the engrossing fight for World Test championship.

After the high of the T20 whitewash, the Indians have conceded an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ODI series following a 22-run defeat in the second match here on Saturday.

Impressed

“These were two pretty good games, great for the fans. I am particularly impressed with how we finished the game. First half we let things slip. I think Saini and Jadeja showed great character, but, as I said, one-day cricket in this calendar year is not as relevant as T20Is and Tests,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

The India skipper said despite the defeat, India has taken some positives from the series.

“This was a game where we could have taken chances and capitalised. We didn’t know Saini can be as good with the bat. We want guys to figure out situations themselves. We could definitely consider changes, we have nothing to lose now.”

New Zealand skipper Tom Lotham hailed it as a “great victory”. “Last time the batters won the game, today the bowlers did the job. I think that total was okay, it was a funny wicket. We managed to take wickets upfront and the bowlers kept taking wickets. We’ve had some close games with India, delighted to get the win,” he said.

“Kyle on debut was fantastic. Delighted for him. It’ll be great to win 3-nil from here. Fingers crossed.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/h9gzbq/article30772196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09JADDU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nz-vs-ind-odi-kohli-plays-down-odi-defeat/article30772197.ece
230,2020/02/08,"NZ vs IND ODI | Surreal, says Jamieson","New Zealand’s debutant pacer Kyle Jamieson termed his maiden international game surreal after he won the Man-of-the-Match award here on Saturday.

The Black Caps took a 2-0 lead in the three-match series as Jamieson was involved in a vital partnership with Ross Taylor and then took two for 42.

Impact

“Pretty surreal. You kind of grow up dreaming of these moments. Get your first cap and hope to make an impact and to play some sort of role in helping us first to get to a total and then restrict a pretty good batting line-up is very pleasing. And to have a series win tops it all,” he said on Saturday.

Talking about his 76-run partnership off 51 balls with Taylor, Jamieson said, “Firstly, we were just trying to get to the 50 overs. We had plenty of time and that made it pretty simple.

“Then my role became about how do I get Ross on strike and what end do we attack and what total do we need to get to and we ended up getting a little bit more because we kind of extended a wee bit, which was good. Pretty simple from Ross!”

He then took a brace including Prithvi Shaw as his first wicket. Later he bowled Navdeep Saini, who was involved in the rescue act with Ravindra Jadeja late in the Indian innings.

“The debut wicket (was more special than the runs). I think hitting the six was a bit of a bonus. My role is to bowl and take wickets and restrict runs. To get that first one under the belt is quite special. But I think being able to perform that role, my core role, is special to me,” Jamieson said.

When asked if he is more comfortable batting or bowling, Jamieson said: “That’s a great question. On these small grounds, maybe bowling. I don’t know, I am not probably the guy to ask. I don’t bat enough to have a fair representation, but look I enjoy the challenges of both.

Changing dreams

“When I was growing up, I was a batter so I probably dreamt of scoring a hundred on debut so not quite that today. I guess as I have gotten older, it probably comes down to how can I contribute to the team and how can we win a game and win a series. In the present moment, doing that is the most special thing,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gohkxe/article30772183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09ROSS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nz-vs-ind-odi-surreal-says-jamieson/article30772184.ece
231,2020/02/08,Big Bash League | Sydney Sixers triumph,"Sydney Sixers was crowned Big Bash League champion for a second time on Saturday after Melbourne Stars fell short in a rain-affected chase.

Needing 117 to win a game reduced to 12 overs, Glenn Maxwell’s Stars could only manage 97 for six as they suffered a second final defeat in a row after imploding against Melbourne Renegades last year.

Second title

“It’s fantastic, it was an entertaining game of cricket,” said Sixers captain Moises Henriques after the 19-run win at the Sydney Cricket Ground secured their second title and first since the inaugural season in 2011-12.

It was remarkable the match went ahead with Sydney drenched by torrential rain for two straight days, which only let up as the final was due to start, with the game getting underway more than an hour late.

Unlike most other T20 events around the world, there is no reserve day for the final.

Nathan Lyon (2/19) and Steve O’Keefe (2/27) were the pick of the Sixers bowlers after they made 116 for five, spearheaded by impressive opener Josh Philippe’s 52.

In reply, Marcus Stoinis clubbed a 4 and a 6 off Lyon’s first three balls to signal the Stars’ intentions, but he pushed his luck too far and was caught near the boundary off the fourth delivery.

After Nic Maddinson followed in the next over, and the explosive Maxwell was lbw to O’Keefe for five, Stars were 18 for three and in big trouble.

Nathan Coulter-Nile (19 n.o.) and Larkin (38 n.o.) produced some late fireworks in a last-ditch bid, but it was too little too late.

Sent in, the Sixers made a slow start, losing Vince for two in the third over.

Philippe keeps his head

That brought Steve Smith to the crease and he hit a boundary from his second ball to get the scoreboard moving. A huge six soon followed before he was caught by Handscomb for 21 going for another one off Maxwell.

The wickets of Henriques and Daniel Hughes followed as Philippe kept his head at the other end, sharing in a 48-run stand with Jordan Silk. Philippe was out last ball going for another big hit after bringing up his fifth half-century of the competition, with Silk unbeaten on 27.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mprn1d/article30771934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BBL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/big-bash-league-sydney-sixers-triumph/article30771935.ece
232,2020/02/08,Ranji Trophy | League stage heading for an exciting finish,"Mumbai has won the Ranji Trophy 41 times. To win its 42nd title, it will have to wait till next year at least.

We can say that with certainty even with a round of matches in the preliminary league remaining this season. That was after Mumbai failed in its desperate bid to force a win against Saurashtra on Friday at Rajkot, though it was just three wickets away.

Only on February 15, when the matches in the last round conclude, would we know who will advance to the knock-out stages and who will be relegated. Mumbai’s conqueror Saurashtra and Gujarat have already done enough to book their places in the last eight, with a game in hand.

The top five teams, out of the 18, from the top tier, combining Groups A and B, will reach the quarterfinals. Going into the final round, Gujarat is leading the table with 29 points, followed by Saurashtra at 28.

All to play for

The race for the remaining three spots is wide open. Andhra, placed third at the moment with 27 points, looks best-placed to claim one of those berths. Even if it loses its away game to Gujarat it will still have a chances to make it.

Bengal (26), Karnataka (25) and Punjab (24) are better-placed than the others. Uttar Pradesh (20), Tamil Nadu (19), defending champion Vidarbha (18) and Delhi (18) will not have just have to win their matches but need favourable results from others.

Kerala, which had qualified for the knock-out stages for the last two seasons, is one team that could afford to follow the final round of matches with total disinterest. It is already relegated to Group C, having drawn its last match with Vidarbha at Nagpur, where inclement weather made even the completion of the first innings impossible.

One more team will join Kerala from Groups A and B. It could either be Hyderabad, which is lying last with six points, five below Madhya Pradesh.

From Group C, one team will be relegated to the Plate Division. It will be either Uttarakhand (two points) or Tripura (six).

Two teams from the group will make the quarterfinals. Jammu & Kashmir (39 points), Odisha (35), Services (33), Haryana (30) and Maharashtra (28) all can afford to hope.

From the Plate Group, one team will advance to the last eight. Goa (43 points), Pondicherry (41) and Chandigarh (36) are the leading contenders.

It would be interesting to follow the final round of 18 matches in the preliminary league of India’s premier domestic tournament, starting on February 12.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/e3iysh/article30771913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09GUJARAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-league-stage-heading-for-an-exciting-finish/article30771914.ece

Meg Lanning’s team has now won both editions after ensuring a winning lead in the 2017-2020 championship.

Captain Lanning received the trophy from ICC Women’s Cricket Manager Holly Colvin after the T20I series match between Australia and India in Melbourne.

“It’s pleasing to have won the ICC Women’s Championship for the second time and of course, to have secured our spot at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand next year. It’s going to be a tightly fought tournament and one we’re looking forward to,” said Lanning.

“The Championship has been a great addition, giving more context to the ODIs we play and proving more opportunities for us to play against the other seven teams involved.

“With a T20 World Cup not far off it’s been really important playing against the likes of Pakistan and Sri Lanka who we haven’t played against a lot in the past. We’ve been able to learn more about them and the way they go about things which helps us prepare for major tournaments.”

The ICC Women’s Championship provides host New Zealand and four other top teams direct passage to the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 with other teams still having a chance to qualify through the Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2020 to be held in Sri Lanka from July 3-19.

234,2020/02/08,Pakistan vs Bangladesh | Babar and Masood send Bangladesh on a leather hunt,"Sparkling hundreds from Babar Azam and Shan Masood put Pakistan in command against Bangladesh on the second day of the first Test here on Saturday.

Azam scored a career-best unbeaten 143 for his third successive hundred in as many Tests — fifth of a burgeoning career — while opener Shan Masood made 100 as it pulverised a hapless Bangladesh attack at the Rawalpindi stadium.

At close, Azam was still batting with Asad Shafiq on 60, piling agony on the visitors during their unbroken 137-run stand for the fourth wicket.

Pakistan leads by 109 runs with seven wickets remaining.

Azam steered spinner Taijul Islam to the short third-man for his 15th boundary to reach his three-figure mark off 134 balls.

Shafiq also batted with confidence, having so far hit eight boundaries in his 111-ball knock.

It could have been early exit for Azam had Ebadot Hossain not dropped him off Islam at long-off when he was on only two.

That lapse cost Bangladesh dearly as Azam added an invaluable 112 for the third wicket with Masood, who also scored his third Test century and second in successive Tests.

Masood — who was finally bowled by Islam — reached his century by hooking pacer Rubel Hossain to the fence.

Islam (one for 111) toiled hard as he bowled 27 overs on the trot since start. The only other successful bowler was paceman Abu Jayed (two for 66).

The scores: Bangladesh 233 in 82.5 overs vs Pakistan 342 for three in 87.5 overs (Shan Masood 100, Babar Azam 143 batting, Asad Shafiq 60 batting).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7eip02/article30771800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09PAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pakistan-vs-bangladesh-babar-and-masood-send-bangladesh-on-a-leather-hunt/article30771801.ece

While Australia women will take on England in a must-win encounter in the ongoing triangular series, Perry and her teammates will be on hand for the celebrity Bushfire match.

In the innings break, Perry will bowl an over to Tendulkar, reports cricket.com.au

Perry, who was named the Women’s Cricketer of the Year for 2019, threw out the challenge on social media via a video message.

“Hey Sachin, it’s awesome to have you out here in Australia supporting the Bushfire match,” she said.

“I know you’re coaching one of the teams but a few of us were sitting around last night chatting and we thought it would be absolutely amazing to see you potentially come out of retirement for one over in the innings break out here at Junction Oval. We’d love to have a bowl to you.”

Tendulkar responded quickly and accepted the challenge “Sounds great Ellyse,” said the 46-year-old. “I would love to go out there and bat an over (much against the advice of my doctor due to my shoulder injury).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7qv1z8/article30771780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09SACHIN-ELLYSE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-to-pick-up-the-bat-once-again-to-face-australias-ellyse/article30771781.ece

The kid got everything right in the video because of which it has gone viral, receiving considerable response from current and former players.

Former New Zealand player Scott Styris shared the video while former player and commentator Simon Doull showed the video to Bumrah and off-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal before the second ODI between India and New Zealand here.

237,2020/02/08,NZ vs IND ODI | Saini regrets untimely dismissal that cost India second ODI,"India pacer Navdeep Saini lamented his dismissal at a crucial juncture which resulted in team’s series-conceding defeat in the second One-day International, here on Saturday.

Saini’s 76-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Ravindra Jadeja kept India in pursuit of a 274-run target but the former’s dismissal crushed team’s hopes.

Saini had smacked Kyle Jamieson for a six but was bowled in the next ball. Skipper Virat Kohli was even seen asking Saini to stay clam after he hit the ball out of park.

“I will regret when I go back and see the video. If I hadn’t got out, maybe the result could have been different. Will regret that I took it so close and maybe could have gotten closer,” Saini said at the post match press conference.

“We felt the wicket was flat and if we could stay till the end, the match could go close. So we were trying to contribute as much as possible and take the match to the end. Jadeja had told me that if you get a boundary ball hit it. Otherwise take singles or doubles, try to keep patience and we can take the game to the end.”

Saini was seen batting long in the nets pre-match and it paid off as he scored 45 off 49 balls, including five fours and two sixes. The pacer said it is important for the lower order to contribute runs for the team’s cause.

“It is a good thing that the lower order is performing like this. If everyone performs, it is called a team effort. If batsmen cannot score, bowlers should. If bowlers are not taking wickets, fielders should help. It is a team, after all.

“I was thinking that I got to bat after a long time. As soon as I hit the boundary, I was in shock. Wow, the ball is coming really well off my bat, I thought. Among the support staff, Raghu (throw down specialist) helps me with batting and is always encouraging me to do well. Even in hotel, he keeps telling me that I bat well and should do better. He keeps motivating me and always talks about my batting,” he said.

Saini has been part of the Indian team’s set up since the World Cup. He was also part of that squad but as a back-up net bowler.

He said that settling down in the family environment has been easy, but there is a major step up from domestic to international cricket.

“There is lot to learn. I am learning as much as I am playing. Conditions are different than home. I am learning about my bowling, what lengths to bowl, how to plan, these things are important for me to learn and for my team. Difference is that margin of error is lower,” he said.

India had reduced New Zealand to 197-8 at one stage. But debutant Kyle Jamieson helped Ross Taylor to put 270 on the board. That stand caught India by surprise and cost them the game.

“You feel bad that you lose the series obviously, but we will learn from our mistakes. Winning or losing doesn’t matter much but our performances should get better,” Saini said.

238,2020/02/08,MCC gym demolition work begins; to pave way for closed stands at Chidambaram stadium,"Work has commenced on demolition of the gymnasium at the Madras Cricket Club (MCC), which will pave the way for re-opening the sealed ‘I’, ‘J’ and ‘K’ stands at the M A Chidambaram stadium in Chennai for the upcoming IPL.

The three stands were sealed after the 2011 World Cup owing to various issues, depriving the city the opportunity to host matches at various events, including the World T20 in 2016 and the IPL final in 2019.

An exception was made when the stands were opened for an India-Pakistan ODI back in 2012.

The work is expected to be completed in 4-5 days, MCC president R Ramesh told PTI on Saturday.

After the demolition is completed, the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) will seek permission of the Chennai Corporation and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for clearance for the three stands, he added.

He also said that the club will be building a new gymnasium, adding that arrangements for an alternate gym for members has already been made.

A decision to demolish the gym was taken during a general body meeting of MCC recently.

TNCA sources said work has begun for demolition of the gymnasium and once it is done, the Corporation and CMDA will be approached for reopening the stands.

The three stands (I, J and K) will be opened for the forthcoming IPL, the sources added.

Earlier, TNCA got custody of the iconic Chidambaram stadium as it entered into a new lease agreement with the Tamil Nadu government.

The three stands were closed as the city Corporation said there was “insufficient” setback space between the stands and the MCC.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6d3ibu/article30770371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHEPAUKSTADIUM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mcc-gym-demolition-work-begins-to-pave-way-for-closed-stands-at-chidambaram-stadium/article30770372.ece
239,2020/02/08,"One day cricket in this calendar year is not as relevant as T20s and Tests, says Kohli","The high-flying Indians have been brought down by the Kiwis in the ODIs but an unperturbed Virat Kohli says this format is not much relevant this year, referring to the fast-approaching T20 World Cup and the engrossing fight for World Test championship.

After the high of T20 series whitewash, the Indians lost the ODI series after conceding an unassailable 0-2 lead following a 22-run defeat in the second match in Auckland on February 8.

“These were two pretty good games, great for the fans. I am particularly impressed with how we finished the game. First half we let things slip away. I think Saini and Jadeja showed great character but as I said one-day cricket in this calendar year is not as relevant like T20Is and Tests,” Kohli said at the post match presentation.

The T20 World Cup will be held in Australia from October and the Indian team is not playing many ODIs this year.

After the ongoing series against New Zealand, India will compete against South Africa in a three-match ODI series, which will be its last in 2020.

The international teams are also fighting hard to earn points for the World Test Championship, which will be decided by June 2021.

The India skipper said despite defeat, they have got some positives too from the lost series and they can make changes to the playing XI for the third match.

“This was a game where we could have taken chances and capitalised. We didn’t know Saini can be as good with the bat. We want guys to figure out situations themselves. We could definitely consider changes, we have nothing to lose now.”

Man-of-the-match Kyle Jamieson, who scored crucial 25 runs while batting at number 11 and took two wickets, was overwhelmed by the win.

“Bit of a high at the moment. Still kind of sinking it. The game kind of ebbed and flowed. It was pretty simple: we were just trying to get it through 50 overs. Just trying and stick with Ross (Taylor),” he said.

“Relief was the feeling to get the first wicket out of the way and not give too many runs. International cricket is quite high intensity, but it was pretty cool.”

New Zealand opener wicket-keeper batsman Tom Lotham hailed it as a “great victory”.

“Last game the batters won the game, today the bowlers did the job. I think that total was okay, it was a funny wicket. We managed to take wickets upfront and the bowlers kept taking wickets. We’ve had some close games with India, delighted to get the win,” he said.

“Kyle on debut was fantastic. Delighted for him. It’ll be great to win 3-nil from here. Fingers crossed, and hopefully we keep learning.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dttotv/article30769927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATKOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-second-odi-in-auckland-virat-kohli-press-conference/article30769928.ece
240,2020/02/08,U-19 World Cup final: India overwhelming favourites as buoyant Bangladesh eye history,"Defending champions India are overwhelming favourites to win a record fifth U-19 World Cup title here on Sunday but a tough fight is expected from first-timers Bangladesh in an all-Asian final.

If the India squad for the 2018 edition had the likes of Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill, who have expectedly gone on to play for the senior team, the exploits of opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, spinner Ravi Bishnoi and pacer Kartik Tyagi in the current edition have made them overnight stars.

Irrespective of what happens in Sunday’s final, India have reinforced the fact that they are undisputed leaders at the under-19 level and the cricketing structure the BCCI has developed is working better than any other board in the world.

India, who walloped arch-rivals Pakistan by 10 wickets in the semifinal on Tuesday, will be playing their seventh final since 2000 when they lifted the trophy for the first time.

Having said that, success at the U-19 level doesn’t guarantee success at the highest level as not all players have the ability to go on and play for India. Some also lose their way like Unmukt Chand did after leading India to the title in 2012.

His career promised so much back then but now it has come to a stage where he is struggling to make the eleven in Uttarakhand’s Ranji Trophy team, having shifted base from Delhi last year.

Only the exceptionally talented like Shaw and Gill get to realise their dream as the competition is only getting tougher in the ever-improving Indian cricket.

India probably is the only side which fields a fresh squad in every U-19 World Cup edition and since there is no dearth of talent and a proper structure is in place, the talent keeps coming up.

“The fact that we allow a cricketer to play the U-19 World Cup only once is a big reason behind the team’s success. While most teams have cricketers who have played in the previous edition,” India U-19 fielding coach Abhay Sharma told PTI from Potchefstroom.

“It just goes to show that the system under the visionary leadership of Rahul Dravid (NCA head) is flourishing. Credit to BCCI as well that other teams want to follow our structure.”

Heading to the mega event, India colts played about 30-odd games in different part of the world. To get used to the South African conditions, they played a quadrangular series before they played their World Cup opener against Sri Lanka.

In the final, India run into Bangladesh, a team which too has reaped the benefits of meticulous planning since their quarterfinal loss at the 2018 edition.

Though the Priyam Garg-led Indian side got the better of them in the tri-series in England and Asia Cup last year, Bangladesh have always come up with a fight and fielding coach Sharma expects it would be no different on Sunday.

“They are a very good side. There is a lot of mutual respect. I can tell you that,” he said.

Considering it is their maiden final, it is a bigger game for Bangladesh. If they win, it will be a sweet revenge against the sub-continental giants, who have found a way to tame Bangladesh at the senior level in close finals including the 2018 Nidahas Trophy and 2016 World T20.

“We don’t want to take unwanted pressure. India is a very good side. We have to play our ‘A’ game and do well in all three departments. Our fans are very passionate about their cricket. I would want to tell them, keep supporting us,” said Bangladesh skipper Akbar Ali after semifinal win over New Zealand.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/m5qn0d/article30769280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-WC-U19-IND-PAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u-19-world-cup-final-india-overwhelming-favourites-as-buoyant-bangladesh-eye-history/article30769281.ece
241,2020/02/08,Former Pakistan batsman Nasir Jamshed jailed in UK over fixing,"Former Pakistan batsman Nasir Jamshed has been sentenced to 17 months in prison for his role in a fixing scandal, Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) has said.

The former Test opener was banned for 10 years by an anti-corruption tribunal in 2018 for his part in the spot-fixing scandal that engulfed the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in 2017.

Manchester Crown Court also announced jail terms for British nationals Yousef Anwar and Mohammed Ijaz after the trio admitted their roles in the conspiracy following a covert NCA investigation.

Jamshed, 30, played 68 international matches for Pakistan, the last being a 2015 World Cup one-day match against United Arab Emirates in Napier.

“Using an undercover officer, NCA investigators identified that the group were plotting to fix elements of the 2016 Bangladesh Premier League T20 tournament which Jamshed was due to play in,” NCA said in a statement on Friday.

Next year, Anwar was captured on CCTV purchasing 28 different coloured bat handle grips which would subsequently be used by the players in PSL as the signal to show the fix was going ahead, it added.

“These men abused their privileged access to professional, international cricket to corrupt games, eroding public confidence for their own financial gain,” NCA Senior Investigating Officer Ian McConnell said.

Pakistan Cricket Board slapped batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif with five-year bans last year, while paceman Mohammad Irfan and all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz received shorter suspensions for their roles in the scandal.

In 2011, Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were jailed in Britain for their role in a plot to bowl pre-arranged no-balls during a Lord's Test against England in 2010.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nltlan/article25287831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NASIRJAMSHED,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/former-pakistan-batsman-nasir-jamshed-jailed-in-uk-over-fixing/article30769279.ece
242,2020/02/08,NZ vs Ind 2nd ODI: New Zealand beats India by 22 runs; claims series,"New Zealand exorcised the ghost of a nightmarish T20 whitewash with a series-clinching 22-run victory against India in the second ODI on Saturday with the visitors paying price for some poor shot selection.

Revenge as they say is a dish best served cold and on a chilly Auckland night, New Zealand defended a total of 273 by restricting India to 251 in 48.3 overs taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

The victory also completed a hat-trick of ODI wins for the Black Caps starting from their World Cup semifinal win in Manchester last year.

The win was more creditable as regular skipper Kane Williamson along with top bowlers Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson were unavailable.

New Zealand’s 6 foot 8 inch debutant Kyle Jamieson (2/42 and 25 off 24 balls) got the ‘Player of the Match’ award for his all-round show.

Ravindra Jadeja (55 off 73 balls) along with Navdeep Saini (45 off 49 balls) raised visions of pulling off an improbable win with a 76-run partnership which ended in vain.

Tim Southee despite running temperature (2/41 in 10 overs) was brilliant with the new ball as his incutter got rid of Virat Kohli but it was poor shot selection from a set Shreyas Iyer (52) and Kedar Jadhav (9) in the middle overs did cost India dearly after the inexperienced pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw had a second successive poor day.

Rearguard action

Earlier, in-form Ross Taylor produced a rearguard act with an unbeaten half century to rescue New Zealand to a competitive 273 for eight in 50 overs.

Taylor scored 73 not out (74 balls, 6 fours, 2 sixes) — his 51st half-century — and put on 76 off 51 balls for the ninth wicket with Jamieson to lift the hosts from 197-8 to a competitive score.

Opener Martin Guptill smashed a run-a-ball 79 to give the Black Caps a good start but they lost seven wickets for 55 runs to look down the barrel at one stage.

Positive start

Put in to bat, New Zealand got off to a positive start as Guptill (79) and Henry Nicholls (41) put on 93 runs for the first wicket.

Guptill’s innings contained eight fours and three sixes, as their cautious start meant India were searching for wickets early on. The breakthrough came only in the 17th over as Yuzvendra Chahal trapped Nicholls LBW.

Chahal had earlier dropped Nicholls in the 15th over as India started nervously in the field again. But things came together after the first wicket with the visitors piling on the pressure.

Shardul Thakur (2-60) got rid of Tom Blundell (22) and then came the turning moment. Guptill set off for a suicidal run and was duly caught short of his crease by Thakur’s throw.

The Kiwis were suddenly down to 157 for 3 and India made good use of the opening. Ravindra Jadeja (1-35) got into the action, first dismissing Tom Latham (7) and then running out Jimmy Neesham (3).

Colin de Grandhomme (5) holed out off Thakur, with Chahal returning to gleefully accept a return catch from Mark Chapman (1).

New Zealand were in danger of not crossing 200 when Tim Southee (3) was caught off Chahal too. The leg spinner finished with 3-58.

However, Taylor had other ideas as he rebuilt the innings with clever batting. He found an able partner in Jamieson as they ran hard between the wickets to elevate the score before stepping on the gas later in the innings.

Taylor scored his half-century off 61 balls, while Jamieson threw his bat around to smack a four and two sixes to bring up their 50-partnership off 35 balls.

New Zealand scored 53 runs in the last five overs, crossing 250 in the 48th over.

Earlier, Virat Kohli won the toss for a first time on this tour and opted to bowl. India made two changes with Yuzvendra Chahal replacing Kuldeep Yadav, while Navdeep Saini came in for Mohammed Shami. The latter was rested keeping in mind the upcoming Test series.

The Black Caps have a 1-0 lead in the three-match series following their four-wicket win over India in the first ODI.

243,2020/02/08,"Women’s T20 tri-series | Mandhana, Verma fire against Australia to help India stay alive","Smriti Mandhana struck a sublime half-century as India finally produced a good batting display to record a seven-wicket win over Australia here on Saturday, keeping their hopes alive for a place in the final of the women’s T20 tri-series.

Australia posted 173 for 5 courtesy a 57-ball 93 from Ashleigh Gardner and Meg Lanning’s 22-ball 37 after India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur elected to field at the Junction Oval.

India then overhauled the target in 19.4 overs, largely due to opener Shafali Verma’s 49 off 28 balls and Mandhana’s 55 off 48 balls.

With the win, India moved to the second position in the points table, behind England. The winner of the final league match between Australia and England on Sunday will decide the finalists for the title clash on February 12.

After two failures, sixteen-year-old Shafali gave India a flying start with her innings containing eight fours and a six. Her senior opening partner Mandhana on the other hand anchored the case with a solid knock comprising seven fours.

After Shafali was caught by Nicola Carey off Ellyse Perry, Jemimah Rodrigues came to the crease and made a quickfire 19-ball 30, studded with five hits to the fence.

Her innings was cut short when she holed out to Alyssa Healy off Megan Schutt’s delivery in the 13th over.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 not out off 20 balls) then joined Mandhana and added 42 to take India close to the target. Mandhana was trapped LBW by Carey in the 19th over. Harmanpreet and Deepti Sharma (11 not out off 4 balls) then took the team to a resounding win.

Earlier, Gardner sent the ball across the fence 11 times and blasted three sixes in her 57-ball innings to emerge as the top-scorer for Australia.

For India, Deepti Sharma (2/27) was the pick of the bowlers, snapping two wickets, while Rajeshwari Gayakwad (1/34), Radha Yadav (1/34) and Harleen Deol (1/21) took one wicket each.

Australia’s Ellyse Perry (1/33), Megan Schutt (1/26) and Nicola Carey (1/27) accounted for a wicket each.

Brief Scores:

“We have decided to ensure 75% reservation to unskilled labourers of Haryana in industries. In addition, regular reservation has been provided in PG medical courses for SC students,” he said.

The CM said the government has also decided to increase the old age allowance and other social security pensions from ₹2,000 per month to ₹2,250 per month. Besides, liquor vends would be allowed only outside the village if women demand it. “So far 872 gram sabhas have passed resolutions against opening liquor vends in their areas,” he said.

The government also launched a scheme named ‘Mukhyamantri Parivar Samriddhi Yojana’ on Friday, under which annual financial assistance of ₹6,000 will be provided to those families whose annual income is up to ₹1.80 lakh and landholding less than 5 acres.

Reacting to the government announcements, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja said the Chief Minister presented only ‘jumlas’ (gimmicks) in his 100-day report card, adding that the biggest achievement of his government was the multiple scams that had taken place during this period.

“After watching the trailer of the first 100 days of this alliance government in the State, it has become clear how their performance is going to be in the next five years. No work has been done on the promises made to the public before election,” said Ms. Selja.

The Haryana Congress chief alleged that soon after the formation of the BJP-JJP government, there was a big scam in the purchase of paddy from farmers. The purchase of sugarcane crop was also delayed, she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-cm-presents-100-day-report-card/article30766830.ece
246,2020/02/08,Farmers stage protest over stray cattle menace,"Annoyed over persistent damage caused to their crops by stray cattle, several farmers having allegiance to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) on Friday staged a protest with stray cattle loaded on tractor trolleys as a part of their agitation in Punjab’s Faridkot.

The farmers were adamant on releasing stray cattle on the Deputy Commissioner’s office premises. They were, however, stopped on the outskirts of the town and were pacified by the local authorities after talks.

“We brought around 250 stray cattle to register our protest. Our aim was to send a message to the local administration about the grave problem of stray cattle. The local authorities have assured us of finding a solution soon,” said Gurvinder Singh, press secretary, BKU (Lakhowal).

Mr. Singh said that even after repeated requests made to the State government, the menace of stray cattle continued to haunt them. “Stray cattle destroy our standing crops and have become a serious threat to human lives in several cases, but we are helpless. Be it sugarcane, wheat, potato or seasonal vegetables, stray cattle damage the crop in almost every season. The State government should take some concrete step to solve the problem otherwise we will be forced to intensify our agitation,” he said.

Mr. Singh said that as a part of their Statewide agitation, farmers, under the banner of BKU (Lakhowal), will stage a similar “march with stray cattle'” towards the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Jalandhar on February 18. “We will hold such protests in all the districts. Yesterday, we had protested in Ludhiana,” he said.

As the problem of stray animals continues unabated, principal Opposition in the State, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal, have time and again accused the government of “completely failing” to protect the life and property of people here.

AAP senior leader Harpal Singh Cheema recently alleged that while the government collected “cow cess” and other taxes in the name of taking care of stray animals, nothing concrete was being done to tackle the menace. The Akali Dal had demanded development of stray cattle pounds, free power to gaushalas on the pattern of the previous SAD-BJP government and judicial use of “cow cess” to tackle the issue of cattle menace.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/farmers-stage-protest-over-stray-cattle-menace/article30766828.ece
247,2020/02/08,Kashmiri youth dies in Jaipur after brawl with co-worker,"A Kashmiri youth, who worked with a catering firm, died following a brawl with one of his co-workers at a marriage function here late on Thursday, the police said on Friday. The co-worker has been arrested, they said.

The 17-year-old, identified as Basit alias Ghulam Mohideen, who was hit on the head, succumbed to injuries at Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital.

Basit hailed from Kupwara district of Jammu & Kashmir. He was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition and was operated upon. He had sustained internal injuries in a fight with co-worker Aditya. The co-worker had allegedly thrashed him following a spat over sitting in a vehicle at Anantham Marriage Garden here.

Basit’s friends rushed him to the hospital when he vomited and complained of a headache. He was admitted for surgery, but his condition deteriorated and he died on the operation table.

Police Commissioner Anand Srivastava said here on Friday that the offence of murder had been added to the first information report registered in connection with the incident, on the complaint of the deceased’s friend Sufiyan. The main accused, Aditya, is a resident of Uttar Pradesh, said Mr. Srivastava.

Basit’s body was handed over to his family after the post-mortem. His relatives had arrived from Kupwara, the police said.

The police denied that it was a case of hate crime and said the fight between the young boys had ensued all of a sudden and had no connection with the victim’s religion or native place.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kashmiri-youth-dies-in-jaipur-after-brawl-with-co-worker/article30766826.ece
248,2020/02/08,FIR against 25 people in Moradabad,"A volatile situation was defused in time in Moradabad on Thursday when a team of the district information department faced the ire of protesters holding a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Deputy Director (Information) Jahanagir Alam along with three members of his team had gone to the Idgah ground in the Galshaheed area of Moradabad to distribute pro-CAA pamphlets among the protesters.

According to Amit Anand, Superintendent of Police (City), some protesters stopped the team from doing its work and Mukul Kumar, the driver, was confined and beaten up. They allegedly questioned him in a threatening tone and snatched his cell phone. “The team was rescued by the police and the phone recovered. Extra force had to be rushed to the protest site. An FIR has been registered on Friday against two named and around 25 unnamed persons under several sections including 143 (unlawful assembly), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323, 332 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC,” he told The Hindu.

Playing down the incident, Mr. Alam described it as trivial. “We were doing our job and the people were registering their protest,” he told reporters. Local sources said it indicated the growing mistrust between the administration and the protesters.

‘Mature protest’

“The protest is being run by common people. There is no single leader. It has been more than a week, and they are showing great maturity,” said Masood Hashmi, a leader of the Samajwadi Party’s youth wing.

He said the Prime Minister had a great opportunity to win the confidence of protesters while addressing Parliament on Thursday. “But he continued with his jumlebaazi [gimmickry],” he said. “The CAA is unconstitutional as it violates Article 14 and the government has only said that the NRC is not being implemented now. There is no guarantee that it will not happen in the future,” Mr. Hashmi added.

Mr. Anand said the police were only being “watchful” as the protesters are by and large peaceful.

Notices in Aligarh

In Aligarh, the administration has begun issuing notices against around 1,000 persons under 107/116 of the CrPC for inciting people to indulge in violence. Hundreds of women are sitting on a dharna at the Idgah ground in the city’s Shahjamal area against the CAA-NRC.

“It is a regular preventive procedure where we identify people who could create a law and order problem on the basis of inputs. They are asked to sign a bond by the magistrate for maintaining peace,” said Abhishek, Superintendent of Police (City).

Salman Imtiaz, former Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union president, who lives in the city area, said it was a way to create fear in the minds of protesters. “With big headlines in local newspapers, it is an attempt to scuttle the protest. If Section 144 remains in place all through the year, how would the citizens exercise their right for peaceful protest,” he asked.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/88un0y/article30766750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08MORADABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fir-against-25-people-in-moradabad/article30766751.ece
249,2020/02/08,SpiceJet’s ‘free’ ticket for polls under EC lens,"The Election Commission is probing SpiceJet’s offer of free tickets for those traveling to Delhi to cast their vote for Assembly polls on Saturday, said a government source.

“The EC wrote to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Thursday, seeking details on the issue,” an official of the Ministry said. The EC is yet to comment on the matter.

Selection process

Earlier this week, SpiceJet launched an offer promising “free tickets” ahead of Delhi polls. Passengers were asked to post their inspiration to vote on social media on the basis of which they would be shortlisted by an internal judges’ panel.

If shortlisted, the passengers could book their journey to Delhi for either February 7 or 8 and return travel for February 8 or 9. But many passengers vying for the offer were left puzzled after they didn’t hear from the airline until Friday.

“Would you be transparent and declare the names of those who got shortlisted in your #SpiceDemocracy campaign? Because otherwise it means you just took everyone for a ride and garnered publicity,” said Babita Gyamtso on Twitter on Friday morning.

She complained that a delay in declaring winners would force many to buy tickets at higher prices to vote in the elections.

The airline will only reimburse the base fare and the passengers will have to pay “applicable taxes, surcharges, levies and any other additional costs,” according to the airline.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/spicejets-free-ticket-for-polls-under-ec-lens/article30766594.ece
250,2020/02/08,Delhi 2020 | 'Religion trumped local issues in campaigns',"With Delhi going to polls on Saturday, many citizens said there was a lot of discussion on religion during campaigning by political parties in the past one month.

While some alleged that local issues got buried, others said religion should be a part of election discourse.

‘Why not discuss religion?’

A 56-year-old businessman from Mayapuri, Ajay Arora, said political parties talked about real issues, development and religion. “India is a democratic, secular country, which means we treat all religions equally. How can we be a secular country without discussing religion? There is nothing wrong in it,” he said.

Another 46-year-old voter, Swapna Nair from Jor Bagh, said political parties talked about developmental issues but not much towards the last few days of the campaigning. “Har baar religion pe aa jata he [every time they talk about religion]. Seeking votes on the basis of religion should end,” she said, adding that the BJP focused on nationalism and national security, which she felt was “important”.

She also said all the three main political parties talked more to the people this election as compared to previous years when they took out more roadshows.

Students from different colleges told The Hindu that there was a lot of talk around religion during the campaigning. Twenty-year-old Swarnim Singh Rokey, a student of DU, said: “I read the manifesto of BJP, AAP and Congress. AAP said they would continue their efforts to bring Jan Lokpal Bill, open 24-hour markets and doorstep delivery, which seemed reliable looking at the party’s work in the past five years.” Many students also appreciated points mentioned in the Congress manifesto like “gender sensitive pedagogy”.

Voting for the 70 Assembly constituencies in Delhi will take place from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday in 13,000 polling booths across the city, said Chief Electoral Officer.

253,2020/02/08,‘BJP campaign focussed on undecided voters’,"The flood of top BJP leaders campaigning in the Delhi Assembly elections was part of a strategy to get undecided voters to side with the party, a senior BJP leader said on Friday, while exuding confidence that the party would win 45 of 70 seats.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, apart from hundreds of MPs, have campaigned in the Capital over the past few weeks.

A senior party leader said that over 6,500 party events, including rallies, roadshows and meetings were held by the party over a 16 day-period.

The leader claimed that the strategy added “a daily average of 2% of undecided vote share” to the party’s kitty, in addition to allowing it an opportunity to try and dent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s image by illustrating his “lack of integrity and hypocrisy”.

“The party felt there was a need to ensure that messages regarding the significance of Centre-sponsored schemes, whose implementation was blocked in Delhi, needed to be aggressively conveyed to the voters; there were some gaps that needed to be filled in regard to the state unit's efforts to this end,” the leader added.

“Over the last 16 days, what with everyone from the Prime Minister and 240 BJP MPs from across the country to grass-roots leaders from the local unit having hit the ground, the party has successfully added 2% of the vote share of undecided, or fence-sitting, voters to its own on a daily basis – especially in JJ clusters and Unauthorised Colonies,” the leader claimed.

According to Tarun Chugh, the convener of the party's Assembly Election Committee and BJP national secretary, the BJP held 6577 meetings from December 22, 2019 to February 6, 2020 – a daily average of 411events including nukkad meetings, road shows and rallies.

While Mr. Modi addressed three big rallies, Mr. Shah held 52 such events, Mr. Nadda 41 events in addition to organizational meetings at 21 Assembly segments. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh participated in 12 such events, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari 10, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 12 public meetings while Union Minister Smriti Irani held 29.

“In the run up to the elections, the contest was supposed to be one-sided – but that is certainly not the case any more. This is a different election compared to 2015 when there was an AAP wave. During, and after, public events which were part of our mass contact campaign, the party's Parliamentarians conveyed to the average voter the hypocrisy of Mr. Kejriwal as a leader and his shifting stand on issues from local to national ones,” the leader said further.

“As far as the AAP Delhi government's power and water subsidies are concerned, the BJP has attempted to illustrate to the average voter that the seeming benefits of zero or substantially less power bills are nothing compared to owning one's home, having medical insurance upto Rs. 5 lakh; we are certain of securing 40 to 45 Assembly seats,” the leader added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-campaign-focussed-on-undecided-voters/article30766577.ece

“Visited the ancient Hanuman temple of CP and sought blessings of Lord Hanuman. Prayed for the progress of the country and Delhi. God said - “You are doing good work. Keep serving people like this. Leave the results on me. Everything will be good” [sic.],” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

He added: “How many conspiracies did they do in the last few days? All failed, right? Have faith in God. All holy powers are with you.”

Meanwhile, the party has set up 70 “war rooms” — one in each of the Assembly constituency — for election-management activities on Saturday. The party added that there will also be 67,815 booth-level mobilisers (five per booth) and 27,126 booth-level agents (two per booth).

The booth-level mobilisers will ensure that people vote for the party.

“The war rooms will do real-time assessment of voting trends and raising interventions to the Election Commission of India,” a party insider said. The war rooms will be connected to the team of the area candidate.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also visited temples in Chhatarpur and Kalkaji to offer prayers on Friday.

256,2020/02/08,"Man gets death sentence for killing judge’s wife, son","The Personal Security Officer (PSO) of a judge was sentenced to death by the local court here on Friday in connection with the murder of the latter’s wife and teenage son in 2018. He was also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of five and three years respectively, and ordered to pay a fine of ₹15,000, for destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code and unlawful use of a weapon under the Arms Act.

Mahipal had shot dead the mother-son duo in full public view at South City-II market on October 13, 2018. He was convicted of the crime on Thursday.

During arguments over the quantum of sentence in the court of Additional Sessions Judge Sudhir Parmar, Public Prosecutor Anurag Hooda, seeking death penalty for the convict, referred to the Kehar Singh and others vs. Delhi Administration case — pertaining to the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh security guards Satwant and Beant Singh.

Drawing parallels between the two cases, Mr. Hooda said: “Mahipal, being a security guard, was duty-bound to protect the judge and his family at the cost of his life. But all the norms and obligations were thrown to the wind.” Saying that it was the betrayal of the “worst order”, Mr. Hooda, who is also the Deputy District Attorney, added: “These are the most foul and senseless murders and the execution of the egregious crime do deserve the death sentence.”

He also relied upon the Bachchan vs. State of Punjab case wherein the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had established the doctrine of ‘Rarest of Rare’ crimes; and Macchi Singh vs. State of Punjab case wherein the apex court had laid down the criteria for assessing whether a crime fell into the category of “Rarest of Rare”.

“The present case qualifies to be in the ‘rarest of rare’ category on account of the manner and the magnitude of the crime and the position of the victim vis-a-vis the convict. It was a double murder and the convict had a relationship of trust with the victims,” said Mr. Hooda.

Defence lawyer Prem Shankar Sharma sought a lesser punishment for his client arguing that it was not pre-meditated murder and the deaths were caused due to “accidental fire”.

He said that the case, at best, attracted the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Mr. Sharma also argued that the convict had no criminal antecedents and an unblemished service record.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/db8fty/article30766538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8DEMAHIPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-gets-death-sentence-for-killing-judges-wife-son/article30766540.ece

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Haryana Chief Secretary to look into the matter and take appropriate action.

The directions came following a report filed by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Panchkula which said that a proposal to diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes was moved to the government on January 23.

The report also stated the penalty to be imposed for the violations.

Taking note of the report, the Bench said: “While the above action may have been now taken, the fact remains that law has been blatantly violated for which accountability needs to be fixed. Let such action be ensured by the Chief Secretary, Haryana and an action taken report furnished.”

Akbar told a Delhi court on Friday that scribe Priya Ramani’s accusations of sexual misconduct against him in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018 were “figment of her imagination” and caused him “great humiliation” and “irreparably damaged his reputation“.

Mr. Akbar made the allegations before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja through his lawyer during the final hearing of a private criminal defamation complaint filed by him against Ms. Ramani after his name cropped up on social media as the #MeToo campaign raged on in India.

Mr. Akbar resigned as Union Minister on October 17, 2018.

Ms. Ramani in 2018 accused Mr. Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist. She worked at the Asian Age from January to October in 1994.

Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Mr. Akbar, said that if there is any grievance, it had to be raised then and there before the appropriate authority.

“Allegations are a figment of her [Ramani’s] imagination. Things that I [Akbar] took 49-45 years to build, without any sense of responsibility, were trashed,” Ms. Luthra said.

“Can you expect a man to answer to something which you allege happened 20-25 years ago? Why now? What is the public good that you are claiming? If there is a grievance, it has to be raised then and there before the appropriate authority... I don’t want to jump onto a political bandwagon,” she added.

“My whole life has gone without any controversy... Can you mar anybody’s life without any impunity, without any evidence? We can’t be a social media country,” she said.

261,2020/02/08,Plea in HC against police request for temporary jail,"A plea was moved in the Delhi High Court on Friday challenging the police’s letter seeking permission from the government to turn Jangli Ram Pahalwan Stadium here into a “temporary jail” for anti-CAA protesters on the day of Assembly elections.

The petition was mentioned before a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar and it agreed to list the matter for hearing on February 10.

The plea by a social activist apprehended that his voting right as well as that of other protesters will be curbed in the wake of Delhi Police’s requisition given to the Principal Secretary (Home) for setting up a temporary jail at the stadium in Kanjhawala for accommodating those who may be detained enmass without any reasonable basis.

Petitioner Jafar Ahsan Karimi sought direction to the Principal Secretary (Home) to recall the letter or the approval order, if any, for the requisition given by the police on January 29 as it is arbitrary.

The petition, filed through advocates Rahul Yadav, Rashid N Azam and Mujeeb Ur Rehman, said setting up of a mass detention centre especially during the polls and on the voting day would adversely affect the conduct of free and fair elections.

The plea claimed that the peaceful protests are being carried out for over 50 days and there has been no violence from the side of protesters except a few incidents where people have tried to attack the protesters using firearms.

“It is alarming in a democracy that the protesters are agitating against a policy decision of framework of citizenship to be granted to foreigners under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 which is ex facie discriminatory and designed to facilitate certain religious communities while excluding others,” the petition said.

It said the “ire of protesters is mainly against the current government at the Centre which is largely a party also contesting the elections in Delhi”.

262,2020/02/08,CBI searches IAS officer’s premises in graft case,"The CBI on Friday searched the premises of IAS official Udit Prakash Rai, posted as a Special Commissioner in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) division, in connection with a graft case. Several GST officials have also come under its scanner.

The CBI on Thursday arrested Gopal Krishna Madhav, a Andaman and Nicobar Island Civil Service cadre official who worked in the GST division of the Delhi Trade and Taxes Department, and an alleged middleman, Dheeraj Gupta.

Mr. Madhav was also an Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s office.

Sisodia’s response

Mr. Sisodia confirmed through his Twitter handle that the GST Inspector was also posted as an OSD in his office.

He said he had got several corruption officials arrested in the last five years and added that the CBI should ensure stringent punishment to the officer.

A CBI official said, “Searches were carried out on the premises linked to Mr. Rai, a 2007 batch IAS official, and some other GST officials.”

The case was registered on the complaint of a transporter alleging that the GST officials had demanded ₹3.5 lakh to release his two trucks.

Subsequently, the middleman was arrested on Wednesday while allegedly receiving ₹2.26 lakh.

Accused spills the beans

During questioning, Mr. Gupta purportedly disclosed that he worked as a middleman for collecting bribes from transporters on behalf of some GST officials.

263,2020/02/08,Revanth files PIL petition over 31.35-acre land in Raidurg,"A public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking direction to the State government to take back 31.35 acres of land in prime area of Raidurg from a real estate company has been filed in Telangana High Court.

The plea filed by Congress Lok Sabha member A. Revanth Reddy, involving transfer of land from a Delhi-based real estate giant to a Hyderabad-based company, is likely to come up for hearing on or after Monday. The MP requested the court to order for prosecution of officials concerned responsible for permitting the transfer of land in violation of allotment conditions.

According to the petitioner, the 31.5 acres of land of survey No. 83 of Raidurg village of Serilingampally mandal was part of 424.13 acres of land allotted by the then government of undivided Andhra Pradesh State in 2006 to Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited. After formation of Telangana State, the land came under the control of Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited.

The land was offered for sale to prospective developers, subject to certain conditions, as part of the government’s information technology policy. The PIL plea stated that M/s DLF secured allotment of the land and subsequently the land was transferred to M/s DLF Rayadurg Developers Private Limited for ₹ 580 crore in 2013. The second company, according to the petitioner, approached the authorities for its renaming as M/s Aqua Space Developers Private Limited, which was permitted. This company approached the government for exchange of the allotted land for another piece of land. The MP stated in the petition that the exchange of land too was permitted by the government along with exemptions of stamp duty and registration fees.

The transfer of land from the first company to the second one, the exchange of land, exemption of stamp duty and registration fee made a dent on the State exchequer to the tune of over ₹ 2,000 crore, the MP alleged in his petition. He sought an order to the State government and the TSIIC to ensure the land was not used against the allotment conditions. He also requested the court to direct the government to maintain status quo and not to create any third party interests with regard to the said land.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/e29xuq/article30772430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-REVANTH-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revanth-files-pil-petition-over-3135-acre-land-in-raidurg/article30772431.ece
264,2020/02/08,"Indian economy in ICU, doctors are clueless: P. Chidambaram","Senior Congress leader and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has termed the Indian economy as the one waiting at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the doctors clueless about the diagnosis and treatment, thus impacting the jobs and sliding spending on the social sector.

But the 160-minute budget presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not make any effort to address these crucial issues. For the six successive quarters growth rate has declined and the seventh one too doesn’t show any hopes, he said while delivering a talk on the ‘Union Budget 2020-2021’, organised by AICC Research Department of Telangana. India is now ‘investment-starved and demand-constrained’ economy and the government is clueless.

The least they can do is to admit their failures and go to an economist like Dr. Manmohan Singh and seek his help. “Will they do?” Mr. Chidambaram asked. He said not a single indicator of the economy shows positive signs and all crucial sectors like Imports-Exports, Agriculture, Coal, Petroleum, Refinery and Automobile are seeing downslide. But the Finance Minister doesn’t want to accept it as it would mean accepting Demonetisation was a monumental blunder with people deprived of 86% cash in the market. “It destroyed industries and killed jobs.”

‘Pessimism all around’

There is no money with the government and people to spend. Those with cash are fearing to spend as there is pessimism all around on economy’s revival. The projection of spendings on all the sectors has shown decline.

He said spendings on agriculture will see a deficit of ₹30,000 crore, subsidies on social sector by nearly ₹80,000 crore and the rural areas consumption is down by 22%. PM Kisan programme, which is dearer to this government, has seen spendings of just ₹54,000 crore though ₹75,000 crore were promised.

“This government is cruel and incompetent to cut spendings on the poorest of the poor in the country,” he alleged. Only half of the much touted Ayushmaan Bharat Health Scheme’s ₹60,500 crore allocations have been spent. Engineers are being hired for ₹8,000 per month indicating how depressed the labour market is, he said.

Stating that ‘tax terrorism’ has damaged the economy as the government ‘criminalised the laws’ giving enormous powers to lowest level of officers, he said they are being misused. The suicide of Cafe Coffee Day owner V.G. Sidharth reflects this government’s attitude towards businessmen.

Later, he answered questions from the audience. TPCC president N.

265,2020/02/08,Downtrend in Civil Services vacancies may continue,"The thrust for lateral entry in the civil services by the present government reflects in the downtrend in vacancies announced by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and it may continue.

The declining numbers by the UPSC overall was revealed when Minister of State for Personnel, Jitendra Singh, in a written reply to the Upper House on Thursday stated that the number has declined in the last four years. Though he gave the numbers of all the recruitment exams conducted by UPSC, a similar trend is seen in the Civil Services exams conducted to select candidates for the top administrative posts like the IAS and IPS.

The Minister stated that the number of personnel recruited by the UPSC has declined in the last four years and reached its lowest of 2,352 in 2018-19. According to statistics, a total of 3,750 candidates were recommended by the UPSC in 2015-16; 3,020 in 2016-17; 3,083 in 2017-18 and 2,352 in 2018-19.

For the Civil Services too the numbers have come down since 2015 when 1,164 vacancies were announced. Similarly, in the year 2016 the numbers further declined to 1,029 and to 980 in 2017. It further reduced to 782 in the year 2018. However, it saw a minor spike at 896 in 2019.

“The trend is likely to continue as the motto of the government is ‘less government and more governance.’ The thrust for lateral entry and the de-linking of the Railway Services from the Civil Services examination, all indicate that the number of vacancies for Civil Services Examination would see a down trend in the future,” says V. Gopalakrishna, Director of Brain Tree.

Though the first Indian Railway Management Service examination is expected in 2021, yet the merger and restructuring of the services may have an effect on the number of vacancies for the 2020 examination.

266,2020/02/08,"For now, GHMC is only against CAA","Confusion prevailed over GHMC Council’s resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) during the general body meeting on Saturday, due to a volte-face on NRC later by GHMC authorities.

During the session post lunch, Deputy Mayor Baba Fasiuddin moved the resolution, through an impassioned plea to the council members.

Mr. Fasiuddin said both CAA and NRC threatened India’s democratic fabric and secular principles, and urged the council to pass the resolution. He was seconded by former mayor and sitting corporator Majid Hussain, who said people, including women and students, were coming out in protest against the unpopular move by the Centre. The resolution was hailed as the first ever in the country passed by a municipal corporation.

Mr.Majid Hussain wished that GHMC should become the first ever corporation and Bonthu Ram Mohan the first ever Mayor to have passed such a resolution against a Central government’s enactment. He thanked the TRS MPs for setting an example by opposing the CAA.

Corporators Jagadish Goud, S.Swarnalatha Reddy, and MLC M. S. Prabhakar spoke in support of the resolution, which was passed unanimously by the council, after a formal announcement by Mr. Ram Mohan, who mentioned both CAA and NRC during his address.

However, confusion prevailed over the resolution later, with GHMC officials as well as Mr. Ram Mohan quickly retracting from NRC about which a decision by the State government is still pending. Mr. Ram Mohan, through a telephonic conversation, confirmed that the resolution was only against the CAA.

Special Chief Secretary to the Health and Family Welfare department A Santhi Kumari wrote to the District Collectors, asking them to set up Coronavirus Control Room in every district and impart meticulous training to everyone expected to handle symptomatic cases, besides undertaking inspection of isolation wards.

In the communication, dated February 6, to the Collectors and Health department officials, Mrs Kumari stated that except the three nCoV positive cases in Kerala, no other State had reported a positive case to date.

Superintendents of teaching hospitals were directed to earmark 25 beds each to quarantine suspects of the virus. District hospitals already have isolation wards for swine flu patients, which would be inspected and kept ready for nCoV suspects.

Besides, officials were asked to ensure availability of 25 units of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and 100 N95 masks each at all teaching hospitals and district hospitals, which had isolation wards.

270,2020/02/08,"For, by and of women","The girls, close to a dozen in number, gently moved in a semi-circle to a tribal song playing in the background, without much emphasis on the facial expressions. The movement of their hands and feet in pace with an animated rhythm reflected their high energy levels.

They were from Araku Valley performing the tribal Dhimsa dance collectively, complementing each other and merging into a unifying force.

“This is precisely the message of our festival, to unite women into a force to reckon with,” says Jyotsna Gullapalli, general secretary, Tharuni Tharangaalu, a women’s organisation and organiser of a two-day Mahila Fest 2020, at Siddhartha College of Arts and Sciences.

The event saw scores of girls and women from Vijayawada and Guntur cities participating in a series of activities ranging from seminars, open forums, competitions and cultural programmes.

Girls and women filled the main auditorium and showcased their talent in folk song and dance, patriotic songs, short plays, skits, mono action, meme, debates and martial arts among other activities.

The rear side of the auditorium transformed into an entertainment zone with girls of different colleges presenting various dance forms and in the adjacent hall sat a mix of young and old women reflecting their views on key contemporary issues. Topics like “Importance of Mother Tongue” for essay writing, a story-writing on “Selection of Life Partner”, poetry on “Misuse of Smart Phones” and a painting contest on “A Day in a Woman’s Life” gave them ample scope to speak their minds out. There were kolatam, vegetable-carving and a Best from Waste contests too.

“Don’t worry about others’ opinions. Allow yourself to make mistakes, process your fears and trust yourself,” Raavi Sarada, president of the organisation, goaded the participants.

Most married competitors in the song and dance sequences were rookie, a few admitting that this was their first stage performance. “In our society, girls often experience failure and rejection with greater intensity and ruminate about it for longer time, which further strengthens a feeling of shame and incompetence in them. The burden of demands, familial and societal, limits their full potential,” said P. Satyavathi, a writer and a member of the organisation, who oversaw the essay writing event in a separate hall.

The Mahila Fest, into its third year, has grown in size. “We had to spill out of the auditorium, till this end of the ground as people kept coming to register names,” said an upbeat Jyotsna, pointing to the shamiyana in the ground.

Tharuni Tharangalu, in association with members of Women Protection Cells in colleges, conducts awareness programmes for girls on topics like menstrual hygiene, importance of self protection and giving back to the society. “We tell them not to confine their celebrations to a Mother’s Day or a Women’s Day. We want them to celebrate their innate strengths every day,” said Jyotsna.",events,https://www.thehindu.com/events/tiry0o/article30766515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ08TARUNI,https://www.thehindu.com/events/for-by-and-of-women/article30766496.ece

A veterinary department official said that the disease, caused by capripox virus, did not result in high mortality rate but morbidity among affected animals was a serious threat to dairying.

Lumpy skin disease results in severe pain for animals and eruptions on the skin. The disease does not spread from animals to humans but spread quickly from animal to animal via carriers.

The symptoms of the disease were visible about a week ago but it has been confirmed only this week. The district authorities have not yet reported the number of confirmed cases. But cases cases had been confirmed in Rayamangalam and Maradi panchayats, said John Theruvath, chairman of Ernakulam Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union, which has issued instructions to dairy farmers to take steps to prevent the spread of the disease. He said that preventive measures like better hygienic handling of animals had been suggested.

Sources said that the disease was being reported in Kerala for the first time and that the Uttarkashi strain of goatpox was being deployed for vaccination.

Mr. John said that the viral disease had so far not posed any threat to milk production. However, he said that farmers had been advised to take care and to resort to control measures.

There are around 42,000 dairy farmers under about a thousand primary milk societies affiliated to the regional milk union in Ernakulam spread over Idukki, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Thrissur.

Daily procurement is to the tune of three lakh litres with a deficit of about 70,000. The deficit is being met through imports from neighbouring States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. However, supplies from these States were drying up with a hike in the price of milk there, Mr. John added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/efforts-on-to-combat-lumpy-skin-disease-in-cattle/article30771042.ece

275,2020/02/08,Police theory getting unravelled in financier’s death,"The police theory that private financier Rajkumar had died of pneumonia and not due to custodial torture seems to be fast unravelling as the deposition of four doctors before the K. Narayana Kurup Judicial Commission inquiring into the incident continued here for the second day running on Thursday.

A day after their strong indictment by Mr. Kurup for having undermined the dignity and nobility of their profession and toeing the line of the police, leading to miscarriage of justice, the doctors from Nedumkandam taluk headquarters hospital, Kottayam Medical College Hospital, and Peermedu taluk hospital continued their disposition before the commission.

The doctor from the Peermedu taluk hospital said the victim was immobile when he was brought for examination at the casualty. He could not be lifted out of the ambulance stretcher despite efforts by five persons as his body had gained weight owing to which he had to be examined inside the ambulance itself.

Mr. Kurup observed that the bloated body owing to potential accumulation of fluid was yet another proof that the victim was by then suffering from kidney failure.

Significantly, the doctor who examined the victim a day before his death vouched that he had no signs of pneumonia at that time. The victim died on June 21 last year.

Mr. Kurup reserved the harshest criticism for the doctor from the urology department of the Kottayam Medical College. Asked why the victim was not admitted despite the presence of blood in his urine, the doctor said almost all urology patients showed that symptom.

This, however, did not go down well with the commission head who said the doctor should not have made such a generic assessment but examined the patient thoroughly and adopted a holistic approach. Though the doctor had prescribed ultrasound scan, the outcome was inconclusive because of ‘poor acoustics’ owing to obesity. Mr. Kurup observed that what passed of as obesity could be a case of body getting bloated owing to multiple organ failure.

The commission had on Wednesday come down heavily on the doctors for not properly examining the victim and simply obliging to the demands of the police. Had any of them bothered to examine the prisoner, it would have revealed the complications he suffered owing to the multiple blunt injuries and other injuries consistent with custodial torture as proved by a second autopsy conducted by a three-member team of forensic experts on the direction of the commission, he observed.

The first autopsy had attributed the death to pneumonia and was silent on the multiple blunt injuries probably caused by custodial torture.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-theory-getting-unravelled-in-financiers-death/article30766906.ece

Association president M. Khalid and general secretary M. Nizarudheen said the emphasis on boosting agriculture-based industries was a welcome step.

KSSIA also suggested that local self-government bodies provide better impetus to entrepreneurship, which will help more young people emerge as entrepreneurs and change the face of rural areas.

Industrialists welcomed the budget granting more time for settling VAT dues. The extension of time for VAT amnesty beneficiaries and for revision of VAT returns under the amnesty scheme till December 31, 2020 is a welcome step, they said.

Industrialists congratulated the Finance Minister for accepting the suggestion that the State implement a scheme on the lines of the Union Government’s ‘sub ka viswas’ initiative. It was on those lines that the budget made a provision for those in dispute over VAT arrears to pay only 50% of their dues.

Nadukkara Agro Processing Company chairman E.K. Shivan said the management hoped that the company would be in a position to buy enough packaging materials for the Jive brand of drinks being produced at the Vazhakkulam unit. Lack of working had prevented purchase of the materials for packing the fruit drinks and the plant has been lying idle for the last one month, he added.

He added that with the ban on plastic coming into effect in January, there had been a huge demand for paper packages, and that the Nadukkara plant had not been able to procure packaging materials.

Meanwhile, the budget has designated the Vazhakkulam facility along with the agro park in Thirssur for establishment of facilities for making wine out of fruits. The emphasis laid by the budget on processing of excess fruits provides a lifeline to the Vazhakkulam plant which has not been able to operate profitably over the last few years.

A senior employee said the 97 employees at the unit had not been paid salary for the last more than 18 months. Production is at a standstill now even as the management has proposed workforce reduction to cut cost and to turn the unit around.

The Nadukkara unit is set to have its own plastic bottle-making unit thanks to ₹4 crore sourced from the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana funds.

The plant is being set up and should be operational within a month. It will have more than enough capacity to produce bottles for the pineapple processing unit. The company management hopes to carry out work for others to enhance profitability.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/production-may-resume-at-nadukkara-plant-in-march/article30766887.ece
279,2020/02/08,Governor calls for efforts to attract FDI to seafood sector,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has called for efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into the marine food sector to increase employment opportunities and boost the country’s exports. He was inaugurating the 22nd India International Seafood Show here on Friday.

Mr. Khan said he was confident that India would be able to increase its share in global seafood trade from the present 4.1% to 6.7% by 2030 by increasing production, value-addition, and diversification.

The show is the Indian seafood industry’s showpiece event and has for its theme ‘Blue evolution: Beyond production to value addition’. The three-day event is being organised jointly by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) and the Seafood Export Association of India (SEAI).

The Governor pointed out that 40% of the global population lived within 200 km from sea coasts and 12 of the 15 mega cities were on the coasts. In India alone, around 40.5 million people were involved in the fisheries sector, which also contributed 1% to the gross domestic product, he said.

The seafood show is organised in Kochi after a gap of 12 years. Over 1,500 delegates, 50 of them from 12 countries, are attending the event to deliberate on policies and actionable road maps to achieve the country’s marine products export target of $10 billion by 2022.

280,2020/02/08,"Seafood show unveils a range of products, technologies","The technology expo held as part of the three-day India International Seafood Show which began here on Friday, is worth a visit for the latest technological interventions in the global aquaculture sector with focus on India.

Seafood India, an initiative of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), is a one-stop shop for export-quality processed seafood products from across the country. The facility, which sells ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat value-added products, speaks of products developed by prominent fisheries research institutions such as CMFRI and CIFT, besides selling and displaying value-added marine products of exporters, said a press release here.

Just as nutritious feed is vital to the growth of aquatic animals, value-addition is equally important, said MPEDA Chairman K.S. Srinivas. “We are into stricter quality control alongside enhanced production and diversification,” he added.

According to Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI), value-addition merits higher emphasis for the country’s seafood products to access more markets abroad. “Clearly, we are poised for such a change,” said Jagdish Fofandi, president of Kochi-based SEAI.

The seafood exhibition is spread over 7,000 square metres and showcases a wide range of products based on automated and IT-aided pre-processing, processing, and storage technologies for value-addition. Besides, they provide an opening for service providers such as logistics and certifying/testing segments.

With Vannamei shrimps turning out to be the stars of seafood industry in India, Vannamei culture is of special importance, and the seafood show emphasises the point. Vannamei shrimp formed the bulk of the 6.10 lakh tonnes of frozen shrimp exported from India in the last financial year out of a total of 13.92 lakh tonnes of seafood exports.

281,2020/02/08,A game changer for start-ups,"The boost received by start-ups in the budget was the toast of Information Technology industry players though there was the odd voice of caution against giving monetary incentives to start-ups without ‘due diligence’.

The budget proposals for helping start-ups tide over capital paucity attracted near universal appreciation from all quarters.

“The proposal to facilitate working capital loan of up to ₹10 crore without collateral security is a key decision meeting one of the long-standing demands of entrepreneurs. It could be very useful to start-ups, especially in the hardware sector, as several of them have been complaining about commercial institutions not financing working capital without collateral security. It is a model initiative, which no other State has done so far,” said Saji Gopinath, CEO, Kerala Startup Mission.

He also found the assistance of up to ₹1 crore to start-ups at the time of expansion of new product prototypes very encouraging. Prasad Balakrishnan Nair, CEO of Maker Village, said the collateral security-free capital loan could prove to be the biggest game changer for hardware start-ups with the potential to turn Kerala into a national innovation hub for hardware development.

“Compared to software start-ups, which manage to generate some revenue from the very beginning, hardware start-ups involve longer product development cycle and investments and are more complex with no revenue generation till the products are developed. The new initiative could be a big breakthrough for the hardware start-up ecosystem,” he added.

Mr. Nair said nearly 10 hardware start-ups from outside the State had already been chosen under the Social innovation Programme for Products: Affordable & Relevant to Societal Health (SPARSH) of the Department of Biotechnology and the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) under the Ministry of Defence. The new scheme will further make Kerala a sought-after destination for hardware start-ups.

However, Joseph C. Mathew, a successful entrepreneur and IT adviser to former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, said while the allocation of government projects to start-ups was welcome, extending monetary assistance without verifying the credentials of start-ups betrayed a lack of due diligence.

“The tendency to register a start-up only to mop up monetary incentives and then winding it up soon thereafter seems to be widespread. Rather, the government should provide them incubation facilities, infrastructure, and handholding. From the very outset when start-up culture started in the State, incentives to entrepreneurs were in kind rather than in cash,” said Mr. Mathew, who felt that financial incentives should be distributed sparingly taking into account the longevity and job creation by start-ups.

On the absence of significant budgetary allocations for IT parks, P.M. Sasi, CEO, Kerala IT Parks, said the government was of the view that IT parks had stabilised and should be eyeing self-sustained growth. The budget merely said the total area of Technopark, Infopark, and Cyberpark would be increased to 245 lakh sft. in 2021.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-game-changer-for-start-ups/article30766880.ece

When a report on the incident came up for hearing, Justice Sathish Ninan directed the Ernakulam General Hospital superintendent to depute a general physician to examine the children and their parents and provide treatment if needed.

The court also directed the District Collector, who is also the chairman of the local level committee under the National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, to inform it of the decision taken at the meeting of the committee scheduled for February 10.

The issue was brought to the notice of the court by V. Ramkumar Nambiar, amicus curiae, appointed in mental health cases. In his report, Mr. Nambiar said the foundation had abruptly closed the hospital and withdrawn all facilities available to the 16 children, leaving them and their parents in the lurch.

The court also served notice to Ajesh Thomas, CEO of Life CAre Foundation, which runs the hospital.

284,2020/02/08,‘Major allocations in previous budget not utilised’,"Large sums allotted in the previous budget, particularly for women and child development and disaster management, have remained unutilised, the K.M. Mani Centre for Budget Research has said in a statement.

Of the ₹450.4 crore allotted for women and child development last year, only 39.40% amounting to ₹177.59 crore was spent. This includes the amount set aside under gender budgeting, the statement added.

Similarly, of the ₹7.5 crore allotted for disaster management, only ₹3.06 crore was utilised, leaving 59.25% of the funds unutilised. “Last minute spending post-budget and before March 31 should be avoided and in future, all finance ministers should try to spend funds allotted evenly throughout the year,” the statement observed.

It acknowledged that the budget was a “mark of respect for K.M. Mani” with ₹5 crore being allotted for the construction of K.M. Mani Smarakam and the continuation of the Karunya Benevolent Fund scheme that the leader had introduced.

While welcoming the hike in welfare pensions, the research centre also called for the need to rework schemes for farmers considering a production loss of minus 5%, setting up e-toilets and a focus on dumping and processing of waste.

The centre also pointed out that the new finance commission had calculated a lower share for Kerala — as much as ₹7,800 crore or 0.6% less than what the previous commission had given the State as grant-in-aid, loans, and tax. “This shortage is going to affect the development of local bodies,” it observed.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/major-allocations-in-previous-budget-not-utilised/article30766860.ece
285,2020/02/08,Start-ups urged to take IPO route,"Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan on Friday made a strong case for start-ups to think of Initial Public Offering (IPO) in order to tackle the fund crunch situation and provide longevity to their fledgling enterprises.

“Start-ups are hesitant to do IPO, which is not difficult. My biggest issue with the start-up ecosystem today is that they are not doing an IPO. Let the Indian public own these companies. They get the wealth being created,” he said. Mr. Gopalakrishnan was inaugurating the fifth edition of the two-day ‘Seeding Kerala’ organised by the Kerala Startup Mission.

“India has USD two trillion of wealth in private hands. Less than one per cent is invested in start-up ecosystem. We need High Networth Individuals’ [HNIs] money going into start-ups,” he said.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan advised start-ups to take minimum funds from angel, friends, and families. They have to create minimum viable product, and establish unit economics and profitable model, he underlined.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/start-ups-urged-to-take-ipo-route/article30766853.ece
286,2020/02/08,How to woo a theatre audience,"I’d like to think I know a little something about the struggles of cultivating an audience for theatre. Whether it is for a certain kind of content, which we have been doing for the past 20 years, or for a new venue on its journey from anonymity to becoming a cultural hub. A few years ago, I ventured into the world of curation, to try to develop a performance space, and while I was moderately successful, it made me realise how difficult it is to develop an audience and then maintain it.

Reaching out to a potential audience, diversifying the current audience mix, converting people who are inclined to attend, but don’t, into attendees, getting current audience members to attend more often; these are difficult but important challenges. In the last month, we have performed at two very distinct outstation venues. One was celebrating its ninth anniversary, but has generally struggled to get a steady flow of viewers. Despite being a lovely venue, one can attribute this to geography and location, or perhaps the lack of aggressive outreach. The other venue was brand new, well located and backed by decent marketing. However, it is in a city whose people aren’t used to regular theatre. But we discovered that they were fascinated with stand-up comedy, so we baited them with that. Once they showed up and learned of the existence of a fun and attractive venue, with the added advantage of a great restaurant attached, perhaps they will show up again. One can hope.

Millennial code

Something that does seem to be working, though, is cracking the millennial code. Creating and retaining younger audiences is critical for the future of the art form. Q Theatre Productions saw this back in 1999 when it came up with Thespo, the country’s first large-scale youth theatre festival. Participants had to be under 25, and hence, so was a lot of the audience. Theatres have taken this one step further with popular seasons for children — like Summertime at Prithvi, Summer Fiesta at NCPA and AHA at Ranga Shankara.

I remember the demographics of our audience began to change quite interestingly when we started working with younger actors and writers. Experimental venues have flourished with fresher content and again, the advent of stand-up comedy. Another thing that seems to work well, and this is supported by research here and abroad, is food and beverages. Younger audiences want to socialise before and after a show, so an attached café or bar really helps. It could seem sacrilegious to be moving away from “content is king” to creating “a wholesome experience”, but it really isn’t, primarily because it works.

Building trust

Constant engagement with audiences is critical. Regularity really helped us create a loyal audience at a co-operative venue in Delhi. But the establishment and the performing group need to be on the same page, which is rare, and they both need to be unafraid to take a risk. There comes a point where we as creators or curators need to step off our high horses and ask, “What does the audience want?” The audience should not be a problem that needs to be solved. The key is building a relationship. Yes, it is a relationship that is often fraught with difficulties, suspicion and a lack of trust. But trust has to be gained. I read an article about how British playwright Howard Barker didn’t care if the audience listened or not, or even if they understood. If they didn’t, it wasn’t for them. On the other hand, David Mamet has reportedly said that the audience is the only judge that matters. “If the audience members didn’t laugh, it wasn’t funny. If they didn’t gasp, it wasn’t surprising. If they did not sit forward in their seats it is not suspenseful.”

Maybe we can take Mamet’s idea further. If, despite all the marketing, social and otherwise, audiences don’t turn up, could it be that they are simply not interested in what we are doing? Or merely that there is something more interesting on Amazon Prime? Nobody has the right to an audience; they have to be wooed, looked after and cherished. So perhaps we can wine and dine them. And perhaps we can loosen up and make whatever point we want to in an entertaining manner. And all this can be done without compromising on the quality of content.

To cope, he writes and directs films and web series and occasionally acts, albeit reluctantly.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/vyif2x/article30760272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09SMWINEjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/how-to-woo-a-theatre-audience/article30760273.ece
287,2020/02/08,Lessons in life,"Y.V. Krishna is the Principal of Abhyasa Vidyalayam that imparts experiential education. “A school should liberate the minds of the children from the stress of competition. We do not award marks or rank the children either as we do not want to separate them on basis of their scores,” says the man whose paper on ‘Pedagogy of Primary Mathematics' was one of the three to get selected at a symposium organised by the Council for Creative Education, Hyderabad, in association with the Government of Finland and earned him a study visit to that country in October last year.

The school is located on a hilly terrain in Gunadala and it is not uncommon to see primary students sitting on benches under trees making flowers with paper.

Teachers here don’t use textbooks for teaching, says Vamsi Konda an alumni. “Geometry was all about making shapes of hexagon and polygon with colour papers and calculating the area,” he recalls. He remembers how they organised a Rythu Bazar where the students had to take on the role of the shopkeepers and buyers. “We learned from real-life examples. We were given bills and posters with discount offers in the exams,” smiles Vamsi, who is now studying Interior Architecture Design at the Indian Institute of Art and Design in New Delhi.

Principal Krishna points to his table and says it was designed by the high school students. He reiterates how crafts, painting, tinkering, puppetry, pottery, weaving, carpentry, cooking, etc., are a part of the curriculum for children from LKG till std. 5. “ These activities build confidence in the children and empowers them to make decisions, ” he says.

Ex students Virajita and Adil Akram Shaik also followed their passion instilled in them while they were at this school. Adil is studying Development Studies from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Hyderabad, while Virajita has embarked on a journey to know about various dance forms of the country. “In the last days of my school, I spent more time learning dance than studying in the classroom . This wouldn’t be allowed in any other school. Students here are encouraged to pursue their dreams and nurture their talent,” says Virajita who is currently learning Bharatnatyam in Kerala.

While convincing parents about this kind of ‘constructive education’ was a mammoth task, the initial opposition and high dropout rate diminished once they realised the benefits of a creative education, says Krishna. The school’s current strength is 240. Krishna took over the reins of the school from its founder K. Jyotsna in 2013 along with her husband C. Raghavachari, a noted journalist who died recently. They set up a trust Deepa Charitable Trust that runs the school.

Wholesome education

Wholesome education is the focus of Vikasa Vidya Vanam (VVV).

Students are not given homework, nor do they lug heavy bags. There is no uniform or textbooks for them and education is not just about passing exams. “Confining children to books stunts their growth and imagination,” says S. R. Parimi, secretary of Vikasa Educational Trust that runs the primary school at Porankhi. The high school, Living Vikasa Vidya Vanam (LVVV) is at Adivi Nekkalam.

“A child must engage with the community, explore Nature and learn to be inquisitive,” says the educationalist, who started the Trust in 1982, along with six friends who were alarmed at “abuses endured by children because of unhealthy educational practices.”

Children here also are encouraged to learn cooking, farming, art, craft, dance, drama, pottery, etc. In the primary section, teachers follow the framework of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing (LSRW), and introduce children to a language in that order.

Kindergarten children have stories read out to them. “Learning a language comes naturally to children, like walking or running. We have seen what happens when this is not followed,” says Parimi, referring to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) that shows how a class VIII student cannot read a class III English textbook.

The VVV, built in 1983, earlier had classes till 10th grade. But Parimi felt the need to take children away from the growing influence of gadgets and other distractions and built a residential school in 2012 at Adavi Nekkalam, 30 km from Vijayawada amidst nature.

The school campus, spread across 24 acres, includes living quarters for teachers and a hostel for students. “This also enables student-teacher interaction. As part of community work, they clean the surroundings, classrooms and the toilets,” explains Parimi. The strength of the high school is all of 78 . “The low number is our strength. We may be a drop in the ocean as we can’t transform the entire society. But we want to show people that this method of education works,” he says emphatically.",schools,https://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/tgjt14/article30766441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vjmp08-children4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/lessons-in-life/article30766443.ece
288,2020/02/08,Arsenic-resistant rice cultivated in West Bengal,"Researchers have developed and commercialised a rice variety that is resistant to arsenic. Several studies have shown that arsenic from groundwater and the soil can enter the food chain through paddy.

West Bengal is among the States with the highest concentration of arsenic in groundwater, with as many as 83 blocks across seven districts having higher arsenic levels than permissible limits.

The new rice variety, Muktoshri — also called IET 21845 —, was developed jointly by the Rice Research Station at Chinsurah coming under West Bengal’s Agriculture Department and the National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, over several years. A gazette notification for the commercial use of Muktoshri was made by West Bengal last year.

Bijan Adhikari, one of the scientists who worked on developing the variety, said that the State government’s decision to make the seeds available for cultivation came after successful trials in both the wet season and dry season in different blocks of the State. The trials were done in areas with arsenic contamination in groundwater, particularly in Nadia, North 24 Parganas, Bardhaman and Murshidabad.

“During our multilocational trials, we found that this variety uptakes very less amount of arsenic from soil and water in comparison to other varieties of rice. The variety yields 5.5 metric tonnes per hectare in the Boro season and 4.5 to 5 metric tonnes per hectare in the Kharif season, respectively,” said Mr. Adhikari.

Work on developing the variety started in 2006 and by 2013 the scientists were successful. Pradip Kumar Das, a farmer at Birnagar in Nadia district who cultivated the variety in over four hectares (30 bighas of land), said that the yield was satisfactory despite a dry spell.

“In Nadia, arsenic contamination is a major health problem. So far about 150 farmers are cultivating the variety and it is going to increase in next few years,” Mr. Das said. He said the rice was long and thin, and aromatic. Across the State, thousands of farmers have started cultivation, even in areas where arsenic in groundwater is not an issue, because of the aroma and the yield.

According to the World Health Organization, long-term exposure to arsenic, mainly through drinking water and food, can lead to poisoning. Skin lesions and skin cancer are the most characteristic effects.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/i6hl0f/article30771630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200208-WA0014-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/arsenic-resistant-rice-cultivated-in-west-bengal/article30771631.ece
289,2020/02/08,Sandeep Khosla: We don’t hang out with people our age,"Sandeep Khosla breezes into the ‘Asal’ store hours before its launch in Hyderabad, dressed in a white shirt. His team wants him to change into something dressier, but he prefers the fuss-free white shirt. And why not? Whites have played a significant role in the rise of Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla label.

The design house has diversified in recent years — apart from the premium AJSK couture, they introduced the diffusion line Asal, menswear Mard, Gulabo for the young and free spirited, and Khosla Jani for an international clientèle.

Asal, which means real and original, was introduced when Abu and Sandeep grew tired of the many knock-offs of their collections. “So when we started something new, we thought we’d name it Asal, the real thing,” laughs Sandeep, seated in the tastefully designed studio inside the store. This diffusion line, he reveals, also stemmed from the need to create a slightly more affordable line than his couture, to cater to an aspirational clientèle. He’s quick to add that there’s no compromise on quality and finish. “People would walk up to us and say ‘I wish you were more affordable’. They loved the AJSK story but found it too expensive, because everything was handmade,” he says.

Asal relies on both hand and machine embroidery. Sandeep insists, “We don’t do computerised designs. It’s still a craftsman who’s doing machine embroidery.”

Their signature techniques, like the mirror work, found its way into Asal. “We’ve been doing mirror work for a 100 years now,” Sandeep laughs, recalling how he and Abu first designed a mirror work jacket for Reema Kapoor’s (Raj Kapoor’s daughter) wedding three decades ago. Mirrors were the highlight for an ensemble for Madhuri Dixit in Devdas.

The real deal

Talking of Asal and knock-offs, Sandeep explains how the design house’s legal team monitors social media and sends legal notices to those who copy them and adds, “they just disappear from social media for a while; it’s impossible to track everyone who rips off our designs. It’s laborious.” The duo laugh it off or get annoyed when someone posts an AJSK jacket worn by Amitabh Bachchan and claims they’ve made it. They just focus on the next big thing for their label.

Abu and Sandeep have been catering to Hyderabad buyers and Sandeep terms Hyderabad, as an evolved market that doesn’t compromise on quality, “People here love the good life — amazing food, they party during the week, are well travelled, and still simple at heart. They are not snobs.”

When the duo started their label 34 years ago, fashion wasn’t a vibrant industry. “We were glorified darzis (tailors),” Sandeep remembers. He reveals how both of them were born into wealthy families but as they grew up, their families lost some of the wealth, and they had to begin from a humble setting. “Our families encouraged us to pursue our dreams.” Both of them aren’t trained designers and Sandeep argues, “a fashion school can teach you the technicalities of garment construction, not how to think. Today everyone in India think they are designers, just like many people draw a ‘bindu’ [like Raza] and call themselves artists.”

Love for cinema

For the untrained Abu and Sandeep, what triggered the interest in fashion? “We were obsessed with movies,” says Sandeep. He and Abu grew up on Hindi classics like Pakeezah while Abu’s father treasured a postcard collection of Hollywood stars. It was poetic that when they opened their first store called Mata Hari, among their first clients were Dimple Kapadia and Jaya Bachchan. “And the rest is history,” says Sandeep, mentioning that their resort wear label Gulabo was named after Waheeda Rahman’s character in Pyaasa.

The designer duo have come a long way. Sandeep credits Abu to be the more creative one of the two, and mentions how he sketches the embroidery pattern outlines for each of their collections. “Abu was less ambitious of the two. I wanted to be someone important. Back then, I thought I don’t want to be just another Sandeep Khosla in the world of Sandeep Khoslas at age 40.”

Cannes story

A game changer in the AJSK journey was when Sonam Kapoor wore their sari with frou for the red carpet at Cannes. “For a few years we were catering to an older clientèle. No complaints, the business was good, but Abu felt we also need to think young. Sonam wearing our sari at the Cannes brought in the young energy, and then we designed for Veere di Wedding,” he shares.

Asal and Gulabo were introduced to focus on the young audience. The constant reinvention helps the designers ward off creative stagnation. “We mostly meet young people to think fresh; we don’t hang out with people our age. It’s so boring to hear about knee pains or sagging cheeks,” Sandeep guffaws, signing off.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/elmbox/article30769763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM10SANDEEPKHOSLA1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/fashion-designers-abu-jani-and-sandeep-khosla-launch-their-label-asal-in-hyderabad-to-cater-to-an-aspiring-clientele/article30769765.ece
290,2020/02/08,Powder-coated love,"Bob Duncan’s love for India is as effusive as the bright colours of his latest work. Cochin Colours, on show at Kashi Art Gallery, showcases six stirring photographs of local people who modelled for the American artist. But this only a fraction of the 1000+ photographs of Indians in various moods, poses and attire. “I am absolutely in love with India,” says Bob who found his way to Fort Kochi through fashion photography three years ago.

Cochin Colours comes after Noir Portraits, explains Bob, a series of portraits against a black backdrop, that began in Rome and continued in Los Angeles, the city from which he hails.

e, the flowing sari or a man’s dhoti, but it was real day-to-day life.” Then, in April 2019, while walking down Princess Street, Bob saw something that stoked his imagination. In a store were heaps of bright coloured powders used in India during Holi and to make rangoli.

He wished to use these on models but was not sure if people would oblige. “It was a surprise when parents came with their children to get them photographed with the colours on them,” says Bob who shot the images in an open studio with a soft black velvet piece as backdrop.

A girl with a turquoise face, purple hair and wondering eyes, a pink-haired, teary eyed nervous boy, one with a soulful eyes peering from a purple countenance and a green-faced boy with an innocent look are images that catch the emotion behind the playful make up.

One of Bob’s portraits is of Faisal, a lemonade seller whom he met at Hotel 18. Attracted by his thick mane Bob approached him to model. Using black on his face and turquoise and purple powder cascading down his frizzy hair is a captivating image of a vivacious man game to take on life.

Renowned artist Jeevan Lal agreed to pose for Bob. “I met him at David Hall and was impressed by his magnificent beard.” Lal appears dramatic in a countenance smeared with rosy, red h

ues.

Such compositions originated from an underground group of photographers in Los Angeles, explains Bob. ‘50 to 60 in number, they photographed a community of fire-eaters, dancers, musicians, artistes and others who gathered together quite organically on certain nights. The police who came there investigating too became models for the photographers. “I think this is where my portrait photography began,” says Bob.

A self-taught photographer, he began his long career at the age of 12 when Polaroid introduced the Swinger, a camera which could be hung on the shoulder and carried around. “It did away with laborious equipment,” recalls Bob. At 66, he has delved into all genres of photography. A show of abstract, minimalist compositions is coming up in Paris, while his black and white genre are being done alongside. “You cannot manufacture magic, so I wait for it to happen and the Holi colours did that for me in this series,” says Bob.

291,2020/02/08,Kozhikode Corporation civil works in limbo,"With civil contractors refusing to take up any more projects, the Kozhikode Corporation is struggling to complete works under its annual project plan.

Corporation Secretary Binu Francis has said that the contractors were unable to get their bills cleared due to the treasury ban, which, in turn, was affecting pending works.

Bills worth ₹15 crore

At a recent protest, the Kerala Government Contractors’ Federation had alleged that bills worth ₹15 crore that dated back 34 months were yet to be cleared.

With the bills failing to get encashed, the contractors faced a severe cash crunch due to which they could not take up more works.

“It was only recently that the contractors served a notice that they will not take part in tender proceedings. However, tender proceedings for all except a dozen projects under the plan have already been allotted. The crisis will arise in their implementation,” he said.

The Corporation has asked the contractors to complete works and submit bills, which would be cleared as the treasury ban was lifted.

‘A roadblock’

But, small-scale contractors who do not have enough money to complete work on a stretch usually complete one or two works, get bills encashed and then invest money in the next project.

The process had met a roadblock due to the treasury ban, said P.V. Jalaludheen, district president of the federation.

Treasuries in State

At present, the treasuries in the State pass bills only up to ₹5 lakh, which is sufficient for projects under smaller local bodies. But, for bigger civic bodies like corporations, most projects cost above ₹10 lakh.

As a result, corporations will lag behind smaller local bodies with respect to plan expenditure.

“We had completed 50% of the projects under plan fund by this time last year. This year, we have submitted bills for 48% of the projects, but they will not be encashed and hence the rest of the works will be in limbo,” said Mr. Francis.

Corporation funds

However, the Kozhikode Corporation will take steps to clear all dues for projects with its own funds by the end of March.

“We have to clear bills worth around ₹6 crore, which can be done with revenue from taxes and licences that are collected at this time regularly,” said the Secretary.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/article19969914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bribe%20corruption,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/corpn-civil-works-in-limbo/article30772523.ece

293,2020/02/08,DCC chief selection to be a daunting task,"A daunting task awaits the Congress high command to choose a fresh face to head the Kozhikode district unit of the party even as grumblings have surfaced following the exclusion of two senior party leaders from the reconstituted Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC).

At least three names, K.M. Ummer, U. Rajeevan and V.M. Chandran, have been considered for the post of District Congress Committee (DCC) president after the elevation of outgoing president T. Siddique as one of the 12 State vice presidents of the party.

The KPCC is weighing all options in the wake of the approaching three-tier local body polls this year and the Assembly elections next year. Incidentally, the party has no legislator from the district for the last three terms despite winning the two Lok Sabha seats, Kozhikode and Vadakara, during the last three parliamentary elections.

The three-year tenure of Mr. Siddique has put back on the rails the rank and file of the unit which was embroiled in factional wars. Thus, the mantle may fall on an acceptable face that takes everyone into confidence.

Any decision on the new DCC president, however, will be taken only after all the office-bearers, including secretaries and executive committee members, are finalised by February 10. Many feel that groupism may dominate for the post just as former DCC president K.C. Abu and the one of the KPCC general secretaries P.M. Suresh Babu were kept out of the revamped State committee. Both have not been considered in the KPCC for balancing the group politics during organisational restructuring.

Mr. Abu was the DCC president for nearly a decade before Mr. Siddique took over. In the 2016 Assembly polls, he was also denied a seat despite his strong lobbying with the State leaders. However, his presidency was marred not only by factionalism but also saw the decline of the party in the district.

Mr. Babu, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the Kozhikode Corporation, had unsuccessfully contested the Assembly polls against CPI(M)’s A. Pradeepkumar from the Kozhikode North segment last time.

Many local leaders are unhappy with the elevation of Mr. Siddique but they admit to giving the devil his due as the activities of the Congress has improved during his tenure.

Last time when the KPCC was reconstituted, former DCC president M. Veerankutty, who was also Chairman of the Kerala State Minority Commission, was removed from the KPCC list.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/dcc-chief-selection-to-be-a-daunting-task/article30772118.ece

Speaking at the 54th Graduation Day of Lady Doak College, she said that continuous learning and the constant update of knowledge would help graduates identify and sustain a good career. They should be curious to update the latest development, she added.

She also urged the graduates to optimally utilise opportunities to be successful. “Unless knowledge is transformed to create innovations that help to create social or economic change, it does not serve its purpose. So make use of the opportunities to become successful entrepreneurs,” she said. She also added that failure is an inevitable part of success.

300,2020/02/08,Float festival in Madurai attracts thousands of visitors,"Blankets of colour surrounded Mariamman Teppakulam on Saturday during the annual float festival, as thousands thronged the temple tank hoping to catch a glimpse of the presiding deities of Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, Meenakshi and Sundareswarar.

The 12-day festival reached its crescendo as the decorated temple float wafted through a brimming tank, on Thai Poosam, the birth star of King Tirumalai Nayak. The 22-acre tank housed a bright temple float, a replica of the interiors of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple.

Joint Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department and Executive Officer of the temple, N. Natarajan, said that they had specifically made arrangements to ensure that the images printed on the teppam or the float were similar to the insides of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple as they wanted to recreate the experience for those visiting from far away places. “With enough water this year, people from afar can see the gods as the float is buoyant. Floral arrangements and the decoration on the tank have been made by experts in Tiruchi,” he said.

The float was taken around the tank twice starting 11.15 a.m. As per convention, youth from the Devendrakula Velalar community from nearby Anuppanadi pulled the float around the central mandapam of the tank using nylon ropes. The group was led by Agniveeran, who said that his family has been participating in the process of pulling the float since the tank was first built. At the central mandapam, priests performed special pujas.

Earlier in the day, the deities were taken in a procession through the Chithirai streets, East Masi Street, Yanaikkal, Nelpettai and Kamarajar Road to Muktheeswarar Temple near Teppakulam.

Foreign tourists clicked pictures of the festivities and vendors selling treats saw brisk business.

Two boats filled with fire and rescue personnel surveyed the premises and stayed close to the float to ensure that no untoward accidents took place.

Traffic flow on the Kamarajar Road was blocked from 10.30 a.m. to 12 p.m.

The festival is expected to see larger crowds in the evening when the float completes its last round around the temple tank.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a63p1p/article30769882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08FEBTH--FLOATFEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/float-festival-in-madurai-attracts-thousands-of-visitors/article30769883.ece

Although the last day to send the report is Friday across India, Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan said they had received an extension of 15 days as elections and long leave for Pongal prevented them from completing the report in full. They had completed 95% of the report.

The report lists qualitative and quantitative measures taken by the university to ensure that they can receive a favourable grade from the NAAC. The qualitative elements concern the total number of students and faculty members, papers published, books published, countries visited by students and teachers as well as patents filed. The quantitative portion pertains to contribution to core values of the institute and efforts made to enhance the university.

Speaking to presspersons here on Saturday, Athrady Prithviraj Hegde, president of the Balaga, said that Mr. Achar died on January 7, 2020.

Since his family, comprising his wife and two children, have no support, Mr. Achar’s admirers came together and formed the organisation to help raise funds.

The aim of the balaga was to raise at least ₹25 lakh through donations to help the family.

A Yakshagana programme too will be organised in May to raise funds.

People interested in donating money could do it to account opened at Corporation Bank, Indrali Branch, Udupi.

The account name is: M/s Bhagavatha Divangatha Nagara Subramanya Achar Abhimanigala Balaga; account number: 520101266351279; IFSC code: CORP0003087; MICR code: 576017021.

312,2020/02/08,ASI stresses on need to increase tourist footfall to monuments,"Many ancient and historical monuments in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts could be made popular and be protected if the tourist footfall to them increases, said Shivkant Bajpai, Superintending Archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India, Bengaluru Circle.

The coastal belt has to be developed into a hub of tourism, Mr. Bajpai said in a chat with The Hindu here. He noted the district administration has to do two immediate things.

One was to demarcate boundaries of ancient monuments and the other was to introduce a hop-on-hop-off tourist bus service to increase footfall to those monuments.

He said there were complaints of encroachment of properties around ancient monuments in the district. There was dire need to reclaim those properties to improve the landscape of monuments and protect them, he said adding he would hold a meeting with the district administration soon in this regard.

Giving the example of Sulthan Bathery in the city, Mr Bajpai said he was told government land around the monument has been encroached. There were complaints about other monuments too. In such a case, the role of the district administration becomes all the more important in reclaiming the encroachment and beautifying monument surroundings.

During his visit to Sulthan Bathery on Wednesday, Mr. Bajpai was surprised to see a survey mark on the bathery and was told it was made by the city administration. He said he would immediately seek its removal from the monument.

Besides marking boundaries, the administration has to facilitate easy and affordable visits of tourists to monuments. Along with ancient monuments, the administration may also include monuments more than a century old in the list and introduce hop-on-hop-off bus facilities.

Besides promoting tourism, the move would also contribute to the economy. For example, a circuit of Sulthan Bathery, Mangaladevi, University College, State Archives Museum, Thousand Pillar Basadi of Moodlbidri and the Masnasthambha at Bappanadu (Mulki) may be introduced, he said.

Mr Bajpai said he was visiting all the ancient monuments in the Bengaluru Circle and would take a call on their improvement later.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/asi-stresses-on-need-to-increase-tourist-footfall-to-monuments/article30771421.ece
313,2020/02/08,"A year after construction, new District Central Library still not open","Nearly a year after the new District Central Library was constructed next to the Town Hall here, it is yet to be thrown open to public.

The construction began here in February 2017 and completed by last April, at a cost of ₹3.49 crore.

The ground floor will house a reading room, children’s section, senior citizens reading section, and magazine and newspaper reading section.

The first floor will house the competitive exams study centre, reading section, digital library, property counter, and chief librarian’s office. The technical and administration section and 130-seater capacity meeting hall will be on the second floor.

Despite the building being ready, the interior works are pending. Arun Kumar, project director of Nirmiti Kendra, said that these will cost ₹1.76 crore. But the Department of Public Libraries had not released funds for them.

He had met the Director of the Department of Public Libraries in Bengaluru recently and he had promised to release the funds by the end of March.

“Once the funds are released, we will be able to complete the interior works in a couple of months,” he said.

The construction of the new building was taken up because there was not enough space at the present District Central Library building located on Kavi Muddana Road.

The Department of Public Libraries had to cede the ground floor to the Udupi city municipal council to house some of its departments resulting in lack of space for the former.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/92rv37/article30771330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BG-LIB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/a-year-after-construction-new-district-central-library-still-not-open/article30771332.ece
314,2020/02/08,MCC to penalise bulk waste generators without processing units from Monday,"Mangaluru City Corporation will begin penalising such bulk waste generators who did not set up garbage processing units in their premises, from February 10, according to Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde, Commissioner of the corporation.

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, he said that under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the bulk waste generators will have to segregate waste and set up processing units, to convert wet waste into manure, on their premises. The National Green Tribunal had also directed the government to strictly implement SWM Rules, 2016. The city corporation, for the first time, will impose ₹25,000 as fine for not setting up processing units on the premises of bulk waste generators. If not complied with, they will be imposed fine of ₹50,000 the second time around. If failed to act even then, steps will be taken to book a case.

The Commissioner said that the bulk waste generators are apartments, hostels, education institutes, hotels, bar and restaurants, marriage and convention halls, some commercial establishments, meat sellers, and the like.

The civic body had conducted a meeting with bulk waste generators on July 3, 2019, and had apprised them to segregate waste and set up processing units on their premises.

A demonstration on various methods of processing available had been conducted for them on September 27, 2019. They had been given time till October to set up the units. Later, it had been extended till December 2019. Yet, many have not bothered to set up them.

Hence, the corporation which is answerable to the NGT, will start imposing fine from Monday onwards.

The Commissioner said that the civic body had so far issued notices to 1,948 bulk waste generators for not setting up the processing units on the premises. There are over 2,000 apartments in the city. About 2,820 individual houses are now segregating waste in the city.

The corporation will not give building completition certificates to new apartments if they failed to set up processing units on the premises. The Commissioner appealed to all bulk waste generators to take the matter seriously.

315,2020/02/08,Rare Lajja Gauri idol found in Barkur,"A rare granite idol of Lajja Gauri has been found fixed on the road in Barkur village of Udupi district, according to information furnished by Shivakant Bajpai, Superintending Archaeologist of ASI Bangalore Circle. It is believed to be from the sixth century.

Lajja Gauri is said to be a fertility symbol. The idol is rare, though very popular among certain cults.

Dr. Bajpai, who is on a tour of the coastal districts, said that he first came across the image when it went viral on social media.

He subsequently traced it to a public road in Barkur, which is an ancient historical town of coastal Karnataka.

It was the ancient capital of the Alupa kingdom and a seat of power for several centuries. “This is a very important idol and hundreds of vehicles pass over it every day.

316,2020/02/08,Mahindra & Mahindra Q3 profit slumps 73% to ₹380 cr,"Home-grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on Saturday reported 73% decline in consolidated net profit at ₹380 crore for December quarter 2019 due to sluggish vehicle sales.

The company had posted a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹1,396 crore for the same quarter last fiscal, M&M said in a statement.

“The results of Q3 F2020 includes a net loss on account of exceptional and one-off items of ₹554 crore as compared to a net gain on account of exceptional and one-off items of ₹519 crore in Q3 F2019,” it said.

Its revenue also moderated to ₹12,120 crore in the latest quarter, as against ₹12,893 crore in the same period last fiscal, it said.

Vehicle sales during the third quarter stood at 1,23,353 units as against 1,33,508 units in the same period last fiscal, a decline of 8%, the company said.

Tractor sales also slipped 6% to 81,435 units in the third quarter as against 87,036 units in the year-ago period, it added.

Exports of vehicles and tractors declined 22% to 9,633 units during the latest quarter, as compared to 12,363 units in the same period a year ago.

However, it said, the Indian auto and tractor industry during third quarter has shown some signs of trend reversal and has seen moderation in the double digit de-growth seen in the first half, it said.

Good monsoons, the festive season demand, improved liquidity conditions, new launches, especially in the Utility Vehicle (UV) segment and special schemes offered by OEMs for the auto industry were the key reasons for this moderation in de-growth, it said.

The unseasonal rains in October 2019 did cause some damage to the kharif crop, but the sentiment in the agri and rural economy is fairly upbeat with good sowing of rabi crops supported by very good water reservoir levels and government announcement for thrust on infra projects.

Going forward, it said, the supportive and coordinated interplay of monetary and fiscal policy will be of paramount importance in revival of growth.

317,2020/02/08,Slowdown hits India Cements,"The India Cements Ltd. (ICL) posted a net loss of ₹5.37 crore for the third quarter ended December 2019 against a standalone net profit of ₹3.13 crore a year earlier, on weak demand. ICL had reported profit for 19 previous quarters.

“The slowdown in the economy together with poor demand for cement in the South had resulted in continuous price pressure,” said N. Srinivasan, vice-chairman and managing director, ICL.

“The company’s performance during the quarter was impacted by the above factors resulting in a marginal loss after a gap of nearly 19 quarters.”

While the cement industry grew in the north, west and the east, it had contracted in the south by 12%. Economic slowdown, stalling of major projects in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana combined with the deferment of infrastructure spending in these States were attributed as the main reasons.

Poor demand

“The performance of ICL has to be viewed against this background of low demand since four of our units are situated in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where the decline in growth was more pronounced and hence our performance was affected more than that of our peers,” he said. Reduction in net plant realisation by over ₹150 per tonne of cement on a sequential quarter basis impacted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by over ₹42 crore.

He added, “We will recover. There are signs of improvement and things will change for the better during the fourth quarter,” he said.

Asserting that sales volume had been picking up in the south since January, he said the worst was over and the cement industry would see growth going forward. “Cement price increase has also taken effect in all the five regions and the hike has been absorbed. ICL is well geared with operational efficiency with head room in all the plants to meet the demand. It can also move more cement to markets beyond the South depending on the price and availability of railway wagons,” he added.

In Q3, ICL’s total revenue fell 9.55% to ₹1,194.42 crore. ICL was able to successfully bring down its total expenditure by 8.50% to ₹1,204.54 crore. The company was able to handle power and fuel cost efficiently. Transportation and handling charges came to its rescue.

During the period under review, ICL’s capacity utilisation stood at 69% against 76%. Overall volume of clinker and cement was lower by 10% at ₹26.66 lakh tonnes. Variable cost of production was kept under control and it was lower by 6%.

Stating that limestone resources were available only in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, he suggested the formation of freight equalisation scheme so that it would be moved to North.

To bail the industry from the current turmoil, Mr. Srinivasan said all infrastructure projects planned and running should be allowed to be done.

On new investment plans in Madhya Pradesh, he said the pace would slow down a little bit but the company would keepgo on buying land for limestone mining.

318,2020/02/08,Upholding the fairness of the sentencing process,"Mukesh Kumar Singh, Pawan Kumar Gupta, Akshay Kumar Singh and Vinay Kumar Sharma have been given seven days to exercise all their legal rights, after which they will, in all probability, be hanged to death for the rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December 2012. The trial court has also refused to permit their execution before the exhaustion of their legal remedies, in light of the order of the Delhi High Court.

Since the incident, the case has received great media attention. The subject of rape has since become a matter of national importance; often there are protests with demands for the perpetrators to be hanged. Public anger around the Delhi incident led to the national belief that the death penalty was the only appropriate outcome.

Fair trial rights

While public sentiment remains unchanged, it is important to realise that judicial processes demand dispassionate fairness that gives due regard to substantive requirements of sentencing. Failure to meet these demands raises serious concerns about fair trial rights of the accused, which is as important during sentencing as it is at conviction. This article discusses the manner in which public opinion and “society’s cry for justice” have played a huge role in the sentencing process at the trial as well as appellate levels of the judiciary in this case, and the implications of this on the fair trial rights of the convicts.

A pivotal case and framework

A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) laid down the sentencing framework in capital cases, requiring sentencing courts to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence and the offender when deciding the question of punishment. Courts also have to discharge the burden of meaningfully considering whether the alternative option of life imprisonment has been unquestionably foreclosed. The death sentence can only be imposed in exceptional cases involving extreme culpability, and such exceptionalism cannot solely be rooted in the brutality of the crime.

The manner of imposition of death sentences by courts at all levels in this case sits uncomfortably with the basic tenet of Bachan Singh. These decisions do not meaningfully engage with the mitigating circumstances of the convicts leave alone fulfilling the obligation of unquestionably foreclosing the option of life imprisonment.

The sentencing orders of both the trial court and the High Court not only summarily dismissed mitigating factors on the basis of precedents but also went on to explain why any punishment lesser than the death penalty would not meet the demands of “justice”. The trial court commented upon the “extreme mental perversion of the accused”, which was “not worthy of human condonation” and also reiterated elements of the crime to highlight their “beastly behaviour”. The High Court elaborately discussed the exceptional nature of this case given the brutality involved to conclude that expecting society to demand anything other than the death penalty for the convicts would be “unnatural and ludicrous”. A plain reading of the sentencing orders makes it very clear that the public clamour for “hanging the rapists” made its way into the judicial decision-making.

Irrespective of the brutal nature of the crime, the circumstances of the convicts are crucial to the sentencing exercise and have to inform the punitive outcome. Recognising these deficiencies in the sentencing hearings by lower courts, the Supreme Court took it upon itself to appreciate mitigating evidence. The Court allowed defence counsels access to the convicts and directed the defence counsel to file “necessary separate affidavits and documents on mitigating circumstances”.

While this is noteworthy, the decision to itself hear on the question of sentence and not send the case back to the trial court for a fresh sentencing hearing took away the right of the convicts to be heard on the issue of sentence by courts at three different levels. The evidence on mitigation that was presented before the Court in the form of affidavits included material on the socio-economic circumstances of the convicts, their family background and some information on their previous occupation.

The uncanny similarity between the mitigation affidavits of the defendants is itself a matter of concern, as it does not meaningfully present individual circumstances of the convicts, raising questions about the quality of legal representation. However, of graver concern is the manner in which the court dismissed these circumstances as irrelevant, given the circumstances of the crime in the case.

Issue of life imprisonment

Confirming the death sentences for all, two concurring opinions remarked that the crime was bound to “shock the collective conscience” and any punishment lesser than the death penalty would “shake the confidence of the public” in the criminal justice system. After an unreasoned dismissal of individual circumstances of the convicts, the Supreme Court also failed to sufficiently answer why life imprisonment was unquestionably foreclosed. The Court failed to discharge any of these burdens.

At its core, imposition of death sentence to satisfy “collective conscience” is vengeance couched as retributive justice, captured by the phrase “an eye for an eye”. Modern penal systems consider this an outmoded concept, and even Bachan Singh had observed that retributive justice means punishment based on blameworthiness of the convict, and cannot be equated to “vindictiveness”. The sentencing requirements under the law do not have a place for bloodlust. However, the judgments in this case indicate a strong influence of collective conscience on the outcome. In fact, the Supreme Court’s approach suggests that society’s cry for the death penalty justifies the imposition of the death penalty, without adequately dealing with the question of life imprisonment.

The execution of the four convicts after exhaustion of their legal remedies may give their case a semblance of due process. However, concerns about the fairness of the sentencing process remain unanswered. While the public has very little patience to appreciate such nuances of the law, courts are duty-bound to maintain a high degree of fidelity to these processes. This should hold true especially in a case such as this which has seen loud and repeated calls for “hanging the rapists”.

319,2020/02/08,"Victim justice is two steps forward, one step back","The recent judgment in Rekha Murarka vs The State Of West Bengal (November 2019) has held that the victims’ private counsel cannot orally examine or cross-examine the witnesses. A deeper examination of the Court’s reasoning shows that the judgment is bound to have serious consequences for the victims’ right to participation. It is a setback to the developing jurisprudence on victim justice.

Under our criminal justice system, victims find themselves removed from the proceedings. Their identities are reduced to being mere witnesses. The harm they suffer is reduced to being aggravating or mitigating factors at the time of sentencing. With the state appropriating their victimisation, the actual victims become mere stage props in a larger scheme.

In 1996, the 154th Law Commission Report suggested a paradigm shift in India’s criminal justice system towards a victim-centric notion of justice. The Code of Criminal Procedure(Amendment) Act, 2009 partially accepted this suggestion and granted some rights to the victims of crime. The Act introduced victims’ right to a private counsel under Section 24(8). The Code of Criminal Procedure already allowed for pleaders engaged by private persons to submit written arguments with the permission of the court under Sections 301(2) and 302 allowed a person to conduct the prosecution with permission of the court. These sections were read together to partially secure the victims’ right to participation.

Some hits but more misses

A slow but steady progress has been made towards securing justice for victims in this country. In the case of Delhi Domestic Working Women’s Forum v. Union of India (1994), the SC called for the extension of the right to legal assistance to victims of sexual assault at the pre-trial stages. In Mallikarjun Kodagali (Dead) ... vs The State Of Karnataka (2018), the Court accepted that under the criminal justice system, the rights of the accused far outweigh the rights of the victim. The Supreme Court not only called for the introduction of a victim impact statement in order to guarantee participation of the victim in the trial proceedings, but also reinstated the victims’ right to appeal against an adverse order.

Despite these advances, the scheme of victim participation remains far removed from the ideals embedded in the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power;India is a signatory. The Declaration requires that the views and concerns of victims should be allowed and considered at all appropriate stages without prejudice to the accused. Presently, the victims’ advocate has an extremely limited role to play wherein he “assists” the prosecutor rather than represent the interests of the victim before the court. This is manifest from Section 301(2) under which the advocate can only air his views and concerns, not to the court, but to the prosecutor and must act under his directions thereafter.

The only substantial opportunity provided to a private counsel is after the closing of evidence when written arguments may be submitted to the court only after seeking the permission of the court. This stage, after the closing of evidence therefore, is the only stage legislatively recognised as “appropriate”. In contrast, the proceedings under the International Criminal Court (ICC) provides for victim participation at the stage of first, a challenge to the jurisdiction of the ICC; second, framing of charges; third, opening and closing statements; fourth, making a written submission wherever the personal interests of the victims are affected; and finally, for presenting witnesses to give evidence on issues relating to the personal interests of the victims.

A lost chance

Effective and meaningful participation still eludes victims of crime. The Supreme Court in Rekha Murarka has missed the opportunity to forward the jurisprudence on victim justice and rectify the lacunae in our laws. Instead, the judgment goes against the jurisprudential current specified above.

Indeed, the victim’s right to participation cannot be secured by restricting the rights of the accused. The right to participation, however, can be realised at appropriate stages without any such prejudice. Instead of exploring such a normative balance between the rights of the accused and victim, the judgment limits the rights of the victim by proceeding on a flawed understanding of the role and responsibilities of the victim’s advocate. According to the judgment, a victim’s advocate cannot be allowed the right to participate because, first, insistence by the victim’s counsel to examine a witness deliberately left out by the prosecution may weaken the prosecution’s case; second, the trial will derogate into a “vindictive battle” between the victim’s counsel and the accused; and third, a lack of experience on the part of the victim’s counsel may lead to lapses.

The success of prosecution is dependent largely upon the victim’s participation in the trial. The primary role and responsibility of the victim’s advocate therefore, is to represent the personal interests of the victim by cooperating with the prosecution.

Instead, the court assumes that unless the victim’s advocate is subservient to the prosecutor, either the prosecutor will be rendered ineffectual or the victim’s advocate will take over the role of the prosecutor.

The judgment further assumes that prosecutions effectively take the victim’s needs into account and ignores the fact that the need for a private counsel arises precisely because intentional or unintentional prosecutorial lapses directly lead to injustice to the victims. The press is replete with instances of “failure of prosecution” leading to dismissal of the case or acquittals. Ingenuously, the court expects the victim’s counsel to make the prosecutor aware of any aspects that have not been addressed in the examination of witnesses or the arguments advanced by the public prosecutor. In the process, it assumes that the prosecutor will address such lapses.

In any event, under the role currently envisaged in our criminal justice system, the public prosecutor cannot sufficiently take into account the interests, needs and requirements of the victims. The need instead, is to strengthen victim participation by providing private counsels with a greater say in the conduct of the trial without prejudicing the interests of the accused. The cause of victim justice would be greatly served, if the Supreme Court decide to revisit its reasoning and assumptions to appropriately amend this provision in light of the above.

320,2020/02/08,Extended folly: On invocation of PSA against Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti,"Six months after the BJP government at the Centre revoked the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir and reduced it to two Union Territories, several senior leaders of the erstwhile State continue to be in detention. On Thursday, the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA) was invoked against former Chief Ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, among others. They were in preventive detention without charges until then. The 83-year-old Farooq Abdullah, another former CM, had earlier been detained under the PSA, and he remains in detention. There is no clarity regarding the number of prisoners or the future course for J&K, despite the elaborate rhetoric from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament on Thursday on the subject. With the dilution of Article 370 that accorded special status to J&K in August last year, the region has now been fully integrated with the rest of the country, the Prime Minister claimed. Indeed, the malevolent instruments of power deployed in J&K have since then dangerously spread to other parts — the crackdown on legitimate political activities, the vilification of leaders critical of the government as anti-India, and high-handed policing that is not merely condoned but glorified. The PM defended the indefinite and arbitrary detention of people as essential, and accused the former CMs of making “unacceptable” statements.

Explained | The Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act

If the executive were to draw boundaries on what statements are ‘acceptable’ and arrogate to itself the authority to punish unacceptable ones, it would be dangerous for a constitutional democracy. The Supreme Court had in January chided the government for the indefinite restriction on Internet in J&K, following which services have been partially restored. The Court cited the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech, and also criticised the frequent and widespread use of Section 144 by governments. While the Court order was rousing in its tone, it did little to restrain the government. The changes to Article 370 and the manner in which they were effected, are under the consideration of the top court, which has not shown the sense of urgency these questions deserve. Though the BJP has always had an ideologically deterministic approach towards J&K, its policy has been nothing more than improvisation. At least at this late hour, the Centre must make an honest approach to restart a political process in the Valley. Indiscreet moves such as attempts to graft an inorganic layer of leaders into Valley politics are destined to fail. With all their follies, regional outfits and their leaders remain India’s best bet in J&K. Their continuing detention betrays a perturbing lack of awareness of this basic fact in decision-making in New Delhi.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/extended-folly-the-hindu-editorial-on-invocation-of-psa-against-omar-abdullah-and-mehbooba-mufti/article30765636.ece
321,2020/02/08,Trump moves on: On the acquittal of the U.S. President,"The acquittal of U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, of impeachment charges in the Senate, has brought an end to the months-long acrimonious proceedings in Congress that exposed the American political class’s deep partisan divisions. Mr. Trump, who was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in the Democrats-controlled House in December, has expectedly claimed the Senate acquittal as a “vindication” of his actions. But the truth is far from his claims. It is Mr. Trump’s decision to delay critical military aid to Ukraine in return for Kiev launching investigations against Joe Biden, the former Vice-President and a key Democratic presidential candidate, and his son, Hunter Biden, that triggered the impeachment proceedings. By refusing to cooperate with the House inquiry into the issue, the Democrats said he obstructed Congressional proceedings. The House voted largely on party lines on December 18 to impeach him, but it was clear that he would not be convicted in the Republicans-controlled Senate where a two-third majority is needed to remove a sitting President from office. The Grand Old Party stood firmly behind its President. Only Mitt Romney, the Utah Senator, broke ranks to vote against Mr. Trump on one of the two charges.

If it was certain that Mr. Trump would be acquitted, why did the House Democrats launch the impeachment proceedings? The Democrats would say that irrespective of the final outcome, it is the House’s responsibility to hold the President accountable for his actions. While this is a valid argument, the problem is the political cost. Mr. Trump has already launched a tirade and would definitely turn the acquittal into another campaign issue that would fit into his “witch hunt” narrative. Clearly, the Congressional inquiry and the trial have not dented his popularity as many of his rivals had hoped for. Different pollsters suggest that the President’s approval rating jump (43.5% to 49%) is near his highest level since he entered the office. Furthermore, the Republican Party, which had often clashed with Mr. Trump in the early days of his Presidency, stood united to defend him, irrespective of the facts of the Ukraine scandal. On the other side, the Democrats, despite their morally righteous positions, are divided. The Iowa caucuses were an opportunity for them to start the process of building a nationwide counter-narrative to Mr. Trump’s protectionist, bellicose, and sometimes vindictive policies. But they messed up, embarrassing themselves. The Democrats may still not end the political wrangling over the scandal. The House can summon more witnesses and continue the investigation. But to ensure a Trump defeat in the November poll, that may not be enough. They should have transparent primaries, unite behind their candidate and launch a campaign on issues that appeal to the American voter.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trump-moves-on-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-acquittal-of-the-us-president/article30765640.ece
322,2020/02/08,Bengaluru startup develops hi-tech machine that grades 10 oranges per second,"In an effort that could turn the laborious process of grading of fruits into an easy task, a Bengaluru-based IT startup has developed a machine that can grade fruits with high speed. This machine, said to be the country’s first ‘optical fruit grading system’, can grade 10 oranges per second, on various parameters, according to Jagadeesh C. Sunkad, who was part of the team that developed the grader.

The machine, developed by engineers on behalf of Zentron Labs, can grade oranges while a similar facility for apples is also ready. The grading system for tomato, onion and mango is under development. It grades fruits on the parameters of size, colour, weight and any surface defects.

“Grading of fruits is very much required for farmers to get remunerative prices as consumers prefer quality produce. But grading is a laborious process as it is being done only manually so far in India,” explained Mr. Sunkad. This machine can grade four to 10 tonnes of oranges per hour and is far cheaper than the imported variant. He underwent a training through Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) to understand various technical and scientific processes involved in grading of fruits before developing the machine. “It is basically the convergence of technologies as a team of 50 engineers with specialisation in different subjects have come together to develop this,” he said, while pointing out that the machine will have multiple cameras to identify different aspects of fruits.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lgjmxd/article30768749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGFRUITGRADING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-startup-develops-hi-tech-machine-that-grades-10-oranges-per-second/article30768750.ece
323,2020/02/08,Multiple infrastructure projects turn city into a dust bowl,"Dug up for pipeline replacement, for Namma Metro work, for Smart City projects, and for laying underground electricity cables, Bengaluru’s roads look the worse for wear with multiple infrastructure projects under way. The city has become a dust bowl and the dry weather is only exacerbating these conditions, prompting people in several areas to term it the city’s “dust age”. The dust and debris from the ongoing, completed, and incomplete projects are also a health hazard.

Swarna Venkataraman, member of I Change Indiranagar, said the white-topping work on 80-ft road was contributing to the dust problem in her locality. “Pollution is a big factor in addition to the lack of access to the road, which has resulted in inner lanes being jammed. We don’t understand why white-topping is being undertaken on this stretch, as another round of asphalting would have been enough,” she said.

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board officials said measures had to be taken to prevent dust, which is an acute problem, especially during the winter owing to wind flow and dry conditions. “Fine dust – PM 2.5 – is the bigger problem. The action plan for controlling air pollution in Bengaluru clearly points out to what measures should be taken. Increasing number of vehicles being registered is also worrying,” said an official.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has a road network of nearly 13,000 km, including 1,400 km of major roads.

According to the action plan, the BBMP is required to utilise mechanical sweeping machines to remove dust deposited near the edge of the kerb and beside the median. To tackle dust from roads as well as footpaths, the BBMP has planned to procure pressure jet cleaners/washers, the action plan states.

The civic body is also supposed to suppress dust by sprinkling treated water from the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board on roads in areas where dust levels are high.

“Plants of specific native species that absorb fine dust should be planted where the pollution levels are very high, such as the Central Silk Board, Whitefield industrial area, and Mysuru Road,” the action plan states.

Ravikumar Surpur, Special Commissioner, Projects and Health, BBMP, told The Hindu that the civic body and the Commissioner had “acknowledged the problem” and were coming up with a “comprehensive plan” to tackle the problem.

On Friday, a group of college students organised a free mask distribution campaign at K. Narayanapura Cross to help residents of Hennur, Narayanpura and Kothanur beat air pollution owing to various roadworks in the area.

Doctors see spurt in cases of asthma, eye allergy

The impact of excessive dust is having a telling impact on the health of citizens. Doctors The Hindu spoke to said complaints related health problems have been on the rise.

Bharath Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director of a private hospital, said there had been a spurt in asthma cases. “When I look for reasons, there is always a mention of roadworks or some construction activity close to their house. For around three weeks, there has been a rise in the number of cases, when usually by the end of winter, we start taking them off medication. It is not just asthma, we are also getting children coming in with eye allergy and red eyes, which are problems closely related to dust, and not the regular playground dust,” he explained.

It is not just development work and construction work. Continuous exposure to vehicular congestion will make people susceptible to health complications, said Shashidhar Buggi, former director of the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases. “The exposure is not just for one or two days. It is for two to three years. This leads to congestion in the lungs, continuous irritation, asthma, bronchitis, and even lung cancer,” he said.

Dr. Buggi pointed out that people working on these projects were the worse hit. “One can imagine their plight. They are prone to respiratory and viral infections. They need to be provided safety gear, such as masks, and regular medical check-ups,” he said.

Apart from taking up planting of trees as part of a large movement and controlling the number of motor vehicles, he said those residing close to construction sites should maintain cleanliness at home, install mesh windows and exhaust fans, and use cleaning equipment such as a vacuum cleaner. This would help especially those with allergic manifestations, he said.

Dr. Reddy, who prescribed wet cleaning twice a day as opposed to dusting, which causes air to get more polluted, keeping windows close to construction activity closed, and vacuum cleaning, said masks may not be of much help in the case of children owing to a mismatch in the size and fitting, as most masks are meant for adults.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wi5anq/article30766818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGDUST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/multiple-infrastructure-projects-turn-city-into-a-dust-bowl/article30766819.ece

Some of the modalities of the examination have been tweaked. While earlier it was stated that evaluation would be conducted at the district level, the order states that it would be done at the school level.

The order also states that the results will be put on the School Achievement Tracking System and marks cards would be generated for students.

325,2020/02/08,Give outer limit for completing delimitation of BBMP wards: High Court,"The High Court of Karnataka on Friday asked the State government to spell out the outer limit for notifying delimitation of the 198 wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) as per the 2011 Census and to fix caste-based reservation of the wards after delimitation.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by the State Election Commission (SEC).

The SEC pointed out that the government has to complete the process of delimitation and reservation for the BBMP wards for timely conduct of election to the BBMP’s council, the term of which will expire on September 10, 2020.

It was pointed out in the petition that the SEC has to prepare a fresh voters’ list only after the delimitation process of wards was completed by the government. Any delay in finalisation of delimitation would impact the process of election.

The SEC also told the court that it has been communicating with the government since 2018 for timely completion of delimitation of wards.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/give-outer-limit-for-completing-delimitation-of-bbmp-wards-high-court/article30766690.ece

Nagar, Banashankari, Kumaraswamy Layout, Electronics City, and Jayanagar. Many took to social media to complain that they were completely cut off.

The telecom company, in a release, attributed the disruption in service to “fibre cuts in the city and outskirts”.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar told the The Hindu: “We had directed all network providers to go underground as above ground cables are dangerous and ugly. However, in this particular case, until the location is specified, we cannot say why the fibres were damaged and who did it.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/disruption-in-vodafone-idea-network/article30766682.ece
327,2020/02/08,BBMP marshals collect record ₹22 lakh as fine in January,"The failure of citizens to segregate waste and cut down on the use of plastic, among other violations, is helping the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fill its coffers. Ward marshals appointed by the BBMP collected ₹22.48 lakh as fine, in around 1,700 cases, in January. It is by far the highest amount collected in a month since September 2019, when the marshals were first roped in.

“In all, including January 2020, over ₹66 lakh has been collected in the past five months. On an average, they collect around ₹10 lakh to ₹15 lakh every month. This month, we crossed ₹20 lakh,” a senior BBMP official said.

One of the reasons for the increase in the fine collection is the renewed crackdown on single-use plastic and related items. Fines collected in January for this was a little over ₹10 lakh as against around ₹3 lakh in the previous month.

Solid waste management violations remain the biggest offence, with over ₹11 lakh collected. In December 2019, the amount for the same category was ₹7 lakh.

D. Randeep, Special Commissioner (SWM), BBMP, feels that deployment of marshals had helped reduce the number of violations. “All the marshals and 27 SWM assistant executive engineers will be provided with PoS (point of sale machines) on Saturday. As of now, only junior health officers have been given the machines,” he said.

Officials hope that with the PoS machines, fine collection will not only be more effective across the city, but also bring about transparency and accountability.

Penalties are levied on solid waste management violations such as littering, not segregating waste at source, improper discarding of animal waste and construction debris, and plastic ban violation, etc.

The BBMP incentivises marshals by allowing them to keep 5% of the fines collected.

“We are now considering extending this incentive to the junior health inspectors and assistant executive engineers in the solid waste management. The Commissioner has agreed to the proposal on extending the incentive to others too. It will be implemented soon,” Mr. Randeep said.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will be launching Sahaya 2.0 and Namma Bengaluru apps on Saturday. He will also hand over PoS machines to the marshals and 15 mechanical sweeping machines to the BBMP.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jvdyxr/article30766671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGBBMPMARSHAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-marshals-collect-record-22-lakh-as-fine-in-january/article30766673.ece
328,2020/02/08,Six arrested for swindling KSAMB of ₹48 crore,"The city police have arrested six persons for allegedly misappropriating ₹48 crore in the Karnataka State Agricultural Marketing Board (KSAMB). The arrested include two officials, one each from the KSAMB and SyndicateBank.

Kari Gowda, managing director, KSAMB, had lodged a complaint recently alleging misappropriation. The board had placed ₹100 crore in two fixed deposits of ₹50 crore each in Uttarahalli branch of SyndicateBank in November 2019. In January this year, however, the board realised that only ₹2 crore was there in one of the FDs and ₹48 crore had been transferred to various current accounts.

The Central Crime Branch that probed the case has now arrested Siddagangiah, deputy general manager at the KSAMB who was in charge of these FDs, and Jayaram, assistant manager, SyndicateBank, Uttarahalli branch. They have also arrested Bharat, brother-in-law of Jayaram, and three middlemen Mustafa, Aslam, and Revanna, all from Chennai. Four other accused, including the kingpin of the scam, are absconding and three police teams are trying to trace them.

“The ₹48 crore was transferred to 60 current accounts, most of them Chennai based. Mustafa, Aslam, and Revanna got the money transferred to their accounts, withdrew it and allegedly gave it to a key accused, who is still at large. He was the link between the officials in the city and the account holders in Chennai,” a senior police official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/six-arrested-for-swindling-ksamb-of-48-crore/article30766658.ece

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said, “We are yet to receive the copy of the order. We will examine the order and decide on the next course of action, as the land is already developed.”

The mall and the apartment complex have come up on the land that earlier housed Raja Mill and was earmarked for industrial purposes at Hanumanthapura village — 3.31 acres in survey number 56, and 37 guntas of Jakkarayanakere. Conversion of industrial use to residential and commercial is a violation of norms and an apex court order, it is contended.

330,2020/02/08,"Citizens, industry bodies slam Bescom’s tariff hike proposal","Citizen and industry representatives slammed the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) proposal to hike electricity tariff for the coming financial year by ₹1.96 a unit.

At the public hearing held at the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) here on Friday, Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC), in its submissions, said the commission should direct Bescom to submit “realistic projections” and “bring discipline” in procuring power at low cost and not pass on this increase in power purchase cost to consumers by increasing the tariff.

“B.PAC has been analysing the submissions made by Bescom for their annual tariff increase since 2014. Our analysis for FY 2019 shows that Bescom has consistently shown no improvement in any of the key metrics such as power purchase cost, energy sales in MU, and transmission and distribution losses, collection efficiency, and quality of service to citizens, and has never met the commission-approved rates and sale levels,” its submission said.

The committee said between FY 2016 and 2019, sales (in MU) had gone up only by 13%, while the revenue increased by 41% and the average power purchase cost increased by 31%. “The distribution loss increased from 12.03% to 12.54% and energy sold to high tension (HT) consumers has fallen by 2%.

“Karnataka in 2019-20 was blessed with good monsoon rain, and all the dams in the State were filled to capacity. However, in the power purchase projections for FY 2021, Bescom has understated the procurement from KPCL hydel,” the committee said, and alleged that data of the Economic Survey of Karnataka shows a “disproportionate increase in agricultural power consumption as compared with the gross irrigated crop area in hectares over the last four decades, indicating “that agricultural power is being diverted to other sources”.

The Peenya Industries Association urged the KERC to “reject” the tariff revision petition and sought creation of a separate tariff for small-scale industries.

“Bescom should have indicated steps taken for improvement of efficiency. Power purchase cost should go down due to bountiful monsoon,” the association said, and alleged that lack of authenticity in the figures mentioned for irrigation pump sets.

The power utility was allowed a 33 paise per unit increase by the KERC last year. Justifying the steep hike that it has asked for this year, Bescom cited a revenue deficit of ₹5,872.08 crore for 2020–21. It has also sought a hike in fixed charges per month from ₹60 to ₹85 for the first KW, and from ₹70 to ₹95 for additional KW.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qi8xfm/article30766641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGHIGHTENSIONWIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citizens-industry-bodies-slam-bescoms-tariff-hike-proposal/article30766642.ece

In a videoconference with health secretaries of all States on Friday to review measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus, the Union Cabinet Secretary said that the police should follow proper protocols in the use of breathalysers.

333,2020/02/08,“Awareness plays a key role’,"A Gram Sabha meeting, held four times in a year, is an opportunity for people and officials to discuss about local governance and its improvement, and development need plans for the village. But, the residents feel that the meets are just an eye wash. The residents say an awareness has to be created among the members of the public about the meetings and authorities concerned should participate in the meets without fail to be successful.

The meetings are held on January 26 Republic Day, May 1 Labourers Day, August 15 Independence Day, and October 2 Gandhi Jayanthi.

Residents of Medavakkam, on conditions of anonymity, say, there is no proper announcement regarding the meetings.

Secondly, the meets are chaired by the local ruling party cadres, who call the shots at these meetings and discuss their problems and of their near and dear ones. The officials at the meet have no other option but to remain a mute spectator and take steps to solve their issues.

For years, we have been raising up the issue of holding local body elections and merging Medavakkam Village Panchayat with Greater Chennai Corporation as the area (Medavakkam) is adjacent to Pallikaranai, which falls under the jurisdictional limits of Greater Chennai Corporation. But, till date, no action has been taken yet. The meets are just an eye wash without the participation of government officials.

Announcements on time

Residents of Varadharajapuram say announcements should be made in advance regarding the meets. As the announcements are made at the last minute, there is no much participation from the members of the public.

Though, the meets are chaired by the government officials, no action is taken regarding the petitions submitted at the meets. It is only after periodical meetings and submission of petitions to the District Collectorate, Block Development Office and Rural Development Executive Engineer, the issues are solved.

Secondly, as per the rules, the petitioners should be informed on the action taken regarding the petitions before or at the next gram sabha meet, which is not followed, residents complained.

A sign of hope

For the first time in the history of Moovarasampet Village Panchayat, the first Gram Sabha meet of this year was chaired by the Alandur MLA T. M. Anbarasan, which residents term it as a ‘sign of hope’.

For years, the meet just used to be an eye-wash. This meet shows signs of improvement. He has committed to do many things in the Moovarasampet region and has said funds will be allocated based on the petitions. This is a welcome move, the residents pointed out.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/awareness-plays-a-key-role/article30770989.ece
334,2020/02/08,‘Provide us with signages that we can see’,"Signages with reflective boards are an important feature of a neighbourhood. No surprise that residents of Rajaji Nagar and Sadasiva Nagar at Madipakkam want them in their colony.

In particular, residents have asked officials of Greater Chennai Corporation for installation of blue-colour reflective name-boards. Except for Rajaji Nagar Main Road, none of the other stretches in the locality have such name-boards.

The names of the streets were painted on the walls, and over the years many have also erased.

“People coming to our colony for the first time find it very difficult to find the address of their friends and relatives,” says M. Anbalagan, president, Madipakkam North East Residents’ Welfare Association (MANERWA).

Those who are tech-savy find the address by either using GPS or through Google Maps, he said.

The association comprises residents of Sadasivam Nagar, Ram Nagar (South) and Rajaji Nagar.

“On Rajaji Nagar Main Road, we have installed a street name board; and two sign boards at Kubera Nagar and Ram Nagar Ninth Main Road. Work on installing street name boards at Ram Nagar was undertaken as part of grid work years ago. Under the grid work, work to lay roads, install stretch lamp posts, and construction of walkers path and storm water drain are taken up,” he said.

Slope height

Residents are also miffed with the construction of ramps that are not in keeping with scientific standards. They complained that outside residential homes and apartments sloped pathways have been constructed at an elevated level in the walkers’ area.

“It is quite risky to walk on the sloped pathways. The pathways have been constructed up to the carriageway from the gates of the residential homes and apartments,” said Anbalagan.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/provide-us-with-signages-that-we-can-see/article30770961.ece
335,2020/02/08,EFI restores a pond at Pattaravakkam,"What was once nothing short of a dump yard today sports a clean look, thanks to the efforts taken by the members-volunteers of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), who have restored and revived the ‘Pidari Ponniamman Pond’.

The pond is located south of the railway tracks near Pattaravakkam railway station and adjacent to ‘Pidari Ponniamman’ temple.

Speaking, Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, EFI, says, “ The Pidari Ponniamman Pond was E.F.I's 94th restoration effort. The pond was dumped with construction debris and non-degradable trash. The shallow levels of the water body meant that water storage was at its minimal levels.”

“ After obtaining necessary permission from Greater Chennai Corporation and funding from Rotary Miraki group to take on the scientific revival works of the water body. Based on a pond pre-restoration study, the problems associated with the water body were identified and thus a revival plan drawn. “

The pond's water holding area was deepened across the contour to increase storage capacity. A recharge well at the primary level followed by a secondary storage percolation pit and a shallow balancer rim supported by a newly established embankment was facilitated, he pointed out.

The entire pond circumference has a raised dual bund which supports the deepened pond. The outer circumference of the pond has defence fencing and the periphery has a Miyawaki forest planted with fencing protecting it. The inlet pipes have also been regulated to ensure inflow during monsoons.

Apart, steps were taken to stop discharging sewage and dumping trash. The water body received good flow of water during the North East Monsoon.

336,2020/02/08,Silt from Adyar dumped in hockey field,"Residents of Kotturpuram are irritated about the dumping of silt at a hockey playground located on Canal Bank Road, Gandhi Nagar, Adyar. The Water Resources Department, is deepening and desilting the Adyar River. As per the norms, the desilted silt will be used to form or strengthen the bunds.

Instead of strengthening the bunds on the banks of Adyar River running adjacent to the playground, the WRD has dumped the silt on the ground, residents complain.

“This is one of the few properly-maintained hockey grounds with good and proper surface and pitch in the city. It is maintained by the Greater Chennai Corporation. For weeks, the desilted silt from the river is dumped on the ground. As a result, we (the players) are not able to practise as we used to do earlier. For the time being, we are undergoing training sessions at a playground adjacent to the hockey ground, where people play outdoor sports,” a few hockey players complain. Besides, the residents have requested the GCC to clean the ground and deploy a security guard. In the absence of security personnel, the ground becomes an open bar for the tipplers after sunset and is misused by anti-social elements. The facility is a boon to young hockey players. It will be good if steps are taken to clean the playground and appoint a security guard at the earliest. The silt is dumped on the playground from the river side through earthmovers.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/silt-from-adyar-dumped-in-hockey-field/article30770660.ece
337,2020/02/08,TANHODA is setting up parks at Gopalapuram and Vannarapettai,"Fifteen months after the inauguration of Horticulture Park in Madhavaram, Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency (TANHODA) is setting up two other parks in the city. They are coming up at Gopalapuram and Vannarapettai.

The Gopalapuram facility will be named after the State flower of Tamil Nadu, Senkanthal, and the park will be called Senkanthal Poonga. The drought-tolerant flower, which is also known as Kathigai Kizhangu, is said to have medicinal properties.

“The park is being developed on a parcel of seven acres. A two-km pergola walkway, a children’s play area, an amphitheatre, an outdoor gym, and a stage for yoga are among the facilities that will come up at the park in Gopalapuram,” says N. Subbaiyan, Director, TANHODA.

With respect to the Vannarapettai facility, a heritage museum and a park for indoor plants are being developed.

“Here, the redundant Government Agricultural Engineering Workshop is being given a new lease of life and it will be turned into a museum which will depict the evolution of irrigation in Tamil Nadu. It was an industrial workshop established in 1920 by the erstwhile Madras Presidency. The facility promoted mechanisation of agriculture. The machines at the facility, which are obsolete now, are being sandblasted. Some of them were imported from the United States of America,” says the Director.

In 1948, the workshop was renamed Agricultural Engineering Workshop by the Industries & Commerce Department and was taken over by the Agricultural Department in 1958; and when Agricultural Engineering Department was formed in 1981, the workshop was brought under its purview the same year. The facility was closed down in 2002 and in 2019, the Agricultural Engineering Department handed over the workshop to TANHODA which is now turning it into a museum.

Other facilities that will come up along with heritage museum is a walkway, amphitheatre, aquarium, children’s play area and a food-court. Besides, there will be an outlet selling various products of TANHODA including seeds, saplings, and chocolates.

Further, endangered tree species native to India will be planted. They include Khair, Bel, Saptaparni, Ankol, Agar, Hingan, Bhojpatra, Salai Guggul, Chironji, Palash, Dhup, Shisham, Amla, Kokam, Dikamali, Gamar, Kutaja, Chaulmoorga, Hapushaa, Jarul, Milada Lakadi, Nagchampa, Champa, Bakul, Narkya and many more.

TANHODA is also setting up another park at industrial estate in Guindy which will be owned and maintained by Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board (TNSAMB).",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a9sdf3/article30770488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09DCADYRVANNARAPETTAITANHODA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tanhoda-is-setting-up-parks-at-gopalapuram-and-vannarapettai/article30770496.ece
338,2020/02/08,Police vehicles hinder traffic flow at Vadapalani junction,"A 50-metre section on Arcot Road, from Vadapalani junction to the police station, can be seen occupied by vehicles. It includes vehicles of the police department and the ones seized by it. This narrows the road space and motorists from Jawarharlal Nehru Main Road find it difficult to take a left turn at the junction. In contrast, Vadapalani police station is spacious enough to accommodate these vehicles.

“Due to these vehicles, we are unable to see pedestrians from a distance,” says V. Prabhakaran, a resident of Virugambakkam.

With no proper traffic regulation especially at the ‘U’ turn, which is around 50 metres away from the Vadapalani junction, the spot turns chaotic. Interestingly, the Vadapalani police station is located at the junction with a few traffic policemen regulating traffic at the junction on the Arcot Road round the clock. However, the ‘U’ turn spot is not regulated and safety rules are violated.

Vadapalani junction is a busy as many educational and healthcare institutions are located in the vicinity.

In October 2017, a new traffic arrangement was introduced at the Vadapalani junction y which motorists from Kodambakkam (on Arcot Road) proceeding towards Porur or Koyambedu have to turn left at the Vadapalani junction and then take a ‘U’ turn under the new flyover and can either proceed straight (to Koyambedu) or take left at the Vadapalani junction near the police station to go to Porur.

Likewise, motorists from Ashok Pillar proceeding towards Kodambakkam can take a right turn at the Vadapalani junction via the service lane under the new flyover.

Besides, motorists from Virugambakkam should go straight to access Kodambakkam. Those who want to go to Koyambedu and Ashok Nagar should take a left turn and right turn respectively. Further, motorists coming on the service lane from Koyambedu and who want to access localities beyond Vadapalani bus terminus are supposed to take a ‘U’ turn under the flyover at the Vadapalani junction. Sources from the police say that steps will be taken to relocate these vehicles.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/m59qns/article30770464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09dctngrVadapalaniJnJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-vehicles-hinder-traffic-flow-at-vadapalani-junction/article30770465.ece
339,2020/02/08,Defunct traffic signal creates chaos,"For the past many weeks, the traffic signal at the intersection of Dhandapani Street and Sivagnanam Street on Venkat Narayana Road in T. Nagar is defunct, leading to chaos at the intersection, especially during rush hour. According to the police, the electrical wires connecting the traffic signal got snapped due to the stormwater drain work. Further, a row of cars can be found parked along the road, that is from the intersection to TTD temple. This has narrowed the road.

“Vehicles are parked on the footpath as well,” says K. Dinesh, a resident of T. Nagar. A Greater Chennai Corporation official says, “Due to the stormwater drain work, there isn’t enough parking space as of now.

Therefore, a section of the stretch, especially at the entrance of the playground, has been allowed to park vehicles.

340,2020/02/08,Delay in relaying road in Saligramam irks residents,"Delay in relaying the Devaraj Nagar Main Road at Dasarathapuram in Saligramam (Zone 10 - Kodambakkam) is giving a tough ride for motorists. According to residents, it is weeks since the road was milled but the Greater Chennai Corporation has not yet started the road-relaying work. After the milling, foot-high manholes of water pipes of CMWSSB (Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board) could be found protruding on the road. Six months ago, the storm-water drain on the road was widened. Since then road is in a bad shape, say residents. The footpath is also usurped by dumping the milled bitumen.

The Devaraj Nagar Main Road connects the lanes in Chinmaya Nagar with Arcot Road at Vadapalani via Dasarathapuram. Therefore, many residents take this road. Residents also complain of dust due to continuous flow of vehicles.

In this regard, Corporation officials say that the needful will be done to relay the road at the earliest.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nzct49/article30770435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09dctngrSaligramamJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/delay-in-relaying-road-in-saligramam-irks-residents/article30770437.ece
341,2020/02/08,‘Hello’ from the other side,"These are unlikely RJs — they are silent for most part of the interaction. Even as the one-hour discussion draws to a close, their answers are still marked by some tentativeness.

So, there are the three of them — Manimegalai, Fathima and Vimala, drawn from a crop of new “recruits” at Anna Community Radio, being run from the Educational Multimedia Research Centre (EMRC) at Anna University.

Around three months ago, they were spotted during a “recruitment” drive by Anna Community Radio station. They had no prior training in radio, and that worked to their advantage. The biggest advantage was that they were from areas that fall within the range covered by Anna Community Radio. Manimegalai and Fathima are from Venkatapuram in Guindy; and Vimala is from Pallikaranai. Selvakumari, associated full-time time with Anna CR points out that the low-powered, 50-watt station — which is what community radios are meant to be — can be heard by residents even in areas close to Sri Balaji Dental College & Hospital at Pallikaranai, to explain why Vimala was roped in.

Welcome to he world of community radios run by the community, for the community.

These three are called community-volunteers, and they are part of 50-member team that broadcasts programmes for people within a 15-kilometre radius. Selvakumari explains they would be scripting the programmes with the support of subject matter experts, with their assistance particularly sought when the programme is based on a niche subject and requires nuanced treatment.

The community volunteers receive a honorarium for every programme they handle.

Woman and Children’s welfare forms the larger focus of the programming. Notable programmes in this genre are Magalir Neeram (which won an award from the Information & Broadcasting Ministry in 2014) and a programme on children’s rights, Selvakumari points out.

“When Anna Community Radio was launched in 2004, a baseline study was carried out, thereby mapping all the areas that came under its coverage, and through interactions with residents, an idea about what programmes would connect with them emerged,” says Vinod Rajesh, production assistant at EMRC.

Anna CR has been tying up with government agencies as well as other organisations known for serving society — notable examples include Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society, and Adyar Cancer Institute — for programmes.

“There is also the practice of general programmes being shared among community radios from across Tamil Nadu,” says S. Gowri, director, EMRC.

Since 2004, the station has been periodically recruiting community volunteers who would take these programmes to the community.

That takes us to Malliga Kaliappan, a reluctant recruit, who got in on the ground floor. A resident of Kotturpuram, she was recruited 16 years ago around the time Anna CR was launched.

Even after she went on air, she was unsure about how suited she was for this role, and this diffidence continued until an unexpected validation came her way.

“When my husband was travelling through nearby Kottur, he tuned in to Anna CR, and I was on air, presenting a programme about nutrition, and he was struck by the poise with which I handled the discussion,” laughs Malliga.

She explains that being a programme presenter did her self-confidence a world of good, and she went on to complete higher studies in yoga.

Even today, Malliga may not be that quintessential radio jockey, who are expected to speak a-mile-a-minute, and come up with snappy wisecracks at will.

But she represents the reason one should persist with the community-radio concept despite the various issues plaguing it. Her experience shows how it can build people from the community.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sngiav/article30770333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09dcCommonPage4CommunityRadio2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hello-from-the-other-side/article30770334.ece
342,2020/02/08,A natural synergy,"The Kotturpuram MRTS station proves “The Law of Synergy”, which suggests that you don’t get too far unless you match steps with the like-minded. Joint initiatives can also bog you down, unless these initiatives develop organically, and aren’t forced.

Over the years the MRTS station has been witness to initiatives that have achieved degrees of synergy, intended as well as accidental.

Miyawaki move

Right now, a remarkably huge open government land close to the the Kotturpuram MRTS station forms the focus of a Miyawaki urban afforestation exercise, started by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). While finding a space for any greening exercise is today a steep challenge, the Corporation seems to have chosen right by going in for this one, as it was overrun with construction debris, and made for a less-than-pleasant sight. By virtue of proximity, the space was not helping the look of the MRTS station. By clearing the debris and starting raising a Miyawaki urban forest, the Corporation could start an promising greening exercise in the heart of the city and also help Southern Railway’s cause.

Taking a cue

Taking a cue from Nizhal volunteers who had been engaged in a greening exercise at the station, auto drivers at what is called the “Kotturpuram-MRTS CITU auto stand” have started their own greening exercise, near where they park their vehicles.

Raghu, an auto driver, says that they received tree-planting technical guidance from Nizhal volunteers. They however went through the whole process and made their own decisions, which includes an innovative upcycled tree guard.

“We would have planted around 10 saplings and some of them failed. So, we took extreme care with the last exercise,” states Raghu. The last effort includes three saplings — syzygium cumini (naval pazham), terminalia catappa (Indian almond) and a pongamia pinatta — that stand protected by tree guards made of discarded concrete fences. Raghu explains that they found them lying in a space nearby. Smart upcycling indeed.

Old initiative

On the right side of the the main entrance to the station, there is a stand of trees, the result of a greening exercise carried out around eight years ago.

“In 2007, Nizhal started a tree-planting initiative at MRTS in partnership with the Southern Railway. The greening activity at the Kotturpuram MRTS station was carried out around eight years ago,” says Shobha Menon, founder-trustee, Nizhal.

Though any patch of green is always pleasant to the eyes, the garbage and squalor characterising the space where the stand of trees is found seems to take away from the effect.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1oyv4e/article30770302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09dcCommonPage5AutoStandSaplingsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-natural-synergy/article30770307.ece
343,2020/02/08,We can still go gaga over community radio,"A superficial view of the community-radio landscape can fuel despondency. R. Sreedher — media analyst and community radio practitioner, and the one who established Anna Community Radio, which he calls the “first licenced community radio in the country” — presents numbers that show how short we are of the projected target.

“Around the time community radios made an advent in India, we envisaged that there would soon be 4,000 community radio stations across the country. At present, there are only 262 community radio stations, and that says it all,” says Sreedher.

Community radios are up against great odds, and he clinically lists one after the other, yet he would not write them off. He believes community radios meet a need, and that there is a need to persist with them, exercising patience.

Now, the challenges.

“Community radios are low-powered, 50-watt stations and I call them mosquito stations. There are many community radios that grapple with the problem of poor reception due to their location. There are community radios that will do better with wider coverage. There is a special provision whereby extension up to 250 watts can be allowed, but in the 16 years that they have been around, no community radio station has received the benefit of this provision. There is the problem of delay in application processing. In the process that moves from application to acceptance, there are two stages in which the I&B ministry is involved; and four stages where the telecommunications ministry is involved. The telecommunications ministry is struggling with huge manpower shortage, and community radios are the least of their concerns. Then there the problem of a narrow advertisement window – an average of just seven minutes of advertising per one hour of broadcasting,” says Shreedhar.

Now, the reasons to soldier on, despite the challenges.

“One has to travel into the hinterlands of the country to understand how community radio empowers certain sections of people through niche programming. And, there are some that survive on little and still fulfill their mission. He cites the example of Radio Muskan, a community radio in Kandhamal. There are just 100 shops there, and Radio Muskan survives by getting advertisements from them, each shop charged at just Rs. 100 for one month of advertising,” he explains.

However, he understands that in this day and age, when diffusion and adoption of new technologies happens at the rate of knots, community radios can’t be a stick-in-the-mud for long and still expect to survive the digitial explosion.

He says: “In the next four to five years, community radio should become digital. By that time, radio itself would have become visual with images and text being part of what is broadcasted as a radio programme. Community radio should turn into visual radio.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4ayjgj/article30770261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dtquote1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/we-can-still-go-gaga-over-community-radio/article30770262.ece
344,2020/02/08,"TUCS shop razed, residents trek 2 kilometres for rations","The shifting of a civil supplies shop on Rameswaram Road in T. Nagar without notice has caused hardship to consumers.

Card holders of shop no. HC 007 were told a few days ago that the shop had moved to Mambalam High Road, half a kilometre away.

Consumers were told that the shop would be rebuilt soon. But residents say the big textile shops would encroach on the government land.

“We are all suffering. The ration shop caters to residents of Sarojini Street, Ramanujam Street and Mahalakshmi Street too,” said S. Parthasarthy, a 78-year-old resident of Motilal Street.

Since 1982 he has been purchasing items from this shop. “How can they suddenly shut down the shop without any prior notice? All it required was to pave the path to the shop. It wouldn’t have been an expensive job,” he said.

The civil supplies shop was added to the Triplicane Urban Cooperative Society shop in the premises. “The TUCS has existed for over 50 years,” he added. Parthasarathy said the officials told him that a new shop measuring 500 sq ft would come up in three months’ time.

But he is not convinced as already a textile shop in Ranganathan Street had built a five-storey structure behind the shop to house its employees. “The road width is only 25 ft and such activity by several textile shops has caused hygiene and sanitation problems,” he said.

Chitra, a domestic help in several houses on Rameswaram Road was resigned to her fate. “The new shop probably helps residents in that neighbourhood. Now I have to walk a longer distance and carry the heavy load of rice and other provisions,” she rued.

V. Santhanam, a resident of Mahalakshmi Street and Exnora International secretary, said he and his 82-year-old brothers bought their rations form the shop. “Even middle aged people find it difficult to trek home with our rations of rice and other materials. Autorickshaws also refuse to ply the stretch,” he said.

According to him residents’ protests had prevented the move eight months ago.

Last year when a portion of the shop on Rameswaram Road was demolished the debris was left in the premises. Hema R, a 77-year-old resident of the Street, said she had tripped and fallen over the rocks breaking her knee cap. It took her eight months and an expensive surgery for recovery.

V.S. Jayaraman, president of T. Nagar Welfare Association, said the new structure on Mambalam High Road itself was an encroachment. “There are two shops – 7 and 9. The shifting of shop 7 has inconvenienced residents abutting South Usman Road,” Jayaraman said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tucs-shop-razed-residents-trek-2-kilometres-for-rations/article30770243.ece
345,2020/02/08,Vultures put in an appearance at gram sabha meetings,"Wouldn’t it be just fabulous if conservation were all about holding seminars in star hotels? A study here and a study there, and lo and behold, critically-endangered species are back from the brink. The hard fact of conservation points in an entirely different direction. It tells us conservation efforts can’t stay elevated above the everyday and the mundane.

The rarefied world of species research and strategy stands validated only in as much as it involves local communities in conservation efforts. Sometimes, this would mean passing conservation-related resolutions at gram sabha meetings.

That is no hyperbole here — many a time in the past and even now, there have been instances of resolutions being passed to get local communities to aid efforts to protect four vulture species found in Tamil Nadu whose numbers have been rapidly dwindling since the 1990s.

In fact, the district administrations of a few districts have issued directives towards this end. Residents of hamlets in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve as well as in the Nilgiris regions must be familiar with such resolutions at gram sabha meeting.

A forest official points out that four vulture species are found in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve — namely gyps africanus (white-backed vulture), gyps indicus (long-billed vulture), sarcogyps calvus (red-headed vulture), and neophron percnopterus (Egyptian vulture). In what may interest us more closely, there have been reports of Egyptian vulture sightings on the outskirts of Chennai.

“Forests with mountains that present a craggy typography are best liked by most vultures,” explains the forest official. “The Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve is characterised by such features. In fact, the vulture range includes the Nilgiris, the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Bandipur Tiger Reserve.”

A “Synchronised Vulture Survey 2019” was carried out in areas.

These vast patches with their vulture-friendly features are also the focal point of man-animal conflict, as hamlets nestle amidst them, and residents find themselves having to make choices that may promote biodiversity or bring it under strain.

Over the last decade, there have been instances of gram sabha meetings in Tamil Nadu passing vulture-conservation resolutions involving panchayats.

“The resolutions usually skim the surface and don’t go into the specifics,” says the forest official, adding that without the specifics being spelt out, little positive action can be expected.

What are the specifics?

“Reporting any incident where an animal carcass had been thrown in the forest is one specific. It is illegal to dispose of an animal carcass. Besides, there is the possibility of the carcass having diclofenac (though banned for veterinary use) or similar formulation that are extremely harmful to vultures. Another specific manner in which they can help is report sightings of vultures. But all these have to be clearly spelt out gram sabha and other such meetings and there should be follow-ups by conservation groups so that the messages are reinforced time and again,” says the forest official.

Subbaiah Bharathidasan of Arulagam, a conservation-NGO that works in these areas in connection with vulture protection, says, “At various times, during the last decade, three district administrations — Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris — issued directives that panchayats be asked, during gram sabha meetings, to cooperate in vulture conservation initiatives. How effective these resolutions are is a moot point, but the fact that the district administrations took cognisance of the issue did help spread awareness about it.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/euzf9n/article30770208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09dcVulturesGramasabha1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vultures-put-in-an-appearance-at-gram-sabha-meetings/article30770216.ece
346,2020/02/08,"Soon, a multi-level car parking at Thirumangalam Metro Rail station","Chennai Metro Rail will soon build a multi-level car parking facility at Thirumangalam Metro Rail station, to meet the increasing demand over the last few months.

According to officials of CMRL, they are considering building a facility that can accommodate about 100 vehicles. “Every day, nearly 10,000 people use this station and it is one of the busiest stations in the phase I project. The parking lot gets filled too soon during the peak hours and many commuters feel disappointed when they don’t have space to park their vehicles and if it continues this way, we may lose traffic,” an official said.

Thousands of people from Kolathur, Ambattur, Mogappair, Padi and other neighbouring areas reach this station and head to their workplace, especially to Anna Salai and Guindy, officials said. Also, there are many who also use this parking lot and walk down to VR Mall, sources said.

“There is some space allocated for commercial development inside the station premises and soon, it will be given out on rent to a firm. This multi-level parking will be built adjacent to it,” he added.

Only recently, CMRL opened a multi-level parking for two wheelers at Meenambakkam Metro Rail station. But it was started as a pilot project and the facility has a capacity to to hold only 10 vehicles. “We will continue to monitor it for a few more weeks and if we are happy with how it is used, we will think about extending it to other stations too, where it is needed,” the official said.

347,2020/02/08,"By year-end, city to go zero waste","The Chennai Corporation has drawn up a comprehensive programme for processing and disposing of the 5,000-plus tonnes of solid waste generated in the city every day, in a scientific manner.

The Solid Waste Department of the civic body has come up with various initiatives like micro-composting, generating biogas, installing incinerators and using plastic waste as fuel for cement industries to dispose of wet and dry waste. The various projects for disposing of waste have already begun, and are at different stages of implementation.

A senior Corporation official, revealing the plans set into motion for managing solid waste, said the aim was to create a ‘zero percent garbage city’ by the year-end. The senior civic official said that as part of ‘zero percent garbage city’, both Pallikaranai and Kodungaiyur dumpyards, located on waterbodies, would be “shut down”, and the legacy waste also cleared by June next year.

The civic body has already given a work order to a private agency for clearing the garbage pile at the Alandur dumpyard, which was shut down several years ago. Bio-mining at the dumpyard, located on the Tambaram-Velachery Main Road, is under progress. The bio-mining plant in operation at the Alandur dumpyard has helped segregate plastic waste and bio-manure. The plastic waste processed from the plant is sold off to cement factories for powering them. The senior civic official said a total of over 5,000 tonnes of solid waste was being generated in the 200 wards, covering 15 zones of the city, every day, with 2,550 tonnes of wet waste and 2,450 tonnes of dry waste.

The civic body has set up micro-composting centres for processing 350 tonnes of wet waste a day. Through vermi-composting, construction of well rings, and installation of biogas and bio-methanisation plants, more than 750 tonnes of wet waste is converted into fuel in a day. Biogas plants are functioning at the Perambur slaughter house and at Amma Unnavagams. The fuel generated from biogas plants is used for cooking at the Amma Unnavagams and powering streetlights.

The civic body has also issued work orders for bio-compressed natural gas plants at four locations, for a total capacity of 350 tonnes a day, at the old central asphalt plant in Anna Nagar, Madhavaram, Pallikaranai marshland and Sholinganallur, along with windrow processing (open-air aerobic process) at two places, for a capacity of 100 tonnes a day. Five locations, including the central asphalt plant, general stores on Wall Tax Road and the two dumpyards in Kodungaiyur and Pallikaranai will have facilities for processing garden garbage, with a total capacity of 400 tonnes.

Recovery centres

For dry waste such as plastic covers and other inorganic waste, the civic body has set up resource-recovery centres at 74 locations, and material-recovery facilities at 110 places, with a total capacity of 250 tonnes. With the trial run of the incinerator plant of 10 tonnes in progress at Manali, the civic body also plans to remove over 600 tonnes of waste in a day, by having six 100-tonne capacity plants at Athipattu, Sathangadu, Mylapore, Ayanavaram, Kodungaiyur and Pallikaranai.

348,2020/02/08,Raise a toast! Sula comes to a Tasmac near you,"Sula Vineyards, one of the largest wine producers in the country, has become the first national wine brand to be listed with the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac).

Sula’s premium and sparkling range will be offered for the first time through Elite outlets and select Tasmac shops. The cash-cow of the state government has 83 Elite outlets, of which 31 are in Chennai.

“We are excited to be the first and only national wine brand to be associated with Tasmac. As one of the top alcohol consuming States in the country, this step opens great avenues for the brand,” Rajeev Samant, founder and chief executive officer, Sula Vineyards, told The Hindu.

Sula has brought in six wine variants and will bring in two more in the next few months. Plans are afoot to introduce wines in the sub-₹1,000 range.

“We are working on it. We recently introduced India's first wine in cans (330 ml). We will study the market here and will bring in those products,” Mr. Samant said.

Tie-up possible

Sula Vineyards, which enjoys over 60% market share in the Indian wine market, is also evaluating options for a tie-up with a winery in Tamil Nadu.

“Talks are also on with Cumbum Valley Winery. We are going to take a look at it,” Mr. Samant said.

Talking about market opportunities in Tamil Nadu, he said, “In other States, more than 80% of wine is consumed in the capital city. We expect a similar pattern in Chennai. The rest [of the sales] will come from other towns like Coimbatore.”

A senior official of Tasmac said, “Last year, we had invited brands registered outside Tamil Nadu and Sula was the first to come and register.”

“Another brand called Fratelli Wines has also evinced interest and has submitted its application,” the official added.

In India, the bulk of wine consumption is in urban centres – Mumbai accounts for 32%, followed by Delhi NCR and its tech suburb Gurugram at 25% and Bengaluru at 20%.

349,2020/02/08,NGT stays construction of fishing harbour in Tiruvottiyur,"The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered a stay on the construction of a tuna fishing harbour in Tiruvottiyur for not obtaining prior environmental clearance.

The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta ordered that the construction work that is currently ongoing be stopped, and directed that a committee be formed to undertake a field inspection and submit the factual position within a month.

M.R. Thiagarajan, in his application, submitted before the Tribunal that the project, being implemented by the State Fisheries Department, fell under the CRZ zone-1, and any activity in the area could not be carried out without obtaining prior permission.

The applicant submitted that the Department began construction without obtaining environmental clearance or CRZ clearance, and sought a stay on the project. He submitted before the Tribunal that the project proponent had started dredging and reclamation work into the sea, without obtaining requisite permissions.

Mr. Thiagarajan submitted that buildings and other unauthorised structures were being constructed in the CRZ zone, and a road was also laid by filling sand, heavy rocks and other materials, causing severe damage to the marine ecosystem and the fishermen who depend on the sea for livelihood.

He further submitted that while the project proponent had applied for EC before the Tamil Nadu State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, the proposal was deferred for the reason that the Environment Impact Assessment Report and the Terms of Reference (TOR) were not satisfactory.

When the case came up for hearing, the Tribunal took cognisance of the documents placed on record by both sides, and ordered a stay on any construction activity for the project. The case has been posted for further hearing on March 26.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngt-stays-construction-of-fishing-harbour-in-tiruvottiyur/article30766510.ece

351,2020/02/08,Puduthangal lake near Tambaram gets a new lease of life,"After remaining neglected for years, the Puduthangal lake near Tambaram has got a new lease of life.

The waterbody, spread across 50 acres, was rejuvenated, thanks to the joint efforts of the Rotary Club of Madras, the Sun Foundation and the Care Earth Trust. Like several other waterbodies in the southern fringes of the city, the Puduthangal lake was contaminated by the release of sewage and the dumping of trash.

The completion of restoration was marked by a function held on Friday in Tambaram. P.N. Mohan, the club’s chairman, Lake Restoration Committee, said the lake was taken up for rejuvenation after a detailed survey by Care Earth Trust. The lake bund was improved for a length of 1,386 m.

Besides deweeding, efforts were taken to desilt the lake. Nearly 25,000 cubic meters of silt was removed from it. The waterbody is the main source for groundwater recharge in the neighbourhood, he said.

The club expects about 50,000 people to benefit from the project, as the water table is likely to improve in the coming months. Residents largely depend on groundwater for their needs. The water-holding capacity of the lake has been improved from 2.83 million cubic ft to 3.83 mcft.

The project was started to conserve waterbodies that were fast vanishing from the city. It may be recalled that the Rotary Club of Madras had earlier restored the Puducheri Keni lake near Sholinganallur. There are plans to take up rejuvenation of the Madambakkam lake.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8uukuq/article30766485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8THLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/puduthangal-lake-near-tambaram-gets-a-new-lease-of-life/article30766486.ece
352,2020/02/08,Early diagnosis key to cancer survival: experts,"In Japan, in the 1960s, a mobile endoscopy unit would ring a bell to announce its arrival on the street and people would queue up to get tested.

Japan, which has one of the highest incidence of gastric cancer in the world, has aggressively used the endoscopy technique to diagnose cancers.

Though the incidence of gastric cancers continues to be high in that country, the five-year survival following diagnosis now is 70%. Korea, which currently tops the list of gastric cancers, has also improved its survival rate.

Gastroentrologists from these countries say that higher survival rates is due to better education and screening of the population.

At the ongoing eighth Asia Pacific Gastroesophageal Cancer Congress in the city, experts from Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and the U.K. had only one message for doctors — when a person complains of stomach ache and comes back with the symptoms repeatedly, refer him to a specialist.

High incidence

Countries such as China, Japan and Korea saw high incidence of gastric cancers due to the high presence of H. pylori bacteria and dietary habits, said experts.

“The older generation consumed fish preserved in salt. Korea still has the same problem,” said H.K. Yang, director of Gastric Cancer Centre, Seoul National University Hospital.

India can learn from these countries to educate the public and pursue early detection programmes of high-risk populations, the specialists said

Though the presence of H. pylori in these countries was eradicated due to better sanitation, experts were concerned about a sedentary lifestyle causing newer kinds of cancers — those at the junction between the stomach and the oesophagus, common in western countries.

To a question on immunotherapy as a treatment protocol, Takeshi Sano, secretary general of the International Gastric Cancer Association, said that it was still in the early stages, but hoped that within the next 20 years, it would become the primary mode of treatment, dispensing with the need for surgery.

S.M. Chandramohan, president of EsoIndia, which is jointly organising the conference along with the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, said countries with high incidence of cancers had improved survival rates by raising awareness about the disease and educating people to seek treatment early. In Japan, the survival rate five years after the detection of cancer is 70%, whereas in India it is only 27%. This should change, since the incidence of the cancer in india is very low, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ch31va/article30766463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8THCANCER3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/early-diagnosis-key-to-cancer-survival-experts/article30766464.ece
353,2020/02/08,32 samples test negative for virus: Health Secy.,"Thirty-two of the 36 nasal, throat swabs and blood samples have tested negative for novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Tamil Nadu, while the results of four samples were under process, according to Health Secretary Beela Rajesh.

As of now, 17,000 travellers from China and other affected countries were screened for symptoms of nCoV at airports and seaports in the State. A total of 1,603 persons are under home surveillance, she told reporters on Friday.

Ms. Rajesh pointed out that 83 persons belonging to Tamil Nadu, who were among those flown from China and quarantined in Delhi, tested negative for nCoV.

Condition stable

Presently, 11 persons were under observation in isolation wards in the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, and government medical college hospitals at Tiruchi, Tiruvarur, Kanyakumari and IRT Perundurai. She said that the condition of all 11 was stable.

“We have lifted samples from persons suspected to have symptoms. In case of a positive result, we will launch contact screening. As of now, we have regular surveillance and awareness activities,” she said in reply to a question about two city students, who were admitted to an isolation ward. “Seventeen persons, including heads of departments, senior IAS officials, additional directors and doctors are on a two-day field inspection. They are visiting all isolation wards across the State and will check on adherence to protocols, assess preparedness and those under home surveillance,” she said.

The members were also visiting the five districts that share a border with Kerala, she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/32-samples-test-negative-for-virus-health-secy/article30766433.ece
354,2020/02/08,Is Stanley Hospital ready for nCoV patients?,"A rope tied across the hallway and a handwritten note attached to it sets the boundary for the isolation ward on the first floor of the six-storeyed New Tower Block of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. While the note declares it a “prohibited area”, a cross-section of doctors say the hospital missed out on crucial guidelines in ensuring infection control and safety of its own healthcare personnel when symptomatic patients started to come in.

The isolation ward now has four patients, including two Chinese nationals, under observation for symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV), but the hospital was not prepared to handle them, said the doctors.

Some of them, including residents, went on to air their grievances in writing on Friday. While expressing their readiness to work, they demanded proper isolation and quarantine wards, as per Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organisation guidelines, and adequate safety equipment for all healthcare workers at the hospital.

A congested space

On February 5, two Chinese nationals who approached the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) for screening were sent to the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, and later admitted to its isolation ward, close to midnight. Two city students, who had returned from China, reported to the hospital with cold and cough, and were admitted for observation.

The hospital is known for the heavy inflow of patients and their attendants, and remains congested for most part of the day; the New Tower Block is no exception. It houses trauma, casualty and emergency departments on the ground floor, while the first floor, where the isolation ward is located, also has the intermediate care unit and new admission ward. The remaining floors have wards of departments including medicine and nephrology, said doctors.

“This is no place for having an isolation ward. We have hundreds of persons walking in and out everyday. By not ensuring proper arrangements, we are putting the lives of healthcare workers, patients and visitors at risk,” a doctor said.

To start with, doctors claimed that the erstwhile dengue ward was haphazardly fumigated and converted into a ward for nCoV, without proper arrangements in place. The patients were triaged into the common admitting ward, along with other newly-admitted patients of the day, where they remained for several hours before being shifted to the isolation ward, he added.

“Only one lift works at night. The patients were taken in the common public lift. In fact, one of them was taken through the common pathway to the X-ray room, with utter disregard for infection control,” another doctor said.

“We are ready to work in the isolation ward. But we have stated that we will not work until they provide us proper personal protective equipment. On the first day, some of the doctors on duty were given kits meant for handling HIV/AIDS patients. No N95 masks were provided,” a junior doctor said. A few hospital workers who had access to the isolation ward were spotted wearing regular masks.

A health official said the two Chinese nationals were sent from RGGGH to the Stanley Hospital, as the isolation ward in the former was being fumigated. The official said that all arrangements were in place and adequate personal protective equipment was available. Hospital authorities said that there was no reason for such apprehensions, and that they were taking adequate safety measures.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lavm8d/article30766421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8THSTANLEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/is-stanley-hospital-ready-for-ncov-patients/article30766422.ece
355,2020/02/08,"Woman priest storms male bastion, solemnises wedding in Chennai","Perhaps in a first in this part of the country, a woman priest solemnised a wedding following Hindu rituals and religious practices duly in Chennai on Friday.

Much to the pleasant surprise of relatives and friends, the woman performed the rituals of two communities to solemnise the wedding of Sushma Harini, a Telugu, and Vignesh Raghavan, a Tamilian, at Dakshin Chitra on the city outskirts.

When the advocate bride insisted on women priests and musicians at her wedding, her parents had a tough time making the arrangements. However she, along with her fiancé, managed to find a Vedic scholar and wedding priest in Bramaramba Maheshwari of Mysore, who agreed to conduct the wedding.

But the family did not find an all-women musical troupe to play the traditional nagaswaram and mridhangam.

“The woman priest did a good job. She not only performed the rituals followed in Hindu weddings well but also explained the significance every sloka/mantra to the bride and groom in English. Initially, we were reluctant and it was a difficult decision since even we haven’t heard of a wedding being solemnised by women priests. But it turned out to be a very happy occasion for all us,” said Ms. Sushma’s father Suresh Reddy, also an advocate.

Mr. Reddy said relatives and friends who attended the marriage were satisfied with the abilities of Ms Maheshwari and many took her contact details.

Ms. Sushma said there were instances of a woman priest conducting wedding in Salem, but it was within a particular sect.

“The profession of priest in marriages is a male bastion. So I wanted to change that perspective and make people realise that it is achievable. Woman priests do exist and we have to encourage by hiring them to conduct weddings.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lndxtc/article30766418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07WEDDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/woman-priest-storms-male-bastion-solemnises-wedding-in-chennai/article30766419.ece
356,2020/02/08,‘Every government school must have an art hub’,"Every government school must have an art hub where students can come to learn painting and other arts and exhibit their art works, said renowned painter Trotsky Marudu here on Friday.

Speaking at the release of line drawing workbooks titled ‘Holistic Education Beginners’ Line Drawing’ for students from Class I to V developed by artist N. Swarnalatha, he argued that the way arts classes are conducted now in schools, mainly government schools, must change. “The arts teacher goes to every classroom to teach. Instead, there must be a common space for arts where every children should come to learn,” he said.

Justice R. Mahadevan, judge, Madras High Court, said that learning to draw from an young age can help bring out hidden talents of the students and help them in holistic development. Highlighting the evolvement of different movements in paintings like neoplasticism and elementarism, he appreciated Ms. Swarnalatha for bringing out the book through which children can teach themselves to draw.

357,2020/02/08,Case against use of foreign species in Jallikattu,"The Madras High Court on Friday reserved its orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by a former wildlife photographer to prohibit the participation of foreign breeds (Bos Taurus) and cross breeds (Bos Taurus X Bos Indicus) in rural bull related sports such as Jallikattu, Manju Virattu, Oormadu, Vadamadu, Vandamanjuvirattu and Erudhu Viduthal.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan deferred their verdict on the petition filed by E. Seshan of Okkiyam Thoraipakkam here. The petitioner had claimed that only native species (Bos Indicus) should be allowed to participate in such sports because those animals would have the perfect hump required for the tamers to hold on to while playing the sport.

The petitioner pointed out that all rural bull taming sports have the common rule that the participant should hold on to the hump of a bull either for 30 seconds or until a particular distance or until it jumps thrice in an attempt to ward of the person holding on to its hump. It would be possible only with native species which have a substantial hump aligned to their front legs, he said.

358,2020/02/08,The high cost of raising trade walls,"India’s international trade posture appeared to turn protectionist in the past week, with two indicators the government sent out. The first, which played out live on television was contained in the Union Budget announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. The other, that went virtually unnoticed, was that India declined to attend a meeting of trade negotiators in Bali (February 3-4) that was discussing the next step in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement.

Laying out the Budget for the year, Ms. Sitharaman made several references to the problems with free trade and preferential trade agreements (FTAs and PTAs), raised tariffs on the import of more than 50 items, and changed the Customs Act provisions substantially to penalise imports suspected to originate from third countries.

Ms. Sitharaman told Parliament: “It has been observed that imports under Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are on the rise. Undue claims of FTA benefits have posed threat to domestic industry. Such imports require stringent checks,” adding that the government will ensure that all FTAs “are aligned to the conscious direction of our policy”.

While the motive may be to protect Indian markets from dumping — primarily by Chinese goods — the consequence of the changes will be to put Indian importers on notice and discourage imports in general. Describing a new chapter incorporated into the Act, the Finance Minister said the aim is to put “certain obligations on importers”, even as the government reserves the right to modify or cancel preferential tariffs and ban the import or export of any goods that it deems fit.

Rise in trade deficits

The government’s problem with FTAs was a key theme in its decision to walk out of the RCEP negotiations (of 16 countries) in November 2019, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his cabinet cited the rise in trade deficits with FTA partners. The government says it will now review all those agreements, in particular TAs signed with the 10-nation ASEAN grouping (FTA), Japan (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or CEPA) and South Korea (CEPA), and wants to “correct asymmetry” in negotiations with new partners.

This is easier said than done. If India makes a complete break with RCEP, as its absence from the Bali meeting indicates it is determined to, negotiating the bilateral trade agreements (TAs) will not be a priority for the other countries until RCEP is done. The process of legal scrubbing is likely to take most of the year, and any talks with India will probably only follow that. It is also hard to see any of them being able to offer India a better deal bilaterally once they are bound into the multilateral RCEP agreement.

The case of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) being negotiated with Australia, which Mr. Modi hopes to give a boost to when Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison visits, will be a difficult task, not the least due to its history. India and Australia began CECA talks in 2011. Mr. Modi and then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had even set a deadline of December 2015 to complete CECA. However, talks hit a dead end in September 2015. With the focus on RCEP, no progress has been made since then.

Tough road ahead

A similar scenario awaits the announcement of the India-United Kingdom FTA talks. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to visit Delhi in the next few months, while Mr. Modi heads to the U.K. in November for an environmental summit, and their bilateral bonhomie is expected to boost chances of an FTA post-Brexit. However, it is unlikely that the U.K. will actually be able to talk until next year, after terms for the U.K.’s full withdrawal from the European Union (EU) are completed.

For the same reason, India’s talks with the EU for a Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) are unlikely to make much headway this year, although they will be in the spotlight when Mr. Modi travels to Brussels for the EU-India summit next month. There, both sides will have to decide how to revive from where they left off in 2013. Making the negotiations harder is the government’s decision to scrap all bilateral investment treaties with 57 countries including EU nations, and bringing in a new Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) model in 2015. Only three countries: Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and most recently Brazil have agreed to sign a new investment treaty based on that model. Finally, there is the much anticipated resolution of U.S.-India trade issues ahead of the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump, expected in the last week of February that could also talks on an FTA. At present there have only been some “non-paper” talks on the issue, and given that the U.S. has expressed deep misgivings about India’s BIT model, these talks will also take several years to come to fruition.

No safety net

While the absence of a TA with any country does not mean that trade will not grow, other changes in the world trading order may become significant hindrances when added to this present scenario. The decline of multilateralism, accelerated by retrenchment of the U.S. and China’s intransigence have all meant the World Trade Organization (WTO) has lost steam as a world arbiter. This leaves states that are not part of arrangements without a safety net on dispute settlement mechanisms.

Second, the government has invoked the massive $57-billion trade deficit with China to explain protectionist measures, but it forgets its own trade surpluses with smaller economies, particularly in the neighbourhood, where Indian exports form more than 80% of total trade with Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, respectively. Even with Pakistan, before India cancelled most favoured nation (MFN) status and Pakistan suspended all trade, in 2019, India’s exports stood at about $2.06 billion of a total of $2.55 billion.

Rise of regional agreements

Third, it is clear that most of the world is now divided into regional FTAs, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for North America, the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR for its Spanish initials) for South America, the EU, the Eurasian Economic Union (Russia and neighbours), the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) FTA in West Asia, and now the biggest of them all, RCEP, which minus India, represents a third of the world’s population and just under a third of its GDP.

With the door to RCEP all but closed, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) virtually abandoned, India is not a part of any regional FTA. Finally, the trend across the world does not favour trade in services the way it does in goods, as most countries have turned migration-averse. India’s strength in the services sector and its demand for more mobility for Indian employees, is thus becoming another sticky point in FTA negotiations.

The debate over trade is as much about India’s leadership ambitions in the world, and the factors that could inhibit its rise. It would be hard to argue that India can rise in Asia without closer trade links with the East or the backing of South Asia.

India’s demographic might is certainly attractive for international investors, but only if that vast market has purchasing power and is not riven by social unrest and instability. Historically, the decline of colonial powers and more ancient empires can be traced to times when they turned inward and disengaged from foreign trade. It flows logically that in the modern, economically interconnected and technologically inseparable world, India’s global rise cannot but be accompanied by an open mind on trade as well.

In India, street vending makes up 14% of the total (non-agricultural) urban informal employment.

361,2020/02/08,Tax regime,"The writer, viewing the new tax regime through the political lens, seems unwilling to appreciate that it is part of the gradual long-term shift towards rationalisation and simplification of tax administration and compliance through the lowering of rates and phasing out of deductions except for essential savings such as Provident Fund and Pension Plans (Editorial page, “Complicating the tax regime further”, February 7). Savings should be need-based depending on the financial profiles of taxpayers. The principle,” from each according to his ability, and to each according to his needs” should guide investment decisions. The current tax rules commandeer the hard-earned money of taxpayers and misdirect it towards investments merely as a source of claiming tax deductions. For instance, the packaging of insurance as a savings instrument, especially by the LIC’s agent-dominated system, misallocates resources and fetches low returns for the investors who could have opted for a cheaper term insurance policy to ensure life cover.

Lifelong employment is a privilege limited to government service. The new tax regime expects future economic transformations to alter the job market in radical ways. The knowledge explosion would make the workforce bear the burden of re-skilling, re-learning, and job-hopping. A simple tax regime would help to prevent their precious earnings from getting locked away in unremunerative and needless financial products.

The government ought to be discussing pressing issues than name calling (Page 1, “Path chosen by you can led to anarchy, PM cautions Oppn.”, February 7).

363,2020/02/08,French food with Marc Delorme,"Marc Delorme fires instructions in impeccable Malayalam to the kitchen staff at Solo, the city’s only French restaurant.

The Frenchman’s accented Malayalam is sonorous and he speaks with charming ease. A curious query on his fluency brings forth a witty Pinne (Then What), before he breaks into laughter.

“It is the love of people that has kept me here for 26 years. I have just applied for an Indian citizenship,” says Marc, who set up Casa Maria, in Jew Town, 16 years ago. The first-floor restaurant with bright indigo walls was a head turner and the menu attracted curious diners.

Much water has flown since. Marc opened La Dame Rouge, a home stay in Ayampally in Vypin 11 years ago, and began conducting classes for women and chefs last year. “I teach them basic French cooking — sauces, pasta, pastry. Here they learn to make salads, cook fish, beef...” he says.

Marc’s interest in cooking began by assisting his mother in Lyonnaise, “the capital of French gastronomy.” His mother, he says, never repeated the same dish in a month, rustling up something new every time she bought provisions from the market. His family was large and included four Vietnamese adopted siblings. “Hence the food prepared at home was global.”

Cooking was not Marc’s first choice of profession; he studied jewellery design in Paris first. At 33, he veered to theatre, doing comic roles. This was followed by a desire to learn Kathakali and he took the plunge.

“That’s how I came to India first. I trained for three years at Vijnana Kala Vedi, in Aranmula.” The experience enriched him, he says, giving him a new definition of body language. “It was a plus for me.”

Marc says his life has been full of surprises. Just as he was settling into theatre, learning Kathakali, came an opportunity to open a French restaurant. He trained chefs, set up the menu and decorated the space in ways that were fresh and new to Kochi. It got him instant attention. Alongside he also opened two suites for visitors coming to Kerala, possibly being a pioneer in home stay tourism that bloomed a decade later.

And while all this happened, his love for the people and the land was growing. He began hunting for a place for himself. An old Tharavadu in Vypin drew him. “For two years, I wooed the owner to lease his home and finally he relented.” Marc set up a four-bedroom Kerala-style home stay, which his large family and extended family from France keep visiting. One of the curiosities of his home is retaining the traditional wood-fired kitchen. He teaches women and chef how to cook both French and Indo-French dishes on these stoves.

Marco’s idea of fusion is a French-style chicken roll stuffed with spinach-mushroom and bordered with Kerala spicy shrimps or Calamari stuffed with couscous and chilli lamb . His latest foray into food is as consultant to French restaurants. He is also writing a book — his selection of the best breakfast-and-dinner places in Kerala, based on three essential factors — quality, beauty of place and price.

Of his life in Kerala, he says, “I love my village, Vypin, and the people love me. My life here is a gift of God.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/french-food-with-marc-delorme-in-kochi/article30769166.ece
364,2020/02/08,Mumbai BJP felicitates cab driver who took poet-activist to police station,"Mumbai BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha on Saturday felicitated a cab driver who took a passenger to police station after overhearing a phone chat about the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.

The BJP MLA conferred “Alert Citizenship Award” on cab driver Rohit Gaur at the Santacruz police station.

Mr. Lodha also accused the passenger, poet-activist Bappadittya Sarkar, of hatching an “anti-national conspiracy” against the CAA.

“Rohit Gaur....who handed over the Uber taxi passenger devising anti-national conspiracy against the citizenship amendment act. Felicitated Rohit Gaur on behalf of the people of Mumbai calling him at the Santa Cruz Police Station and gave alert citizen award,” Mr. Lodha tweeted.

He also shared pictures showing him felicitating Mr. Gaur.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Sarkar was taken to police station by the driver of his Uber cab.

Mr. Sarkar, a resident of Jaipur who arrived in Mumbai on February 3 for a poetry reading session at the Kala Ghoda Festival, took part in the ongoing anti-CAA-NRC protest at Nagpada in Mumbai.

On Wednesday night, while traveling by an Uber cab, he was discussing protests against the CAA with a friend on phone.

Overhearing the chat, the cab driver called the police and urged them to arrest Mr. Sarkar. The poet was then taken to a police station and allowed to leave after an inquiry.

The driver allegedly told Mr. Sarkar that he should be thankful that he took him to police station and not somewhere else.

Mr. Sarkar later commented that the driver’s aggressive behaviour and violent language reflected the atmosphere in the country.

The 23-year-old poet also said that despite the ordeal he faced, he was not going to lodge a complaint against the driver as it might ruin his career and life.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bzm6r9/article30770568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/lodhajfif,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-felicitates-cab-driver-who-took-poet-activist-to-police-station/article30770396.ece
365,2020/02/08,"Fire at Navi Mumbai apartment, seven firefighters injured","Seven firefighters, including two officers, were injured while dousing a fire at a duplex flat in Seawoods Sector 44 on Saturday. The fire was reported from a duplex flat on the 20th floor of SeaHomes apartment near Podar International School around 6.10 a.m.

“The call came at 6.30 a.m. and by the time we reached, the flat was completely gutted. While dousing the fire, a cylinder exploded, injuring our officers who were rushed to hospital. All the residents are safe as they had been evacuated from the building using stairs,” said fire officer Arun Bhoir from Nerul fire brigade.

Inability to get water from the fire hydrant and low pressure of water reaching the 20th floor, took fire fighters nearly eight hours to douse the fire.

Chandrakant Bhansali, chairman of Wellwisher group, and owner of the flat, said he was making tea at that time. “It was around 6.15 a.m.. My wife Kalpana and son Abhijeet had woken up. My daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were still in their room. I was making tea when suddenly the electricity went off. I asked my son to check there was some tripping. When he opened the distribution board, he saw black fumes coming out and called me,” Mr. Bhansali said.

Mr Bhansali, who is also chairman of the society, saw that the wires were on fire and took a fire extinguisher to douse it. “The sprinklers in my flat had started while I was trying to douse the fire. Initially it seemed like I was succeeding. But the blaze started again and there was huge smoke. That’s when I felt that the situation was going out of control and asked my family members to rush out.” His wife Kalpana said, “We made a call to the fire brigade and hence have our mobile phone with us. Rest everything is gone. On our way down, we banged the door of every flat and asked them to rush out.”

By the time the fire brigade reached, the flat was reduced to ashes. Heavy wooden interior work acted as fodder to the fire, said a fire officer. Shimona, interior designer, and daughter-in-law of Mr. Bhansali said, “We just saw black smoke and ran out. We have no idea if the fire broke out in the wiring of the building or in our flat.” The flat had gas pipeline connection and while running out, they turned it off. But they also had two cylinders of which one was full. While the firefighters were dousing the fire, the cylinders burst, breaking a wall and injuring them. The sound of the blast could be heard at the nearby Podar International School too. The glass panels of the flat were broken for the fumes to escape. The windscreens of some vehicles parked on the podium broke due to the falling debris.

Mr. Bhoir said, “We faced parking issues as the roads were narrow. We had to first get the people to move their vehicles. The fire hydrant was not working and we had to source water from two adjacent buildings. Also, the water pressure was low by the time it reached the flat on the top floors. We had only one source of water through the stairs where we had connected fire hoses. Had the fire occurred on any lower floor, the time taken would have been less.”

The injured personnel — Vikas Koli, Ganesh Gade, H.B. Bhoye, Deepak Jawale, Shrimant Joshi, M.T. Pawar and P.A. Thackerey — are currently in National Burns Centre, Airoli. “They are out of danger and have suffered less than 20% burns, which are second degree injuries. Mr. Koli, Mr. Gade and Mr. Bhoye are in ICU for observation but are out of danger,” Dr. Sunil Keswani of the hospital said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ppn5m6/article30769113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/seawoods1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/firefighters-injured-after-fire-breaks-out-at-seawoods-apartment-in-navi-mumbai/article30769114.ece

A single bench of Justice Sandeep Shinde will hear her plea on February 11. Ms. Chudawala was booked under charges for sedition for raising slogans in support of JNU student Sharjeel Imam at an LGBTQ march in the city on February 1.

Ms. Chudawala contended that she was exercising her fundamental right to speech and the slogans raised by her were neither intended to, nor resulted in any violence or incitement to violence at the Azad Maidan.

367,2020/02/08,Women protesters at Mumbai Bagh to form committee,"Protesters at Mumbai Bagh have decided to form an all-woman committee to represent themselves before the authorities in the wake of political participants at the protests stirring a controversy.

The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA0, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) started on the night of January 26 and the women have been continuing it on a relay basis.

On Tuesday, following a meeting with State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, political leaders connected to the protest said they would call the protest off. The protesters, however, refused to flinch, saying the women had started this protest of their own accord and not on any political guidance.

Late on Friday night, Nagpada Police registered an FIR against the women who have been protesting since January 26.

Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said the FIR was registered on a complaint by Assistant Municipal Commissioner Alka Sasane with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

“We have booked 200 to 300 protesters for stopping the concretization of the Morland Road under the Indian Penal Code and the BMC Act,” Mr Ashok said

Earlier, Feroze Mithiborewala, member of the managing committee of Mumbai Bagh, said on Friday a committee of prominent women representatives would be formed. “On the first day of the protest, many political leaders joined us and asked why they were not informed about the protest. Subsequently, a committee was formed comprising local political leaders, but no women were included in it. We are now working to form a committee on the lines of the one in Shaheen Bagh and it will be finalised in a day or two,” he said.

Nadia Batliwala, a protester, said, “We will not call off the protest until resolutions are passed in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha against the CAA, NRC and NPR. Our fight is not against the State government but the Centre. We demand a written confirmation, not an oral assurance. We are clear about our demands and will stick to them.”

Ms. Batliwala said the women were never reliant on politicians and have already started seeking the requisite permissions from the police.

“The women who accompanied the politicians to meet the Home Minister were not even allowed to speak. Rather than talking about Mumbai Bagh, they were talking about Sharjeel Imam and the protest at Gateway of India,” said another protestor, who identified herself only as Aisha.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ll95ps/article30766621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/women-protesters-at-mumbai-bagh-to-form-committee/article30766622.ece
368,2020/02/08,Gay friendship proves fatal for Thane resident,"The much romanticised practice of making friends with strangers proved fatal for Thane resident Umesh Patil, whose body was found in Dombivli on Thursday morning.

Late on Thursday night, the Anti Extortion Cell of the Thane Police Crime Branch arrested Dombivli resident Praful Pawar for the murder. Officers said CCTV footage and cellular location mapping led them to the accused. Patil’s body was found in Dombivli (West) around 9.30 a.m. in a duffel bag and was identified on the basis of a missing persons report registered two days back by his sons.

A Thane Crime Branch officer said, “Patil and Mr. Pawar met on a local train around six months ago and exchanged numbers, after which they stayed in touch and soon got into a relationship. Patil visited Mr. Pawar frequently at his residence. Around three months ago, Mr. Pawar got married and severed ties with Patil.”

The rejection did not go down well with Patil, who repeatedly tried to contact Mr. Pawar. On Tuesday, Patil went to Mr. Pawar’s residence in Kumbharkhan Pada. Both had an argument which led to a fight, the police said.

“Mr. Pawar strangled Patil in the heat of the moment and later stuffed the body in a duffel bag which he discarded the garbage dump outside Railway Ground in Dombivli (West),” the officer said.

On scanning the CCTV footage police spotted Mr. Pawar on his bike and were able to trace his movement from his residence to the ground and back. They also mapped Patil’s cellular movements, which led them to Mr. Pawar’s residence, sources said.

“Mr. Pawar was arrested after preliminary questioning and handed over to the Vishnu Nagar police for further inquiries,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4olqfy/article30766612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BM-Praful-Pawar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gay-friendship-proves-fatal-for-thane-resident/article30766613.ece

370,2020/02/08,Three held for NCP leader’s murder in Sangli district,"The Sangli district police on Friday arrested three people, including a local Shiv Sena leader, for the murder of a member of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

Manohar Patil was found murdered in a field in Kavathe Mahakal tehsil late on Thursday. Authorities said Patil, a former chairperson of the Kavathe Mahakal Panchayat Samiti, was killed using sharp-edged weapons on a farm in Haroli village.

Within hours, the Kavathe Mahakal police took Sena leader Dinkar Balaso Patil and two others into custody and charged them with Manohar Patil’s murder. The police suspect a long-standing personal feud between Manohar Patil and Dinkar Patil to be the motive.

The Sena is in alliance with the NCP and the Congress in the State government.

This is the second such incident in Sangli district within a span of four days. Earlier this week, local NCP leader Anandrao Patil was hacked to death by two assailants near Khatav village in Palus tehsil, when he was returning from his farm on his motorcycle.

371,2020/02/08,Modern College cancels Tushar Gandhi’s lecture over ‘threats’,"Alleging threats of disruption from right-wing outfits, a city-based college cancelled a lecture that was to be delivered on Friday by Tushar Gandhi, the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, as part of a national seminar on Gandhian thought being held by the college.

In a tweet on Thursday night, Mr. Gandhi indicated that the right-wing outfit Patit Pavan Sanghatana had pressured the authorities of Modern College to cancel his talk, which was part of the seminar ‘Revisiting Gandhi’.

“Modern College Pune was forced to cancel a program scheduled for tomorrow celebrating the 150th anniversary of Bapu because they invited me, Patitpavan Sanstha threatened to disrupt the program if I was present. The Goli Maro Gang in Action (sic),” he tweeted.

The two-day seminar on the Mahatma, which started on Friday, proceeded without Mr. Gandhi’s lecture.

College authorities said they informed Mr. Gandhi on Thursday about the cancellation of his talk in the wake of letters from a number of outfits who had warned of protests if he delivered his speech. Authorities said they feared that protests could have an effect on the ongoing practical examinations and hence decided to call of Mr. Gandhi’s lecture.

Gajanan Ekbote, chairman of Progressive Education Society (PES) which runs Modern College, said, “Earlier this week, some students had approached the [college] principal with some video clips of Tushar Gandhi and claimed that his speeches were politically inclined and could generate negative sentiment. They also objected on grounds that events with a political colour should not be allowed given that the seminar was organised with funds from the Pune University.”

Mr. Ekbote said he had apparently assured Mr. Gandhi that the college would hold his lecture at a convenient date very soon.

The Patit Pavan Sanghatana, however, has categorically denied ever issuing any threat letter against Mr. Gandhi’s lecture. “We have never opposed Gandhian thought, nor have anything to do with the cancellation of Tushar Gandhi’s scheduled talk. We are not aware of this incident and have only come to know of this through the media. We will seek an explanation on this matter from the college and PES authorities,” Sourabh Pawar, a member of the organisation, told The Hindu.

The Savitribai Phule Pune University is funding the seminar under the under the Quality Improvement Programme.

372,2020/02/08,"SIM box rackets busted in Kerala, Noida","In an interstate operation conducted in collaboration with the Military Intelligence, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted two SIM box rackets being operated out of Kerala and Noida. Officers said both the locations are significant as Kerala has been in the news for increasing number of Islamic State (IS) recruits over the past two years, while another alleged IS module was busted in Delhi earlier this year.

A SIM box, which is capable of holding scores of cards at a time, routes international calls through a SIM card and helps the caller bypass the international calling rates. Another advantage of the SIM box is that calls made through it can not be traced or tapped and can hence be used by criminals or terrorists.

“While the rackets have caused losses running to thousands of crores of rupees to the national exchequer, the bigger concern is about the kind of people using them. With several recent examples of the IS increasing its presence in countries like India, SIM box calls can be used to plan an entire terrorist operation with authorities being none the wiser about what is brewing inside the country,” an officer with the Mumbai Police said.

According to Crime Branch officials, investigations were initiated in January after the Military Intelligence intercepted a call received by a landline number registered to an address in Mumbai.

“The call was actually made from Saudi Arabia but was reflecting in call records as a local call made from within India. We started a probe into the matter,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi said.

Over the next couple of weeks, the Crime Branch examined hundreds of call detail records and found that the same SIM cards were being used by different handsets at the same time, which was only possible to do using SIM box technology.

“We ascertained that there were two illegal telephone exchanges being run using SIM boxes, one of them in Noida and the other in Kerala. Teams were despatched to both locations,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I) Akbar Pathan said.

On Thursday, Crime Branch teams conducted simultaneous raids at both the locations and arrested one accused, identified as Hilar Mohammed Kutty (34) from Kerala. Mr. Kutty, who is being said to be the mastermind of the Kerala racket, has allegedly been running it since December 2017.

The Crime Branch has seized five SIM boxes and 675 SIM cards from Noida and three SIM boxes and 11 SIM cards from Kerala. The SIM boxes and the laptop connected to them are being examined to check for records of the calls made through them.

Information about a third such racket has also been received during inquiries, and teams are working on this information, sources said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jyho1i/article30766265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMSIM-box-racket,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sim-box-rackets-busted-in-kerala-noida/article30766236.ece

Sharda Govind Mali was found dead in her residence at Dundre in Panvel when her daughter-in-law had gone to call her for lunch on Tuesday. Based on a complaint filed by the woman’s son, the police booked five people, including a minor girl. On Friday morning, four of them — the minor’s parents and two other neighbours — were arrested. However, the girl has not been detained yet.

Ashok Dudhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone II, said the crime scene was confusing. “The victim had burn marks around her neck and shoulder, other than marks of hanging. The sari, which was removed from her before she was dressed in a blouse and petticoat, was found in the same room where she was found dead. The door was closed from inside but a window was open.”

He said they decided to register an abetment to suicide case and wait for the post-mortem report. “But the doctors are equally confused and have reserved the cause of death. Further investigations are on.”

Meanwhile, BJP leader Pravin Darekar on Friday met Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar and urged him to speed up the probe into the case.

“We have demanded that the guilty be given exemplary punishment. Crimes against women are increasing under the Maha Vikas Aghadi government,” Mr. Darekar, Leader of Opposition in the Council, told reporters after the meeting.

BJP MLAs Prashant Thakur and Ramesh Patil were also present when Mr. Darekar met the police commissioner.

374,2020/02/08,Money-laundering case: PMLA court sends Wadhawan to judicial custody,"Kapil Wadhawan, the promoter of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly having laundered gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s aide Iqbal Mirchi’s money, was produced before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Friday. He was remanded in judicial custody till February 18.

His lawyer Amit Desai moved the court for bail, and demanded that the ED produce the FIR registered for his examination. Mr. Desai argued that his client was always available in the city and had been cooperating with the agency.

He said that Mr. Wadhawan had even recorded his statement in the middle of the night.

Mr. Desai said the ED had summoned Mr. Wadhawan on December 3, 2019, and that Mr. Wadhawan had requested for another date, but he was denied. He also pointed out that the ED’s complaint before the court did not have any reference to Mr. Wadhawan or his alleged role in the case. “I could not find a single sentence,” Mr. Desai said.

He also questioned the manner in which Mr. Wadhawan was arrested on December 27, 2019, after being summoned to the ED office.

Mr. Wadhawan’s bail plea hearing will now continue on February 11.

375,2020/02/08,‘Internet shutdowns show lack of accountability’,"Shiv Sena leader and State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday said the absence of internet is an absence of accountability. Mr. Thackeray’s remarks come a day after Union Minister for Information Technology and Telecom Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed that the Supreme Court never said the right to internet is a fundamental right.

Mr. Thackeray also proposed an online Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) for Maharashtra, saying it will soon be implemented.

He was speaking at the inaugural session of the 23rd national conference on e-governance at Worli’s National Sports Club of India, hosted by Maharashtra this year.

In a veiled attack on the internet shutdowns across the country during protests, Mr. Thackeray said, “Protests for any reason whatsoever have to be heard, responded to, even through the internet. Absence of internet beyond a few hours can be chaos too.” Internet shutdowns during protests, he said, indicate an absence of accountability.

India has recently witnessed blanket internet shutdowns in parts of the northeastern States such as Assam, Nagaland and Uttar Pradesh in the wake of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Jammu and Kashmir has been facing a partial internet shutdown for the past six months since Article 370 was scrapped. Mobile services too are partially shut down in many places there. Mr. Thackeray’s statement is seen as clear disapproval of the Centre’s policies of shutting down access to the internet to curb protests.

The national conference was the first Central government programme organised in Maharashtra after the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Mr. Thackeray said the State government will soon have an online CMO, on the lines of experiments at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation level. “Mumbai has come online for an exchange of information and dialogue of citizens with the BMC and vice versa for small grievances and large projects as well as through its Twitter handle. Now the State will soon have an online portal and online CMO for the same,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray said e-governance is also an extension of democracy. As the largest democracy in the world, we must adopt e governance for transparency, accountability and efficiency beyond social barriers, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/internet-shutdowns-show-lack-of-accountability/article30766151.ece
376,2020/02/08,4 arrested for cricket betting,"The central unit of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested four people from a flat in Ghansoli for allegedly betting on an India-New Zealand cricket match.

A police team led by senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar, assistant police inspectors Nilesh Tambe and Sanjay Pawar, raided a flat at Calista housing society in Sector 8, Ghansoli, on Thursday.

Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray met a delegation from the industry and assured them of resolving issues related to partitioning (permit room) allowed on their premises and the legal drinking age. The relaxations were part of the ease of doing business norms announced by the previous government, but were never fully implemented. Restaurant and hotel owners said they face a huge challenge — while eating out is growing in popularity as a form of entertainment, stringent norms prevent them from catering to this growing clientèle.

“While a lot of needless permissions were done away with last year, there are pending issues related to the excise permit and partitions. We hope the government will take our demands into consideration and resolve these at the earliest,” said Dilip Datwani, immediate past president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India.

Earlier, Mr. Thackeray held back-to-back meetings with the hotel and events and entertainment industries. “This afternoon I met prominent people from the hotel industry in Maharashtra. We want them to thrive and grow. That will lead to growth in revenue and employment in the State … I also had a consultative session with the events and entertainment industry and those having venues. Ease of doing business and being the entertainment capital again is what we want to achieve to give a boost to tourism,” the minister said on Friday.

Last year, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had approved bringing down the legal drinking age from 25 to 21. He had also assured he would do away with drinking permits, as per the recommendations made in a report by Accenture, commissioned by the government.

Abolition of permit rooms and permits for drinking, joint grant of operational and construction permits in a single stroke and cutting down permissions from the current 142 to just 20 were among the other proposals the chief minister agreed to in principle. But the association said some of these are yet to be fully implemented in the State. Of the 71 permissions required at the operational level, many have been identified as insignificant and should be deleted, according to Accenture’s report. The report recommends that of the total 142 licences, 29 should be merged. The remaining 113 should be brought down to 20. Many of these steps are yet to be taken, the delegation informed the minister.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-ease-norms-on-drinking-age-permit-rooms-says-govt/article30766120.ece
378,2020/02/08,"Duo rape, murder 28-year-old woman in Santacruz, arrested","The Vakola police have arrested two people for allegedly sexually assaulting a 28-year-old woman and then killing her in the residence of one of the accused. The duo have been identified as Vinod Ghadi (34) and Sunil Kadam (35). Officers said Mr. Ghadi used to stay with another friend in a rented room in Santacruz (East), where the offence occurred.

“Mr. Ghadi came to the police station on Wednesday evening saying that he had reached home from work and found the body of a woman. We rushed to the house and took the woman to V.N. Desai Hospital in Santacruz, where she was declared dead before admission. We then started making inquiries with Mr. Ghadi, while a separate team started inquiring in his locality to identify the deceased,” an officer with the Vakola police said.

The officer said while Mr. Ghadi kept claiming that he had no idea who the woman was and that he had never seen her before in his life, inquiries with his neighbours revealed a different story, which helped nail his lie.

“Several of Mr. Ghadi’s neighbours told us that they had seen the woman visit him at his residence several times. Confronted with this information, Mr. Ghadi broke down and confessed to the crime. He said he called the victim to have drinks with him where Mr. Kadam was also present. During this time, both of them forced themselves on her. She, however, was fighting them hard and at one point, both of them held a pillow over her face for a long time and ended up killing her,” the officer said.

Based on Mr. Ghadi’s questioning and assistance from local informants, the police traced Mr. Kadam to Thane and brought him to the police station. Both of them were arrested and charged with rape and murder under the Indian Penal Code.

“Inquiries so far do not indicate the involvement of any others in the offence. Further inquiries are under way,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone VIII) Manjunath Singe said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/duo-rape-murder-28-year-old-woman-in-santacruz-arrested/article30766088.ece
379,2020/02/08,Who likes Spartacus?,"Madam, Sir,

Did you see the sad news? Kirk Douglas has left this world. Saddest of all sad news. Actor means Kirk Douglas. These days some idiot will grow one beard and wearing cooling glass means actor. But real actor means Kirk Douglas.

When I saw the news, I put one phone call to Dr. Shankaramenon. I said, “Doctor, doctor, I think Kirk Douglas has died.” He said, “Oho Mathrubootham, how many times I have to say just because I am doctor I am not god, ok no problem, what is the flat number? I will come and try something. Maybe I can try electric shock.”

I said, “Kamanatti rascal, porambokku karumam sori nayi paradesi muttaaal manda shiromani madaya, I am talking about great actor Kirk Douglas. You will go to Hollywood and give electric shock? Rascal, Hollywood police will shoot you and then put in electric chair. You enjoy the shock.”

Madam/ Sir, when you make friends during youth whether any warning will be there that they will turn into foolish people in retirement. Please ask science department reporter to find any solution.

Then I called Mohammed Usman in his shop. “Usman, Usman,” I said, “Kirk Douglas has expired.” He said, “Mathrubootham, is it some shampoo item? I will ask boy to replace. But shampoo and all you can use after expiry also. I am using one after-shave lotion since 1997.”

I said then, “Usman do one thing please, bring shaving lotion called Anthony Hopkins and perfume with name Audrey Hepburn.” He said, “Oho Mathrubootham! Upper-class lifestyle these days. Please send names on WhatsApp so that boy can buy properly.” “No problem, I will send,” I said. Then I recorded all the abuses in Tamil and Malayalam in one voice message and sent it to Usman. Enjoy Usman, foolish man.

Finally, I went to Mrs. Mathrubootham. I said, “Kamalam, the great Kirk Douglas has departed this world.” She came into room and said, “Yes, I know, old man. Whole day I am feeling sad. What a hero he was.” I said, “Too much hero. Scenes of Spartacus are still flashing in my mind after 60 years.” She asked, “What is your favourite film of Kirk Douglas?” I said, “Easy question, it is Spartacus.” She said, “Okay, what is your favourite film after Spartacus?”

I said, “I don’t know, I have to think. Which films you have enjoyed Kamalam?”

She said, “Spartacus was classic. But Lonely are the Brave is even better. And have you seen Lust for Life? Let us thank the god for all these experiences. It is a blessing only.” I said, “Yes, yes 100%.”

Then she said, “But old man, you tell me two or three good Kirk Douglas films you are liking, we can get DVD and watch together.” I said, “Kamalam, first of all, there is Spartacus, it is a classic.” Then she said, “Old man, how many times you will say Spartacus Spartacus. Everyone has seen Spartacus, whether you have seen any other film? Or you are fraud fan just putting big talks?”

Madam/ Sir, I immediately went into bedroom and closed the door and I said in loud voice, “Kamalam, how dare you say such things?” Then I went on Internet to urgently read Wikipedia entry of Kirk Douglas.

If he has only one super-hit film means it is my problem? Nonsense. Kirk Douglas and all too much hype.

Yours in exasperation,

380,2020/02/08,Notes from Armenia,"Picking an accommodation option that sits cheek-by-jowl with a primary school is always a risky proposition. One that is fraught with countless somnolence-threatening annoyances. From loud, early morning assembly calls and mid-day playground cacophony to afternoon marching band practice, the ultra-light sleeper in me has encountered it all.

But my recent stay at a family-run B&B in Yerevan — the pink-hued capital of Armenia — that shares a wall with one of the city’s most popular public schools, showed me another, more surprising facet to Armenian academia. One that struck a home run in more ways than one…

Chess in school

With one of the most ambitious school chess programmes in the world, the chess-obsessed nation has made the game a compulsory subject on the national curriculum. An initiative of the then Armenian President Sersh Sargsyan — who was also president of the Armenian Chess Federation — since 2011, children studying in grades two to four have two weekly chess lessons that are graded just like any other school subject. And just like the one next door, these classes are often conducted in school playgrounds that have sets of purpose-built concrete chess tables in a designated corner.

To keep up with this new demand, Armenia now has more than 4,000 qualified chess teachers in its school system, besides national champions like Levon Aronian as visiting faculty. The once number-two chess grandmaster in the world, also known fondly as Armenia’s David Beckham, today regularly coaches kids in chess at schools across the country. Interestingly, a 2009 BBC World Service report titled Armenia: the cleverest nation on earth shows that with its population of a little over three million, Armenia is among the world leaders in chess, with one of the highest numbers of chess grandmasters per capita.

Grandmaster Tigran Petrosian

So, where and how did it all begin for this Armenia-chess love affair? Curious, I visit the Tigran Petrosian Chess House — the ‘Ground Zero’ of all things chess in the Caucasian state. Nestled on Yerevan’s leafy Khanjyan Street and built in the early1970s in the typical Soviet brutalist architectural style, the building is named after the Soviet Armenian grandmaster Tigran Petrosian, who became the World Chess Champion in the 1960s.

Here, I learn that although chess was institutionalised during the early Soviet period, the country has always had a historical love of the game that goes way back to the Middle Ages. This was proved with the discovery of an ancient chess set in the citadel of Dvin, the medieval capital of Armenia, in 1967.

At Yerevan’s imposing grey basalt Matenadaran museum of manuscripts, a digital copy of Shatrang: The Book of Chess (1936) by Joseph Orbeli and Kamilla Trever tells me more as it augments the India-Armenia chess connection. Called chatrang, a word derived from the Sanskrit term chaturanga, which translates to ‘four arms’ (representing elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers), chess apparently came to Armenia from India via the Arabs in the 9th century, when Armenia was under Arab rule.

“Shakh yev mat,” is a victory cry I hear all of a sudden as I settle down with my 200-dram (₹30) blueberry softy cone at a bench outside the Moscow Cinema on Yerevan’s arterial Abovyan Street, next to a giant pedestrian chess set. But then, the Armenian equivalent of “checkmate!” is something I’ve been hearing at almost every public square and city park I’ve sauntered past in the last few days. There’s probably nary a public space in Yerevan that doesn’t have at least a couple of chess tables, with players of all ages hunched over an intense game of chatrang.

On a free walking tour of Yerevan, as a passing shot, our guide Varko lets us in on a little-known chess world secret. As it so happens, Garry Kasparov, the former Soviet grandmaster, and easily the world’s best ever chess player, is of Armenian heritage, though he was born in Baku, Azerbaijan. Apparently, his original surname was Kasparyan — with the ubiquitous finale of an Armenian surname, which usually end in “ian” or “yan”.

381,2020/02/08,A lab in the skies,"If you were to think of a laboratory in space, you would probably think about the International Space Station (ISS). A habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit, the ISS is a joint project by a number of space agencies and its usage is governed by treaties and agreements. The ISS, however, isn’t the first space station built by humans. There were precursors to it, one of which is the Skylab.

NASA had the idea for a space station for years before the Skylab was eventually launched. It was believed to be the dream of American-German space architect and Apollo rocket engineer Wernher von Braun, who had long wanted to build a human outpost that would let people live and work in space for extended periods of time.

Use unused hardware

With the space race and the mission to moon dominating the 1960s, the idea for a space station picked up pace only after that. NASA began an Apollo Applications Program to utilise unused hardware from their missions to the moon and one of the ideas to pursue was that of the space station.

The design evolved over the years and the Skylab consisted of four components. The Orbital Workshop (OWS) was the main compartment for living, working and sleeping; the Airlock Module (AM) allowed astronauts to conduct space-walks; the Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA) enabled rescue operations; and the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) contained telescopes for observations and solar arrays for additional power.

Repair work possible

Launched on May 14, 1973, Skylab was faced with a crisis right at the start. A micro-meteoroid shield that was to function as a thermal blanket and shelter Skylab from debris accidentally opened just over a minute after the launch. This meant that the temperatures inside the space station rose to intolerable levels.

While the launch of the first crew was delayed because of this incident, their first task eventually became to salvage this situation when they made their way on May 25. Even though it was no easy task and it was definitely frustrating for the crew members involved, they eventually succeeded after a few days. They were able to erect a sun shade, deploy the array that was previously stuck and begin their work inside the space station. It showed that it was possible for space-walking astronauts to fix badly damaged space stations while it was still in orbit.

Three successive three-man crews lived aboard the Skylab. While the first one – the ones who performed the repair – stayed in space for 28 days, those in the second and third crews lasted 56 and 84 days in orbit respectively.

Superhuman expectations

Skylab’s second crew were super productive in getting their tasks done, that they wanted more. So much so that it set unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved in space. By the time the third crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974, they had accomplished a lot of scientific work, but not before complaining of being overburdened with superhuman expectations.

Even though there were plans for more crews to be sent to Skylab, the third turned out to be the last as well owing to financial constraints and NASA’s other objectives. The three crews had managed to conduct 270 experiments in life sciences, solar astronomy and Earth observations. In fact, over 700 hours were spent observing the sun, resulting in over 1,75,000 solar pictures.

Intense solar activity heating up Earth’s atmosphere meant that Skylab’s orbit decayed faster than NASA’s expectations, forcing them to pursue the only course of action possible. They adjusted the station’s path so that it wouldn’t hit populated areas. Upon re-entering on July 11, 1979, it broke up in the atmosphere and showered debris over the Indian Ocean and Australia.

Skylab provided for plenty of learning, especially with respect to the human element in long-haul space-flights. The focus was placed strongly not only on the nutritional and physical exercise requirements for human beings in space, but also other mental concerns they might face, including those caused by their workload and the lack of family life. Thanks to the Skylab, all these areas are now addressed for astronauts aboard the ISS.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/x9rzs1/article30710865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09istbSkylabjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/a-lab-in-the-skies/article30710867.ece

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan, who also holds the agriculture portfolio, jointly inaugurated the farm festival.

Around 30,000 flowering plants raised in the three nurseries of the Agriculture Department will be on display. Experts from various fields related to agriculture and allied sectors will speak on subjects aimed at doubling farm income, Director of Agriculture Bala Gandhi said in a release.

Institutions such as the National Horticulture Mission, Agriculture Technology Management Agency, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru College of Agriculture and Research Institute, Karaikal, Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Krishi Vigyan Kendra and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Veterinary Education and Research will display their research works for the benefit of farming community, the release added.

Sale of flowering, medicinal and ornamental plants cultivated by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra will be on sale at the festival. Farmers can use the opportunity to procure bio-pesticides, tissue culture banana and other products at a subsidised rate.

Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu that the government had decided to organise the farm fest instead of the annual flower show as a means to cut expenditure. The department incurred an expenditure to the tune of ₹80-90 lakh annually to organise the flower show, he said.

387,2020/02/08,Space city: Thiruvananthapuram embarks on Space Revolution 2.0 with SpacePark Kerala project,"When the first sounding rocket rose to the skies from Thumba in the November of 1963, it marked the beginning of Thiruvananthapuram’s unique relationship with space technology. Nearly six decades down the line, the State capital is poised to jump-start Space Revolution 2.0 with the SpacePark Kerala project.

The spotlight is now on the Kerala government initiative that aims to attract and nurture space-tech firms and start-ups with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declaring his government’s intention to develop Thiruvananthapuram as the country’s ‘Space city’.

ISRO units

For this unique venture, the government is banking on the proximity and support of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) units in the region as well as the industry. Currently, SpacePark is in the process of establishing its campus at the Knowledge City, Pallipuram. It is also busy wooing start-ups and space-sector firms to Thiruvananthapuram to be part of what promises to be an intriguing journey.

Made up of two sub-verticals — a Nano SpacePark and the Space Tech Application Development Ecosystem (STADE) — SpacePark has already on board start-ups such as Agnikul Cosmos, Bellatrix and SatSure. Currently, it is in discussions with Digantara Research and Technologies, Pixxel, Kawa Space and Aadyah Aerospace, SpacePark special officer Santhosh Kurup told The Hindu.

The concept paper of the project describes Nano SpacePark as a space for units that provide services and products useful in space missions. STADE, on the other hand, focusses on the application/ICT side of the space industry. There is some distance to go before the park becomes full-fledged. “We need to establish the incubation centre for applications development, the facilities for start-ups and common facility centres and the hi-tech manufacturing facilities required for medium and small-scale enterprises,” Mr. Kurup said.

MSME-related activities will be established in 18 acres of land. APJ Abdul Kalam Knowledge Centre and Space Museum — a memorial to the former President that is a part of SpacePark — will come up on two acres of land. Space applications-related activities will be hosted in a 200,000 sq ft structure built by the Brigade Group on the Technocity campus. “Thiruvananthapuram has been identified as the location for a Technology Centre (TC) under the Union government’s MSME sector schemes. We have given a proposal that the TC should focus on space technology clusters,” Mr. Kurup said.

So what makes Thiruvananthapuram a preferred destination for space-tech firms? The presence of ISRO units such as Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU), and the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) is a key factor, says Srinath Ravichandran, co-founder and CEO of Agnikul Cosmos, an IIT-Madras incubated start-up that is designing a three-stage rocket for low-earth orbits.

“We being a launch vehicle company, proximity to the VSSC would be an advantage for us. Two, as start-ups, we are always worrying about infrastructure availability. At SpacePark there will be facilities that will be commonly shared among the companies. Third, Thiruvananthapuram is home to many retired ISRO hands whom we can access. Fourth, the government is very encouraging. The Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has done a lot to encourage start-ups,” Mr. Ravichandran explained his company’s reasons for choosing SpacePark.

Global collaborations

Kerala is unveiling its SpacePark at a time when collaborations between private entrepreneurs and government-run space agencies like the ISRO is growing. “The global space business, right now, around $200 billion a year. The projection is that it could grow to $300 billion by 2030. That’s the kind of potential. Out of this, manufacturing component contributes 10% of the volume. As much as 90% is hogged by applications of space technology,” points out former ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair.

In India, private entrepreneurship has immense scope in the sector, especially with a globally competitive, high-quality product. But to develop a successful ecosystem, you also require a new breed of entrepreneurs, he added. “Ideally, the government should act as a facilitator. The services in SpacePark should come with no strings attached. Here, speed is very important. Nothing will wait for you. You need a new breed of entrepreneurs who can take up this challenge,” he said.

On another important front, SpacePark is working on building international partnerships that would benefit its companies well in future.

Thomas Isaac of ignoring the capital city in the budget presented on Friday, while ruling Left Democratic Front MLAs lauded him for allocations in their respective constituencies.

V.S. Sivakumar, MLA of the Thiruvananthapuram constituency, demanded that the Finance Minister announce a special package for the district, in line with similar packages announced for some other districts.

‘Allot fund for flyovers’

Allocations have not been made for Light Metro or flyovers at Jagathy and Vazhuthacaud to solve traffic snarls in these junctions. No projects for drinking water or sewerage facilities have been announced for the coastal areas, he said.

Vattiyurkavu MLA V.K. Prasanth said the Budget allocation of ₹51.45 crore for the constituency would lead to a jump in the developmental activities there. The development of Vattiyurkavu junction, Pattom flyover and similar big projects would be taken up with funding from the KIIFB.

Minister Kadakampally Surendran said ₹23 crore had been set aside for his constituency Kazhakuttam, where a mini civil station would come up at a cost of ₹10 crore.

Bridge on Thettiyar

390,2020/02/08,Library hosts knowledge-sharing workshop,"The District Central Library with the support of M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation organised a workshop of the International Network of Emerging Library Innovators (INELI) - (India and South Asia Network), an online network of public librarians. The three-day workshop titled ‘Building Smart, Inclusive, Knowledgeable and Resilient Communities,’ began on Friday.

The programme is aimed at discussing ways to redefine the role of public libraries, attempting to making it a knowledge-sharing space for not just for reading but for community building. Through INELI, selected librarians share information and travel to various libraries to learn from them and to provide feedback.

""The District Central Library, with the active participation of the Readers’ Forum has been able to organise several need-based programmes and has become a centre for community learning,” said A. P. Sivakumar, District Library Officer. “The delegates from across India and South Asia will observe the workings of our library, provide feedback and also learn new ideas, which they can implement at their libraries,” he said.

Over three days, the visitors will observe workshops organised at the library, such as yoga, reading and games for children, classes for competitive examinations, programmes and facilities for persons with disabilities and special children. They will also visit branch libraries at Thuraiyur and Thottiyam on Saturday.

Neeza Singh, librarian at the Central State Library, Chandigarh, said that the District Central Library encouraged active participation of the community, something which many libraries lacked. “The users themselves are able to request facilities based on their requirements, be it interactions with doctors for senior citizens or counselling for students before taking examinations,” she said. The programme would also teach delegates how to effectively plan and handle the requirements of communities, Ms. Singh added, as she appreciated the quality of infrastructure available for all members of society.

Another delegate, Kyaw Lwin Soe from the Millennium Centre in Myanmar said that the programme would help him to learn how to pitch partnership and funding opportunities to stakeholders for the betterment of facilities at his library.

“There are no government-supported libraries in Myanmar, most of them are just small rooms with shelves. For me, libraries are lifelong learning centres and I hope to bring that to my city,"" he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/33e5u1/article30767748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TY-CITY-CENTRALLIBRARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/library-hosts-knowledge-sharing-workshop/article30767749.ece
391,2020/02/08,Three sculptures found in Kolli hills,"Historians have found and identified three ancient sculptures, including two Chola period ones, near a pond on the outskirts of Karayankattuppati near Chemmedu in Kolli hills recently.

The sculptures were identified by R. Akila, Assistant Professor, Department of History, Arignar Anna Government Arts College, Musiri, and M. Nalini, Head, Department of History, Seethalakshmi Ramasami College, Tiruchi, when they undertook an exploratory study to supplement data collected by L. Chandrahasan, Assistant professor, Department of History of Arignar Anna Government Arts College for his project on tribal life and culture. V. Palanisamy, Assistant professor of the college accompanied the scholars.

According to R. Kalaikkovan, Director, Dr. M. Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research, two of the three sculptures were that of Mahishasuramardini and the other one was that of Jyeshta.

Among the two Mahishasuramardini sculptures that are seen side-by-side under a tree, the bas-relief sculpture fits the description given in the Tamil literary work, Silapathikaram. In this, the deity is represented in standing posture with her feet resting on the head of the defeated and killed buffalo demon Mahishan. Holding bow and arrow in the front hands and sword and shield in the back hands, She is adorned with karanda makuta, palm leaf kundalas, bangles, broad necklace (charappalli), silk attire below the hip and a breast band. A beautiful deer is standing behind her with its face to her right. Absence of the usual objects such the chakra and the conch in the back hands of this image is significant and differentiates it from the urban counterparts. This may be dated on stylistic grounds to the later Chola period.

The second image resembles the first one in posture, ornamentation and apparel but differs in three important aspects and is of later date. In this sculpture, the front hands of the deity are in abhaya (bestowing protection) mudra and dola (simply hanging on the side).Commonly the right hand of the deity is used to show the abhaya mudra whereas here it is done with the left hand. The back hands of this icon as in the normal Durga images carry conch and chakra. The most distinguishing difference is that this is sculpted as a low relief sculpture (sunken relief), where the image does not rise beyond the stone surface on which it is made. Such low relief sculptures are generally seen in the tribal areas, Mr. Kalaikkovan said.

Another sculpture which is at a distance from these two is also placed under a tree. Stylistically this is the earliest of the lot and may be dated to the 10th century C. E. It represents Jyeshta, the elder sister of goddess Lakshmi. Also known as Muttadevi, this deity is mentioned in the ancient Tamil literature Thirukkural where She is called as Thavvai and Mamugadi. Seated on a bench with both her legs down She is adorned with Karanda makuta, palmleaf kundalas, charappalli, bangles, rings and swarna vaikaksha. A beautiful flower medallion is fixed to her head gear. Though a silk dress is tied around her hip, the breast band is missing. Her right hand is in abhaya and the left hand is kept on the thigh.

A flag staff shown to her right is with the usual crow banner.

Her son Nandhikesvaran, also known as Manthan, and her daughter Agnimatha are seated in suhasana on two raised pedestals seen one on each side of her. Her son with the face of a bull has a staff in his right hand and his left hand is kept on his thigh. He is wearing the sacred thread and short apparel at the hip. A charappali adorns his neck.

The daughter whose ornamentation and apparel are just like her mother but for the pearl necklace is seated to the left of her. Her left hand is kept on the thigh and the right hand holds some fruit.

The local folk who were not aware of the significance of sculptures have assured to safeguard them, Dr.Kalaikkovan said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/s1fbsw/article30767723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TYCITY-JYESHTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/three-sculptures-found-in-kolli-hills/article30767726.ece
392,2020/02/08,Students display innovative projects,"An innovation exhibition-cum-competition for students of government schools was organised by Tiruchi Round Table 54 and Tiruchi Ladies Circle 33 on Friday, to encourage scientific temper and problem-solving skills among children.

Students of nearly 50 schools took part in Ideathon 1.0, organised at Bishop Heber Higher Secondary School, Teppakulam, where 200 students, in teams of two or three, showcased their projects. They were categorised as Category A - students of Classes 5 and 6; Category B: Classes 7 and 8; and Category C - Classes 5 to 8. They were asked to pitch innovative ideas under the theme - ‘Need of the hour.’

Parkavi Murali, Chairperson, Tiruchi Ladies Circle 33, said that the idea came close on the heels of a six-day craft camp organised in November. “Students showed interest in coming up with solutions and also making models to showcase them. Children from larger private schools have ample opportunities like these but for students of government schools, who have unique solutions to real problems, an initiative has to be taken,” she said.

Students made models of large buses which can hover over smaller vehicles, battery-operated water pumps, cars, and water filters.

“We watched a video of electricity being generated from vegetables and plants. We tried it with potatoes but found better results with aloe vera,” said A. Bavabakaruddin and N. Yukeshraja, students of Panchayat Union Middle School, Thuvakudi.

Collector S. Sivarasu distributed participation certificates to the students. Addressing the students, he encouraged them to seize opportunities which come their way.

“Hard work is the only key to success. There is no short cut. Students must believe in themselves and cultivate self-confidence,” he said.

A. Thameemunisa, District Social Welfare Officer, informed the students of ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,’ and the benefits girl students can receive from it.

Winners were awarded cash prizes. They will also be eligible to participate in a boot camp to be organised soon.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/k66exk/article30767713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TYCITY-IDEATHON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/students-of-government-schools-showcase-innovative-projects/article30767714.ece

394,2020/02/08,Official begins inspection of electrified stretches,"K.A. Manoharan, Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru, began a two-day statutory inspection of the second electrified portion of the main line section from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai via Chidambaram on Friday following completion of overhead electrification work. The officer would also inspect a separate electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur.

Accompanied by senior officers of the Tiruchi Railway Division and Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Mr. Manoharan started the detailed exercise from Cuddalore Port Junction travelling on board a special train.

The RVNL, a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, has been entrusted with the task of electrifying the 228 km main line section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam and a separate stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur via Peralam and Nannilam (23 km).

The RVNL has already electrified the first portion of the main line section from Villupuram to Cuddalore Port Junction with trains being hauled by electric locomotives after the Commissioner of Railway Safety accorded mandatory clearance after inspection.

Railway sources said Mr. Manoharan would inspect the electrical installations established as part of the project from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai besides inspecting the signalling and engineering works during the day-long exercise.

He would inspect the electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur on Saturday and conclude the exercise by conducting a speed trial in the special train that would be hauled by a electric locomotive in the evening from Tiruvarur to Cuddalore Port Junction (113 km).

The sources said the speed trial would be between 90 and 100 kilometres per hour. Ahead of inviting the Commissioner of Railway Safety for inspection, the RVNL officials had conducted a trial run of an electric locomotive from Tiruvarur to Cuddalore via Mayiladuthurai.

Passenger and freight trains hauled by electric locomotive would be operated in the electrified stretches from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai and from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur after obtaining mandatory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety. Presently, passenger and freight trains were being hauled by diesel locomotives on both stretches.

The last leg of the ongoing overhead electrification project in the remaining 70-km stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur via Kumbakonam was apace with foundation work underway. The RVNL has targeted to complete the electrification works up to Thanjavur Junction by June. The entire project is being executed at a cost of around ₹300 crore. The completion of the project would enable operation of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains from Villupuram to Thanjavur.

The main line section is another important stretch falling under the vast jurisdiction of the Tiruchi Railway Division after the chord line section from Villupuram to Tiruchi via Vriddhachalam, Ariyalur and Srirangam. The double line stretch from Villupuram to Tiruchi has already been energised with trains being hauled by electric locomotives.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6en67i/article30767687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TYCITY-INSPECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/commissioner-of-railway-safety-begins/article30767688.ece
395,2020/02/08,"ISL: Chennaiyin FC, Bengaluru FC eye full points in crucial clash","Chennaiyin FC will look to continue to its four-match winning streak and close in on a play-offs spot when it takes on defending champion Bengaluru FC in an Indian Super League (ISL) match here on Sunday.

With 15 goals in their last four matches, Chennaiyin are on a roll and forward Nerijus Valskis (12) who tops the goal-scoring charts will be the man to watch out for.

After a lacklustre start to the 2019-2020 season which saw head coach John Gregory exit, the two-time champion has turned things around well under Owen Coyle.

CFC, however, runs into a tough customer in Bengaluru FC which has the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in its ranks. The visiting team hasn’t been in dominant form of late but will look to pull off a win to seal their play-off berth.

For Chennaiyin, Valskis, Rafael Crivallero and Maltese Andre Schembri have been in good form in recent games and will need to continue in the same vein for the team to earn three points.

The host will miss the services of Anirudh Thapa, who is suspended.

Bengaluru FC is close to sealing a semi-final spot, but can’t afford to slip up, as they attempt to chase down the elusive top spot.

At the pre-match press conference, the team’s head coach Carles Cuadrat said Chennaiyin FC is in good form and also fighting for a top four spot and emphasised the need to go for three points.

“For sure, Chennaiyin are in a positive mood. They are fighting for the top four also. For them, it is also an important game. But our work is to also fight for our objectives. We will really go for the three points. We can expect a really exciting game because when you see two teams going for the victory, it’s nice,” he said.

Stressing the importance of the first goal in the contest, Cuadrat said, “A lot of things are important in these kind of games. For example, who is the first team to score the goal.

“The three games that we have lost, it was because when the other team scored first, they were comfortable. We will try to be the first team to score. But we know it is not going to be easy.”

Apart from Chhetri, custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu will be a key player for BFC as he would need to keep the Chennaiyin forwards at bay.

396,2020/02/08,Roma’s top-four hopes hit by Bologna loss,"Roma's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League suffered another blow on Friday as a 3-2 home defeat by Bologna extended the capital club's winless streak to three Serie A games.

Paulo Fonseca's fifth-placed side remain level on points with fourth-placed Atalanta, who visit Fiorentina on Saturday, before the two teams meet in Bergamo next weekend.

“At this moment, we are too anxious, so I must consider what I can do to change this situation,” Roma boss Fonseca told Sky Sport Italia.

“We must work to change this. It's not overly dramatic, it might all seem negative right now, but we just need courage.”

Riccardo Orsolini took advantage of an error by English defender Chris Smalling to grab a 16th-minute advantage for Bologna at the Stadio Olimpico, before Stefano Denswil's dreadful own goal drew Roma level just six minutes later.

But Gambian international Musa Barrow scored excellent individual efforts either side of half-time to send Bologna on their way to victory.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan's header gave the home side hope with 18 minutes remaining, but Bryan Cristante was sent off shortly afterwards to end any thoughts of a comeback.

Bologna climbed to sixth in the table after their third straight win, one point above Cagliari and Parma in the race to qualify for the Europa League.

398,2020/02/08,Vizag to have its Disha police station in a week,"The city will have its first Disha Police Station in a week’s time. This was disclosed by the Commissioner of Police R.K. Meena, here on Saturday.

He was interacting with The Hindu after Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the first Disha Police Station in the State in Rajahamahendravaram on Saturday.

Giving details about the police station, he said that the police station will be an exclusive set-up that will handle cases booked under the newly-formed Disha Act. The Bill for the Disha Act has been passed by the State and has been sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs for its final nod and consent of the President.

“Once the President gives his consent the Act will be implemented in the State and it will deal specifically with cases related to atrocities against women. Irrespective of the area of crime, if the case is booked under the Disha Act, the case will be transferred to this police station from the area police station,” he said.

The Disha Police Station will be housed in the newly-constructed building at Yendada. While the first floor will be occupied by ACP (North) the ground floor will house this police station.

As per Mr. Meena, the police station will have two ACP or DSP rank officers, five Sub-Inspectors, 38 constables and six head constables.

“This apart, one SI will be present at the one-stop centre, which has come up at King George Hospital. This one-stop centre will contain one SI rank officer, and at least one officer from each of the stakeholders such as a medical practitioner, one gynaecologist, one officer from the legal department and one counsellor. The centre will work 365 days and 24/7,” he said.

As per the Disha Act, investigation has to be completed within seven days and the trial has to be completed within the next 14 days. In total, the time frame provided is 21 days, from investigation to verdict.

To keep functioning within the deadline, we not only have an exclusive police station, but we have already started an exclusive court in the city with one special public prosecutor on duty round- the-clock, he said.

Three forensic labs

The government has also sanctioned three vehicles, launched the Disha App and three fully-equipped forensic labs, including one in Visakhapatnam.

The labs in Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Mangalagiri will have DNA testing facility.

According to Mr. Meena, standard operation procedures in handling Disha cases have been formulated. “Every thing has been defined in the SOP with time schedule. The SOP has clearly specified by how much time the investigating officer has to complete the investigation, including collection of material evidences and filing of FIR and charge sheet and by how much time the evidences need to be produced before the court. If there is a delay the officer concerned has to give an explanation within 24 hours. The Act also specifies that the IO has to record the statement of the victim under IPC Section 164 within 24 hours before a Magistrate,” he said.

The government has also provided a van with basic equipment for the CLUES team to gather the evidence from the crime scene and a cubicle for transporting the victim. “Training has been given to all officers and staff right from how to collect evidences, how to make the case strong, how to handle the victim and how to investigate the case,” said Mr. Meena.

Disha Command Centre

Talking about the App that was launched by the Chief Minister, the commissioner of police said that it will be available for download within the next 48 hours from playstore. “The App is compatible in all smartphones. If one is unable to call or press the button, then the victim can just shake the phone for five times,” he said.

This will activate the App and alert the staff at the Disha Command Centre at Mangalagiri.

This App facilitates both text and audio and visual communication and is GPS enabled. The staff at the command centre will then alert the nearest police station or patrol vehicle from the crime scene and the reaction time is 3 to 7 minutes, said Mr. Meena.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/gs1t8z/article30771750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-VZ-DISHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-to-have-its-disha-police-station-in-a-week/article30770634.ece

Mr. Tiwari first stated that Mr. Kejriwal “insulted” the Hindu religion. The AAP chief hit back, saying god belongs to everyone and may god bless everyone, including those of the BJP.

“Look at the truth of the Hanuman devotee Kejriwal... The garlands of flowers were offered to Baba with the hands with which he removed his shoes! You insult Hinduism, Arvind Kejriwal,” Mr. Tiwari said in a tweet of a video, in which Mr. Kejriwal is seen entering a temple.

“Ever since I read Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channel, people from BJP have been constantly mocking me. Yesterday I went to the Hanuman temple. Today BJP leaders are saying that the temple was defiled by me going there. What kind of politics is this? God belongs to everyone. May God bless everyone, even people from BJP,” Mr. Kejriwal said in response.

Hitting out at the BJP, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said, “The BJP considers Arvind Kejriwal an untouchable. Manoj Tiwari has said ‘Kejriwal defiled Bajrangbali by worshiping Hanuman ji.’ Why so much hatred? I appeal to the people of Delhi to give a reply to the BJP, which considers your son an untouchable.”

Also, Mr. Kejriwal and Union Minister Smriti Irani got into a war of words on Twitter over his tweet urging women to discuss with men about the right person to vote for in the election.

On Saturday morning, Mr. Kejriwal said in another tweet, “You must go to vote. Special appeal to all women — Just like you take the responsibility of the house, the responsibility of the country and Delhi is on your shoulders. All women must go to vote and also take the men of your house along. Make sure to consult with men, who will be the right person to vote for.”

Terming the AAP chief “anti-women”, Ms. Irani said in a tweet: “You don’t consider women capable enough that they can themselves decide whom to vote for?” Replying to it, the AAP chief said the women in Delhi had decided whom to vote for and they had also decided for their families.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/180m8y/article30772030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9TH-VOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/aap-bjp-locked-in-a-war-of-words/article30772031.ece

Mehzabeen Qureshi, who returned to the protest site after voting said, “I stayed at home to let other women in the house go out and vote. Now I have joined them here at Shaheen Bagh after voting. I voted today to secure democracy.”

Zaheeda Khan, another resident of Shaheen Bagh, said they decided to vote in batches.

“The women here had decided a day before voting that some of them would go out for voting in the morning, while others will stay back for chores. The others will go in the afternoon and then come back to the protest site.

“By the evening, we will be a full house again, all geared up to continue our protest,” she said.

Zahra Sheikh said they are determined to exercise their right to vote as it is crucial for a democracy.

“We started our day knowing that it will be of double importance for us. We want to ensure that democracy survives hence, every citizen of Shaheen Bagh is voting,” she said.

In the meantime, the men from Shaheen Bagh filled in at the protest site when the women protestors were away completing domestic chores.

Taking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s “biryani” remark, Mohammad Ayub, a resident, said they were voting to prove a point that they were not being served any “biryani“.

Mr. Adityanath was served a notice by the Election Commission for his “Kejriwal is feeding biryani in Shaheen Bagh” comments.

The Shaheen Bagh protest site had become a focal point in the BJP’s poll campaign.

“Many people have alleged that we were protesting for Delhi elections and that some political parties were funding us and serving ‘biryani’ They should know that we are still protesting as Delhi votes and will continue the agitation after the polling,” Mr. Ayub said.

“No party serves us ‘biryani’ The women cook and bring food to feed the protestors,” he added.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/lvhwg8/article30769645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/women-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/women-protesters-at-shaheen-bagh-vote-in-batches-to-keep-agitation-alive/article30770151.ece
404,2020/02/08,Kejriwal in war of words with BJP on Twitter,"As people went out to vote in the Delhi Assembly election, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that god belonged to everyone and hoped that god blessed everyone, including BJP voters.

Mr. Kejriwal was reacting to allegations by BJP Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari that Mr. Kejriwal had made the Hanuman Temple “impure” by not washing his hands after removing his shoes and doing puja.

“Ever since I read Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channel, the BJP is constantly making fun of me. Yesterday I visited the Hanuman Mandir and today the BJP leaders are saying that the temple has become impure. What kind of politics is this,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

Another tweet by Mr. Kejriwal in which he appealed to women to go out and vote along with the men of the house and discuss with them which party would be the right party to vote for drew criticism from BJP leader Smriti Irani who replied to him asking if he felt that women were not capable of taking decisions on their own.

Mr. Kejriwal replied that all the women of Delhi had taken the decision on their own as to who they were voting for as it was the women of the house who bore the responsibility of running it.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h9dvkd/article30769534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KejriIranijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/2020-delhi-assembly-elections-kejriwal-in-war-of-words-with-bjp-on-twitter/article30769531.ece
405,2020/02/08,BJP mocking me ever since I recited ‘Hanuman Chalisa’: Kejriwal,"Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday alleged that the BJP has been mocking him ever since he recited the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ on a TV channel.

Taking to Twitter after casting his vote for the Delhi assembly elections, Mr. Kejriwal sought to know what kind of politics the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is doing.

“Ever since I have recited the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ on a TV channel, the BJP is constantly mocking me. Yesterday, I went to a Hanuman Temple.”

“Today, BJP leaders are saying that the temple has turned impure by his visit. What kind of politics is this? God belongs to all. God blesses everyone, including those in the BJP,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.

On Friday, Mr. Kejriwal along with his wife offered prayers at the famous Hanuman Temple near Connaught Place.

Earlier this week, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener had said his reciting the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ has hurt leaders of the BJP.

During an election rally in Delhi on February 4, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said, “Now Arvind Kejriwal has started reciting the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. In coming days, you will see Owaisi reciting the same. This will certainly happen.”

407,2020/02/08,"Like a slow, sad song: Pankaj Kapur’s ‘Dopehri’ reviewed by Vineetha Mokkil","Veteran actor Pankaj Kapur successfully dons the hat of a novelist with Dopehri, originally written in Hindustani and now translated into English. Kapur had performed Dopehrimore than 50 times on stage in India and abroad before it appeared in book form.

This slim, elegantly designed novella set in Lucknow has a big heart. The story revolves around 65-year-old Amma Bi, who lives all by herself in her huge, desolate Lucknow haveli. With nothing but her late husband’s life-size portrait and vintage car for company, Amma Bi is staring at the abyss of loneliness. Her house help, Jumman, whom she “doesn’t like one bit”, happens to be the only one “who saw and heard her in her old age”. Though Amma Bi has dedicated her life to family and relationships, she finds herself painfully alone at this stage of her life.

Every evening, she hears the sound of phantom footsteps in her courtyard. Every night is a burden, every waking hour a pain. Kapur paints Amma Bi’s interior landscape poignantly. Her melancholic phase followed by her life-affirming transformation — thanks to the arrival of Sabiha, a lively young woman whom she takes on as tenant and grows very close to — is convincingly portrayed.

The city of Lucknow, as much a character as the cast of the novella, comes alive in Kapur’s descriptions. The grandeur of Lucknow’s monuments, the hustle and bustle of the city, the kites flying in the bright blue sky are all captured in cinematic detail. Flashes of insight add texture to the setting and make it an integral part of Amma Bi’s story.

Dopehri is well-paced for the most part. But Kapur rushes to tie up loose ends and reach a satisfying resolution towards the end. The languid pace of the initial part is to be savoured.

Like a slow, sad song, it reaches the reader’s heart, lingering long after you stop turning the pages. Anyone who has endured loneliness and found companionship and hope in unexpected places is sure to relate to these characters and be drawn into this book.

The writer is the author of A Happy Place And Other Stories.

408,2020/02/08,How do we treat our children? Deepa Anappara’s ‘Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line’ reviewed by Jerry Pinto,"There is a family of five — which seems to be growing — on the street where I live. They have three children, all under the age of five. These children live in a state of near-total freedom. They wander the street at will, they dress in clothes donated by the middle-class mothers of the area and they discard these clothes when they are dirty. They play with puppies and kittens and once a stray goat that bit through its leash and was found wandering the streets. They seem fascinated by stones and sticks and leaves, almost as much as by the teddy bears and stuffed toys they are sometimes given. They seem like aliens sometimes, aliens because their lives are never going to be anywhere comparable to mine.

Morality play

And so I enter Deepa Anappara’s world, the one she hath wrought in Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, defenceless. I understand that she has chosen to take on the voice of a boy, and naturally he is a prodigy. All the children of literature are prodigies even when they are presented as simple, even when they are aw-shucksing their way into literary history. If they were not special, if they were not capable of representing and giving nuanced witness to their interior landscapes, we would not be interested in them. They would be Just William and he wasn’t a slouch either.

In this defenceless state, I am also without my moral compass, such a useful thing, I should never have left home without it. So I

am no longer worried about whether the street child has been represented or has been given a voice or has been appropriated. I give up any attempts at applying what little I know about street children — several years with Childline, watching street boys who loved Jeroo Billimoria, the founder of the call number 1098, test her by throwing puppies at her, because they knew she was terrified of dogs. I was then an outsider, as I am an outsider after a decade of visiting the kind of school Ms. Anappara describes in her novel for MelJol, to check whether the social and financial education scheme which is now in a hundred countries across the world, is functional.

(We are all outsiders. We were once children, we share that, all of us, from Donald Trump to Baba Amte. Picasso says we could have all been geniuses if we stayed children. The children I meet seem to be striving not to be children. And some of us get stuck at adolescence, more’s the pity.)

I feel like I am in a morality play and even Good Deeds won’t be my guide. I will therefore be guided by the brute instinct that lies under every novelist’s desire to recreate the universe. It’s called Story and it has a huge appetite for what happens next and for the dirty details. Story comes away half-filled from Anappara who can keep things moving, who has an eye for detail, who brings in colour and sound and texture. But there is also a curious innocence about this and this innocence means Story has overdosed on nursery food.

Do you agree?

What is childhood? I once asked a group of young people. No one could answer. Legalistically, it is simple. If you are not 18 years old, you are a child. Do you agree?

How should childhood’s innocence be treated. With reverence and tenderness. Do you agree?

If you do, how will you treat a five-foot-five-inch male person, 60 kilos, who has reached the age of 17 years and 362 days and has just raped and killed a woman? Is he a child? Do you want to treat him as a child?

How do you want to treat children? We love children in this country. You take a baby out and watch how people’s responses walk the fine line between the gentle and the vicious. Let us now pinch the baby’s cheeks. This underlying violence produces some extreme moments. We beat children to death. We shake them to death. We set cameras to watch as they die in tubewells and in drainage pipes. We kidnap them and rape them and kill them.

That is why there are no street girls, only street boys; it takes about four hours before an unescorted girl who comes to the city ends up in a brothel and is raped by a truck driver with AIDS who believes that he will be cured by sex with a virgin... okay, I’ll stop.

Childhood is a beautiful thing when it is protected but it takes a village to protect a child. It is a terrifying and brutal thing when the village says: There are certain children who deserve protection by virtue of their birth and there are others whom we can allow you to rape and brutalise and kill because they aren’t, well, they aren’t our children.

Deepa Anappara’s book is framed as a mystery. Mysteries work when societies care about the uniqueness and magic of a single human life. Mysteries work when justice can be assured. Djinn Patrolon the Purple Line tries very hard but its tragedies will never match the brutality of how our children live.

The writer is a poet and novelist.

409,2020/02/08,A ride on Tram No. 36: Review of Kunal Basu’s ‘Sarojini’s Mother’,"The literary world of Kunal Basu began, in his first few novels, with historical fiction that explored the British opium trade, Mughal miniatures, racial science in the Victorian era, and the reach of syphilis. With his collection of short stories, The Japanese Wife, he delved into other genres and embarked on deep character studies. Then, with his fifth novel, Kalkatta, he turned to the contemporary, looking at people living on the margins of the city. Through the lens of a gigolo, a Bihari Muslim, Basu led readers to the underbelly of Kolkata — places which “smell of dead cows and pigeon droppings”, where mothers wonder why the streets are “paved half and half, with dirt and gold.”

In interviews, Basu has said that he is drawn to the unexplored and to life beyond the comfort zone. His latest novel, Sarojini’s Mother, also set in contemporary Kolkata, tells the story of two people, a daughter looking for her ‘real’ mother and an Elvis Presley lookalike who helps her. In the periphery lurk others from poor and rich worlds, who steer Sarojini (or Saz) and her guide Chiru Sen (Elvis) towards their goal through the teeming city with its highs and lows.

Saz Campbell has arrived in India to search for her biological mother. She was adopted and taken to England when she was little but her ‘hippie’ mother Lucy cannot give her details of her past. All Saz can tell Elvis is that according to her mother, the orphanage was in a crumbling villa with a “smell of burning flesh”. With a stroke of luck, the villa is found. Saz meets Jamuna, who lives in a slum and claims to be her mother. “Slum is an ugly word. It makes you think of other ugly words. Like dark, dirty, dingy, dangerous.” The ominous alliterative warning doesn’t bother Saz, who begins spending most of her time with Jamuna.

The twist in the tale occurs when another person, Urvasi, turns up, also claiming to be Saz’s mother. Will Saz find her real mother? Will this give her a reason to live on? There are no easy answers, but while we wait, Basu takes us on many a ride through the cobbled streets of Calcutta. And the ride on Tram No. 36 is just one of these.

410,2020/02/08,‘I desire only the body’: The poetry of Akshaya Bahibala,"I meet Akshaya Bahibala in Bhubaneshwar’s Walking Bookfairs, an independent bookstore that he runs with his partner. The store, quite like his work, lies hidden — among eateries and other shops — and only a few venture there. As Bahibala reads out from his works to a small gathering — which he hosts from time to time — his poetic craft reveals itself: a seamless weave of his experiences and observations expressed through metaphors and symbols in colloquial Odia.

Stripped bare

To be counted as a poet or not, is a question that follows Bahibala wherever he goes. Faced with ruthless criticism and charges of obscenity from the conservative, Brahmanical Odia literary establishment, he has been banished from the hall of poets because of his free verse, which deviates from the established poetic diction and depicts the ordinary.

“No publisher accepted my work as ‘poetry’, or as literature, for that matter. They said it was half story, half poetry and not up to the mark,” says Bahibala with a smile. After multiple rejections, he finally decided to self-publish. He has three poetry books and one short story collection to his credit.

Bahibala, which literally translates into ‘bookseller’, a title he gave himself, comes from a modest background. Born in Puri in 1980, he went to government schools in districts all over Odisha. Leaving home at a young age, he travelled to Goa, Kolkata, and other places to earn a living, sometimes working as a waiter, sometimes selling books — taking up whatever work he could find. With his meagre earnings barely enough to meet basic needs, he never thought of taking up writing for a living. “Neither was I studying literature nor was I fraternising with contemporary writers — how could I even dare to dream?” he asks.

The Odia literary sphere has largely remained chained to the canons. By poetry, what is indicated is poetry in standardised form and diction. Bahibala’s writing smashes those expectations.

When Bahibala started putting together his poetry into slim volumes in his mid-30s, his intentions were clear: to shatter societal façades, slice them open to reveal inequalities — and he does all that with a cold-blooded honesty. One of his recurring motifs is, not surprisingly, nudity.

I desire only the body.

The body, and body’s touch.

When I burn in desire, or cry

I search for another body.

Why, you ask?

Because, I cannot touch a soul.

Real utterance

The language in which he captures the “langala deha” (naked bodies) is itself naked — approximating real utterance as opposed to the commonly held view of poetry as terse, abstract lyric.

His poems on the city space are profound meditations on existing inequalities. Through his experience of inhabiting the city’s edges, he interrogates the construction of the centre.

Of the streets

Bahibala takes his poetry to the streets, the source of his art. And he reads them out to the people for whom his poetry is created. “For me, the objective of literature is to find its readers. The ones who I write about must receive what is written. Often, they do not like my poetry even when they can see themselves there, because they are taught to like poetry in a different way. They think of themselves as unworthy of being written about. We have taught an entire class of people to hate themselves,” he says.

Does it bother Bahibala that he is not called a poet in literary circles? “I never wanted to be a poet, in any case. And poets do not do what I do — publish and distribute, run a bookstore or wait at tables. Poets here have historically been Indian Administrative Officers who are imagining the summers of Bhubaneswar as Wordsworth did,” says Bahibala.

Powerful, sharp, urgent, visceral and often harsh, his works are thoughtful commentaries on contemporary life in a city anywhere in India. They are yet to be experienced by a larger audience, as his works await translation.

411,2020/02/08,The seed of the novel lies in disbelief: Shubhangi Swarup,"Shubhangi Swarup’s debut novel, Latitudes of Longing — acclaimed as the “novel of the year” by its publisher, HarperCollins — has been getting rave reviews ever since its publication in 2018. Expertly blending the natural with the supernatural (the cast includes a yeti searching for human company), Swarup explores fault lines that are as much geographical as psychological. One of the first Indian novels to engage with environmental changes, Latitudes of Longing features nature as a living, heaving entity. Excerpts from an interview:

Latitudes of Longing is such a rich and strange novel: how did you conceptualise it?

The seed of the novel lies in disbelief, for there exist patterns, connections and truths in nature that are beyond human grasp.

When you are standing in the high-altitude desert of Ladakh, the fossils and shells tell you a different tale and history. They tell you that it was once a seabed, just as the Andaman islands are mountain peaks sticking out of the ocean. The gems found in Myanmar speak of the profound geological violence witnessed by the region, and how the violence connects it to the Himalayan glaciers and valleys, and oceanic islands. A tectonic fault line is the narrative thread of my novel, and when you shift your gaze this way, a very different story emerges. One where natural history is the framework to our lives, not political borders or artificial plots.

You engage with climate change in the novel. What kind of research went into it and what conclusions regarding the environment have you arrived at on the basis of your extensive travels and studies?

It surprises me when my novel is termed as magic-realism or ecological fiction. It just shows how delusional the genre of

‘realism’ has become. We as a modern society aren’t invested in the environment sciences, natural history and larger web of life that nurtures us. As a result, the current discussions around climate emergency are myopic and solipsistic. They are devoid of the awe, love and personal investment our planet deserves.

And without this fundamental respect and awe, various catastrophes will keep occurring, if not this one. So let climate emergency be that necessary trigger for reflections, right from individual to civilisational. We don’t need manic fluctuations in temperature to include rainforests and blue whales in our national discussions, novels or films. We just need humility.

Your novel is full of solitary people. Is writing a solitary act?

My characters carry a profound solitude within them. Not only does it remain with them throughout, it also leads them to form bonds with other people, and with forces of nature. Writing, in a similar way, has helped me go deep within, and leap as far outside. Solitude as an experience can’t be reduced to a physical space or state of mind.

Parts of the novel were written in exotic locales all alone, but majority of it was written in a crowded house shared by nine people, where nothing, not even the page, was sacrosanct. Sometimes, my niece would scribble over things, or a family member note a number down on my manuscript.

In what ways does your work as a journalist feed into your fiction-writing?

My work as a journalist trained me to plan my research trips impeccably, to always have a plan B, sometimes even a plan C, but most importantly, to know that almost all plans fail, yet one succeeds. I took seven years to write the novel, as I had to manage day jobs along with the travels and writing.

Journalism taught me the value of deadlines, and sticking to them in the face of uncertainty.

412,2020/02/08,Déjà vu in Lahore,"Lahore is a fabled city beyond our reach in India. I had lived there as a child when my father, who was in the army, was posted in the city. That was a long time ago. But Lahore has always remained in my memory, as my mother died there; her ashes were immersed in the Ravi. I never expected to see Lahore ever again until...

Last June, I found in my mailbox an invitation to a literary event to be held in Lahore from January 10 to 12, 2020. This was magical. The invitee was Yaqoob Khan Bangash, Director, Centre for Governance and Policy, IT University of Punjab, Lahore, and curator of the Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest. In the lengthy invite, Yaqoob outlined its purpose (“New ideas”), and mentioned a list of distinguished past invitees. I accepted immediately. I was invited to launch my social history travelogue/ memoir, Empress of the Taj, In Search of Mumtaz Mahal.

Fingers crossed

Through several emails, we discussed that elusive document, The Visa, to that forbidden country. It’s availability depended on our countries’ mutual relationship at the moment of application. Under the two current governments, the situation did not look hopeful. We both had our fingers crossed over the months of correspondence and political uncertainties, made more intense by November. Yaqoob sent the link for the Pakistan visa forms; I was to get a conference visa. Both the Pakistan and India governments will not issue tourist visas to each other’s citizens. Yaqoob and I thought this was insanity but those were the edicts. I wanted my wife to accompany me: as an Australian, she could possibly get a tourist visa.

I filled in the forms, added many passport-size photos and sent the documents to the Pakistan High Commission’s visa office in Delhi late November. Yaqoob wrote: “Just a couple of weeks for the visas”. Then, we waited. And waited. The silence was deafening. December, Christmas and then the new year. No visa still, with Yaqoob chasing from his end. By January 6, we were resigned. I would never see Lahore again.

On January 8, 5 p.m., Yaqoob sent the message, “Conference visa granted”. I had to pick it up on January 9. Then another message — my wife’s tourist visa was cancelled. Yaqoob asked me to call the chancellor at the High Commission. It was 9.30 pm. He did answer, was very friendly, consulted papers, and said my wife’s tourist visa was reinstated.

Tit for tat

I spent half the night booking flights for us, first to Delhi, then to Amritsar: from there we would cross the Wagah border into Pakistan along with the other Indian invitees. I wasn’t told for how many days I would get a visa. I decided to return on January 13.

On January 9 afternoon, we met the courteous Pakistan staff in the visa office who disappeared with our passports. We waited two hours. They returned. Our visas were valid for seven days, and only to Lahore. India does the same — both governments keep themselves busy playing tit for tat, like children. We met the chancellor, Mr. Saeed Ali, also courteous, laying out tea and biscuits, conversing and wishing us a good journey. The next day, on the Delhi-Amritsar flight, we met the five other invitees, including Mani Shankar Aiyar, a friendly man and a great raconteur. He arranged taxis to the Wagah border.

Warm welcome

Crossing was both an emotional and physical journey. I was returning after many years. Passports were minutely examined, the details noted in ledgers and computers by at least eight officials on the Indian side. Finally, stamped. We walked across the border, passing the crowds filling the small stadium for watching the daily display of strutting soldiers.

In Pakistan, the same minute examination of passports, notes entered in ledgers/ computers, also by eight or nine officials and the police. Stamped. Their welcome was warmer and more courteous.

Finally, I met Yaqoob waiting for us: a charming man with the distracted air of someone hosting over 150 invitees from all over the world and Pakistan. My first questions to him was, “Where is Lucknow Road, Lahore Cantonment?” That was our home address then. He had never heard of it, nor had any Lahori I asked. Road names had changed, they said. It was there under a new alias. I would never find it.

At Lahore Fort

In the hotel, the first familiar face, Sir Venkatraman (Venki) Ramakrishnan, whom I had met at The Hindu Lit Fest. The welcome dinner, on a bitterly cold night, was at Lahore Fort, first built by Emperor Akbar in 1575, with his descendants adding their flourishes — Shah Jahan the marble pavilions and Aurangzeb the massive battlements flanking the main gate. It was the chance to meet the others, including Mark Lyall Grant, ex-U.K. High Commissioner to Pakistan, and the historian Kim Wagner, whose book on 1857 I had read recently.

Also, there was my host for the book launch, Dr. Nadhra Khan, Associate Professor, History and Art, Lahore University. A bright, attractive woman who had not had enough time to read the entire PDF manuscript of my book (Indian books are banned in Pakistan and vice versa). The great feast took up two long tables, with the lit-up fort as the backdrop. Venki had a hard time finding vegetarian food, the only offering being pasta.

The conference venue was the Alhamra Arts Council. On January 11, the first speaker was Grant, on ‘International Governance and the Future of the State’. He tried to reassure us by saying there was hope despite the rise of right-wing nationalist governments around the world. The talks by the others covered every subject, from politics, history, books to governance.

Same people

As I had written my novel, Taj, with Jahangir as a character, I had to visit his tomb in Shahdara, in the outskirts of Lahore. In the afternoon, Maureen and I headed off first to see Lahore Fort in daylight. The roads were wide, smooth for the most part, no sign of garbage, and the shops, including Anarkali market, crowded. When we reached the fort, the crowds — families with children, all in their finery — were overwhelming.

Many went out of their way to say a ‘hello’ to us, others waved as we passed. As many Lahoris I met commented, “We’re all the same people.” And I agreed. We found everyone — drivers, shopkeepers, even the police — courteous and friendly.

Lahore Fort is similar to Red Fort, but grey granite and twice as large. On our way to the tomb, we crossed a bridge. The driver pointed down to the river Ravi. I looked at the cold waters, struggling with memories.

There were few visitors to the tomb, the garden was huge. Jahangir’s tomb was at one end, and far at the opposite end, Mehrunissa’s. She had designed both. We could take photographs inside. But there were signs of neglect too. On the way back to this exuberant city, we discovered that Delhi and Lahore have matching traffic jams. You could read War and Peace waiting for the traffic to move.

That night, we had dinner in the striking Haveli Barood Khana in old Lahore. The neighbourhood resembled old Delhi.

On January 12, the first talk was by Sir Venki on the gene machine. We heard others — on the Amritsar massacre, a Chinese world order, Savarkar and the origins of Hindutva. At my book launch with Nadhra, a retired professor of English from Lahore University spoke glowingly about my book.

I woke up on January 13 panicking. I had booked the Amritsar flight for 12.45 p.m. Mani cheerfully informed me that I would never make it through Wagah in time for the taxi to the airport. It was pouring rain as we raced to the border. At least the porters knew the routine. Same show of passports to everyone. On the Pakistani side, we were welcomed, ushered through with a quick stamp, and the immigration officer shook hands. We crossed the no-man’s land in the rain, dragging our suitcases to India.

There was a bus and we waited in it to take us to the Indian immigration and customs building. Time was flying. More passport checks, finally out by 11.15 p.m. We had 45 minutes to check in. We called for a taxi and the one that came was an ancient Maruti van. The old Sikh driver started off: his van did not have wipers and he drove by sheer instinct, as we could not see the road in the rain. We reached the airport with five minutes to spare.

In those few days in Lahore, none of the English language newspapers had mentioned India, in any context. The first Indian newspaper I opened headlined a comment by our PM on Pakistan.

413,2020/02/08,‘The Body – A Guide for Occupants’ review: Unravelling the science of the human body,"Bill Bryson’s 2003 work, A Short History of Nearly Everything, delved into the universe, and brought the somewhat inaccessible world of science to the layperson. In The Body, he does the same for the bodies that we, well, occupy all day. In just over 450 pages, Bryson covers a wide array of topics, from the human brain, to the skin, to the microbes that we all carry around and even cancer, or when things go horribly wrong. The book contains a staggering amount of information, but that never stops Bryson from being chatty, down to earth and very, very funny.

And so we travel with Bryson, as he uncovers the many mysteries of the human body and modern medicine. It’s only too easy to take our bodily functions — the skin, the digestive system, the immune system and all the rest of them — for granted, just as we have come to be used to vaccines and antibiotics and modern dentistry. But we only need to look a little bit closer to see just how complex they are, and Bryson’s book does just that. Why does the digestive system do such a good job of killing bacteria but not our own organs? What really lies behind race and skin colour (a “sliver of skin about a millimetre thick,” says Bryson)? How much of us is really us? (Not much — a very large chunk of the cells floating around in us belong to microbes).

Radical discoveries

Bryson doesn’t only talk about the science of the body — he also delves into the history of some of the greatest medical discoveries of our time. Bryson tells us about many unsung heroes, such as Ignaz Semmelweis, who first promoted handwashing to prevent infections in maternity hospitals, Nettie Stevens, whose dogged persistence led to the discovery of the X and Y-chromosomes, and Theodor Bilharz, who died trying to contain typhus in Cairo. A good chunk of the book is devoted to the extraordinary story of William Halsted, the father of modern surgery, who performed a daring gallbladder surgery on the kitchen table before developing the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Bryson also reminds us that the great “accidental” discoveries of medicine may not have been quite as accidental as we think — Alexander Fleming was a persistent and careful scientist, whose discovery of penicillin accompanied some other pathbreaking work on lysozymes to fight infection. Indeed, the petri dishes on which the penicillium grew had been discovered only 50 years before. To get as far as we have — a world with vaccines against infectious diseases, treatments for cancer and higher life expectancies than ever before — we have piggybacked on years of work by many, many great scientists before us.

Like in all of his earlier work, Bryson manages to convey a sense of wonder, as if he can’t quite believe that the human body is all this. The book is peppered with delightful little factoids, such as how passionate kissing can transfer more than one billion bacteria between people. Through this, Bryson’s sense of humour remains intact — he describes sperm cells as “blundering idiots,” “curiously ill-prepared for the one task evolution has given them.”

But The Body isn’t all fun and games. In a more sombre tone than he usually uses, he reminds us that our bodies, designed to keep us from starving in paleolithic winters, cannot quite deal with the abundance of food in our modern lives. Millennials like me might be the first generation not to outlive our parents. Medical care in the United States, advanced as it is, is expensive and inaccessible to many. With the overuse of antibiotics, we may find ourselves gravely unprepared for drug-resistant infections lurking in every scratch of a rose bush. After all, as Bryson reminds us, this is a planet of microbes, which would do just fine without us. We would do well to remember the journey we took to get this far.

414,2020/02/08,‘She Said’ review: Taking on Harvey Weinstein and a colluding system,"In She Said, an unputdownable, thrilling account of The New York Times’ investigation into the sexual allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey are less interested in Weinstein the predator and more eager to draw attention to how the system enables perpetrators. They explain how lawyers and HR personnel, tabloid writers and publishers, managers and publicists, and family and friends work tirelessly and shamelessly to keep the producer’s image clean. Weinstein’s team even hires an Israeli firm to spy on the “cockroach journalists”. The nauseating pattern in Weinstein’s behaviour becomes clear to the journalists soon enough. The women, all unbeknownst to one another, not only narrate the same sequence of events — the bathrobe, the champagne, the hotel suite, the massage, the shower — but also use the same language in describing the experiences that leave them scarred, angry, helpless and compromised.

Tale of cover-ups

But first, getting women to speak even off the record becomes a challenge for Kantor and Twohey. The women are gagged by settlements with shockingly restrictive clauses. They are prohibited from recounting their experiences, keeping evidence, or listening to other survivor’s stories. But their accusations have no impact on Weinstein’s life or actions. The reporters realise that merely recording the experiences of women will not be enough; legal and financial trails need to be exposed. They write: “The settlements didn’t prevent the story; they were the story, a tale of cover-up that illuminated the alleged wrongdoing.”

The book begins on an ironic note. When Kantor first writes to Rose McGowan months after the actress accuses an unnamed producer of having raped her, she declines to speak because of her previous experience of sexism at The New York Times. Kantor doesn’t give up. She and Twohey doggedly pursue sources, knock on doors unannounced, pore over complex legal documents, and continuously corroborate statements. She Said is as much a hat-tip to old-fashioned investigative journalism involving patience and grunt work as it is about a systemic problem across the world.

In what is the most gripping part of the book, the journalists document the final hours before publication. Weinstein storms into NYT to intimidate the journalists and later calls them, alternatively bellowing (“I am a man who has great resources”) and whimpering (“I’m already dead”). Women who are not ready to go on record suddenly change their minds. The lede is rewritten in the last few hours. All the chaos and anticipation that characterise a newsroom before the publication of an important story is captured in these pages.

Women villains

The heroes of the book are the women, of course. Ashley Judd risks a successful Hollywood career to go on record. Zelda Perkins, a Miramax assistant, quits her job after she unsuccessfully confronts her boss about his attempt to rape another assistant, Rowena Chiu. Despite the emotional trauma following the loss of her marriage, and before a second mastectomy surgery, Laura Madden too agrees to go on record. But many of the villains too are women. Lisa Bloom, who champions herself as an advocate for women, bends over backwards to help Weinstein. “You should be the hero of the story, not the villain. This is very doable,” she writes to him in a letter, listing the various ways in which he can be protected. The message is clear: in this toxic system, women are as much the perpetrators as the men.

If the book falls short anywhere, it is towards the end. The detailed descriptions of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings capture the shortcomings of the system and the #MeToo movement, but have little to do with Kantor and Twohey. But this is a minor issue in what is otherwise an exceptional work of journalism and storytelling; the All the President’s Men of today’s age.

415,2020/02/08,‘A Dominant Character: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of J.B.S. Haldane’ review: An unusual life,"It’s rare for a 20th century scientist, who hasn’t bagged a Nobel Prize, to be worthy of a biography. John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (JBS) who died in 1964 already inspired two and A Dominant Character: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of J.B.S. Haldane by journalist Samanth Subramanian, is a new, 21st-century take on the pioneering biologist, ardent Marxist, polymath, anti-establishment newspaper columnist, ordained as the ‘last man who knew all there was to be known’.

Evolution biology

When Europe was in turmoil in the early part of the 20th century, scientists were co-opted by governments at an unprecedented scale to gain an edge on the battlefield. Ideology, nationalism, racism were all stirred with the ladle of evolutionary biology, the other great scientific revolution of its time along with quantum physics.

‘Evo bio’, fashioned by the rudiments of the science of genetics, was a nascent science that probed the mechanism of heredity, the inter-connectedness of life and how this put man in relationship to other beings. One central question was whether genes passed onto offspring could be altered to exhibit desired behaviour. Could winter-varieties of wheat be dunked in cold water and have their genes re-programmed, thereby making them thrive in spring? No, suggested experiments on fruit-flies, observations on the evolution of species and theory — J.B.S. played a major role in explaining all this.

Trofik Lysenko, Soviet biologist and Josef Stalin’s favourite scientist, insisted otherwise. Because he had the dictator’s ear, Soviet scientists who disagreed with Lysenko were isolated, even killed and the redoubtable Haldane, high priest of scientific precision and committed to the dignity and equality of scientists and workers everywhere, was found lacking in his condemnation of Lysenko.

Politics vs. science

J.B.S. was a prominent member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Did politics interfere with his science? He was a patriot — having fought for Britain in World War I and taking on the fascists in Spain — but was also believed to be a Russian spy. Disgusted with Britain, he chose to spend the winter of his life in Bhubaneswar to galvanise biology research in India but true to form, fell out with P.C. Mahalanobis — eminent statistician entrusted with formulating India’s planned economy — who brought J.B.S. to the Indian Statistical Institute.

Wearied by Indian bureaucracy he called the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the network of national labs conceived to aid India's industrial development, the ‘Council for the Suppression of Independent Research.’

Subramanian’s biography is an exquisite literary expedition into J.B.S.’ boyhood, his family history, his schooling. As the son of John Scott Haldane, a physiologist, who didn’t shrink from self-experimentation in the pursuit of scientific truth, J.B.S. imbibed early on that science was about putting oneself at risk to get at the core of deep, interesting questions.

Haldane’s personality, his accomplishment, calibre and the time that he inhabited makes him a naturally compelling subject and much of the facts of his life are well documented, Subramanian gives compelling context.

From the history of the development of biology to the Spanish Civil War, Subramanian skillfully mixes archival research and deep scrutiny of J.B.S.’ work to portray — what can be safely assumed — a breed of scientist almost impossible to imagine today.

416,2020/02/08,‘Resurgent Asia – Diversity in Development’ review: The dramatic Asian turnaround,"Asia’s rise has been a much talked about subject of both academic and policy discussions. It has been clear for a while that the centre of gravity of global economy is, slowly but steadily, shifting to Asia. Deepak Nayyar examines this shift with an intellectual rigour and analytical finesse that has often been missing from this discussion.

Juxtaposing his work against Gunnar Myrdal’s landmark book Asian Drama which was pessimistic about Asia’s economic prospects, Nayyar outlines the remarkable economic transformation in Asia over the last several decades, making the region the veritable engine of global growth. This brings Asia back to the heart of the global economy from its heyday of 1820 when the region accounted for more than one-half of the world income and two-thirds of world population.

Patterns in divergence

Nayyar’s work surveys the last 50 years and provides a data-rich account of the economic development in Asia. It situates this evolution in the wider historical and social context as it underlines the factors that have shaped the economic trajectory of Asia. This brings out the divergences in the historical experiences of Asian countries in the realm of their economic policies. Given the divergences in Asia, this is a remarkable exercise which manages to divine some patterns in the region. These range from the role of investment and savings as well as education to the role of governments in providing the right balance between the state and the market. That he manages to examine broad trends even while being granular in examining individual countries is a tribute to Nayyar’s scholarship.

While most of the book is about examining past trends in Asia, the last chapter is about future challenges. This is a particularly challenging time for the global economy when most of the assumptions of the post World War II economic order are being challenged, mostly by those who had set up this order in the first place. So while the economic transformation in Asia makes the continent a natural pivot of the emerging global economic order, the challenges are huge and are mounting.

Jobless growth

Nayyar talks about growing inequality and jobless growth, the middle-income trap and the need to raise productivity levels and innovation capacities. But he talks less of the backlash against the basic tenets of economic globalisation and how that might impact Asia. This section is rather insignificant. Though understandable, given the focus of the book, it would have been useful to situate the discussion about the future in this broader and rapidly evolving context where the so-called developed world is ready to turn its back on the very principles it was so rapturously enunciating till a few years back.

Balance of power

There is little to contest with Nayyar’s conclusion that Asia’s political and economic significance will continue to rise in the future and that the balance of power is shifting towards Asia. But what complicates Asia’s rise is also geopolitics.

While for economists, it makes sense to think of Asian rise and resurgence, despite all the diversity, the geopolitics of Asian resurgence is where it gets more complicated.

Differences within Asia are so striking that it is almost meaningless to talk of Asia as a whole in a geopolitical sense. Just talking of China and India and their bilateral relationship would make the difficulties inherent in the so-called Asian century apparent. Asian economies might certainly continue to dominate the global economic trajectory, but there is a long leap from there to assuming that this century will be of Asia.

China’s rise

We have already moved on to the Indo-Pacific with all its contending claims and counterclaims. Meanwhile, key economies in the region, including China and India, are slowing down amid underlying conflictual tendencies. The West, especially the U.S., is more determined than ever to preserve its technological advantages over its most likely competitor, China. And China’s rise in Asia is forcing regional players to recalibrate not only their strategic postures but also economic policies.

At a time when the term ‘Asia’s rise’ is thrown around glibly, this book should be read by everyone who is interested in understanding the economic history of the region and what the rise of Asia actually implies. This century may or may not be Asia’s but as Nayyar rightfully argues circa 2050, Asia “will have an economic and political significance in the world that would have been difficult to imagine fifty years ago, even if it was the reality in 1820.”

417,2020/02/08,A new way of getting a sense of how time flows,"Time, as we experience it, flows only in one direction – forward. We cannot easily reverse the ‘arrow of time’ as it is called. An example is that it is easy to squeeze a toothpaste container and bring out the paste, but well-nigh impossible to push it back without making a mess. It is a fascinating exercise to see how physicists view this concept.

Physics and time

The laws of elementary particle physics remain the same when time is reversed. That is, take the questions which govern gravitational, electromagnetic and strong-nuclear forces and replace “t” by “–t” and the equations are invariant. Does this mean that time reversal is indeed a possibility? We do not see it in practice, hence there must be something defining the arrow of time. This is the second law of thermodynamics, which says that a quantity known as the entropy of the system will either remain a constant or increase with time. The entropy is directly related to the disorder in a system. The more the entropy the greater the disorder. So, we can break an egg and go from an ordered state into a disordered state, but the reverse – broken bits of egg joining to form a whole – does not happen. Thus, the direction of increasing entropy determines the arrow of time. This is a popular way of defining the arrow of time.

Energetics and time

Professor Mahendra K. Verma from the Physics Department of IIT Kanpur has come up with a different way of defining the arrow of time, which is described in a paper published in The European Physical Journal B.

The concept is readily illustrated taking the example of milk being stirred into coffee decoction in a cup. First the milk swirls in large blobs, then it dissolves into smaller and smaller blobs until it gets dispersed in the decoction. Therefore, there is a transfer of milk from large blobs to smaller blobs and then to still smaller blobs. In the same way, energy gets transferred from a large scale to the small scale, there by defining a direction for the arrow of time.

Such alternative definitions of arrow of time are needed, for example, in cosmology to explain cosmological models like the oscillating universe. According to this model, the universe, which we know to be expanding, will reach a maximum size and then start contracting once again due to gravity. In such a contracting phase, entropy may actually decrease. If this happens, it will mean the arrow of time defined using entropy will reverse, and that sounds physically impossible.

Oscillating universe

“The second law of thermodynamics encounters difficulties in explaining cosmological arrow of time for oscillating universe. However, energy transfers can predict the arrow of time for the collapsing universe,” says Prof. Verma.

In a gravitating system, such as the collapsing universe, cluster or star formation is somewhat similar to the formation of cyclones or hurricanes. “[In contrast to the example of coffee] here the energy flows from small scales to large scales. For such systems, the clustering or structure formation is in the forward direction of time,” he adds in explanation.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fcbxkd/article30771312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TH-SCICOFFEE-CUPjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-new-way-of-getting-a-sense-of-how-time-flows/article30771313.ece
418,2020/02/08,IIT Madras: candle flame oscillators shine light on combustor stability,"Using stacks of candles tied together, and studying pairs, and quartets, of such candles, an IIT Madras team of researchers has come up with interesting inputs that will help in building combustors in rockets.

We know that Apollo 11 successfully landed men on the Moon in 1969. Stories of the failures that paved the way to this success are less known. One such failure was due to thermo-acoustic failure of the F1 engine of the rocket during a test stand in 1962. When NASA tried to test how to launch the rocket, it just blew apart. The reason was uneven burning of the fuel. Like a candle whose flame flickers due to uneven presence of oxygen around it, the flames inside the F1 engine flickered, only at a higher frequency - an instability that blew the rocket apart. This is called a thermo-acoustic instability, which is another name for high-amplitude pressure oscillations, in the combustor.

Combustors contain several flames due to the presence of multiple fuel injection systems. “The interaction of these flames with the acoustic field (pressure variations) collectively results in the onset of thermo-acoustic instability. In order to understand the interaction between multiple flames in a much simpler and economical environment, we started to study candle-flame oscillators,” says R. I. Sujith in whose lab these experiments were carried out. He is a Chair Professor in Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras.

Candle oscillators

The thermo-acoustic instability problem, and others like it, can be understood, albeit in a scaled-down manner, by studying stacks of two or three candles tied together so that their flames merge. The flames of such candles, when placed beside other candles, oscillate in synchronicity and show a rich variety of phenomena. The IIT Madras researchers have studied such candle flame oscillators and shown experimental manifestations of some phenomena that have hitherto only been known theoretically in oscillators. The research on this has been published in the journals Scientific Reports and Physical Review E.

One such phenomenon is amplitude death, which is the complete quenching of oscillations due to a coupling between the different flames. Another phenomenon is phase-flip bifurcation, which is an abrupt change from in-phase synchronisation to out-of-phase synchronisation.

First study

“Our candle study is the first to experimentally prove the existence of both states in a single system. The coexistence of these two states in a single system brings the possibility of evading undesirable states in various other oscillators,” says Prof. Sujith an author of the papers, in an email to The Hindu. He explains how studies on neural diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease model these conditions as a consequence of the occurrence of the amplitude death state in the neural oscillators. On the other hand, there are systems such as thermo-acoustic oscillators and oscillations of bridges and skyscrapers, where amplitude death is actually a welcome thing.

“The coexistence of the states of amplitude death and phase-flip bifurcation in a single system gives rise to the possibility that a system in which amplitude death state is undesirable can transition to a state of phase-flip bifurcation by varying a system-specific control parameter,” says Prof. Sujith.

Useful inputs

The experiments gave the team useful inputs into the original problem they were interested in – thermo-acoustic phenomena in combustors: “We got very relevant information about placing the injectors or flame locations in the combustor such that they would be inherently stable (or in an amplitude death state),” says Prof. Sujith.

He adds that they believe the study on four candle flame oscillators would help in understanding the interaction of multiple thermo-acoustic systems (more than two), which is practically used in can or can-annular type of gas turbine combustor. “Thus, we will be able to simultaneously control the thermo-acoustic oscillations in all the combustors. We are planning to build a test-rig of this type,” he says.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/g97uo2/article30771293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TH-SCICandlepng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-madras-candle-flame-oscillators-shine-light-on-combustor-stability/article30771294.ece
419,2020/02/08,Question Corner: Exercise and high blood pressure,"Q : Why are people with high blood pressure discouraged from doing exercises that involve lifting weights (isotonic)? What is the mechanism by which aerobics, walking and swimming help in reducing blood pressure?

A:

Dr Vijaya Bharat

Isotonic exercises are high intensity activities for a short duration, like weight lifting. The contracting muscles exert pressure on the arterioles causing increased peripheral vascular resistance which necessitates the heart to pump more forcefully. Increased contractility of the heart muscle and increased vascular resistance increase the blood pressure. Therefore isotonic exercises are to be avoided by those with high blood pressure.

Aerobic exercises like walking, swimming and cycling start gradually and remain sustained for a longer time. This causes dilatation of the arterioles in the muscles in order to supply more blood to the exercising muscles. By increasing the venous blood flow from legs to the heart and by reducing the resistance in the arterioles, the heart is able to pump blood with ease. Regular aerobic exercise reduces blood pressure and improves cardiac function.

420,2020/02/08,Finding the elephant’s long-lost relatives in Kutch,"It was a pleasant January winter morning last year and Ningthoujam Premjit Singh along with his team was out on their excavation work at Kutch. When he stumbled upon a premolar tooth of about 6 cm width and 7 cm length, little did he know that what he held belonged to an extinct ancient elephant called Deinotherium indicum.

First occurrence

Interestingly, this turned out to be the region’s first occurrence of the mammal which weighed between eight and 10 tons in weight. Dr. Singh adds that this new find also expands the distribution range of this species, hitherto only known from two or three localities (Tapar of Gujarat, Haritalyangar in Himachal Pradesh, and Piram Island off the coast of Gujarat). It also increases our understanding of the variations in dental morphology of the South Asian Deinotheres species. Dr. Singh is a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Geology at Panjab University and the first author of the paper recently published in the Journal of Paleontology.

Biostratigraphy

Using a technique called biostratigraphy, it was noted that D. indicum lived roughly between 11 and 7 seven million years ago in India. In biostratigraphy, the presence of certain species from a known time period can be used to estimate the age of a deposit containing the same species in a different locality. “Remains of D. indicum have been found in well-dated Siwalik deposits from Haritalyangar of Himachal Pradesh. Based on the similarity in species, we inferred a similar date for the Kutch’s D. indicum,” Advait M. Jukar from the Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution explains in an email to The Hindu. He is the co-first author and corresponding author of the paper.

He adds that definite dates can only be procured when paleomagnetic and radiometric studies are performed on the rocks that these fossils came from.

When asked how morphologically different this species is from today's elephants, he explained that though they had similar large bodies with column-like limbs, their heads were very different. “They had flatter skulls, and a set of downwards pointing, curved tusks only on the lower jaw. Analyses of their skulls have shown that they probably also had a short, slightly bulbous trunk. If you looked inside their mouths, all of their teeth would have erupted and were used in chewing at the same time. Modern elephants have only one tooth in use on each side of their jaw,” explains Dr. Jukar.

Distant relative

This species was a fairly distant relative of today’s elephants, both evolutionarily and in time. The deinotheriidae, the family that includes D. indicum, was first found in the fossil record approximately 28 million years old in Africa, but the family that includes modern elephants doesn’t appear until about eight million years ago.

The team plans to continue their studies in the Tapar beds of Kutch as it may be hiding many more fossils. “The plan now is to keep describing different species until we have a solid understanding of the diversity of vertebrates from western India. We hope to create a dataset of species occurrences through time in western India and compare the trends in diversity seen there with those seen in the well-studied fossil record from the Siwaliks,” adds Dr. Jukar.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/cf02vy/article30771266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TH-SCIDeinotherium12jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/finding-the-elephants-long-lost-relatives-in-kutch/article30771267.ece
