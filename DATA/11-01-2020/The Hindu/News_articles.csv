0,2020/01/11,Ajeet Kumar defends 5000m run title in style,"Gujarat’s Ajeet Kumar Yadav on Saturday started his campaign at the Khelo India Youth Games by sensationally defending his gold medal in under-21 boys’ 5000m run with a timing of 14:39.99.

The 20-year-old, who had bagged gold medals in 1500m and 5000m last year, was given a close chase by Madhya Pradesh’s Sunil Dawar (14:40.00) and Bahadur Patel (14:41.52).

As many as seven meet records were bettered on the opening day of athletics competition, which saw 13 track and field gold medals on offer. Madhya Pradesh made a mark, picking up three gold.

Uttarakhand broke into the medals chart with Ankita’s gold in the girls’ under-21 5000m in a new meet record time of 16:38.75. She exchanged leads with Gujarat’s Reena Patel before pulling away with a lap and a half to go.

Madhya Pradesh’s Vivek Kumar led a sweep of the medals in boys’ under-17 javelin throw with Rinku Yadav and Mohammed Arif Mansoor joining him on the podium.

Haryana dominated the boys’ under-21 400m with its sprinters Vikrant Panchal, Amit Balyan and Ayush Dabas claiming the medals. Panchal set a new meet record of 47.99 seconds.

Gymnastics

Maharashtra’s Asmi Ankush Badade and Uttar Pradesh’s Jatin Kumar Kanojia joined Tripura’s Priyanka Dasgupta as quadruple gold medal winners in gymnastics.

Kanojia won the parallel bars gold following his boys under-17 artistic gymnastics all-around crown and floor exercises and horizontal bars titles. He wrapped up the competition with six medals.

Archery

World cadet champion Komalika Bari lost to Sakshi Tote of Maharashtra in the second round of the girls’ under-21 recurve competition.

Other familiar names like Akash and B. Dhiraj also suffered reverses.

Maharashtra topped the chart with 27 medals, including seven gold. With 12 medals, including six gold, Uttar Pradesh occupied the second spot while Delhi was third with a total of 12 medals, including five gold.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/khelo-india-ajeet-kumar-defends-5000m-run-title-in-style/article30545632.ece
1,2020/01/11,"Easy for Karthik, Krishna; Five share lead","In sharp contrast to the string of upsets on Friday, games on the leading boards produced anticipated results in the fourth round of the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament here on Saturday.

Five share lead

Five leaders, including Grandmaster Karthik Venkataraman and International Master C.R.G. Krishna, maintained their all-win sequence to reach four points. Six players followed at 3.5 points.

After three rounds of ‘accelerated pairings,’ normal pairings meant at least two overnight leaders got to play against far lower-rated rivals on the third and fourth boards.

The beneficiaries were Karthik and Krishna, who faced rivals who were rated 786 and 924 points lower.

Lop-sided contests

Clearly, the lop-sided nature of pairings on the top four boards saw stronger players winning with black pieces. Of the lot, Niranjan Navalgund fought the toughest against eighth seeded GM Aleksej Aleksandrov and stretched him to 70 moves.

On the top board, Peru’s 18-year-old Grandmaster Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara, seeded four, stopped International Master Himal Gusain in an impressive manner. He traded a rook for a bishop and then used queen and bishop-pair to wreck havoc in 47 moves.

In the games involving those at 2.5 points, seven games ended as draws and four of the five decisive games witnessed victory for those playing with white pieces.

Among these, Indonesia’s Theolifus Taher Yoseph held second seed Pavel Ponkratov, Saptarshi Roy shared a point with third seed M. Karthikeyan, seasoned International Master proved equal to seventh seed Nodirbek Yakubboev and young Sri Lankan Kevin Ranidu Silva (rated 1854) made a mockery of rating by proving equal to 14th seeded GM Alexei Fedorov (2562).

Leading fourth-round results (Indians unless stated): Himal Gusain (3) lost to Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara (Per, 4); Niranjan Navalgund (3) lost to Aleksej Aleksandrov (Blr, 4); Ishvi Aggarwal (3) lost to Karthik Venkataraman (4); Rudrashish Chakraborty (3) lost to C.R.G. Krishna (4); Ziaur Rahman (Ban, 4) bt Abdelrahman Hesham (Egy, 3); Farrukh Amonatov (Tjk, 3.5) bt Al Muthaiah (3); Theolifus Taher Yoseph (Ina, 3) drew with Pavel Ponkratov (Rus, 3); M. Karthikeyan (3) drew with Saptarshi Roy (3); Nodirbek Yaubboev (Uzb, 3) drew with P. Shyam Nikhil (3); Ivan Rozum (Rus, 3.5) bt Marat Dzhumaev (Uzb, 2.5).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/delhi-grandmasters-easy-for-karthik-krishna-five-share-lead/article30545503.ece

6,2020/01/11,Australian Open: Bopanna to pair with Sania,"Former World No. 3 Rohan Bopanna is all set to join hands with six-time Grand Slam champion and former World No. 1 doubles star Sania Mirza at the Australian Open.

After coming close to a medal at the Rio Olympics, when Sania and Bopanna were up a set in the semifinals against Venus Williams and Rajeev Ram, the resolve is to do better at Tokyo.

Fine start

And, Bopanna has made a fine start to the year. Winning a title in the first tournament of the season is not a new experience for Bopanna, but the win this time in Doha, partnering Wesley Koolhof, on Friday was special as it was the first time his seven-month daughter Tridha was in ‘attendance’.

[However, Bopanna’s wife Supriya had to watch from the staircase as children below two years are not allowed inside the stadium.]

That apart, the 39-year-old Bopanna was much relieved that the therapy injections he has had have improved the condition of his knees.

“The first thing I did after winning the title was call Dr. Madan Ballal in Bengaluru. He told me that my determination to get better had also helped in the cure,” said Bopanna, on a brief stop at his home on Saturday before flying to Auckland, where he will partner Henri Kontinen of Finland.

“It was the first time I was playing a match alongside Koolhof, but I had practised with him a lot. We got together because his regular partner, Robin Haase, was playing in the ATP Cup. Also, I could get entry because of his No. 18 rank,” he said.

Even though he would love to partner Divij Sharan in the run-up to the Olympics, Bopanna said he had to be practical and ensure entry by playing big events with better ranked players.

“The goal is to make the cut for the Olympics individually. After that, Divij and I can play the grass-court circuit,” said Bopanna.

New partner

7,2020/01/11,ATP Cup | Spain’s Nadal secures comeback win to set up final against Djokovic-led Serbia,"Rafael Nadal secured a come-back victory against Australia’s Alex De Minaur at the ATP Cup in Sydney on Saturday, propelling Spain into the final of the inaugural event to play the Novak Djokovic-led Serbian team.

The world’s top ranked player was ambushed early by the young Australian, who threatened to run away with the match, before the Spaniard recovered to win 4-6, 7-5, 6-1.

Earlier in the evening, Roberto Bautista Agut played a near flawless match to defeat a misfiring Nick Kyrgios 6-1 6-4, giving Spain an unassailable lead going into the doubles match.

The top 20-ranked De Minaur, who had previously not won a set against the Spaniard, threw his wiry frame at every shot, breaking Nadal’s serve in the first game of the match before going on to take the set.

The 20-year-old hopped into his backhands, such was his determination to throw himself forward, and launched into the air to hit his punishing forehands.

Nadal, one of the most dangerous players to serve against, remarkably did not earn a break point on the Australian’s serve until late in the second set, which he converted despite enjoying little momentum up until that point.

“He had a lot of energy, he plays with a lot of passion, sometimes a little too much,” Nadal said.

Spain has had a punishing schedule leading into the match, which included finishing the previous tie against Belgium in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Nadal reeled off four straight games at the start of the third to set up the victory as De Minaur’s error count rose, and the Spaniard found his range.

LONG RIVALRY

In the other semi-final, Djokovic played strong tactical tennis to overcome the enigmatic Russian Daniil Medvedev, to secure Serbia’s spot in the final.

The Serbian won the contest 6-1 5-7 6-4 after he found success pushing the 198cm (6.5 ft) tall Russian around the court, forcing Medvedev to constantly scrape shots off his shoe laces.

Less than two weeks out from the Australian Open, Djokovic gave the world’s top players a possible blueprint on how to beat the 23-year-old Russian who has been regularly toppling the game’s elite.

While Medvedev’s slapping forehand, flat backhand and big serve have proven hard to counter, Djokovic used dropshots and low slicing backhands to pull the world number five into awkward places.

Earlier, Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic beat his more highly ranked opponent, Russia’s Karen Khachanov, giving Serbia an unassailable 2-0 lead going into the doubles match.

Spain will have an opportunity in Sunday’s final against Serbia to confirm it has the world’s best men’s tennis team, having recently won the revamped Davis Cup and boasting two top 10 players in its ATP Cup side.

But Nadal will likely first need to reverse the momentum in his long rivalry with Djokovic, who has not lost to the Spaniard on hardcourts, like the court surface in Sydney, since 2013.

Nadal said late on Saturday he had not yet formed a game plan.

“No idea yet, I’m just happy for now, tonight, to be where we are,” Nadal said.

8,2020/01/11,del Potro withdraws from Australian Open due to knee problems,"Former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro has pulled out of the upcoming Australian Open starting January 20. del Potro has failed to recover from a knee injury which he suffered during the Wimbledon tune-up at Queen’s in June last year.

“Our two-time quarterfinalist Juan Martin del Potro has withdrawn from Australian Open 2020 as he continues to recover from a knee injury,” the Australian Open tweeted on Saturday.

“Wishing you all the best with your recovery. We hope to see you back in Australia soon,” it added.

del Potro made the last eight at the Melbourne Park in 2009 and 2012. The 31-year-old Argentinian has played just one Australian Open since 2015, reaching the third round two years ago.

Three-time champion Andy Murray and Japanese tennis star Kei Nishikori have already withdrawn from the Australian Open.

The tournament will see players competing for a record AUD 71 million ($ 49.1 million).

The men’s and women’s singles champions will pocket $4.1 million each after officials announced an increase of 13.6% on last year’s purse. Prize money has more than doubled (183.9% increase) from A$25 million in 2011 (10 years).

9,2020/01/11,ASB Classic | Serena Williams to meet Jessica Pegula in final,"Jessica Pegula upset former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday to set up a final at the ASB Classic against top-seeded Serena Williams.

The daughter of Buffalo Bills owners Terry and Kim, Pegula came from a set down to beat formerly top-ranked Wozniacki 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 in Wozniacki’s penultimate tournament before retirement.

The crowd at the Auckland Tennis Center had barely recovered from the shock of Pegula’s victory when Williams joined her in Sunday’s final. Williams took only 45 minutes to overwhelm third-seeded American Amanda Anisimova 6-1, 6-1.

Anisimova wasn’t born when Williams won the first of her 23 Grand Slam titles and had dreamed of one-day playing Williams. But she met Williams in her most dominant form.

“I was definitely in the zone today,” Williams said. “It was just one of those days.

“I knew I was playing a really, really great player and an even better person so I knew I had to come out serious.

“It feels good. I’ve been working really hard for a couple of years - my daughter’s only two - and I seem to be really hard on myself. But considering everything it’s really good.”

Anisimova, who lifted her ranking from 99 to 24 in 2019 and ousted Eugenie Bouchard on her way to the semifinal, had no answer for Williams’ power Saturday. She was broken in her opening service game and again in the third and seventh games of the first set.

Williams broke in the second and fourth games of the second set to lead 4-0.

The match contrasted sharply with the clash between Wozniacki and Pegula which lasted almost two hours.

Pegula broke Wozniacki’s serve in the first game of the match, immediately dropped her own and was broken again in the sixth game and Wozniacki went a set up after only 43 minutes.

Agressive play

But Pegula stepped up in the second set and played more aggressively than Wozniacki, controlling the match from the baseline. She was able to move Wozniacki around the court and to change pace of her ground strokes, particularly to lift the pace of her cross-court forehand. Wozniacki was more defensive and struggled to match the 25-year-old American.

Pegula broke Wozniacki’s serve in the second game of the second set, gave up a break at 2-2 but broke again in the 10th game to take the set.

She was dominant in the third set, breaking Wozniacki in the second, fourth and sixth games to surge into her third WTA final.

“Caroline has had an amazing career and I know she’s retiring so I had to work really hard but I’m just happy to get the win and I’m pleased to be in the final,” Pegula said. “I definitely knew if I was going to play defensive I wasn’t going to win that battle because she’s the best in the world at that.

“So I knew I just had to step in and take my chances and just trust my game.”

Wozniacki remains in contention for a title in Auckland. She and Williams will combine Sunday in the doubles final.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/xfdyod/article30541802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDPEGULA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/asb-classic-serena-williams-to-meet-jessica-pegula-in-final/article30541803.ece

12,2020/01/11,"Ukraine demands justice, compensation","Ukraine on Saturday demanded that Iran punish those guilty for the downing of a Ukrainian airliner and compensate victims while praising Tehran for cooperating with an “objective” investigation.

Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky was due to discuss the incident with his Iranian counterpart President Hassan Rouhani, his press office said. “We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts,” the Ukrainian leader wrote on Facebook, calling also for the “payment of compensation” and the return of remains.

Tehran admitted on Saturday that it accidentally downed the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) plane, killing all 176 people on board on Wednesday, shortly after launching missiles at bases hosting US forces in Iraq.

Tehran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation. Kiev said that Iran had cooperated with its experts and it expects an objective probe.

Tehran has handed Ukrainian experts enough data including “all the photos, videos and other materials” to show the investigation “will be carried out objectively and promptly,” Mr. Zelensky’s office said. “The political part of the work is finished,” it added. It published photos of experts examining the scene and close-ups of holes in the fuselage and shrapnel damage.

Ukraine said on Friday its experts dispatched to Iran had been granted access to the flight’s black boxes, debris from the plane, the crash site and to recordings of conversations between the pilot and the airport control tower.

Independent inquiry

Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council which is coordinating the probe, said Kiev did not yet have evidence on where the missile was produced, only that it was “launched from Iranian soil.” Mr. Zelensky said earlier that Ukraine hoped the inquiry would be pursued “without deliberate delay and without obstruction.” He urged “total access” for the 45 Ukrainian experts, and in a tweet also sought an “official apology”.

UIA vice president Igor Sosnovsky told a news conference in Kiev on Saturday that Tehran should have closed the airport due to the escalation of regional tensions following the U.S. assassination of a top Iranian general.

The majority of passengers on UIA Flight PS752 from Tehran to Kiev were Iranian-Canadian dual nationals but also included Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said closure and accountability were needed. He also demanded “transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims”. “This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together.”

It is Iran’s worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the U.S. military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.

Video footage of the incident, which The New York Times said it had verified, emerged and appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.

13,2020/01/11,The Sultan who shielded Oman from regional turmoil,"Oman’s Sultan Qaboos, who died on Friday aged 79, transformed the former Arabian Peninsula backwater into a modern state and sought-after mediator while shielding the sultanate from a region in turmoil.

The intensely private Sultan — the longest-reigning ruler in the modern Arab world — left no apparent heir and the royal family was charged with selecting a successor. Instead, however, they opted for the Sultan’s own choice, his cousin Haitham bin Tariq, who was named in a sealed letter that Sultan Qaboos had prepared in case of a deadlock.

Sultan Qaboos was born on November 18, 1940, into the centuries-old Al-Said dynasty in the southern provincial capital of Salalah, in an isolated country on the margins of the modern world. The young Qaboos was sent abroad for his education to Britain, attending the elite Sandhurst Royal Military Academy from where he graduated in 1962.

He went on to join a British infantry battalion in Germany, returning home to bide his time under the close watch of his father, Sultan Said bin Taymur. On July 23, 1970, he deposed his father in a palace coup, pledging “a new era” for the nation.

Good ties with rivals

Oman is strategically located on the Strait of Hormuz — the narrow seaway through which much of the world’s oil supply passes — and between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. Sultan Qaboos maintained good ties with both nations, a balancing act that made his capital a must-stop for Western and Arab diplomats as well as military chiefs alike.

The Sultan’s first foreign trip was to Iran, whose Shah — along with the British — helped him quell the Marxist insurgency he inherited from his father in the restive Dhofar region. Those ties endured through Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution that ushered in a Shia theocracy. Muscat would serve as the back channel for talks between the United States and Iran in the lead-up to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.

Neutrality over Yemen

Sultan Qaboos also worked to preserve ties with Saudi Arabia and the rest of the wealthy six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to which Oman belongs, but stuck to his principle of non-interference.

In 2015, Oman was the only GCC country not to join a Saudi-led military coalition against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen. It leveraged this neutrality to mediate the release of multiple foreign hostages captured by Yemen’s warring factions. Muscat also maintained close military and economic ties with Britain and the U.S. Unlike other Arab states, Sultan Qaboos did not contest Egypt’s 1979 peace treaty with Israel, opening a trade office in Tel Aviv in the mid-1990s — shuttered in 2000 during a Palestinian uprising.

Arab Spring protests

Sultan Qaboos faced rare protests at the height of the Arab Spring in 2011 and responded by sacking Ministers accused of corruption. But his government left no space for opposition, shuttering the independent Azzaman newspaper and jailing its editor as well as the writer of a critical article.

Sultan Qaboos assumed power as an unknown and spent his first years cultivating the respect of his countrymen, from the mountainous interior to the coast.

He channelled revenues from fledgling oil exports into infrastructure, taking the country from having just a handful of primary schools and some 8 km of paved roads to a modern state with well over 1,000 schools and a massive highway network.

But Sultan Qaboos was no ceremonial monarch. He held every top post, from Commander of the Armed Forces to Finance Minister.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9hkejk/article30545439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12-OMAN-KING1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-sultan-who-shielded-oman-from-regional-turmoil/article30545440.ece
14,2020/01/11,"Sleepless, penniless and hopeless on Brazilian streets","Last Sunday, Carlos da Silva, a 39-year-old homeless man, was sleeping on a pad of flattened cardboard boxes at a footpath in the city’s eastern quarters, when a man tip-toed on him and doused the ground with a liquid before throwing a burning match-stick into it. As the flammable liquid exploded, the man ran away and Mr. Da Silva turned into a ball of fire. But Mr. Da Silva dragged himself across the street, screaming for help. When he was taken to a hospital, he had 70% burns. He was declared dead. The police found a gallon of fuel at the site of crime, but they have not found the perpetrator yet. Most homeless persons in the area vanished the next day.

As the number of homeless people increases on the streets of this megalopolis, so are violent attacks on them. They live in constant fear.

Living on the edge

In a damp corner of a tunnel that connects the city’s posh neighbourhoods with Avenida Paulista, the Manhattan-like area of glass-and-chrome towers, Janice, 28, lives with her two children and a dog. The area is littered with plastic bags, wet blankets and broken trolleys. The stench is unbearable. But Janice calls it home, which her family shares with 20 other persons and five dogs. “We are always on the edge, ready to run. Sometimes, the municipal workers come here and splash us with water. Sometimes, the police kick us out,” said Ms. Janice. “I have nowhere to go,” said the woman who worked as a cleaning staff in a bakery for seven years, before losing her job, savings and house in the past three years.

According to the National Survey on the Homeless Population released in May 2019 by the Ministry of Citizenship, Brazil today has more than 1,17,000 homeless people; and in the past seven years, the number of homeless families has increased about 16 times. As per the government survey, of all homeless people in the country, 82% are men between 25 and 44 years of age; 67% of them are either brown or black; and 64% of them had not completed primary education. With its economy grinding to a halt and extreme austerity measures being imposed on the population in the past three years, the homeless population has exploded across the country. “We have abandoned the most vulnerable people of our society by cutting massively on social welfare. Out of job and money, people are living on the streets. This is also creating social tensions as petty crimes go up,” says a federal Ministry of Health official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We are staring at a major social problem.”

The people who are bearing the brunt of this problem are those who have no roof over their heads, little money to eat and who are constantly pushed around by the police and ordinary people who see them as potential criminals. As per the Ministry of Health records, there were 17,386 cases of violence between 2015 and 2017, in which the primary reason was the victim’s homeless condition. There has been a huge spike in attacks on homeless people in Rio de Janeiro, where their numbers have tripled in the last few years to 15,000, including thousands who went there from other States for work before the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics and then lost their jobs. “Just three years ago, there were very few people living on the streets here. Now, even the touristy areas are full of them,” says Jose Moreira, a resident of Copacabana. “The middle-class residents want them kicked out. There is a lot of tension in the air.”

3,58,000 apartments needed

Rio, which is almost bankrupt, is facing a huge challenge but São Paulo is not doing any better. According to State government estimates, to end the housing deficit in the city, São Paulo needs to build 3,58,000 apartments or houses at the cost of $13 billion. Neither the city nor the State and federal government is talking about tackling the problem. To make the situation worse, an ambitious plan launched by the Workers Party government to provide low-cost housing to families making under $550 per month has suffered deep cuts, with the number of units dropping by 5,00,000 between 2013 and 2016.

In such dire conditions, the homeless in São Paulo — and other cities — have taken to occupying old and abandoned buildings, mostly in downtown areas. Many of these buildings are decrepit but they give a shelter and a sense of security to homeless families. “I can’t sleep at night as I am worried about my children,” says Janice, who is looking for a place in an “occupied” building. “At least, someone will not burn you alive while you are sleeping.”

Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin shook hands at the start of the meeting which the German leader said would cover topics, including turmoil in Libya and the Syria conflict as well as Ukraine’s war with pro-Russian separatists.

“There is a lot to discuss,” said Ms. Merkel, adding that “talking with one another is always better than talking about one another.” Mr. Putin thanked the Chancellor for visiting and said they would focus on “the hottest” topics.

Germany and Russia said ahead of the talks that they would cover the confrontation between Washington and Tehran over the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general and turmoil in Libya. The visit by Ms. Merkel was her first to Russia since May 2018 when the leaders met at Mr. Putin’s Black Sea residence.

Mr. Putin visited Syria and Turkey this week and is keen to stress his role as a regional powerbroker. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who accompanied Ms. Merkel, said a “key reason” for the meeting was the escalating crisis in Libya, where Berlin is acting as a mediator in a conflict he has warned could become a “second Syria”. Ms. Merkel is to invite Mr. Putin to a Berlin conference on Libya later this month, diplomatic sources told AFP. Mr. Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a ceasefire in Libya on Wednesday, although they are seen as supporting opposing sides in the conflict.

Reiterating the stand, Javid Faisal, a spokesperson for Afghan National Security Council, told this writer that the government remained concerned about recent developments.

“We hope the two countries will find a smooth way forward through dialogue,” he said. Despite rivalries, both the U.S. and Iran remain close allies of Afghanistan, raising fears that the war-torn nation could get caught in the escalating conflict. However, Mr. Faisal assured that the government was committed to not allow the use of Afghanistan against other countries.

“We assure our neighbours that the Afghan soil would not be used against other countries and expressed the hope that Iran would continue to play a positive role in Afghanistan,” he said.

A haven for fleeing Hazara Shias

Millions of Afghans sought refugee in Iran at the height of the Afghan war, and the U.S.’s arch-rival also remains one of the largest hosts to displaced Afghans, the majority of whom are from the Hazara Shia minority. This dynamic is further complicated by the fact that many Afghan refugees have been recruited into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Qods Force to fight as foot soldiers in Syria. Over 20,000 Afghans were drafted into the Fatemiyoun division of the Qods Force and deployed in Syria.

Meanwhile, the Taliban’s leadership has also condemned the killing of Soleimani by “barbaric American forces,” according to a report. It has also warned of consequences, a surprising development considering that Solemani had reportedly supported Afghanistan’s Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban.

Soleimani, who commanded the Qods Force, was responsible for strategising the recruitment using a combination of financial incentives, coercion and ideological motivators. “In the last five years that I have followed the issue, I have seen Soleimani meet with commanders and fighters on the front-line. He met families of fallen Fatemiyoun...,” remarked a senior Afghan analyst. On the other hand, Soleimani’s replacement, Esmail Qa’ani, hasn’t really had much of a public profile, he said. “I don’t ever remember Qa’ani in any of those photos. Also, I haven’t seen him mentioned in any of the Fatemiyoun propaganda reports, which are replete with mentions of Soleimani,” he pointed out.

According to the analyst, Qa’ani is a more cautious operator, and prefers to stay in the shadows. “You can tell this is true by looking at his history in Afghanistan: He has visited the country and met with Governors, but few people noticed it,” he said.

However, despite the discreet nature of Qa’ani’s personality, his appointment raised concerns among Afghans. Photos have surfaced on social media showing Qa’ani in the central province of Bamiyan, and another of him inspecting maps of the Salma Dam. However, the Afghan analyst dismissed these concerns. Salma Dam, located in western province of Herat that shares a border with Iran, was rebuilt by the Indian government in 2017. The dam reduced Afghanistan’s power dependency on neighbouring countries and also irrigates 75,000 hectares of land. However, the project in effect cut down the downstream flow of Harirud river into Iran, causing discontentment and concern.

No change in direction

The analyst also pointed out that Iran had decided much earlier that Qa’ani would succeed Soleimani. “Qa’ani was second in command and came up automatically. That’s how Fatemiyoun works; there’s no new headhunting for a leader...,” he explained, adding that real clues were more in the statements coming from Iran.

In a decree issued on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, “The orders for the (Qods) Force remain exactly as they were during the leadership of martyr Soleimani. I call on the members of the force to be present and cooperate with General Qa’ani.” This indicated that the Qods Force, as under Soleimani, will continue to operate in the same capacity, including with the involvement of the foreign militia.

18,2020/01/11,"After Soleimani’s killing, Russia moves to push its agenda in W. Asia","On January 7, as Russia celebrated Christmas, President Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit to Damascus and met his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad, before heading to Turkey, where he was set to launch TurkStream gas pipeline project.

This was Mr. Putin’s second visit to Syria since the start of almost nine-year long war and his first to the country’s capital.

Hours after the Putin-Assad meeting, Iran fired missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq in retaliation to the killing of Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. Then, the Ukrainian plane crashed near Tehran killing 176 people — Iran would later admit it was “unintentionally” shot down by its military. But, as the developments on U.S.-Iran escalation played in the background, Mr. Putin proceeded to Istanbul, where, with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he launched the TurkStream gas pipeline.

Halting military action in Libya

Speaking about the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the two leaders “spoke assertively in favour of resolving all the issues in the Persian Gulf and the region in general solely by peaceful means and in line with international law”. One of the major outcomes of the bilateral talks was a call to immediately stop military action in Libya and declare a ceasefire from midnight of January 12, showcasing Russia’s determination to push its agenda in the region.

Mr. Putin’s surprise visit to Damascus was important for the very same reason: with the assassination of Soleimani, Russia’s military had lost an important connection in Syria as it was the Iranian general who was responsible for coordinating all the pro-Iran forces there.

Experts believe both visits showcased Russia’s will to cement its positions in West Asia and North Africa region. This could also be seen as a sign to regional powers that Russia is a stable and reliable partner, unlike the U.S., which has yet again put the already-unstable region on the verge of a new war.

According to Konstantin Kosachev, Chairman of the Committee on International Affairs of the Federation Council of Russia’s Parliament, the visits of Mr. Putin to Syria and Turkey were highly symbolic. “While they were planned following their own natural course, they have very clearly demonstrated once again that Russia, unlike the U.S., has its own creative and constructive programme of action in the region, devoid of emotions and conjuncture, aimed at strategic perspective and not at election cycles,” Mr. Kosachev wrote in his commentary in Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

“That is why Russia does not have a single irreconcilable enemy in this region, but instead is getting more and more partners. Iran, Iraq and Turkey, as well as Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are among them, as paradoxical as it may seem from Washington...,” he added.

Diversification of ties

Dmitry Suslov, an analyst at the Valdai Club think-tank agreed. “Tactically, the most important question now is how the ongoing crisis between the U.S. and Iran will affect the balance of power in the Middle East. It seems that it would lead to the weakening of the positions of both Iran and the United States and the strengthening of the positions of other players, and first of all, Russia and Turkey,” he said.

He added that by assassinating Soleimani, the U.S. had forced everyone in the region, including its own allies, to look up to other partners and try to diversify their military-political ties. He believed this could strengthen Russia’s position in the region as it could be seen as an alternative to the U.S., provided Moscow uses the opportunity smartly.

The challenge for Russia is to continue manoeuvring between the conflicting interests of its regional partners. So far it has been managing the task well, experts added.

This has implications for India as well as it could bring a new dimension to Indo-Russian cooperation, both in economic and military domains, believed Alexey Kupriyanov, Senior Research Fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences. “Russia is being vocal that it needs partners to restore life and infrastructure Syria and India could become such partner with Indian companies participating in the projects...,” Mr. Kupriyanov told The Hindu.

India and Russia could also expand their engagement in the northern and western parts of the Indian Ocean. Experts believe India could take advantage of Russia, its long-term privileged strategic partner, emerging as an important and predictable player in this region.

19,2020/01/11,"This Independence Day, the anthem may not be sung in Tamil","More than three decades after Sri Lanka recognised Tamil as an official language like Sinhala, you would expect a debate on singing the national anthem in Tamil to be redundant. However, a controversy erupted recently after local media reported the Public Administration Ministry’s decision to drop the Tamil version of the country’s national anthem from its Independence Day celebration.

This would effectively reverse a practice that former President Maithripala Sirisena re-introduced a year after he was elected to the country’s top post on the promise of good governance and reconciliation with the Tamil minority. On February 4, 2016, the Tamil national anthem was sung at the Independence Day celebrations for the first time since 1949, when it was last sung on the occasion, a year after the erstwhile-Ceylon gained Independence.

Several Tamils saw it as an important symbolic gesture, signalling a possible departure in state policy towards minority Tamils. There was opposition too, including from former President Mahimda Rajapaksa and an angry citizen, who filed a fundamental rights petition challenging the move.

And now, in the first Independence Day celebration since President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s big election win, made possible by a decisive mandate from the southern Sinhala Buddhist majority, the decision to drop the Tamil anthem has drawn much attention.

There are different shades of opinion on the issue, from varied political standpoints. “We have only one national anthem, there is no reason to sing it in two languages,” Ramesh Pathirana, a Cabinet spokesman told local media.

Some Tamils argued that the decision made little material difference to the lives of Tamils, who have been denied their rights for decades. In their view, even when the anthem was sung in Tamil, it was at best symbolic in the absence of concrete action or progress on their political demands since the war ended in 2009.

No sign of resistance

Tweeting on the development, K. Guruparan, lawyer and senior lecturer at the University of Jaffna said: “I have no interest in singing the national anthem in Tamil, but while the Citizenship Amendment Act led to mass protests in India, in Sri Lanka the ‘6.9 million want to sing the national anthem in Sinhala’ argument is met with silence on the streets.”

Mr. Guruparan was referring to the figure quoted by Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena, who had said the decision to have the national anthem sung in Sinhala alone had the consent of 6.9 million Sri Lankans.

The Tamil political leadership has also weighed in. Tamil National Alliance (TNA) spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said he saw the move as being part of a plan to make Tamils “second-class citizens”. He said the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration was taking steps to widen the gap among people belonging to the two communities, instead of taking steps to promote unity and reconciliation. “If the government wants the Tamils not to sing the national anthem, we will be glad not to sing it,” he said.

Another popular argument referenced India and its own national anthem. Despite many languages, if India could sing the national anthem in one language, why must Sri Lanka have two versions, some asked. The context is very different, others rebutted, pointing to the history of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, in which the Tamil language or the refusal to recognise it has figured repeatedly. ‘Sri Lanka Thaaye’, the Tamil version of the anthem, is a translation by poet Nallathambi of Vaddukoddai. It sounds exactly like the Sinhala original ‘Sri Lanka Maatha’ composed by Ananda Samarakoon, a disciple of Rabindranath Tagore. It has a familiar ring of Rabindra Sangeet. For citizens however, a national anthem is more than just a song.

In a recent intervention in Parliament, TNA leader R. Sampanthan observed that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa polled nearly seven million votes of the country. “85% of the Tamil people, on our call, voted against him; he could not capture their vote. You cannot capture their vote with henchmen; you cannot capture their vote with stooges. You will only capture their vote with the support of people who understand the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil people, their civilisation, their traditions, their language, their culture, their dignity and their self-respect. Those are fundamental.”

Allowing the national anthem to be sung in both official languages of the country could be merely symbolic. But symbolic actions often bear more significance in their deliberate omission than in their inclusion.

20,2020/01/11,Trump’s birthday greetings to Kim not enough to restart talks: N. Korea,"North Korea has received birthday greetings to its leader Kim Jong-un from U.S. President Donald Trump, but their personal relationship is not enough for a return to talks, according to a statement published by state news agency KCNA.

The comments on Saturday come against the backdrop of stalled denuclearisation talks following a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea in 2018 and early 2019.

While Mr. Kim could personally like Mr. Trump, he would not lead his country on the basis of personal feelings, Kim Kye-gwan, an adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said in the statement. “Although Chairman Kim Jong-un has good personal feelings about President Trump, they are, in the true sense of the word, ‘personal’,” he said. “We have been deceived by the United States, being caught in the dialogue with it for over one year and a half, and that was the lost time for us.”

North Korea will not discuss proposals such as those Mr. Trump made at his last summit with Mr. Kim in Hanoi in February 2019, the Foreign Ministry adviser said. The North will not give up its nuclear facilities for partial sanctions relief, and will only return to talks when the U.S. makes concessions, he added. “The reopening of dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. may be possible only under the condition of the latter’s absolute agreement on the issues raised by the former, but we know well that the U.S. is neither ready nor able to do so.”

‘Seoul not a mediator’

The North Korean adviser also cautioned South Korea to steer clear of ties between the North and the U.S., saying it should not seek “to play a mediator role”.

On Friday, a South Korean official said Mr. Trump had asked the South Koreans to pass on birthday greetings to North Korea. For South Korea to meddle in personal relations between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump was “presumptuous”, the North Korean adviser said, adding that the North had already directly received from Mr. Trump a letter with the greetings.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ttbbvf/article30455481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/North-Korea-s-KGLS6U5B0R3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-birthday-greetings-to-kim-not-enough-to-restart-talks-n-korea/article30544988.ece
21,2020/01/11,Boris Johnson says Iran plane crash shows it is vital to de-escalate tensions,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger jet in Iran reinforced the importance of de-escalating tensions in the Middle East.

“Iran’s admission that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by mistake by its own armed forces is an important first step,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement.

Four British nationals were among the 176 people killed in Wednesday's crash.

“We now need a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died. The UK will work closely with Canada, Ukraine and our other international partners affected by this accident to ensure this happens,” Mr. Johnson said.

“We can all see very clearly that further conflict will only lead to more loss and tragedy. It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward.”

Iran said earlier that its military had mistakenly shot down the plane, saying air defences were fired in error while on alert in the tense aftermath of Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq.

Iran’s armed forces say they mistook the passenger plane for a hostile target in the tense aftermath of Iran’s ballistic missile attack on two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.

24,2020/01/11,Death toll in Pakistan mosque bombing rises to 15,"The death toll from a suicide bombing at a mosque in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta rose to 15 on Saturday, officials said. The blast during Friday evening prayers wounded at least 20 other people, police said.

“Two of the wounded people died overnight in the hospital,” said provincial home minister Zia Langove, adding that six people were still in a critical condition.

Islamic State claimed its suicide bomber carried out the attack to target an Afghan Taliban seminary. “The U.S. condemns this heinous terrorist attack in a place of worship,” Paul Jones, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, said in a statement. “I extend our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives.”

The attack was the second in the city this week, while police said they had foiled another by killing a suicide attacker in Rawalpindi city near Islamabad after he shot and killed two policemen.

The Taliban denied in a statement that some of its members, including a senior commander, were killed.

25,2020/01/11,Oman names Culture Minister as successor to Sultan Qaboos,"Oman announced on Saturday that culture minister Haitham bin Tariq Al Said has been named as the new ruler of the Arabian country and the successor to longtime ruler Sultan Qaboos.

The announcement came as Omanis lined the streets of the capital, Muscat, to catch a glimpse of the motorcade carrying the body of Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who died hours earlier at the age of 79.

Qaboos was the Middle East’s longest-ruling monarch, seizing power in a 1970 palace coup. He was known internationally for his diplomatic balancing in the volatile Persian Gulf. The ruler often served as a facilitator of talks between adversaries Iran and the U.S.

Soldiers stood guard along the streets and troops stood in machine gun nests atop SUVs as citizens and residents of Oman gathered along a highway to see the motorcade carrying the sultan’s body for burial.

Oman state TV said authorities had opened a letter by Sultan Qaboos bin Said naming his successor, without elaborating. State TV then announced shortly after that Haitham bin Tariq Al Said is the country’s ruling sultan.

Oman’s Defense Council had earlier said it met with the Royal Family Council, inviting its members to select a successor.

According to Oman’s succession laws, if the family council cannot agree on a successor the country’s authorities are to unseal a letter written by Sultan Qaboos containing his choice for successor.

Al Said, who was serving as the Minister of National Heritage and Culture, often played an important diplomatic role, representing Oman abroad and welcoming Britain’s Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, for example, upon their arrival to the country for a visit in 2016.

A top diplomat in the United Arab Emirates described Qaboos as a “wise and inspiring leader” and extended his country’s sincere condolences to the people of Oman.

""Today we lost a historic and renaissance figure of high class with the death of Sultan Qaboos,” UAE’s Minister of State or Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter.

In the United States, former President George W. Bush issued a statement saying that he and former first lady Laura Bush are saddened by the sultan’s death.

""He was a stable force in the Middle East and a strong U.S. ally. His Majesty had a vision for a modern, prosperous, and peaceful Oman, and he willed that vision into reality,” Bush said, adding that he and his wife visited him in Muscat last fall.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s2x2bf/article30541979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OMAN-SULTANSUCCESSOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oman-names-culture-minister-as-successor-to-sultan-qaboos/article30541980.ece
26,2020/01/11,Shringla would be captain of India-U.S. ties as Foreign Secretary: official,"In his capacity as India’s foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla would be the “captain of India-US relationship”, a top American diplomat has said at a farewell reception for the outgoing envoy.

Mr. Shringla, who has been appointed as India’s next foreign secretary, leaves Washington DC for India over the weekend to assume the responsibilities of his new assignment later this month.

A 1984-batch foreign service officer successfully served as India’s Ambassador to the US for about a year.

“We are delighted that Ambassador Shringla will be going on to become Foreign Secretary because in that position we know that we’re going to have a captain of the relationship and somebody who will be committed to doing the delicate work that needs to be done to stitch two very important countries together,” Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Alice G Wells, said at the farewell reception.

U.S. Chief of Protocol Can Henderson hosted a rare reception for Shringla at the historic Blair House that was attended by top officials from the White House, Pentagon, State Department, Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representatives.

The Blair House reception for an outgoing envoy is normally reserved only for a few countries. India has emerged as one of them. Previously it was normally done at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department.

Ms. Wells, who is headed to India next week to attend the Raisina Dialogue, said that the two countries have been working for the last two decades to realise the goal of becoming “a natural partner”, a term that was coined during the tenure of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

“It has been extraordinary, what you have been able to achieve,” she said.

In his brief remarks, Mr. Shringla said: “The year has been an intense year.

In the second half of the last year, there were as many as four meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, in addition to the two phone calls between them.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited the U.S. twice including the one for the successful 2+2 dialogue in December. The year also saw visits by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Similarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited India. To cap it all was the historic Howdy Modi event in Houston wherein Trump joined Modi to address a strong crowd of 50,000 Indian Americans.

“It has been a great tenure, not just by the way of activity, but I think I’ve enjoyed every moment of the time that I’ve been here,” Mr. Shringla said as he echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in describing United States as India’s partner of choice.

“I leave here with the sense that this is one of our most important relationships... the words of our prime minister constantly came to my mind, when he said that the United States is a partner of choice when it comes to the socioeconomic transformation of India through our flagship scheme and initiatives.

“I think that’s what is important. As we develop and as we move forward, the U.S. is the country that offers us the means and the ability and the capacity to achieve our objectives in developmental terms, technology terms, investment terms and in every way possible. So, as I go back to New Delhi, we look forward to expanding on the relationship, broadening it and deepening it,” Mr. Shringla added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cd58pb/article29722875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shringla2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/shringla-would-be-captain-of-india-us-ties-as-foreign-secretary-official/article30541813.ece
27,2020/01/11,"Trump goes out of his way to take a bow, again","It was wonderful news- Researchers reported earlier this week the largest-ever one-year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate during 2017. And President Donald Trump didn’t miss the chance to take a bow.

Mr. Trump tweeted- “U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration.”

While many presidents have acted as the cheerleader-in-chief for the good things that happened on their watch, the cancer tweet showed how the president has taken the art of self-marketing to a whole new level.

From foreign policy initiatives to the choice of music at White House events, from the prevalence of “Merry Christmas” greetings to the title of the new USMCA trade deal, Mr. Trump is happy to give himself a public pat on the back - repeatedly - for his great ideas.

As for cancer, the record drop occurred during Trump’s first year in office and was part of a long-running drop that began nearly three decades ago as declining smoking rates and advances in treatment have led to falling rates of lung cancer illnesses and deaths.

But for the president, it was another message well received by his throngs of Twitter followers, with more than 161,000 people liking his tweet and another 25,000 retweeting it as of Friday.

It was all a bit much for Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, a breast cancer survivor.

""Cancer rates dropped before you took office. Hopefully they keep dropping because Congress rejected your cruel research budgets, which sought billions in CUTS to NIH and the National Cancer Institute. This is good news despite you - not because of you,” she tweeted.

The president has supported cutting funding for the agency that oversees health research, although Congress has rejected his recommendations. In the current fiscal year, Mr. Trump recommended cutting more than $4.5 billion in funding from the National Institutes of Health. In the end, he signed into law a $2.6 billion boost.

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center, said there is a sound strategy to the president’s efforts.

""To the extent that basically everything in the world that you like he’s taking credit for, he’s making more salient that your world is filled with positive things while he’s president, whether he deserves credit or not,” Ms. Jamieson said.

Mr. Trump also extended credit-taking this past week to international affairs.

At a rally on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had a hand in the latest Nobel Peace Prize, which went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

""I made a deal, I saved a country,” Mr. Trump said without mentioning the country by name. “And I just heard the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. ... Did I have something to do with it? Yeah. But that’s the way it is.”

Mr. Ahmed accepted the prize in December for making peace with longtime rival Eritrea and other reforms.

A senior Ethiopian official told the remarks referred to a different issue - preventing further tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt over a massive dam that Ethiopia is completing on the Nile river. Egypt says the dam threatens its water supply. Ethiopia says it’s needed for development.

The official asserted that Egypt’s president lobbied Mr. Trump over the disputed dam project, leading to the U.S. taking a role in the discussions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media on the matter.

""President Trump really believes he avoided a war as such but that was not the case,” the official said.

The president can cite strong economic numbers to go with his presidency - and does he ever.

The stock market regularly hits new records. The unemployment rate is low. Economic progress is the kind of bread-and-butter boasting all presidents do, regardless of how much responsibility they ultimately bear for that progress.

Jamieson said that fits with the public traditionally giving the incumbent credit when the economy is doing well and blame when it’s not - regardless of whether it’s deserved. She said that by veering into categories such as cancer, which has touched and scarred virtually every family at some point, he runs the risk of the many voters doing a double-take and asking what specifically he did.

""By taking credit for things that he obviously does not deserve credit for, such as the drop in the cancer death rate, you raise the possibility that the public will say, ‘What else is he taking credit for that he should not get credit for?’” Jamieson said.

While Jamieson sees strategy in the president’s credit-taking, others see a personality trait - and not necessarily a healthy one.

Wayne Fields, author of “Union of Words- A History of Presidential Eloquence,” said he couldn’t think of another president who approaches Trump’s level when it comes to self-congratulation.

Fields said- “Some will say this is just part of his routine, this is just part of his act. It may be, but I also think it’s part of his character and part of his need.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/br1iio/article30541684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ETHIOPIATRUMPNOBELPRIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-goes-out-of-his-way-to-take-a-bow-again/article30541685.ece

An investigation found that Mr. Hu had “lost his ideals and convictions” and had committed violations such as using his post to illegally benefit others, abusing his power, and allowing his family members to “complain about property”, said the statement by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI).

The CCDI also said it would seize his illegal income and transfer his case to the judicial bodies. Reuters was unable to reach Hu for comment.

The graft watchdog in July announced that Mr. Hu was being investigated for suspected serious violations of discipline, though at the time it did not give any details of the breaches.

President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping anti-corruption drive that has ensnared numerous top officials since he took office in 2012.

Hu joined the China Development Bank in 2013 and was also the top official of the ruling Communist Party unit at the policy bank. He stepped down in September 2018.

The following month, his name emerged during the high-profile graft trial of a party official, Wang Sanyun, who had been the party chief of Gansu province from 2011 to 2017.

In that case, prosecutors said that Hu in his previous role as chairman of Bank of Communications had channelled bribes to Wang on behalf of Ye Jianming, the former chairman of the once high-flying conglomerate CEFC China Energy, China's official CCTV reported in 2018.

29,2020/01/11,Japan seeks Interpol wanted notice for wife of ex Nissan boss,"Japanese authorities have requested the International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO) for an Interpol wanted notice for the wife of former Nissan Motor boss Carols Ghosn, local media reported on Saturday.

If the notice is issued for his wife, Carole, the couple's travel chances outside of Lebanon may be restricted, Mainichi newspaper said. Interpol has already issued an arrest warrant for Ghosn.

The request from Japan was made on Thursday, Mainichi and other Japanese media said, quoting unnamed sources.

Officials at the Japanese justice ministry weren't immmediately available for comment.

Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against Ghosn's wife for alleged perjury, as officials stepped up efforts to bring the fugitive car industry boss back to face trial on financial misconduct charges.

Ghosn, the former Nissan and Renault chairman, fled Japan to Lebanon, his childhood home, last month as he awaited trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.

His dramatic escape has raised tensions between Japan and Lebanon, where Ghosn slammed the Japanese justice system at a two-hour news conference on Wednesday, prompting Japan's Justice Minister to launch a rare and forceful public response.

Lebanon, which has no extradition agreement with Japan, may lift a travel ban on Carlos Ghosn if files pertaining to his case do not arrive from Japan within 40 days, caretaker justice minister Albert Serhan said in a statement on Friday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7zba/article30541486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NISSAN-GHOSNLEBANON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-seeks-interpol-wanted-notice-for-wife-of-ex-nissan-boss/article30541487.ece
30,2020/01/11,Iran says it ‘unintentionally’ shot down Ukrainian jetliner,"Iran announced on Saturday that its military ‘unintentionally’ shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing all 176 aboard, after the government had repeatedly denied Western accusations that it was responsible.

The plane was shot down early Wednesday, hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad. No one was wounded in the attack on the bases.

A military statement carried by state media said the plane was mistaken for a “hostile target” after it turned toward a “sensitive military center” of the Revolutionary Guard. The military was at its “highest level of readiness,” it said, amid the heightened tensions with the United States.

""In such a condition, because of human error and in a unintentional way, the flight was hit,” the statement said. It apologized for the disaster and said it would upgrade its systems to prevent future tragedies.

It also said those responsible for the strike on the plane would be prosecuted.

Iran’s acknowledgement of responsibility for the crash was likely to inflame public sentiment against authorities after Iranians had rallied around their leaders in the wake of Soleimani’s killing. The general was seen as a national icon, and hundreds of thousands of Iranians had turned out for funeral processions across the country.

But the vast majority of the plane victims were Iranians or Iranian-Canadians, and the crash came just weeks after authorities quashed nationwide protests ignited by a hike in gasoline prices.

Iranian FM apologises, cites ‘U.S. adventurism’

Iran’s foreign minister Saturday offered his country’s “profound regrets, apologies and condolences” after the armed forces admitted shooting down a Ukrainian airliner due to “human error“.

“A sad day,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster. Our profound regrets, apologies and condolences to our people, to the families of all victims, and to other affected nations.”

The jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran shortly after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport.

Iran had denied for several days that a missile caused the crash. But then the U.S. and Canada, citing intelligence, said they believed Iran shot down the aircraft with a surface-to-air missile, a conclusion supported by videos of the incident.

The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. The Canadian government had earlier lower the nation’s death toll from 63.

""This is the right step for the Iranian government to admit responsibility, and it gives people a step toward closure with this admission,” said Payman Parseyan, a prominent Iranian-Canadian in western Canada who lost a number of friends in the crash.

""I think the investigation would have disclosed it whether they admitted it or not. This will give them an opportunity to save face.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9y46ad/article30541050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDUKRAINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-says-it-unintentionally-shot-down-ukrainian-jetliner/article30541051.ece

32,2020/01/11,"Student, teacher killed in Mexico school shooting","An 11-year-old student opened fire with two guns on his teachers and classmates in a school in northern Mexico Friday, killing a teacher and wounding six other people before taking his own life, authorities said.

Coahuila state Gov. Miguel Angel Riquelme said the preliminary investigation showed the 6th-grader arrived at his classroom in the city of Torreon, told a classmate, “Today is the day” and asked permission to go to the bathroom.

After 15 minutes, when he had not returned, his teacher went to look for him. He emerged from the bathroom firing the guns. The shooting ended when he shot himself, Mr. Riquelme said.

Among the wounded were five students and a gym teacher, Mr. Riquelme said. None of the injuries were life-threatening, and some victims were expected to be released from hospitals soon.

School shootings are rare in Mexico. Friday’s shooting was reminiscent of another in January 2017 in the northern city of Monterrey. In that case, a student opened fire in a private high school. He killed a teacher and wounded two students. The shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The governor said the 11-year-old in the Torreon shooting lived with his grandparents and that his mother had died some years ago. He said the boy had not presented behavioral problems before in the school. Investigators were looking into reports the boy was influenced by a particular video game.

Images from the scene showed worried parents arriving at Colegio Cervantes to pick up their children Friday. It is a private school in downtown Torreon across the street from a large park.

Danya Mendizabal, whose daughter is in 4th grade at Colegio Cervantes, said she was initially alerted by a chat of student mothers. She called the school but no one answered. Then she called a teacher who told her that her daughter was fine and she should come get her.

Mendizabal said her daughter was in her classroom in another part of the school and did not know what had happened. “They managed it well because the teachers were very calm,” she said.

She said she never imagined anything like it could happen at the school.

""Colegio Cervantes has always distinguished itself as a very safe school of middle class kids,” she said.

The school participates in a state program called “Safe Backpack” in which school personnel search each child’s backpack when they arrive at school, she said.

34,2020/01/11,Taiwan begins voting with future of its democracy on the line,"The future of Taiwan’s democracy is on the line as the self-ruled island’s 19 million voters decide on whether to give independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen a second term.

Voting began at 8 a.m. on January 11 and wraps up at 4 p.m. The vote count will begin soon after, with results expected later in the evening.

For many in Taiwan, months of protests in Hong Kong have cast in stark relief the contrast between their democratically governed island and authoritarian, communist-ruled mainland China.

Tsai said the election was a chance to protect Taiwan’s democracy.

""Let’s get out there and vote tomorrow, let us tell the world with our own votes that Taiwanese are determined to defend sovereignty, determined to guard democracy and determined to persist in reforms,” she said at a rally late Friday.

Tsai’s Nationalist Party challenger, Han Kuo-yu, has said Taiwan should be more open to negotiations with China, in contrast to Tsai, who has dismissed Beijing’s overtures. At his last rally, attended by hundreds of thousands of people in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, he focused on practical issues such as improving education and the economy. ""I want to attract massive investments. I want products to be exported non-stop,” he said.

China and Taiwan separated during civil war in 1949, but Beijing still claims sovereignty over the island and occasionally threatens to use force to seize control if necessary.

The Hong Kong protests have undermined Taiwan support for the “one-country, two-systems” approach Beijing has championed for governing both that former British colony and Taiwan.

Fears of Chinese interference in Taiwan’s politics and an uptick in the economy have helped Tsai regain an edge after a dire electoral setback for her Democratic Progressive Party 14 months ago.

""The reason why I vote for her is for upholding the value of Taiwan’s freedom and democracy and that should not be affected by the other side of the strait (China),” Lucy Ting, a college student, said at Tsai’s rally on Friday.

The Nationalists have struggled to find candidates who can fire up their pro-China supporters and win over young Taiwanese who increasingly favor the DPP. Still, the election of former lawmaker Han as Kaohsiung’s mayor in December 2018 helped to re-energize the Nationalists, who lost their hold on power four years ago. They had governed since their forces fled to Taiwan from the mainland with the communists’ civil war victory in 1949.

Shortly after taking office, Han traveled to China to sign deals to sell 5.2 billion New Taiwan dollars ($165 million) worth of Taiwanese agricultural products. He also met with leading officials for relations with Taiwan, including the head of the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Liu Jieyi, and ranking Communist Party officials in Hong Kong.

That reinforced his image as a candidate backed by and friendly to Beijing. While Han is not expected to win, his party is fighting hard to overturn the DPP’s’ majority in the 113-seat parliament, officially known as the Legislative Yuan.

A win by Tsai is anticipated to draw more diplomatic, economic and military pressure from Beijing on the island, in a continuation of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to compel her administration to endorse its insistence that Taiwan is a part of China.

Tsai has refused to do so, maintaining that Beijing has no claim over Taiwan, although her government has repeatedly called for the reopening of talks between the sides without preconditions.

Since its transition to full democracy beginning in the 1980s, Taiwan has increasingly asserted its independent identity from China even though it is not recognized by the United Nations or any major nation.

The island of more than 23 million people exercises all the roles of a sovereign nation, issuing its own passports, maintaining its own military and legal system and serving as a crucial hub in the global high-tech supply chain.

If reelected, Tsai will face challenges in trying to reform the government and economy and push through unpopular cuts in generous civil service pensions.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qy0evl/article30540798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TAIWAN-ELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwan-begins-voting-with-future-of-its-democracy-on-the-line/article30540801.ece

Western-backed Qaboos, 79, had ruled the Gulf Arab state since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1970 with the help of Oman's former colonial power Britain.

Qaboos had no children and had not publicly appointed a successor. A 1996 statute says the ruling family will choose a successor within three days of the throne becoming vacant.

If they fail to agree, a council of military and security officials, supreme court chiefs and heads of the two consultative assemblies will put in power the person whose name has been secretly written by the sultan in a sealed letter.

Oman state news agency ONA said Qaboos died after “a wise and triumphant march rich with generosity that embraced Oman and extended to the Arab, Muslim and entire world and achieved a balanced policy that the whole world respected.”

36,2020/01/11,Trump says he believes Soleimani was targeting 'four embassies',"President Donald Trump said Friday that he thinks Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was planning attacks against four U.S. embassies before he was killed last week.

“I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies,” Mr. Trump said in an excerpt of an interview due to air later on Fox News. “Probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad.”

37,2020/01/11,"US tried to take out another Iranian leader, but failed","The US military tried, but failed, to take out another senior Iranian commander on the same day that an American airstrike killed the Revolutionary Guard’s top general, U.S. officials said Friday.

The officials said a military airstrike targeted Abdul Reza Shahlai, a high-ranking commander in Iran’s Islamic Republican Guard Corps but the mission was not successful. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a classified mission.

Officials said both Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Shahlai were on approved military targeting lists, which indicates a deliberate effort by the U.S. to cripple the leadership of Iran’s Quds force, which has been designated a terror organization by the U.S.

A U.S. drone strike on January 3 killed Soleimani shortly after he landed at Baghdad International Airport. Trump administration officials have justified the killing as an act of self-defense, saying he was planning military acts that threatened large numbers of American military and diplomatic officials in the Middle East.

Iran, however, called the attack an act of terrorism, and on January 8 it launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq that house American and coalition forces. No one was killed in that retaliation.

The State Department has offered a reward of $15 million for information leading to the disruption of IRGC finances, including Shahlai, a key financier in the organization.

The State Department said he “has a long history of targeting Americans and U.S. allies globally”, and planned multiple assassinations of coalition forces in Iraq.

It said that his activities included providing weapons and explosives to Shia militia groups and directing a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington, DC, in 2011.

The Pentagon declined to discuss the highly-classified operation.

“We have seen the report of a January 2 airstrike in Yemen, which is long-understood as a safe space for terrorists and other adversaries to the United States. The Department of Defense does not discuss alleged operations in the region,” said Navy Cadre Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokeswoman.

38,2020/01/11,Indigenous food is now meant only for the elite. The poor can eat cake,"The venue for the event is a posh club in Calcutta. As my companions and I approach, we quickly find myself ensnared in a maze of various expensive automobiles. The policemen direct traffic lazily as only Cal cops can, gently caressing the cars as they stand nose to nose.

At the ticket counter, a man bearing an uncanny resemblance to the current Home Minister tries to jump the queue by pushing his large paunch in between two people. When several of us glare at him, he reluctantly moves back a few inches. Then he gestures with his hand to convey a ‘pehle aap’ as if he’s displaying utmost graciousness and good upbringing.

Inside the club, the ‘festival’ has the air of the last days of the Romanov empire, if the czarist aristocracy can be imagined to be jostling on a tropical lawn next to an unfrozen body of water, vying to quaff different strictly vegetarian grub at a ‘natural’ food and horticultural festival. The range of alimentation-related produce is slightly startling, if for nothing else than for having finally reached this city where the parsimoniousness of the wealthy is legendary. The elite in Bangalore, Bombay and Delhi have doubtless been exposed to this sort of stuff for a long time but for small entrepreneurs to attempt to breach this eastern fortress of tighfistedness can only be admired as shocking bravery.

Wallet in pocket

At first we confirm that this is, indeed, an exclusively vegetarian affair. Sure enough, there is no dead animal produce to be found, no salami from origin-denominated pigs, no delicately flavoured carpaccio of beef, no chicken stock made from birds individually massaged in saffron and honey.

There are, however, several pâtisseries and cake shops and we check these out first. The range of confectionery is impressive but my wallet stays in my pocket. However, things are touch-and-go when one sees some croissants on display. I am a sucker when it comes to croissants, they are my weak underbelly, my Achilles heel, my Duryodhan thigh-spot, and I like to try different ones, even if they look terrible. I look at the ones here and think about it, failing to convince myself that ₹145 for a croissant is not a lot.

When we eat, it’s at two adjacent stalls. My companions choose the vegetarian khow suey over various fusion quesadilla and vegetarian ‘Korean’ combos. I stick to my roots and purchase, from the Gujarati stall, the most extortionately priced small bowl of undhiyu and two theplas I have ever eaten. The khow suey is apparently good, though it desperately needs chicken; my undhiyu and theplas are perfectly serviceable though they need to be about 200 bucks cheaper.

Stomachs filled, hungry eyes brought back to size, we wander some more. There are two encounters, the first of which is with someone trying to sell locally grown turmeric at ₹546 for 300g and locally extricated ghee (organic, of course, why do you even ask?) at ₹1,100 a kilo. The second tete-a-tete is with a pair of young women who have baked some bread. They have classic sourdough, sourdough with various fillings, and one kind with ‘active charcoal’ lurking inside. I taste the cheapest basic model and it’s okay; the texture is a bit woolly, the chewiness requisite in sourdough completely absent, but I would eat it again. Not at ₹245 a loaf (the charcoal variant is over ₹300) though. I point out that the best available bread, the nearest competition in town, sells a lesser loaf but at ₹65. Bas, khatam. The young woman takes off on how that bread is industrial, full of additives, including sugar, etc. etc. All true, but still, the price? “When it comes to health, price cannot be an issue!”

Imaginary onions

In a sentence, a world-view is laid out: health is now a luxury only available to the elite; they can now appropriate everyday indigenous foods and diets that include bajra, ragi, fresh produce, etc., repackage it as ‘organic’, ‘hand-crafted’, ‘artisanal’ and sell it at exorbitant prices to the rich; the poor, from whom these diets have been snatched, for whom they’ve been put out of reach, can eat cake, or imaginary onions.

There is, of course, a different trajectory that has been followed by organisations working with fair trade — with profits going to the producers, and the final products too priced reasonably. Some young people are also trying to follow this business model but there is only one lone example of this in the fair. We make our way to the stall where two young men are selling organically grown seasonal vegetables, reasonably priced, and which, unlike other stalls, are not wrapped in three layers of cling film. What is most heartening about their approach is that they speak about how they are learning from the local farmers in the hinterland, rather than trying to do it the other way around. Hope grows unevenly and in the oddest places.

40,2020/01/11,No ‘word play’ in health insurance policies: IRDAI,"Health insurance policy clauses, at least a clutch that are common, will soon be easier to comprehend, become more transparent and not vary across companies, with regulator IRDAI setting in motion the process towards uniformity in wordings of the contracts.

“It is proposed to standardise some of the general clauses that are commonly incorporated in the health insurance policy contracts of indemnity-based health products,” the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said, soliciting comments on an exposure draft.

One of the key aspects under the proposed guidelines on ‘Standardisation of General Clauses in Health Insurance Policy Contracts’ will be insurers committing to a timeline in handling claims and in the event of failure to comply, pay interest to the policyholder.

“The company shall settle or reject a claim, as the case may be, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document. In case of delay in the payment of a claim, the company shall be liable to pay interest from the date of receipt of the last necessary document to the date of payment of claim at a rate 2% above the bank rate,” the IRDAI draft said.

Where a claim warrants an investigation in the company’s opinion, it has to be settled within 45 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document. Beyond that, the insurer will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment of claim.

Another aspect for which wordings are proposed to be common relates to action against the insured. “The policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the company in the event of misrepresentation, mis-description or non-disclosure of any material fact,” the draft said.

Uniformity in wordings have been proposed by IRDAI with regard to complete discharge, multiple policies, cancellation, renewal of policy, including the company not being bound to give any notice for renewal, as well as migration and portability.

The proposed guidelines assume significance in the backdrop of robust growth in the segment. Health insurance premium continues to grow over 20% year-on-year in the past four fiscal years, IRDAI’s annual report for 2018-19 said.

General and health insurance companies collected ₹44,873 crore as health insurance premium last fiscal or 21.2% higher compared to 2017-18. Share of group health insurance was the highest, in 2018-19, at 48%, followed by individual business at 39% and government business the remaining 13%. Both individual and group businesses (other than government schemes) have doubled during the last five year period, the annual report said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/1m2z6e/article30545656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUMEDICINE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-word-play-in-health-insurance-policies-irdai/article30545657.ece

42,2020/01/11,Won’t back fiscal tightening currently: Abhijit Banerjee,"Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee has said that he would not back fiscal tightening in the current economic environment.

Prof. Banerjee added that the real constraint to the state of education in the country in the current climate of economic slowdown was not lack of money, but the lack of attention paid to the sector.

The Union Budget 2019-20 pegged the fiscal deficit target at 3.3% of GDP. “I think the budget deficit numbers are a little bit imaginary. I don’t think it’s a big deal to breach it more. Certainly, I won’t be supporting fiscal tightening right now,” he said on Saturday while interacting with journalists ahead of a talk he delivered at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Prof. Banerjee had been associated with Pratham, an NGO in education at whose silver jubilee he gave the speech, and had used randomised control trials on its projects. Speaking about the impact of the current economic slowdown on education, Prof. Banerjee said that the real constraint was the lack of attention, and not money. “People are starting to get very worried about the state of the macro-economy [which] is not very good news,” he said. He added that the Centre had little role to play in funding education as it was a State subject.

More than budgets, what was required was the reform of institutions such as the Ministry of Human Resources and Development and the University Grants Commission (UGC) and funding reforms on a par with global standards.

Institutional reforms

“We need institutional reforms where I can decide my own syllabus with no interference by anybody. I think we should start getting people who are active participants in the education more involved in deciding what’s the right syllabus rather than syllabi decided some board or the other,” he added.

Prof. Banerjee also said that the emphasis had shifted too far towards technical education at the time he was growing up and in order to have a vibrant democracy, the country needs to have a class of people who would have broad-based education.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/95uvtc/article30545499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUABHIJIT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wont-back-fiscal-tightening-currently/article30545500.ece
43,2020/01/11,Amazon boss Bezos to face protests from traders during India trip,"Thousands of small-scale traders in India are planning to organise protests against Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, who will visit the country next week for a company event and potential meetings with government officials.

Mr. Bezos will participate in an Amazon event in capital New Delhi aimed at connecting with small and medium-sized enterprises, three sources told Reuters.

He has also sought meetings with the Prime Minister and other government officials, with conversations expected to centre around e-commerce, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.

Details of Mr. Bezos' visit, including his arrival date and the duration of his stay are not known.

Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm the visit. The Prime Minister's office also did not respond to requests for comment.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a group representing roughly 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, said it will protest across 300 cities during Bezos' stay in the country.

CAIT has since 2015 waged a battle against online retailers Amazon and Walmart-controlled Flipkart, accusing them of deep discounts and flouting India's foreign investment rules.

Both e-tailers have denied the allegations.

Amazon has previously said its platform provides business opportunities to thousands of small sellers, artisans, weavers and women entrepreneurs. But CAIT is not convinced.

“We plan to organise peaceful rallies against Jeff Bezos in all major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata as well as smaller towns and cities,” Praveen Khandelwal, the group's secretary general told Reuters.

“We expect to mobilise at least 1,00,000 traders in the protests.”

With its 1.3 billion population and the world's second-biggest smartphone user base that relies on cheap data for social media and online shopping, India is a key market for U.S. retailers Amazon and Walmart to grow their business.

Discounts on their platforms have helped lure Indians to shop online for everything from groceries to large electronic devices, a phenomenon which traders say has unfairly hurt their business.

New Delhi introduced rules last year to protect nearly 130 million people dependent on small-scale retail — a key voter base — by deterring large online discounts.

The rules forced e-commerce firms to change their business structures, drawing criticism from the United States and straining the two countries' trade ties.

The federal commerce ministry is reviewing complaints and evidence filed by CAIT against Flipkart and Amazon, Reuters reported previously.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/isbxap/article30543901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jeff-Bezos1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/amazon-boss-bezos-to-face-protests-from-traders-during-india-trip/article30543902.ece
44,2020/01/11,Google legal chief David Drummond leaving amid sexual misconduct troubles,"David Drummond, the legal chief of Google parent company Alphabet, is leaving at the end of the month, following accusations of inappropriate relationships with employees.

Alphabet did not give a reason for Drummond’s departure in a short regulatory filing Friday.

The company said last November that it was investigating sexual misconduct cases against executives. Claims against Drummond were included in the investigations.

Last August, a former Google employee, Jennifer Blakely, published a report of her relationship with Drummond. Drummond has acknowledged a relationship with Blakely.

But in a statement at the time, he said he never started a relationship with anyone else at Alphabet.

The company said Drummond is not getting an exit package as part of his departure.

In a memo sent to employees, Drummond said that with founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin “now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it’s also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders.” He did not mention the misconduct allegations.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dm30dt/article30541522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKALPHABET-LEGALCHIEFRESIGNS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/google-legal-chief-david-drummond-leaving-amid-sexual-misconduct-troubles/article30541523.ece

46,2020/01/11,Opposition’s lies on Citizenship Amendment Act have led to anarchy: Amit Shah,"A day after the Ministry of Home Affairs notified the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday slammed the opposition parties for “spreading falsehood” against the CAA, which has created anarchy in the country.

“The opposition does not have any other issue, so they are spreading misinformation and falsehood on CAA. This has resulted in anarchy in the entire country,” he said.

Mr Shah hit out at the opposition parties while inaugurating various projects of Gujarat police in Gandhinagar, his parliamentary constituency, including the ‘Cyber Ashvast Project, VISWAS.’

During his speech after inauguration, he launched a scathing attack at other parties and alleged that the “falsehood” spread by the Opposition parties to create anarchy in the country.

He also challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Communists to show him any provision in the CAA, which would take away the citizenship of Muslims in the country.

Mr Shah singled out Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee for their criticism on the CAA.

“Rahulbaba, Mamata, Kejriwal and Communists are spreading lies that CAA will take away the citizenship of Muslims. I challenge them to show me any such provision in the Act,” Mr. Shah said.

“Persecuted minorities have to come to India to save themselves. However, the previous governments did not give any facilities to these migrants thinking that it would make others unhappy,” he said, implying that the previous governments failed in providing citizenship to those persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The Union Home Minister also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government to make the security of the country as number one priority of his government.

“Before Narendra Modi became the prime minister, there was no sense of fear in any country regarding the borders of India,” he said and added that after Mr Modi assumed office, the security status of our borders has changed.

“After Modi became PM, the security of the borders of our country became the top priority, which is why we see a change regarding the same today,” Mr. Shah said.

He added that surgical strike in PoK and air strike in Pakistan has made the country more secure from cross border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t7cz5u/article30543842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/citizenship-amendment-act-oppositions-lies-have-led-to-anarchy-says-amit-shah/article30545529.ece
47,2020/01/11,Mumbai Police hopes to gather clues on old cases from Lakdawala,"The “keep your enemies closer” axiom that the underworld operates on is expected to work in the Mumbai Police’s favour, with the Crime Branch milking arrested gangster Ejaz Lakdawala dry for information not only about his own activities but also other gangland figures like Rajendra Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar.

Lakdawala was arrested on Wednesday in Patna by the Anti-Extortion Cell (AEC) of the Crime Branch after being on the run for over 20 years. He was subsequently remanded in police custody and is currently being interrogated by the AEC.

What makes Lakdawala a significant catch is that he has worked with both Kaskar and Rajan before starting his own gang, said Crime Branch officials.

“The underworld operates heavily on grapevine, as it is an operational requirement for any criminal gang to keep close tabs on their rivals. This is mainly to ensure that they get to know of any impending attack by the rivals as well as to pass on the occasional tip about the gang’s members to law enforcement agencies as a way of eliminating the competition,” a Crime Branch officer explained.

Vital information

The officer added that in Rajan’s case, Lakdawala — who worked with him till 2008 — could provide vital information in cases that date back all the way to the early 1980s.

Rajan was arrested in Bali in October 2015 and subsequently extradited to India.

He is currently lodged in the Tihar Jail in Delhi, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) having taken over all the cases against him.

“Rajan is still facing trial for many of the cases, which were registered when Lakdawala was a part of his gang. His interrogation could provide crucial information about these cases which would be useful as evidence. It could also help identify any others who were acting as foot soldiers for Rajan in Mumbai when he was still operational. Any relevant details will be passed on to the CBI,” the officer said.

Lakdawala could be an important source of information about Kaskar’s activities as well.

Another officer said, “His terrorist tag notwithstanding, Kaskar still continues to be a legend in the underworld and every gangland element still wants to know what he is doing. While we are not expecting any direct information about Kaskar himself, data about the gang’s footsoldiers and criminal rackets in India would help to a great extent and can be shared with multiple law enforcement and anti-terror agencies both at the State as well as the Central level.”

48,2020/01/11,Historians ignored people: Narendra Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said historians had reduced the history of India to a “struggle for power, succession wars and violence related to it” but ignored the crucial issue of how the people had dealt with those “tumultuous times”.

Mr. Modi, who is here on a two-day visit, rededicated three recently restored iconic colonial buildings — Currency Building, built in 1833, Metcalfe Hall and Belvedere House — to the people.

Speaking at an event at Currency Building, Mr. Modi quoted from an essay written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1903 to press the point that “politics is transient” and the real history of a civilisation was reflected through its art and culture.

“Some people came from outside... fathers, sons and brothers turned upon each other for power, and struggle for succession continued. This is not the history of India… I am not saying this, Gurudev said this,” Mr. Modi said.

During his 20-minute speech, the Prime Minister said the Centre wanted to highlight India’s cultural resources before the world with a “new vibrancy” and form so that the country became a big centre of heritage tourism in the world.

“Heritage tourism will play a big role in promoting tourism in India, including in West Bengal. It will generate new employment opportunities,” Mr. Modi said.

Pointing out that India had tried to preserve its own heritage buildings, he said efforts had been made at the same time to modernise these structures.

Renovation exercise

“With this thought, the Central government is renovating historic buildings. Starting from Kolkata, such buildings in Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Varanasi will be renovated so that they can have new galleries and house new exhibitions, and can be a venue for theatre, drama or music concert,” he said.

The Prime Minister announced that five museums in the country, including Kolkata’s Indian Museum, would be converted into “iconic museums” of international standards. Underlining the need for maintenance and management of heritage buildings, Mr. Modi spoke about the establishment of an Indian Institute of Heritage Conservation. Giving the institution a deemed university status is being considered, he said.

The Prime Minister, who also officially reopened two galleries in the Victoria Memorial that has been shut for a long time, proposed that a gallery at Victoria Memorial should have a place for the freedom movement in Bengal.

“A museum called Biplabi Bharat will be made, in which Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghosh, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan, Binay-Badal-Binesh, and all great soldiers of freedom struggle should get some place,” he added.

He inaugurated a light-and-sound show on the iconic Howrah Bridge at Millennium Park on the bank of the Hooghly.

49,2020/01/11,Transgender Persons Act comes into effect,"The Social Justice Ministry issued a notification on January 10, 2019, notifying the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which was passed by Parliament on November 26 and given Presidential assent on December 5, 2019.

The Act aims to end discrimination against transgender persons in accessing education, employment and healthcare. It also recognises the right to self-perceived gender identity and provides for certification from a District Magistrate; in case a transgender person has had a gender-change surgery, the law says they can obtain a certificate from the medical facility where they had the operation, and apply for a change in their certificate.

However, many in the community have raised concerns about the requirement of a certificate from the district magistrate.

Activists have expressed concerns about the lack of awareness and sensitisation. Lovely Kumari, a transwoman, who had participated in the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer’s campaign to boost turnout among transgender voters in last year’s the Lok Sabha elections, said that trans people found it difficult to get papers.

“During the elections, we went door-to-door ... It was difficult because many of us have two different names on our documents. People don’t have any knowledge about this [about the transgender identity certificate under the Act],” she said.

However, Dr. Manabi Bandopadhaya, who became India’s first transgender college principal in 2015, said certification was needed to prevent misuse of welfare measures. “Transgender people are deeply deprived.

50,2020/01/11,JNU to undertake security audit of hostels,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration on Saturday said a security audit of all hostels would be conducted through the wardens.

The circular was issued after the Delhi police, in a letter dated January 7, “requested” for a hostel audit “in view of the present scenario”.

The circular reads: “All hostel residents to follow the rules regarding having guests in the hostel rooms as per the procedure and rules of Inter-Hall Administration (IHA)... In case any outsider or unauthorised student or guest is found staying in the rooms, necessary action will be initiated against the hostel residents.”

However, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) said it “condemned” such audits. Any audit would be on the basis of the new hostel manual, which was being opposed by the students, it said.

The administration issued another circular that classes and other academic activities would begin on January 13. “The winter semester registration process is going on smoothly, and the campus is peaceful. Students who have gone out of station are requested to return to the university in time to pursue their studies and research,” it said.

According to reports, Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar met a group of students on Saturday. However, the administration did not respond to questions on who these students were.

The JNUSU said, “Usually there are circulars sent. However, today [Saturday], there was no intimation. We got to know from the media about the Vice-Chancellor meeting students. None of the office- bearers was informed. We have no idea of the students he met.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/70c92w/article30545299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THJNUPRESSCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-to-undertake-security-audit-of-hostels/article30545300.ece
51,2020/01/11,Bangladesh Deputy Foreign Minister skips Delhi visit amid an all-is-not-well perception,"Bangladesh Deputy Foreign Minister Shahriar Alam has cancelled his visit to Delhi scheduled for this week on Saturday, making this the fourth visit by senior officials from Dhaka that has been cancelled in the past month.

According to Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, Mr. Alam, who was due to visit Delhi to address the MEA’s annual Raisina Dialogue Conference from January 14-16, has conveyed to the MEA’s organising partner thinktank, Observer Research Foundation, that he would be travelling to the United Arab Emirates instead, accompanying Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on a visit there.

“The Ministry would like to convey that State Minister Mohammad Shahriar Alam was invited as a speaker in the Raisina Dialogue which coincides with his visit to UAE to accompany the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. As such State Minister Alam could not avail the participation,” said a statement from the Foreign Ministry. “The inability of his participation has no other connection,” the statement added, in response to reports that it was linked to tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Mr. Alam’s decision not to visit India comes after the cancellation of scheduled visits by Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on December 12, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on December 13 and a delegation of senior officials for the Joint River Commission talks on December 18, the timing of which raised speculation they were connected to disquiet over the passage of the CAA in Parliament on December 11.

The Ministry of External Affairs downplayed Mr. Alam’s cancellation saying he was not coming on an “official bilateral visit”. “It is understood that he had to cancel his India visit as he has to accompany the Bangladesh PM on her visit abroad,” an MEA official said. In December too, the MEA had denied the cancellations were connected to Dhaka’s unhappiness.

“We have to understand that with Bangladesh there are over 75, over 75 dialogue mechanisms which are taking place and dates are decided through mutual consultation. Our understanding is a relationship which is as close as between our two countries should not be defined in terms of a postponement of a visit here and there,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

Though the government has clarified in Parliament that the CAA pertains mainly to religious persecution in Bangladesh that took place before Sheikh Hasina came to power, Bangladeshi Ministers have said publicly they are not happy to be “bracketed” with Pakistan and Afghanistan on this issue, and denied that minorities in Bangladesh are under threat. Ms. Hasina had herself raised the issue of the NRC leading to India deporting ‘illegals’ to Bangladesh with Prime Minister Narendra Modi when she met him in New York in September 2019 and in Delhi in October 2019.

According to officials who asked not to be named, however, there is growing unhappiness in Dhaka over the Modi government’s push for the CAA-NRC and ‘unfavourable’ references to Bangladeshi migrants.

A few other incidents in the past few months have also added to the sense that all is not well, they said. One official pointed Ms. Hasina’s two visits, to Delhi for a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi which resulted in seven agreements being signed and a visit to Kolkata for the first day-night Test match between India and Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens. On both occasions, Ms. Hasina was welcomed by fairly junior officials, including a Minister who was a “first-time MP” in Delhi, and the Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh in Kolkata, which had surprised the delegation, the official said. The issue had been raised in Dhaka, and even in Parliament in Delhi. To a specific question in Parliament on December 12, Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan had said Ms. Hasina had been “provided due protocol courtesies”.

The failure of the two sides to move forward on the Teesta river water settlement for years, which is being held up by the West Bengal Chief Minister, has also been a constant cause for concern for Ms. Hasina, who faced criticism from the Opposition and the media over agreeing to share the Feni river water with a town in Tripura in October, without assurances from India on other water sharing talks.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5z1lkv/article30544913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bangladesh-deputy-foreign-minister-skips-delhi-visit-amid-an-all-is-not-well-perception/article30544914.ece
52,2020/01/11,"CWC demands withdrawal of CAA, stopping of NPR process","Accusing the union government of unleashing its ‘brute majority to impose its divisive and discriminatory’ agenda on the nation, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday demanded the withdrawal of the new citizenship law and to stop the process of updating the National Population Register (NPR).

The CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body, noted that India is facing an unprecedented crisis in its history since Independence and cautioned the government its ‘divisive agenda’ will pose a serious challenge to internal security and make the country vulnerable to hostile external forces.

It also accused the Modi government of unleashing “the entire might of the brute State power to suppress, subjugate and stifle the voice of the youth and students across the country”.

The Congress body also adopted a special resolution against the ‘suppression of the voice of the youth and students of India’ who have been protesting over the anti-CAA and the proposed nation-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The tone for the CWC’s first meeting in 2020 was set by the Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who in her opening remarks, demanded termed the CAA as ‘a discriminatory and divisive law,’ expressed solidarity with the youth and promised to protection the Constitution.

Former party chief Rahul Gandhi, however, did not attend Saturday’s meeting as he was out of Delhi and was expected to reach on Sunday.

“The sinister purpose of the law is clear to every patriotic, tolerant and secular Indian: it is to divide the Indian people on religious lines,”she said and added,“Thousands of young men and women, especially students, have realized the grave harm the CAA implementation will cause. They have taken to the streets braving the cold as well as the police brutalities. I salute their courage, their abiding faith in the values of the Constitution of India, and their determination to defend and protect those values”.

The Congress chief noted that Uttar Pradesh and Delhi had become ‘police States’ and the situation was evidently alarming with the escalation of violence across campuses.

“We have no faith that either the UP State government or the LG of Delhi will bring the culprits to justice. We therefore demand that a comprehensive high-powered Commission should be constituted to enquire into the incidents connected with the anti-CAA protests and justice to the affected persons,”the Congress chief asserted.

Senior party leaders Anand Sharma, K C Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala later briefed the media about the CWC deliberations.

“CWC cautions the Government that, its pursuit of divisive agenda with the sole objective of polarisation, may give short term political dividends but will create deep fissures in the society undermining national unity and social stability. That presents a serious challenge to internal security and makes India vulnerable to hostile external forces. The CWC demands that Citizenship Amendment Act should be withdrawn and the process of NPR be stopped forthwith,”Mr Sharma read out from the CWC statement.

Sources said like the Kerala Assembly that passed a resolution against implementing CAA, Congress ruled States too could follow a similar strategy.

“India is facing a crisis unprecedented in its history since independence. The nation needs a healing process to restore people’s trust and confidence. It is unfortunate, that the BJP Government does not believe in building a consensus to resolve national issues, but follows a policy of imposition and confrontation,”the CWC noted.

“Instead of listening to the students, the only response of BJP Government has been to unleash police lathi charge, tear gas shells, forcible arrests, lodging of FIRs and even planned attacks on the protesting students and the youth...Modi Government is systematically attacking the culture of creative thinking and learning, of questioning the hierarchy and of inculcating the culture of assimilation and cohabitation,”Mr Venugopal read out from the special CWC resolution.

On economy, the CWC called upon the Government to reveal its road map for reviving the economy, investors’ confidence and job creation.

Noting that the government had taken diplomats on a guided tour of Jammu and Kashmir while the ‘shutdown’ had entered its sixth month, Congress asked civil liberties to be immediately restored.

The party also asked the government to prepare a contingency plan to ensure energy security and the safety of the Indian diaspora in the Gulf because of the escalation of tension between Iran and the United States.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l72ape/article30544507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CWCMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-working-committee-meeting-passes-resolution-on-january-11-2020/article30544508.ece

The students’ body also said that as the “first step” towards resolving the deadlock, they were ready to register for the new semester by only paying the tuition fees and not the hiked hostel fees.

In a chronology of events which unfolded on the university campus between January 4 and 5, presented by the JNUSU, office bearers said that despite a message being sent out to the force around 3 p.m. on Sunday, no action was taken to prevent the violence.

JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh who was also attacked by a masked mob during the violence said, “When I called them (police) I was told not to worry as all of them (alleged mob) had been removed. If that was indeed the case then how did the violence take place?”

The JNUSU office bearers while addressing the press also refuted charges put forth by the Delhi Police on Friday.

Reacting to the charges against her of “leading a mob” into the Periyar hostel, Ms. Ghosh said, “There was heavy stone pelting happening and there was no sign of any security personnel when we reached Periyar. What is the Delhi Police expecting? When we get SOS calls, is it not our responsibility to ensure safety of the students. The video is being zoomed into to treat me like a suspect.”

Terming the Delhi Police press conference which was held on January 10 as “fraud and bogus,” the JNUSU also claimed that there was a “clear conspiracy” and that the police, JNU administration and the ABVP were complicit in it.

“If you see how the rooms were targeted in Sabarmati, you will see that it is proof that ABVP was involved. Rooms which had ABVP posters were not attacked while the others were…,” the students’ body said.

Ms. Ghosh added, “When Najeeb disappeared the administration told the courts that there was no CCTV on campus. But now there are CCTVs right? Why can’t they show the footage?”

Regarding allegations against the protesting students of attacking the server rooms, the JNUSU said, “If the optical fibre and servers were down then how did students get a mail on January 5 from the official server,” while displaying screenshots of emails sent out by the administration on Sunday afternoon.

Maintaining that there demand for the current VC’s removal continues, Ms. Ghosh said, “January 5 has changed our lives immensely. We still love the university but it will take time to get over the trauma. This is why sacking the VC is the only option as he has no moral ground to continue. It is not about left versus right but about right versus wrong.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bmy260/article30544657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-11-at-74059-PMjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnusu-claims-police-ignored-messages-about-mobs-presence-in-varsity-on-january-5/article30544400.ece

“We demand that a comprehensive high-powered commission be constituted to enquire into the incidents connected with the anti-CAA protests and give justice to the affected persons,” she said.

As the students’ protest gains momentum, it is clear that the government is digging in its heels. Not a day passes without the home minister and on some days the prime minister himself making provocative statements, the Congress president said.

“The situation in some states is alarming, turning the states into police states, notably in Uttar Pradesh and the Union Territory of Delhi,” she said.

Coming down hard on the National Population Register (NPR), Ms. Gandhi told Congress top brass not to be under any illusion that it was a “benign exercise”.

“In form and content, NPR 2020 is a disguised NRC,” she said.

Ms. Gandhi also hit out at the government over the state of the economy and the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

“It is a matter of anguish and concern that the people in Jammu and Kashmir continue to be denied their fundamental rights while the Government makes farcical claims of normalcy and arranges guided tours of diplomats,” she said.

55,2020/01/11,"MHA says 34 lakh OCI cards issued, declines to detail cancellations","The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has stated that more than 34 lakh Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registrations had been done but declined to divulge information relating to the number of persons whose OCI cards had been cancelled, citing non availability in a “consolidated form.”

Responding to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by The Hindu, the ministry said that the information sought remained outside the “mandate and scope of the RTI Act, 2005.”

On November 7, in an unprecedented move, the ministry had announced on Twitter that it would revoke the OCI card to author and journalist Aatish Taseer over what it claimed was his attempt to “conceal information” that his father, Salman Taseer, was of Pakistani origin.

The ministry had at the time said that Mr. Taseer had failed to dispute a notice that had given him the opportunity to submit his reply/objections regarding his PIO/OCI cards. Asserting that Mr. Taseer had not complied with basic requirements and withheld information, the ministry had ruled that he had become “ineligible to hold an OCI card as per the Citizenship Act, 1955”.

In his reply on September 6 to an August 13 notice, and a subsequent notice dated September 3, Mr. Taseer had explained that his parents had never been legally married, and that his mother was his sole legal guardian.

Mr. Taseer was criticised by several members of the ruling BJP, as he had authored an essay in May 2019 for Time magazine that accused the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of following divisive policies.

In reply to the RTI on the number of OCI cards issued from January 1, 2000, to November 26, 2019, the ministry said, “As per data available, 34,21,337 OCI registration/OCI card have been issued.”

To subsequent questions seeking year-wise data on the number of OCI cards issued or cancelled, the ministry said, “Information related to year-wise issuance of OCI registration or year-wise cancellation of grant of registration as OCI cardholder is not available in consolidated form. It may please be noted that the contents of these paras remain outside the mandate and scope of the RTI Act, 2005.”

While responding to another question on major reasons for cancelling the OCI cards, the ministry replied, “Information sought is not available,” however, it “could be cancelled on grounds mentioned in section 7(D) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which is available in the public domain.”

Section 7(D) says that the OCI registration may be cancelled if it was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact; or if the overseas citizen of India has shown disaffection towards the Constitution of India, or unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy (in case of a war) or has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years within five years after registration as an OCI, or if it is necessary so to do in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India.

The OCI scheme has been operational since December 2, 2005. It provides facilities like lifelong visa, exemption from registration with Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) and parity with non-resident Indians (NRIs) in economic, financial and educational fields except in matters relating to the acquisition of agricultural properties. No parity is allowed in the sphere of political and public employment rights.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3ufnw6/article30544083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OCICard,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mha-says-34-lakh-oci-cards-issued-declines-to-detail-cancellations/article30544088.ece
56,2020/01/11,Centre’s new initiative — write a letter to Bapu and win a prize,"The Centre, as part of 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi, is organising a countrywide letter-writing contest on January 21 that will let participants communicate with the Father of the Nation. Each letter must begin with the salutation, “Dear Bapu, You are immortal...”

Normally, such an exercise would pass off as routine — one of those government-conducted events that generate little interest either in the public or the media. But in turbulent times like these, when student agitations are raging across the country and when WhatsApp has emerged as the primary mode of communication — be it to stay in touch or spread rumours or even conduct mob attacks — a contest that requires putting pen to paper and writing to the apostle of non-violence assumes significance. It also comes at a time when many in the ruling party, the BJP, are openly lionising Mahatma’s assassin Nathuram Godse.

It is most likely that the event, being organised by the Department of Posts, was planned many weeks or months in advance, but now that it is going to be held in the backdrop of the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and the mob attack in the JNU, the idea not only looks refreshing but can also help the Centre, if it chooses to publicise it aggressively, promote peace.

The participants will be divided into two categories, below and above 18 (for those under 18 the contest will be held in schools). They can choose to use either an an inland letter (500 words) or an envelope (1,000 words).

The event is called Dhai Akhar, and in Kolkata, the city of festivals, Postmaster General (Kolkata Circle) Amitabh Singh has decided to promote it under the banner of the Kolkata Letter Fest. It will be held in the Rotunda Hall of the handsome 1868-built General Post Office at BBD Bagh from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

“It will be an open house, anybody can walk in. All they would need is pay ₹5 as registration fee. Each participant would be given a stamped envelope, paper, an India Post pen — and a cup of coffee,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu.

The letter can be written either in English, Hindi or the local language. The first prize will be ₹50,000 at the national level and ₹25,000 at the circle level. There will be three sets of prizes in both categories.

“For the Kolkata Circle, however, I intend to give away more than three prizes, maybe seven or eight, the idea being to encourage people. Letter-writing is a creative exercise, it activates the right brain. It is a habit we need to revive, it also happens to be the life-blood of the Postal department,” Mr. Singh said.

This would be the first-ever Letter Fest to be held in Kolkata — or anywhere in the country, for that matter — and if the event becomes an annual affair, then the people of Kolkata will have one more date to mark on their calendar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oedqly/article30543869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04ISBSGANDHIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centres-new-initiative-write-a-letter-to-bapu-and-win-a-prize/article30543870.ece
57,2020/01/11,Oppositions’ falsehood on CAA has caused anarchy in country: Amit Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday alleged that the falsehood being spread by the opposition parties against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) has resulted in anarchy in the country.

He also challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Communists to show him any provision in the CAA, which would take away the citizenship of Muslims in the country.

Maintaining that security was the Narendra Modi government’s top priority, the minister said that when India conducted surgical strikes and air strikes, it became the third country after the US and Israel to do so.

“The opposition does not have any other issue, so they are spreading misinformation and falsehood on CAA. This has resulted in anarchy in the entire country,” he said.

His statements come in the wake of violent protests in parts of India over the CAA, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

“Persecuted minorities have to come to India to save themselves. However, the previous governments did not give any facilities to these migrants thinking that it would make others unhappy,” he said at the inauguration of various projects of the Gujarat Police here.

“Rahul baba, Mamata, Kejriwal and Communists are spreading lies that CAA will take away the citizenship of Muslims. I challenge them to show me any such provision in the Act,” Mr. Shah said.

“I urge the BJP workers to visit every household and bust the lies and misinformation being spread against the CAA.

Since there is no alternative to Modiji in politics at present, the opposition is resorting to falsehood,” he added.

“We have the power to make people understand the truth. After our campaign is over, people of the country will understand the importance of the CAA,” the BJP chief said.

He also claimed that there was no violence in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 and not a single person has died there due to it.

“Some leaders from the opposition had claimed in the Parliament that there will be bloodbath (if special status of Kashmir is revoked). Such statements are on record. But people gave a befitting reply to such leaders. Not a single person has died there ever since Article 370 was abrogated,” he said.

Mr. Shah said that after Narendra Modi took charge as the country’s PM, he brought a clear division between the foreign policy and the security policy, unlike in the past.

“We told the world that we want peace with everybody, but if we are attacked, we will not tolerate it. Terrorist attacks were frequent in our country...But after Uri and Pulwama attacks, surgical strikes and air strikes made our intentions clear. India became the third country after the US and Israel to do it,” Mr. Shah said.

India carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC on September 29, 2016. It came 10 days after a major terror attack on an Army camp in Uri in Kashmir. In February last year, the Indian Air Force (IAF) struck a terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot area, days after the Pulwama terror attack.

On the launch of various projects aimed at strengthening security in Gujarat, Mr. Shah said the ruling BJP has ended the previous system, wherein political leaders had a nexus with criminals.

He also urged the people of Gujarat not to forget the “lawlessness” of the previous (Congress) governments.

“Atrocities on Dalits, curfew, scarcity of food in tribal areas have become a thing of the past in Gujarat today. I urge the people to identify those behind spreading lies and misinformation,” Mr. Shah said.

Praising the Gujarat Home Department and the state police force for effectively tackling crime, he said the governments can make maximum use of technology to curb crimes.

Mr. Shah had earlier served as the minister of state for home in Gujarat when present Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hief minister of the state.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t7cz5u/article30543842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oppositions-falsehood-on-caa-has-caused-anarchy-in-country-amit-shah/article30543843.ece

59,2020/01/11,Details on manual scavenging cases continue to be absent from NCRB reports,"The ‘Crime in India’ reports released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2017 and 2018 continue to fail in providing data on cases filed under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation (PEMSR) Act of 2013.

A separate column listing the number of cases filed for offences related to manual scavenging was available under the Special and Local Laws (SLL) section until 2015. In 2016, the NCRB said that it was clubbing data on manual scavenging and 10 more SLLs under the ‘Other SLL Cases’ column since only ‘very few cases’ are reported under these Acts.

It is another issue that even the NCRB report of 2015 listed The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act of 1993 instead of the PEMSR Act that came into force in 2013.

In the 2017 and 2018 reports, the NCRB has partially gone back on its decision of 2016 and has reduced the clubbing of cases under ‘Other SLL cases.’

In his foreword to the 2017 report, NCRB Director Ram Phal Pawar said, “Owing to the detailed data collection proforma, the clubbing of crimes under ‘Other’ Indian Penal Code (IPC) and SLL have been reduced so as to have better visibility. The publication is more detailed as compared to previous years.”

Through this move, around 20 acts that were hitherto clubbed under ‘Other SLL Cases’ were listed separately in the 2017 and 2018 reports. These include acts like The Telegraph Wire Unlawful Possession Act of 1950 that had zero cases registered in 2018 and just 2 cases in 2017.

282 deaths in three years

In a reply to the Lok Sabha on December 3, 2019, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment said that 282 deaths while cleaning sewers were reported in the country from 2016 till the first week of November 2019 as per data available with National Commission for Safai Karamcharis. Tamil Nadu topped the list with 40 deaths.

Villupuram MP and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi general secretary D. Ravikumar, who last year questioned in the Lok Sabha, the inordinate delay in releasing NCRB reports for 2017, said that the unavailability of data on manual scavenging was in line with the present Union government’s ‘strategy’ of obfuscating, withholding and manipulating data.

“Whenever data on such sensitive issues like violence against children, women or farmer suicides come out, there is widespread discussion. The government does not want that,” he said, adding that the government wanted to make obtaining data as difficult as possible.

He said that the government must pro-actively provide data on such important issues instead of furnishing data under unnecessary crime heads. “If they really want to address the issues, making data available will only be of help,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c8v9uz/article30542364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11JANTH-MANUAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/details-on-manual-scavenging-cases-continue-to-be-absent-from-ncrb-reports/article30542365.ece
60,2020/01/11,Nirbhaya case: SC to hear curative plea on Jan. 14,"A five-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana will examine the curative petitions filed by two Nirbhaya gang-rape case convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh, on January 14.

The other judges on the Bench are Justices Arun Mishra, Rohinton Nariman, R. Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan. The judges would examine the petitions in their chambers at 1.45 p.m. and decide to either accept or reject them.

The curative petitions were filed by both convicts on January 9. The petitions came just days after a Delhi sessions court scheduled the execution of all the four convicts for January 22, at Tihar Jail.

Sharma and Mukesh, in separate curative petitions, said there had been a sea change in the death penalty jurisprudence since their convictions. They argued that ignoring the subsequent changes in the law against death penalty would be a “gross miscarriage of justice”.

Curative is a rare remedy devised by a Constitution Bench in its judgment in the Rupa Ashok Hurra case in 2002.

A party can take only two limited grounds in a curative petition — one, that he was not heard by the court before the adverse judgment was passed, and two, that the judge was biased.

A curative petition, which follows the dismissal of a review petition, is the last legal avenue open for convicts in the Supreme Court. Sharma was the first among the four convicts to file a curative plea.

In his plea, Sharma said the Supreme Court had commuted the death penalty in several rape and murder cases since 2017, when the apex court first confirmed the death penalty for the Nirbhaya convicts.

“After the pronouncement of judgment in 2017, there have been as many as 17 cases involving rape and murder in which various three-judge Benches of the Supreme Court have commuted the sentence of death,” the petitioner contended.

The Supreme Court had recently dismissed a review petition filed by another one of the four condemned men, Akshay Singh, to review its May 5, 2017, judgment confirming the death penalty in the Nirbhaya case.

The court had also refused Singh’s plea to grant him three weeks’ time to file a mercy petition before the President of India.

A Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi had said it was open for the Nirbhaya convicts to avail whatever time the law prescribes for the purpose of filing mercy plea.

Singh (33), Mukesh (30), Pawan Gupta (23) and Sharma (24) had brutally gang-raped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

The case shocked the nation and led to the tightening of anti-rape laws. Rape, especially gang-rape, is now a capital crime.

One of the accused in the case, Ram Singh, had allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board. He was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fzgcz1/article30545042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nirbhaya-convicts-Mukesh-Vinay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-to-hear-curative-petitions-of-2-death-row-convicts-on-january-14/article30542298.ece
61,2020/01/11,We won’t leave Siachen: Army Chief,"﻿Siachen is the closest point for ‘collusivity’ between China and Pakistan, Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Saturday, adding that the Army was rebalancing its weaponry to the northern borders.

﻿Addressing his first annual press conference as Chief of Army Staff ahead of Army Day, Gen. Naravane outlined his vision and asserted that the armed forces “swear allegiance to the Constitution of India, whether it is a jawan or an officer”. “As said in the preamble: ‘justice, equality and fraternity’. That is what we are fighting for... when we are fighting on the border, it is to secure this for all,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of concerns about the politicisation of the Army.

Stressing on the importance of the Siachen glacier, Gen. Naravane said, “That is one area which faces the western and northern fronts... we should not lose sight that it’s one place where collusivity can happen. So we should keep control.”

Elaborating, he said as far as land borders were concerned Siachen was where China and Pakistan were the closest. “So the chance for collusivity here is the most. Here and in Shaksgam valley,” he stated.

Two front war

Asked if India was prepared for a simultaneous two-front war with China and Pakistan, Gen. Naravane said the Army was conscious of the fact that India has threats “both on the western and northern side.” In case of a simultaneous threat, there would be a ‘primary front’ and a ‘secondary front’, he said.

“Our forces will be concentrated on the primary front and we will adopt more deterrent posture on the secondary front so that we are not found wanting,” he observed, adding that the Army had formations with ‘dual tasking’, enabling them to move between the western and eastern borders.

﻿Speaking of the northern borders, the Army Chief said they were rebalancing advanced weaponry to the northern borders. “At one point of time it was more towards the western font. Now we think both the borders are equally important. It is in that context that the rebalancing is taking place.”

He said post Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, differences on the border were being settled at the lowest level. After the strategic guidelines, small differences were sorted locally and not allowed to escalate, he stated.

To a question on recent statements about India taking back Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK), Gen. Naravane referred to a Parliamentary resolution dating back in time that the entire erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India. “If Parliament wishes that it be ours and we get a directive, we will act on it,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yqbz6t/article30542075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Naravane2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/creation-of-cds-a-very-big-step-towards-integration-of-forces-army-chief/article30542294.ece
62,2020/01/11,Naval variant of LCA Tejas successfully lands on carrier,"The Naval variant of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk1 Tejas under development successfully completed the first arrested landing on board aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya on Saturday.

“After completing extensive trials on the Shore Based Test Facility (SBTF), Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) developed LCA Navy did an arrested landing on INS Vikramaditya successfully today January 11, 2020 at 10:02 hours,” the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said on Twitter. Commodore Jaideep Maolankar did the maiden landing, it added.

The Naval LCA recently successfully completed take-off and landing trials on the SBTF in Goa, which the Navy has said is a technology demonstrator.

“With this feat, the indigenously developed niche technologies specific to deck-based fighter operations have been proven, which will now pave the way to develop and manufacture the twin engine deck-based fighter for the Indian Navy,” the Navy said on Twitter.

Navy Chief Adm. Karambir Singh stated in December that the DRDO had offered to develop a new twin engine deck-based fighter for the Navy based on the experience of the Naval LCA and it should be ready by 2026.

The Naval LCA-Mk1 made its maiden flight in April 2012 and two prototypes have been flying as part of the development. The SBTF, which replicates the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, was specifically built to train Naval pilots in the complex manoeuvres of landing on the short flight deck of an aircraft carrier before they move on to the actual carrier.

Naval LCA is designed with stronger landing gears to absorb forces exerted by the ski jump ramp during take-off, to be airborne within 200 m and land within 100 m as against 1000 m required for normal runways.

The Navy currently operates Russian Mig-29K fighters from INS Vikramaditya, which will also fly from the first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant once it enters service. The Navy is currently evaluating global tenders for 57 carrier-based twin engine fighter aircraft.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/45lbst/article30541924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11LCATEJAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/naval-variant-of-lca-tejas-successfully-lands-on-carrier/article30541842.ece

64,2020/01/11,"Modi-Mamata ties: One meeting, many questions","The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has blanketed the city with billboards that underscore the ferocity with which party chief Mamata Banerjee opposes the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). Indeed, Ms. Banerjee has been campaigning relentlessly across the State against both the CAA and the NRC.

However, when it came to a proposed meeting of all Opposition leaders in Delhi to plan a joint strategy amid the ongoing countrywide protests against the law, the mercurial West Bengal Chief Minister had a surprise in store. The TMC leader announced on Thursday that she would not be attending the Jan. 13 meeting, triggering speculation about her motives.

Ms. Banerjee, who is expected to share the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kolkata on Sunday during the latter’s two-day visit to the city, had hitherto been relentlessly targeting the BJP-led central government for the CAA and proposed NRC. But on Thursday she asserted that the “hooliganism of the Congress and the CPI(M) during the bandh [on January 8] has stopped” her from attending the meeting of the anti-BJP parties, which will be led by Congress and attended by the left parties as well.

A senior TMC leader compared Ms. Banerjee’s decision to skip the Delhi meeting to Mahatma Gandhi’s decision to halt the non-cooperation movement in 1922, following the Chauri Chaura incident which had resulted in the death of 25 people, a majority of them policemen.

“I do not support this,” the TMC leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. “We need to work together,” the member of the State’s ruling party added.

But then why did Ms. Banerjee decide to skip the crucial Delhi meeting of Opposition parties? The understanding in political circles is that the TMC leader is not too keen to mount more pressure on the BJP at a time when the saffron party is facing a concerted countrywide challenge over the new law. The strategy could be beneficial for her on multiple counts.

One argument is that this would ensure that the BJP remains indebted to Ms. Banerjee, without being a formal ally, for the TMC leader’s decision to pull her punches at a time when Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah were under pressure. The second contention is that the move may hurt the BJP’s image in the State. During the later years of Jyoti Basu’s reign as Chief Minister, it was widely whispered that the Congress was the “B team” of the CPI(M) as the two parties were in a non-hostile relationship in Delhi. The spread of the “B team” propaganda, resulted in the annihilation of the Congress in the State. The argument now is that if an idea — that the BJP and the TMC are in an informal alliance (as the CPI(M) has been alleging) gains traction in the State — it would damage the BJP more, similar to the fate that befell the Congress.

Thirdly, such an informal alliance — if it gets more pronounced in the coming months — may strengthen the CPI(M)-Congress alliance and ensure a robust three-cornered contest in 2021, an outcome that would play to Ms. Banerjee’s advantage.

Moreover, the investigations by central agencies have slackened following Ms. Banerjee’s meeting with the Prime Minister and the Home Minister last September. Also, the TMC’s eight MPs did not vote during the passage of the CAA in the Lok Sabha; Ms. Banerjee had absolved them at the time by asserting that the Bill had been passed in secrecy.

Given this backdrop, if the TMC supremo goes ahead and shares the dais with the Prime Minister at the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) event on Sunday, after skipping the Opposition meet in Delhi, it would fuel further speculation about the Modi-Mamata relationship. While the TMC camp is tight-lipped about her plans for now, a meeting with the Prime Minister would force the State BJP and the TMC’s local leaders to scramble for a new political narrative to explain the relationship.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3bpjqy/article29449683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shuv-Mamata-Banerjee-Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-mamata-ties-one-meeting-many-questions/article30537883.ece
65,2020/01/11,"Raghuram Rajan condemns attacks on JNU students, teachers","Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has condemned the attacks against students and teachers at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), noting that they lend weight to claims that the Indian government is suppressing its citizens.

“While the identities of the attackers remain unclear, what is clear is that many of the attacked were activists, and neither the government-appointed administration nor the police intervened,” he wrote on Thursday, in a post published on Linkedin.com. “When even elite universities become literal battlegrounds, accusations that the government is attempting to suppress dissent—even if by apathy rather than design-gain substantial credibility.”

Dr. Rajan, who currently teaches at the University of Chicago, also blamed those who voted for the government whether for economic reasons, or out of indifference, prejudice or fear. “...we, the public, also bear a responsibility. After all, it was the citizenry that put our leaders into office and acquiesced in their divisive manifesto, which they have taken as their marching orders,” he wrote.

On the other hand, Dr. Rajan expressed support and admiration for the young people of different faiths marching on the streets, a seeming reference to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. He also singled out for praise those who have stood up for their convictions in the face of great risk: IAS officers who resigned because they could not serve in good faith, a Bollywood actress who stood with JNU victims (a reference to Deepika Padukone), an Election Commissioner who acts with integrity despite the harassment of his family (a reference to former Commissioner Ashok Lavasa), and journalists who stand against government pressure to bring out the truth.

His friends used to point out to him that he was quite popular on campus with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student organisation affiliated to the Rashtriya Swamyamsevak Sangh, but Khaki would dismiss them. “No, yaar,” he would say. “I am friendly with all sides. Politics means nothing to me.”

But on January 5, Khaki could not afford to be apolitical or ignore what was happening on campus. He was in his hostel when, all of a sudden, a group of people broke into his room with rods, he recounts to a group of psychiatrists assembled in Sabarmati hostel on December 9. They scattered on the floor all the neatly laid books is his room, he says. Despite his cries, they stomped on the blankets and broke the glass panes. Khaki is emotionally bruised and this is why the psychiatrists have come: to help the deeply divided university cope with the latest trauma.

Fee hike protest

It all began when protests broke out against the revised fee structure that the JNU administration under Vice Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar drew up in 2019. These protests dragged on as neither the university authorities, led by the Vice Chancellor, nor the Human Resources Development Ministry could meet the core demand of the students: to roll-back the steep increase in fees. Towards the end of October, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) called for a “complete university strike” against the draft hostel manual which was part of the fee hike project of the university. The campus had been non-functional since the fee was raised.

The reopening of the winter semester was getting delayed as neither the JNU administration nor the JNU Teachers’ Association had managed to come up with any solution to the problem. Registration is a JNU-specific issue. Every six months, all the students in the university enrol themselves afresh for the courses that semester. This is also when the faculty give them feedback on their work.

To register or not to register for the winter semester was the main issue on campus. JNUSU opposed the registration process. It believed that simply doing so would mean surrendering to the revised fee structure. “We marched towards Rashtrapati Bhawan in December to register our complaint when we were lathi-charged by the Delhi Police. The whole world watched as this happened,” says Sucheta Talukdar, a student.

On the other hand, students say, teachers, mainly from the right-leaning JNU Teachers’ Federation, had been pushing them to register. Gathering at the State Bank of India to pay the fees, the students consulted one another on the issue. Many were not sure what to do.

The see-saw continued on January 3 and 4 when several rounds of heated discussions and spats took place between the JNUSU and the ABVP, which wanted to roll out the admission procedure. ABVP’s posters on campus read: “By preventing and threatening bonafide students willing to register for the winter semester, the JNUSU has lost its legitimacy, morality and cause of its very existence.” JNUSU maintained that registering would amount to acceptance of the higher fee structure that it had been protesting over the last five months. JNU has a ‘zero semester’ system, which means that a student can opt out of a semester citing health or family issues. If all students refused to register, reasoned JNUSU, it would make the semester a ‘zero semester’ for everyone, a welcome scenario for the protesting students.

On January 4 morning, students say members of the JNUSU, led by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, marched to the main server of the campus and forcibly disconnected it. This led to a scuffle outside the server room, a sign of things to come. As Ghosh was leaving the server room, she and others were stopped and beaten up by some students, Sucheta says.

However, ABVP activist Shambhavi Jha, a Russian language student from JNU , says WiFi on campus had become nonfunctional even before January 4. “We believe that JNUSU disconnected the servers even before January 4. We were unable to access WiFi needed for admission-related work,” she says.

The final confrontation

These events snowballed into the final confrontation of January 5. On the afternoon of that cold Sunday, teachers and students gathered together at Sabarmati T-point, ironically for a peace march. “We had been planning to gather at Sabarmati hostel to initiate a dialogue among the students. We gathered at Sabarmati T-point with placards and posters,” says Amit Thorat, Assistant Professor at the Center for the Study of Regional Development.

Around the same time, says Chandan (name changed), a student at the School of Language, Literature and Cultural Studies, a large group of students had congregated at Mahi-Mandavi hostel and then dispersed at 3 p.m. There was a murmur going around that the long-standing tensions between the ABVP and JNUSU would blow up. Students were apprehensive and nervous: it seemed like something terrible was going to happen. Chandan took his scooter and rode around campus. He says he did not want to miss out on any of the “action”. Chandan was also concerned about the safety of a woman friend; he wanted to ensure that she was safe in case a fracas broke out. He rode around for a while and then went to Periyar hostel near the North Gate, an area known as Dakshinapuram. Even as he was talking to fellow students, Chandan says he saw a teacher belonging to a right-wing political group hand out sticks and rods to some youngsters near the entrance of the hostel. “Some of the rods appeared new and shiny and drew my attention. I was stunned to see this young Assistant Professor distributing these to students,” he says. “The teacher kept saying ‘jaldi karo (act fast)’ while distributing the rods and sticks,” he says. The teacher had found himself in the midst of a controversy earlier as his appointment had drawn flak in the academic circles.

A group of students rushed to inform the teachers at Sabarmati T-point that an Assistant Professor was busy arming some students with sticks and rods. By then a mob had quickly arrived, their faces covered with dupattas and masks. They were armed with sticks and began to assault the teachers, multiple students say. Professor Sucharita Sen was hit on her head repeatedly. Thorat says he had reached the backyard of Periyar hostel by then, where he was assaulted by the masked members of the gang for taking their photographs on his phone.

The masked lot then moved to the girls wing of Sabarmati hostel and targeted the rooms of Kashmiri students, like Khaki, and other minority students, says Jyoti Priyadarshni, a student. Three students stood up to the attack. As the gang went from room to room, Monica Bishnoi, Priyadarshni, and Raashi stood outside and confronted the gang members. Alerting the women of the hostel even as they chased away the attackers, these young students emerged as the saviours on the long night of terror in Sabarmati hostel.

Fear of new trouble

The night came to an end but fear and trauma have only begun, say students. They are afraid as they continue to share hostel space with those whom they suspect were among the masked men and women. Thorat and others are aware that gang members from outside could not have targeted faculty without help from insiders.

Chandan explains the lingering mental trauma and after-effects of the violence. “A courier delivery man knocked on my door on Tuesday. The knock was loud but I could not bring myself to open the door. My heart was beating fast and I told my roommate that this could be a trick; maybe some people were planning to assault me,” he says. The courier man eventually went away. Following the violence, the dhabas and small eateries on campus are slowly returning to normalcy, but assaulted students continue to wear broken spectacles, injuries on their head and face, and anxiously scan their surroundings, anticipating another round of assault. No amount of assurance makes them feel comfortable. “Our outdoor activities have drastically reduced. Many of us are so tired that we sleep for more than 12 hours. We have stopped our morning walks,” says Krishan Takhar of the Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, indicating that students who usually spend hours at the famous central library of the university are unable to study.

Apart from the presence of some of the key members of the masked gang among the students of the right-wing student bodies, the battered activists also fear the security agency of the campus. The agency, Cyclops Security and Allied Services, took charge a month before the complete university strike was called by the JNUSU students. In a notification issued on September 18, JNU’s security department was asked to remain “extra vigilant”. The note said, “They have been instructed to verify the identity of the person entering JNU Campus/building, to their full satisfaction. All residents are requested to carry their ID cards... Together we can make JNU a secure campus.”

Once the strike and sit down protest began, the students realised that the guards intended to assault them. “On one occasion we spent a night protesting at the administration block. Some girls were huddled together early in the morning. Suddenly a guard came and snatched away our razai (thick blanket),” says Sucheta. She also claims that the guards slapped her and others some time between January 3 and 5.

The security agency boasts of appointing ex-servicemen for security assignments. However, visitors to the campus say they noticed a subtle change in the rules for entering the campus soon after the agency took charge. In the old system, guards gave plastic tokens to outsiders entering the campus. Thorat noticed one day, when he was being driven into the campus by a friend, that the guards were not always asking for the tokens to be returned. But students also add that they are not wary of all the security guards. They are friendly with many of the previous security guards, who even called them after the January 5 incident to enquire about their well being, they say.

So far, a controversial tenure

Ever since Kumar took charge in January 2016 from Sudhir Kumar Sopory as Vice Chancellor of JNU, there has been trouble. In March 2018, eight women accused Professor Atul Johri, at the university’s School of Life Sciences, of sexual harassment. Subsequently, the Delhi High Court stopped him from accessing his office and the school premises. Despite the restraint order from the court, Johri continued to teach and access his room and laboratory even as students continued to protest against his presence. The breakdown of the Gender Sensitization Committee Against Sexual Harassment, or GSCASH, which used to be at the forefront of protecting students against sexual assault on campus, has also been a major issue during Kumar’s tenure. GSCASH was dismantled and replaced with a new outfit called the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), set up by the administration. In 2018, The Wire reported how the ICC leaked a complaint from a student to the ABVP. This jeopardised the identity of the complainant. As a result, the ICC could not gain the trust of the students. The JNU administration guided by the Vice Chancellor replaced the more representative GSCASH with the ICC. JNUSU claims that the ICC is staffed by the administration’s “loyalists” and lacks the transparency required for deterring sexual harassment on campus. Apart from the complaint against Johri, several cases of sexual harassment that raise disturbing questions about gender fairness on campus remain unaddressed.

The dream of unity

The hostels in JNU are named after the rivers of the country to represent the unity of India. However, students and teachers on campus say that the university is deeply splintered today. In such a polarised campus, where a student protest against fee hike has taken the form of an anti-government movement, the biggest victims are the students who want to remain removed from campus politics and intellectually curious. “There is no way a student can maintain his academic and personal freedom. We are constantly reminded that to remain safe we must align with one group or the other,” says Krishan, a student. Apart from the students, the teachers are also divided. The JNU Teacher’s Association has held many protest rallies against the Vice Chancellor. Its members were brutally assaulted on January 5. The JNU Teacher’s Federation has accused the JNU Teacher’s Association of disrupting academic life on campus. A group called JNU Commons has emerged to safeguard the intellectual autonomy of students and scholars and provide space to those who want to maintain a distance from all these issues and yet show commitment to justice and fairness on the campus.

As the police investigation continues, questions hang in the air about the future of the investigation itself. Students claim that they saw police in civvies inside the campus even as the assault and heavy stone-pelting targeted female students of the Left. It was only several days after the traumatic day, on Thursday night, that the police removed large posters near the university. These had been pasted by a self- proclaimed Hindu Sena leader, Surjeet Yadav, and accused student leaders of being “balaatkaari (rapists)”, “pro-Chinese” and “anti-national Leftists”.

Meanwhile, the administration is still pushing for students to register. “There were concerns among some of us about whether or not we should register but after the attack of January 5 more students feel that it’s better to stay united and avoid registering this semester. January 5 was the last day of registration but only a fraction of students had registered by then. Now the admin has extended the registration process but this option is not yet popular,” says Deepak Kumar, senior research scholar at the Centre for Law and Governance.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z0qdrn/article30537433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THAISHE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-violence-the-night-of-the-long-rods/article30537437.ece
67,2020/01/11,Steel mesh to replace border fences,"The ‘rickety’ barbed wires along the Pakistan and Bangladesh border are being replaced with meshed fence made of steel and coated with anti-rust paint, a senior government official said on Friday.

India shares 4,096.7 km border with Bangladesh and 3,323 km with Pakistan.

The cost of around 1 km of fence is approximately ₹1.99 crore. The Border Security Force (BSF) that is deployed along the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders has been tasked to ensure that the fence is installed in a time-bound manner.

Currently a pilot project has been sanctioned at a cost of ₹14.3 crore at Lathitila in Assam’s Silchar district. The clearance was first given in 2016. “This will be a complete overhaul of the security system. The unique quality of the new fence is that it cannot be snipped,” the official said.

He added that nobody can climb it. “There are many pockets along the border where the old barbed wires are so fragile that they can be destroyed with a mild push,” the official said.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the functioning of the BSF on December 14 where various technological solutions to plug the porous stretches of the border was discussed.

The official said a comprehensive review was done and all the vulnerable spots along the eastern and western borders have been mapped and identified.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is implementing the project and the contract has been given to a firm called AON Fencing & Gates, headquartered in Ireland.

The official said the border guarding forces have been asked to be on high alert as there are inputs of infiltration attempts from Pakistan once the winter subsides.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bvn2sw/article30537173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11thfence,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/steel-mesh-to-replace-border-fences/article30537174.ece
68,2020/01/11,Environmentalism must be a political passion: Jairam Ramesh,"Congress MP and former Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh on Friday said environmentalism must be a political passion, and sloganeering and making false claims at international conferences would not be enough.

“Of course, we need faster economic growth,” he said, but environment was a “matter of livelihoods”.

At a panel discussion at the Bhopal Literature Festival, he said, “The Ministry is the most unpopular to head. Yet, we have to discover the political courage to walk the talk.” “It’s a balancing act,” he said. “Of course, a poor country requires jobs, industry and investment. But at the same time, we need to protect our environment.”

If all stakeholders remained unhappy, the Environment Minister did his job well, he said. “Sometimes you take decisions which will please environmentalists and sometimes not. The first rule is you can’t satisfy everyone. You can’t achieve satisfaction, but balanced dissatisfaction.”

However, he pointed out, governments themselves bypassed laws in several instances. “Where there is public hearing, there is no public, and where there is a hearing there is no public. Guess who is the biggest culprit? It is the government and its agencies. Don’t blame the private sector each time.”

Mr. Ramesh asserted that the ease of doing business was a “dangerous thought”. Governments tended to make environmental laws weaker in an attempt to achieve better ranking, he said.

In a session moderated by journalist Abhilash Khandekar on Mr. Ramesh’s book Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature, he said the former Prime Minister, during her 16-year tenure, was committed to the cause of environment. “Four major laws, including the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, were enacted during her regime at her personal and political initiative.” “Still, she didn’t see herself as a political figure, but a child of nature,” said Mr. Ramesh. “The favourite phrase of Indira Gandhi, the only Prime Minister to take part at the Stockholm Conference, was ecological balance.”

Though Ms. Gandhi had never visited a national park, apprehensive of being intrusive, she visited the Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, he said. “She had a special connect with Madhya Pradesh, and often encouraged its Chief Ministers to conserve environment.”

However, he added a caveat: not all her actions were flawless. “She cleared the opening of the oil refinery in Mathura knowing well that it could have an impact on the Taj Mahal. That’s an example of a decision that ought not to have been taken.”

Contrasting her role with that of her father and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, he said, “For Nehru, nation-building was of paramount importance; for her, striking a balance between environment and development was.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pbb4qj/article30538594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10RAMESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/environmentalism-must-be-a-political-passion-jairam-ramesh/article30538595.ece

Kurnool MLA Hafeez Khan sat alongside the leaders of KJAC and reiterated the State government’s stand. “The Muslims of Andhra Pradesh would not be inconvenienced in any manner by CAA or NRC,” he said.

Brushing aside the rumours that the government had started collecting data, he said, “The government has not started collecting any data for citizenship. However, the village and ward volunteers are collecting some data for the effective implementation of the government’s welfare schemes.”

Responding to an appeal by the leaders of KJAC, Mr. Khan said that he was confident that the NPR would not be taken up in the State in a discriminatory manner. On why the YSRCP voted in favour of the CAA, the MLA blamed the Central government and claimed that they were given “half-truths” about the Act.

KJAC leader Syed Shafi Pasha Qadri told The Hindu that the protest was expected to last a month. “Every day a new set of people from different areas of the city will stage a protest against CAA, NRC and NPR,” he said.

73,2020/01/11,YSRCP leaders seek TDP stand on HC for Rayalaseema,"“Will the Telugu Desam Party support High Court for the Rayalaseema region at Kurnool? Does it want decentralisation of development with all regions in Andhra Pradesh growing? Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu must make his stand clear on these aspects before he lands in Rayalaseema to campaign for Amaravati as capital,” said YSR Congress Party leaders here on Saturday.

Addressing separate press conferences, Anantapur MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy and YSRCP parliamentary constituency in charge Nadiem Ahmed took objection to Mr. Chandrababu Naidu “standing just for a handful of farmers in Amaravati and not bothering about the development of the rest of the State”.

“Hundreds of farmers committed suicide in the five years of TDP rule in the Rayalaseema region, but did Mr. Naidu ever bother to rescue them by resorting to raising funds from the public, like he is doing for the Amaravati farmers?” Mr. Venkatarami Reddy questioned. “Why did Mr. Naidu not choose Kurnool for setting up the High Court as per the Sribagh agreement, and why is he averse to Kurnool region getting developed,” he asked.

Mr. Naidu could not develop his own Kuppam constituency in the Rayalaseema region and was behaving like a leader for the two districts of Guntur and Krishna, he said.

‘False claims by TDP’

“Is Mr. Naidu against the development of North Andhra?” asked Mr. Nadiem Ahmed at a separate press conference. He said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wished only to decentralise the development and administration by locating each wing in one region and Amaravati was not being abandoned as was being made out by TDP leaders, he said.

74,2020/01/11,At least 70% of Amaravati prone to floods: IIT-Madras,"In its report on the conditions in Amaravati, where the TDP government proposed to develop the capital city, the IIT-Madras has stated that the constitution areas on the south of the Krishna such as the sports, government, finance and tourism cities are not recommended for construction due to significant risks of flooding.

As per the report, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, IIT-Madras also observed that construction was expensive due to the presence of rocks at depths greater than 40 metres, and the costs to raise or fill up the area to prevent flooding would be very high, and it would be dangerous to other areas.

Besides, it was mentioned in the master plan prepared by the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) that it was recommended to raise / fill up three to four metres, which is higher than the historical flood level of the Krishna river, and redesigning it entailed significant costs.

The cost of construction in the capital area would be very high due to the pile foundation required to be laid. The raft foundation with basement was not advisable due to the groundwater level at 2.50 metres to 5 metres below the ground level.

The IIT-Madras further observed that at least 70% of the proposed capital area could be affected by floods, and that constructions on and near the riverbed were fraught with high risks.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wfhrm/article30548294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJPG4-IIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/at-least-70-of-amaravati-prone-to-floods-iit-madras/article30545011.ece

77,2020/01/11,TDP will approach court on ‘misuse of Sec. 144’: Uma,"Former Minister and TDP leader Devineni Umamaheswara Rao on Saturday said that the YSRCP government was misusing Section 144 and Section 30 to trample on the fundamental rights of the people of the State.

The TDP would fight it out in the court of law, Mr. Rao told the media here.

Referring to the observation made by Judge of the Supreme Court Justice N.V. Ramana that governments had been found misusing Section 144 to curb freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution, the TDP leader said that Mr. Justice Ramana had clearly mentioned that the Section could be imposed only under dire situations, or else the victims could approach the court of law.

Mr. Rao came down heavily on the police personnel for allegedly locking up the Vedika Kalyana Mandapam near Benz Circle, the office of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti’s Joint Action Committee (JAC), and reminded that the JAC was representing over 50 organisations, which included all political parties.

IAS officers cautioned

The TDP leader alleged that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his team were now preparing the ground for repealing the CRDA Act, and warned the IAS officers against “blindly signing on the secret GOs.”

Mr. Rao reminded the IAS officers of the case of Y. Srilakshmi, who had been arrested due to her alleged involvement in the Obulapuram Mining Company case.

Mr. Rao said that the protests would continue until the government conceded to their demand to retain the capital in Amaravati.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-will-approach-court-on-misuse-of-sec-144-uma/article30544939.ece
78,2020/01/11,Corporations for BCs likely on population basis,"A meeting of Ministers and leaders of the Backward Classes (BC) welfare associations and the YSRCP, chaired by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, resolved to set up separate corporations for the BCs in three categories on the basis of population (ranging from 10,000 to 1,00,000; 1,00,000 to 10,00,000; and above 10,00,000) as recommended by a committee constituted by the party before the 2019 elections with Janga Krishna Murthy as its chairman.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested that the BC communities, whose population was less than 10,000, should be taken care of in an appropriate manner for alleviating their living standards along with that of the numerically stronger ones.

Emphasis should be laid on providing houses, ration cards, pensions and financial assistance to those communities, the Chief Minister said.

He said the government would consider the recommendations of the committee and finalise the modalities after a high-level meeting involving the BC Ministers, MPs, and MLAs, and leaders of various BC associations.

Ministers Botcha Satyanarayana, Mopidevi Venkataramana, P. Anil Kumar, Dharmana Krishna Das and M.

79,2020/01/11,Centre closely watching situation in State: Sujana,"Taking objection to the “police crackdown” on the people protesting against the move to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam under the guise of decentralisation, BJP Rajya Sabha member Y.S. Chowdary (popularly known as Sujana Chowdary) said on Saturday that the Central government was closely watching the manner in which the State was dealing with the situation.

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishen Reddy personally enquired into the law and order scenario, he said.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Chowdary said that instead of trying to arrive at a consensus on his model of decentralisation, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was persecuting those speaking against it while he remained a mute spectator to the “excesses” being committed by the police on the protesters.

NCW probe

The use of force by the police allegedly led to the death of a woman in Ongole, prompting the National Commission for Women (NCW) to order a probe into the incident, he said.

“DGP D. Gautam Sawang is expected to be impartial,” Mr. Chowdary said.

Restrictions had been imposed under Section 144 of the CrPC without adhering to the norms, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court itself issued certain directions thereof, he observed.

Mr. Chowdary stated that the idea of three capitals was highly impractical, and with the finances of the State teetering on the brink of a disaster, the government would do well not to precipitate the crisis further.

MLA complains to Shah

Special Correspondent in Visakhapatnam writes: Meanwhile, YSRCP MLA from Anakapalle and party spokesperson Gudivada Amarnath, in a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, decried the comments allegedly made by Mr. Chowdary at a press conference.

“His comments are unconstitutional, unlawful and not in good taste,” Mr. Amarnath said in his letter.

Mr. Chowdary allegedly said that “India is not a fit place to live, and it is better for the citizens to shift to other countries as refugees instead of witnessing the crimes occurring in India.”

“Such a statement from a responsible lawmaker will upset the people and cause irreparable damage to the country,” Mr. Amarnath said, and urged Mr. Shah to take appropriate action against Mr. Chowdary.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-closely-watching-situation-in-state-sujana/article30544766.ece

81,2020/01/11,Mining racket busted,"The Prakasam police busted a major mining racket with the arrest of 16 persons at Martur in the district on Saturday.

Probe revealed tax evasion to the tune of ₹100 crore by the accused who did illegal granite business for about ₹900 crore after floating fictitious firms under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Tax Offices (CTOs) in Addanki, Chirala, Ongole-I and II under the new GST regime, Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal told the media here.

The offenders had allegedly evaded payment of commercial tax and mining royalty to the tune of ₹100 crore by transporting 6.38 lakh square feet of mined material through fake bills. They had concealed the volume and value of the mined material and generated 25,000 E-waybills after creating 17 email accounts using 26 mobile phones.

Probe further revealed that more than 100 persons, including 23 ‘granite markers’ were involved in the racket, said the SP who constituted a Special Investigating Team (SIT) under Chirala DSP Y. Jayaramasubba Reddy to probe the case.

Fictious firms

Taking advantage of the State government’s Ease of Doing Business policy, they had allegedly floated 278 fictitious firms and generated Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) with the help of forged documents including rental agreements, Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, electricity bills and bank account passbooks, the SP said.

“We are working in close coordination with the mining and tax authorities to unravel the racket in full,” he said, adding legal action would also be taken against the officials who had colluded with the offenders. More arrests would follow as the SIT was in the process of collecting strong evidence to build a strong case.

The offenders were identified as Y.Ravi (30), Patan Arifulla (25), Sk. Shabbir(26), K.Satish (33), G. Hemanth (32), A. Ravikumar (36), V. Jellaih (30), Patan Jani Basha (21), Sk. Raheem (26), K.

82,2020/01/11,‘Justice will be done to Amaravati farmers’,"The YSRCP government would not leave in the lurch the farmers who had parted with their land in Amaravati for the construction capital during the TDP term, Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy asserted on Saturday.

Leading a rally here, Mr. Srinivasa Reddy exhorted the people to endorse the three capitals move of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy by giving a thumping majority to the party in the local body elections.

Allaying the fears of the Amaravati farmers, he said the farmer-friendly government would ensure justice to them.

He wanted them to not get misled by the politically-motivated agitation by the TDP.

He explained that locating the Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial capitals in the three regions of the State would spur decentralised development.

TDP warned

Poor infrastructure created in Amaravati exposed the sincerity of the TDP government, which had spent only ₹5,000 crore in five years while projecting in graphics a dream capital with an investment of about ₹1,00,000 crore.

Taking objection to alleged violence perpetrated by the TDP, he said, “Don’t test the patience of the YSRCP workers who are maintaining restraint. If they begin to react, the TDP will be wiped out.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/justice-will-be-done-to-amaravati-farmers/article30544505.ece
83,2020/01/11,Three capitals: YSRCP steps up efforts to garner people’s support,"The YSRCP has stepped up its efforts to garner people’s support in both the districts to the government’s move to establish three capitals.

Its leaders and cadres are organising awareness rallies and human chains to enlighten people on the advantages of such a move.

The party has taken up these initiatives at Kothavalasa, Gajapathinagaram, and Bobbili in Vizianagaram district and Itchapuram, Palasa, and Narasannapeta in Srikakulam district.

“The north Andhra region will witness development with the establishment of the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam and construction of an international airport at Bhogapuram,” says YSRCP MLA representing S. Kota K. Srinivasa Rao.

“Former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu is batting for Amaravati as capital only to benefit from the land deals. Investing all money in one area will be detrimental to the interests of other districts. The Hyderabad-centric model of development he had adopted in the unified is an example,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao argues.

‘It will check migration’

“Over 5 lakh people had migrated from Srikakulam district in search of greener pastures. Most of them are leading a pathetic life in different parts of the country. They are unable to take care of their aged parents who have been left to fend for themselves back home. Most of them will stand to gain if employment opportunities are created locally. For that to happen, development of the north Andhra region is a must. And the three capitals plan will usher in real development,” says YSRCP leader from Etcherla constituency B. Janardhan Reddy.

‘Nothing to fear’

Adviser to the State BC Welfare Association and noted physician Kutikuppala Suryarao says that there is nothing to fear with the three capitals move as the government is coming up with detailed development plan for all the 13 districts.

“Equal distribution of wealth and equal opportunities in employment are the need of the hour. Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, which are the most backward areas in the country, will witness development only when steps are taken to improve the per capita income of people,” Dr. Suryarao says.

“Vizianagaram has been denied justice for the last seven decades. It may get its share of development if Executive capital is set up in Visakhapatnam,” according to Vizianagaram district Telaga Samkshema Sangham president P. Venkata Ramarao.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-capitals-ysrcp-steps-up-efforts-to-garner-peoples-support/article30544488.ece

Coming down heavily on Mr. Naidu, Former Minister and senior YSRC Party leader Dadi Veerabhadra Rao said that at present Naidu’s only aim is to become Chief Minister by doing anything. He alleged that since Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is gaining a good name with his welfare schemes, Mr. Naidu is coming up with various tactics to spoil the image.

He alleged that Mr. Naidu had failed to develop North Andhra region and he had no right to talk about the region.

87,2020/01/11,NCW takes suo motu cognisance of women protesters’ ‘shabby’ treatment,"The smouldering fire of the ‘three capitals’ issue seems to be turning into a full-blown conflagration with scores of women from the capital Amaravati villages, along with their supporters, hitting the road declaring that its a do-or-die battle for them.

The simmering issue of the proposed shifting of the capital out of Amaravati to Visakhapatnam has evoked strong reactions from various quarters.

Responding to the situation, Chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW) Rekha Sharma tweeted on her Twitter handle that the Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of the alleged reports of women brutally beaten and throttled by the Andhra Pradesh police during their protest.

Ms. Sharma said the commission would deput a fact-finding team to Amaravati to probe the incident.

Remarks trigger row

Chairperson of the State Women’s Commission Vasireddy Padma, meanwhile, incurred the wrath of the women protesters when she said that they were being used as pawns by their men who were “hiding behind them”.

When asked to respond to the ongoing agitations by women in the capital region, Ms. Padma asked where had the men gone. Hinting at the TDP leaders, she said the people’s elected representatives who played a very active role in the insider trading were not to be seen now. “Are men there to only enjoy their posts? When it is time to protest, they have brought their women to the fore,” she said.

The women panel chief said the men (TDP leaders) should hang their heads in shame for reducing the women to mere vote bank and called it “politics of decadence”.

Strong reaction

Ms Padma’s statement evoked strong reactions from the protesting women who said that being at the helm of the Women’s Commission, she should extend her support to the cause of women but she was reduced to a pawn in the YSR Congress Party government.

88,2020/01/11,High-power panel discusses key proposals,"The high-power committee, in its second meeting on Friday, discussed in detail the “special proposals” to develop Krishna and Guntur districts.

The committee was of the opinion that centralised development would be an immense loss to the State.

Taking a cue from the history on the implications and disadvantages of centralised development, it stressed the need for equitable development.

Disclosing the details of the meeting, Information and Public Relations (I&PR) Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said the views of the employees, farmers and other stakeholders would be taken into consideration. The committee would meet again on January 13, he said.

Agriculture Minister K. Kanna Babu said the committee discussed various aspects. It also discussed the reports of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), G.N. Rao Committee and Sivaramakrishnan Committee. Also, decentralisation of administration and interests of the farmers in the Amaravati area were discussed in detail, he said.

Dig at Naidu

The previous government did not construct permanent buildings in the Capital area. Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should respect the people’s verdict, the Minister said.

“Mr. Naidu had mobilised ₹50 crore by way of donations for the construction of the capital. Now, he is repeating the same. What happened to the funds he had collected?” Mr. Kanna Babu asked.

“Mr. Naidu is instigating the farmers for his vested political interests. He is creating confusion among the people. He is trying to divert people’s attention from the successful implementation of welfare schemes. The Leader of the Opposition does not want comprehensive development of all the regions. He does not want development of the Rayalaseema, north Coastal Andhra and other backward areas. The high-power committee will take the people sentiments into consideration,” he said.

Land for employees?

Meanwhile, sources said that the high-power committee discussed at length the implications of shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam as far as employees were concerned.

The committee was said to have discussed a few key proposals such as allocation of 200 square yards of land at a nominal price to each employee who shifts to Visakhapatnam, sanction of loan of up to ₹25 lakh each for construction of a house, sanction of ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh, depending upon the cadre, to help shift families, concession to travel by bus or train, and five-day week. These proposals were said to have been placed before the employees.

The committee, in its first meeting, had opined that administration and development should be decentralised.

89,2020/01/11,Tension prevails on Bandar Road as women assemble in huge numbers,"Tension prevailed on MG Road (Bandar Road) here on Friday with the police swooping down on women who were protesting against the State government’s plans to shift the Capital to Visakhapatnam.

In response to a call given by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti JAC, women gathered in huge numbers near PWD Grounds and tried to proceed towards the Benz Circle. The police took them into preventive custody saying that Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people in an area, was in vogue.

The women, wearing black saris and dress, assembled near Sub Collector’s office, Civil Courts and other places located close to Bandar Road. Despite restrictions, the women took out procession raising slogans and squatted on the road near D.V. Manor bringing the traffic to a grinding halt. They also staged a sit-in protest near RTA office. They jumped the medians and rope parties of the police to proceed towards Benz Circle.

Tough time

The police had a tough time in handling the situation. The vehicles lined up to shift the women who were taken into preventive custody were not adequate. A couple of them tried to deflate the tyres of a police van. The women also tried to take away the ignition keys of the vehicles. At a point of time, the women jumped from the police vans and rejoined the protests.

Telugu Desam Party leaders Gadde Anuradha, Divya Vani and others were arrested. Ms. Divyavani alleged that the police misbehaved with her. The police did not show any respect for the women. They bundled the women into buses and vans forcibly. She had a wordy duel with the police on duty.

The women were shifted to different police stations in the city. While Ms. Divyavani was shifted to Gannavaram police station, some were sent to Nunna Rural police station. Though the police tried to elicit their personal information, the women refused to speak. Instead, they raised slogans demanding that the government shelve its plans.

Police Commissioner Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said there was no permission to take out rallies.

Pointing to the fact that the two schemes were started in 1989 with an idea to utilise them for helping workers in need of financial help, union president Y.V. Rao and general secretary P. Damodar Rao found fault with the management for scrapping the schemes without taking them into confidence.

They said in the event of discontinuation of the schemes, the management had agreed to repay the amount due to the employees within next three months with 8 %-15% interest on it.

Local residents continued to gather in village centres voicing their opinion against the move. Meanwhile, the death of a farmer, Adepalli Krupanidhi from Krishnayapalem, evoked grief among the villagers.

Telugu Desam Party national general secretary Nara Lokesh consoled the family members and even carried the body up to some distance. Mr. Lokesh, had earlier visited the district jail in Guntur, and interacted with those arrested in the case of assault on mediapersons.

The TDP leaders upped the ante against Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Former Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu alleged the decision to shift the Capital to Visakhapatnam was taken to placate Swami Swaroopananda Swamy, based in Visakhapatnam. He also alleged that the decision to shift the Capital was a “guru dakshina” to the godman.

TDP leader G.V. Anjaneyulu said that Mr. Jagan had destroyed the hopes of five crore people in the State.

94,2020/01/11,Cashew traders hail decision on export of kernels,"A notice issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade suspending the ad-hoc norms approved in July 2018 for the export of cashew kernels (wholes and pieces) against the import of shelled cashew kernels has brought cheer among cashew exporters from North Andhra.

Welcoming the decision, A.P. Cashew Manufacturers’ Association president Phani Raghavalu called the decision a New Year gift from the State government to the cashew industry, at a time when exporters were struggling to overcome a slowdown and recover losses caused by multiple cyclones.

“We are thankful to the DGFT and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for suspending the ad-hoc norms,” Mr. Raghavulu told The Hindu.

There have been umpteen complaints regarding misuse by some companies who dumped low quality cashew kernels in the country using loopholes and gaps in the system, forcing processors to suffer huge losses.

North Andhra, comprising Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, has nearly 800 processing units of which over half closed their operations due to heavy losses. Many are operating by drastically reducing production. The turnover in the region is estimated to be over ₹100 crore.

Some companies allegedly misused norms by dumping broken cashews in the domestic market, bringing prices down by ₹150 to ₹200 per kg. “This affected small processors hugely who are entirely dependent on domestic markets for their production. Our State has over 650 units which come under micro and medium enterprises. As a result of losses, many units were shut down,” Mr. Raghavalu said.

APCMA vice-president Vasu said that the notice has brought hope to crisis-hit cashew farmers and processors.

Over 300 processing units in Srikakulam had come under huge pressure due to the market fluctuation following dumping of low quality cashew kernel into the domestic market by some big players, according to Malla Kantaro of Kannan Cashews.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qc641o/article30537943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-VJ-ROASTEDCASHEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cashew-traders-hail-decision-on-export-of-kernels/article30537944.ece

Speaking at a meeting on the action plan for Dharwad Rangayana here on Friday evening, newly-appointed director Ramesh Parvinaikar said all senior and performing artistes and experts in theatre would be invited for the discussion to formulate new plans for Dharwad Rangayana.

He said the idea was not to limit theatre activities just to Dharwad but to hold theatre-related activities in the districts of Haveri, Gadag, Bagalkot, Vijayapura and Uttar Kannada. “We want people from all these other districts to benefit from theatre programmes. Hence Rangayana administrator, artistes and staff would be asked to chalk out plans for new programmes,” he said. He added that every month there would be a review of programmes of the month and discussions on new projects to be taken up.

Rangayana would hold workshops, symposiums, children’s plays and stage shows. This apart, the national drama week would also be organised, he said.

101,2020/01/11,"‘EyeCane’, sensors to alert solid waste handlers, gas leak alarm and more","Some of the ideas and projects demonstrated at The Hindu in School Science Festival held at RIMSE here on Saturday brought to spotlight the schoolchildren’s societal concerns and the problems faced in urban landscapes.

One such project was by Surya and Eshaan from VVS BM Sri CBSE School, Kuvempunagar, Mysuru who have developed “EyeCane”, a walking stick for the visually challenged persons using the sensor technology, and “EyePro”, a neck and shoulder device alert on the approaching objects for the visual-impaired.

While the stick gives three types of beep noise depending on the closeness of the approaching object for cautioning the person, the “EyePro” device vibrates to alert the person on the nearing objects. Either of the two can be used by the visually impaired for their assistance, they said.

Before coming up with this device, the students had interacted with persons with visual impairment to understand their difficulties. Some visually challenged persons have given positive feedback on the device.

Peeved over overflowing trash on roads, Pragna and Yashas of DMS School, Mysuru have used sensors to alert the solid waste handlers upon the garbage bin spillover for its clearance. Using Google maps, the handlers are alerted with location on where the trash was overflowing.

How to reduce the burden of trash in cities? Edible and biodegradable plates using naturally available resources could be the answer, say Sanjana and Gowri of VVS BM Sri CBSE School, who came up with products as substitutes to nature-unfriendly plates. Interestingly, biodegradable plates had been embedded with seeds so that they grow into plants upon disposing of.

A gesture recognition and communication project by Akanksha and her team, students of Excel Public School, Mysuru, aims to make day-to-day activities of differently abled persons easier with gestures.

Alcohol detection with engine locking system, gas leak alarm, and driver warning systems on the hill road bends for safer journey were a few other projects that drew attention among the many displayed at the science festival which also gave the participants a platform to exchange opinions and ideas.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/w0tqzh/article30545715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MYSBOYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/eyecane-sensors-to-alert-solid-waste-handlers-gas-leak-alarm-and-more/article30545719.ece
102,2020/01/11,New branch of DCC Bank opens,"Claiming that the DCC Bank has already crossed working capital of over ₹6,000 crore in twin districts of Vijayapura and Bagalkot, MLA and DCC bank president Shivanand Patil said that the bank has been working for farmers of the district.

Addressing at the opening of new branch of the bank on Saturday, he said that in Vijayapura alone, the bank has waived off loans worth ₹1,000 crore after government wrote off farm loans. “Our primary objective is to provide financial assistance to farmers to make sure that they work in farms without any worry,” he said.

Stating that sugar factories are the bank’s main source of earning, Mr. Patil said a majority of sugar factories of the twin districts avail loans from the bank.

About the new branch, he said it was earlier functioning in a rented building. Now, the bank has its own building.

“We have 39 branches in the district. By November, we would like to add 11 more to bring the total to 50. Since we are celebrating 100 years of the establishment of the bank, we are also planning to hold a ‘state cooperative week’ in Vijayapura this month. We are in touch with the functionaries of the cooperative federation,” he said.

In his address, Siddeshwar Swami of Gyana Yogashrama urged farmers to repay the loans on time to help the bank run smoothly. “The bank should work for farmers and farmers should work for the bank.

103,2020/01/11,Promoting tubers and roots,"It is a discovery of the world of tubers and roots ranging from cassava to yams at the two-day Tuber Mela that got underway at the Nanjaraja Bahadur Choultry in the city on Saturday.

A 88-kg tuber cultivated by a farmer from Hunsur, which took two years to reach its beastly size, was the cynosure of all eyes at the mela which is drawing huge crowds and saw the presence of the erstwhile royals of Mysuru including Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Also on display was Simha Pada, another variety of tuber, besides 500 others in all sizes and shapes from across the State.

Kalegowda Nagawar, folklorist, who inaugurated the mela called for a return to the consumption of tubers and roots as it is part of the country’s culinary heritage that has been ignored in the last few decades. The mela is being organised by Sahaja Samruddha and University of Horticultural Sciences, Bagalkot, to promote public awareness on the nutritional benefits of tubers and roots.

Mr. Nagawar said the tribal communities were first exposed to tubers and roots which were rich in proteins and carbohydrates.

They are a precursor to other food items including rice and is part of the inherited heritage that should be conserved. He expressed concern that even the tribal food culture was of late being polluted by the widespread introduction of polished rice in hamlets.

The folklorist said it was time to bring back tubers and roots to the food table.

Book released

A book on the world of tubers and roots was also released to mark the occasion. Arun Kumar Bhavidoddi, a horticultural scientist from the Regional Horticultural Research and Extension Centre, Dharwad, said tubers and roots were a good supplement to ensure food security and would benefit the farmers too as they entailed little cultivation cost, were resistant to vagaries of nature and there was a ready market for the produce. They could be grown under rain-fed conditions, he added.

More than 25 farmers’ groups from across the State are participating in the two-day mela which will feature a cooking competition on Sunday.

Krishna Prasad of Sahaja Samruddha said tubers and roots have an important role in food security and nutrition and were beneficial to farmers to shore up their income. In the present times of agricultural crisis where the input cost has increased and income is on the decline, tubers require next to nothing to grow but could supplement farmers’ income, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/omh7if/article30545697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MYSTUBER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/promoting-tubers-and-roots/article30545699.ece
104,2020/01/11,Good response to ‘Avishkar’,"The second edition of The Hindu in School Science Festival – Avishkar – in Mysuru on Saturday evoked tremendous response with over 250 students from various schools from Mysuru, Hassan and other places turning up to showcase their innovative talent and creativeness on the picturesque premises of Ramakrishna Institute of Moral and Spiritual Education (RIMSE), Yadavagiri.

The inter-school competition gave a platform for the schoolchildren to demonstrate their projects on scientific concepts even as other inquisitive and enthusiastic children thronged the venue to look at the inspiring ‘innovations’.

The event was open for children from Class 7 to 10 and each team comprised two students.

Swami Sathyakanthananda, Correspondent, RIMSE, who was the chief guest, inaugurated the festival in the presence of Yuvraj Jain, Founder, Excellent PU College, Mangaluru, the title sponsor of the event, teachers and parents and others.

The corridors of RIMSE, which was the venue partner, had turned into a sort of “innovation lab” with children displaying their projects and enthusiastically explaining their concepts to the visitors and the judges, who had the task of choosing the best ones.

A total of 44 schools took part with about 130 projects which were impressive and elucidated the students’ proclivity for science. Most children were accompanied by their parents and teachers.

After two rounds of screening, the jury zeroed in on three projects for the top three prizes besides finalising the five consolation prizes and two special prizes to encourage the talents.

The top three winners received the “Change Maker” award besides cash prize, trophy and a merit certificate. The first prize carried a cash prize of ₹5,000 while the second and third prize winners received ₹3,000 and ₹2,000 respectively.

Vittala Chaithanya N.M. and Yashwanth A.L. from Sri Ramakrishna Vidyashala, Mysuru, won the first prize for their project on solar-powered grass mower. Developed as an ‘alternative’ to the battery-powered lawn mower, the device harnesses solar power to slice the grass.

Tushar Gururaj and Soumik Sinha from Kendriya Vidyalaya, Mysuru, bagged the second prize for their idea “Hantalk”. This is a device useful for speech-impaired people as the hand glove with circuits facilitates conveying messages displayed on the mobile phone of the person wearing the glove.

Hemanth Kumar M.M. and Shreyas U. from Vijaya School, Hassan, secured the third prize for their project titled “Uses of sound in medical treatment”.

Dhanalakshmi and Dhananjay from Elite School, Hassan, got the first special prize for their “river cleaning machine”. The rotating blades of the machine removes the trash and other wastes collected on the river surface and the belt running the blade shifts the collected waste to the rived bank.

107,2020/01/11,Raising awareness on Turner Syndrome that affects females,"When 12-year-old Kruthika (name changed) was not growing in accordance with her age, her parents did not think it was important to seek medical advice. As she grew up, her short stature and inability to attain pubertal development became a major concern for them. When they finally took her to a doctor, little did they know that their daughter was suffering from Turner Syndrome, a rare chromosomal disorder.

Turner Syndrome is a condition that affects only females when one of the X chromosomes (sex chromosomes) is missing or partially missing. Described by Dr. Henry Turner in 1938, it can cause a variety of medical and developmental problems, including shorter height, failure of the ovaries to develop, and heart defects.

To discuss the challenges across lifespan of Turner Syndrome, Magic Foundation-India, an organisation working to create awareness about growth disorders in children, has organised a conference for patients, caregivers and doctors in the city on January 12.

Turner Syndrome can be diagnosed before birth (prenatally), during infancy or in early childhood. Occasionally, in females with mild signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is delayed until teen or young adult years.

Girls and women with Turner Syndrome need ongoing medical care from a variety of specialists. Regular check up and appropriate care can help most girls and women lead healthy and independent lives.

“My diagnosis was 30 years ago and although doctors said I could be treated abroad, we could not afford it. I lived with the condition and subsequently, went into depression. However, I was able to come out of it and I am now leading a successful life,” said Kruthika.

Although there is no data available on the incidence of the condition in Indian population, experts said Turner Syndrome occurs in 1 in 2,500 live female births. “Short stature is almost a consistent finding in Turner Syndrome, the cause of which is multifactorial, including intrauterine growth retardation, gradual decline in height velocity in childhood, absence of pubertal growth spurt, and to end organ resistance resulting from skeletal dysplasia,” said Shaila S. Bhattacharyya, paediatric and adolescent endocrinologist at Manipal Hospitals.

Varying symptoms

Signs and symptoms may vary among girls and women. For some, the presence of the syndrome may not be readily apparent, but in others, a number of physical features and poor growth show early. Signs and symptoms can be subtle, developing slowly over time, or significant, such as heart defects, the doctor said.

108,2020/01/11,Saundatti Yellamma fair attracts hundreds,"The jatra or the annual car fair of the Saundatti Yellamma temple attracted countless devotees from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa and other States.

They arrived at the mountain top town in buses, cars, bullock carts and other vehicles. They walked to the top to visit the temple and worship the reigning deity Yellamma (‘Mother of All’). They took a dip in the waters of the Jogul Bavi and Enne Honda. They set up stoves along the road to cook for their families and offer prasad to the temple. They walked to the temple with chants of ‘Udho, Udho’, holding prasad and coconuts and vermilion. About a hundred shops were set up on the premises to sell clothes, books, prasad items, coconut, dhoop and other materials.

The temple committee has put up barricades all along the premises to control the crowd. “We have streamlined the darshan system to reduce waiting time,” Ravi Kotargasti, CEO, temple committee, said. “We are taking up a massive clean-up operation once the fair ends. We will be utilising the services of paid employees and volunteers,” he said.

The district administration and district police had made elaborate arrangements. The permanent water supply scheme has ensured that the devotees did not suffer scarcity of water.

109,2020/01/11,Human-animal conflict deaths: Ex gratia increased to ₹7.5L,"The State government decision to hike the ex gratia for the family members of those killed in human-animal conflicts from ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh has evoked mixed reactions.

Though the enhancement has been welcomed, it has transpired that the Chief Minister had originally approved a hike from ₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh. This was at the State Board for Wildlife meeting on September 26 last year.

The issue was raised by Sanjay Gubbi, member of the board, who had argued that ₹5 lakh for a family who has lost its breadwinner was measly in the present times. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had approved the hike as per the proceedings of the meeting.

However, the final Government Order issued on January 7 had fixed the ex-gratia amount at ₹7.5 lakh.

Activists question revision

Activists have questioned the downward revision in the final order.

As per government statistics, 47 people died in human-animal conflicts in 2015-16, 48 in 2016-17, 36 in 2017-18, and 21 persons died in 2018-19. This works out to an average of 38 deaths per annum. Enhancing the ex gratia by ₹2.5 lakh would have cost the government less than ₹1 crore, say activists.

For the bereaved family, the loss of near and dear ones is incalculable and human life can never be compensated with money.

110,2020/01/11,Ballari teacher suspended for sharing video of student,"A teacher of a government school in Ballari district, who had allegedly shared a video of a student struggling with the pronunciation of a Kannada word, was suspended on Saturday.

After the video, which reportedly showed the teacher mocking and beating the child, went viral on social media, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education traced the teacher to Hagari Bommanahalli in the district, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar told reporters in Mysuru.

The suspension order states that though there is an order prohibiting teachers from using mobile phones inside classrooms, the teacher had violated the rule. “Besides, the harassment to the child as stated in the Rule 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act has also been proven during inquiry,” the order states.

Mr. Kumar also pointed out that mobile phones cannot be used on school premises during working hours.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ballari-teacher-suspended-for-sharing-video-of-student/article30545559.ece
111,2020/01/11,‘Non-teacher’ status irks resident doctors in medical colleges,"A communication from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), terming junior residents and senior residents working in medical colleges with post-graduation diploma as “non-teachers”, has left the community disappointed.

The medicos with PG diploma have objected to the stand taken by RGUHS and has said it against the guidelines of the Medical Council of India (MCI).

The Karnataka Medical Council in a letter recently asked RGUHS its opinion on whether junior resident/PG students are teachers in medical colleges. The KMC had sought clarification because of the on-going elections to members of the board of management of the council.

The RGUHS, in its reply to KMC, on December 24 said: “Junior residents and senior residents are not considered teachers in a medical college as per MCI regulations.” With this letter, faculty with PG diploma working in medical colleges have lost the opportunity to contest in the KMC elections.

Pruthvi Chakravarthy, a medical practitioner with PG diploma, told The Hindu: “This is unacceptable. There are enough directions from the court and MCI to treat PG diploma holders as teachers,” he said. Dr. Chakravarthy, who till recently worked in a medical college, pointed out that with the latest stand taken by RGUHS some of his friends had lost a chance to contest the KMC elections.

G.P. Ramanath, senior resident with Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences, said in a notification issued by MCI in August 2019 defined a senior resident as teacher. “Even in the past, the MCI has maintained that junior resident and senior residents are teaching staff. If we are not teaching staff, what else are we?” he asked.

When The Hindu contacted S. Sacchidanand, Vice-Chancellor of RGUHS, he said the KMC, being a part of MCI, should not have asked the university for clarification. “When you ask me to define the job profile, I have to state that junior residents and senior residents work in the hospital, not in the college. The university has said the same,” he said. However, he said he had written to the KMC suggesting that it get the issue clarified from MCI.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ja0xuh/article30545556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGRGUHS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/non-teacher-status-irks-resident-doctors-in-medical-colleges/article30545557.ece
112,2020/01/11,Police cite attempts to explode petrol bombs to stop Sringeri literary meet,"Organisers of the Chikkamagaluru District Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, which was opposed by Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi and a few right-wing groups, were told by the local police to stop the event midway because of “attempts by miscreants to explode petrol bombs” in the temple town.

Questions have been raised about why the police did not take action against these miscreants instead of forcing the organisers to cancel the event.

The two-day literary event, presided over by writer and activist Kalkuli Vittal Heggade, was inaugurated on Friday. The police, who had earlier denied permission for the programme, repeatedly intervened at the programme to stop it. A few people, who were opposed to the choice of Mr. Heggade as president, also staged protests. The police took around 80 protesters into custody and released them later. In the evening, the police served a notice on the organisers, asking them to cancel the second day’s programmes.

In the notice, the police claimed that there had been attempts by protesters to burst tyres and explode petrol bombs in Sringeri town to disturb the event, all successfully averted by the police. To avoid any further untoward incident, the event should be called off, they said. They also warned of action against the organisers and participants if they went ahead with the second day’s programmes. The police further said that more than 1,000 people from across the district might land in Sringeri to stop the event.

Eventually, MLA for Sringeri T.D. Raje Gowda, president of the event’s reception committee, decided to cancel the second day’s programmes.

Referring to the police notice, Congress leader V.S. Ugrappa asked if the State government was incapable of ensuring the safe hosting of a Kannada literary event. Senior journalist Dinesh Amin Mattu said that going by the content of the notice, one could conclude that law and order had collapsed in the State.

When The Hindu asked Chikkamagaluru Superintend of Police Harish Pandey if any case was registered under the Explosives Act, given the police claim that attempts to explode petrol bombs had been stopped, he said, “We reached the spot of preparation [of petrol bombs] and were able to disperse them. We found some evidence of bomb preparation. Police action will be intimated in due course.”

Kannada Sahitya Parishat district unit president Kundur Ashok said a decision on conducting the second day’s programmes another day was yet to be taken. “I am glad many people contributed funds for the programme,” he said. With the Parishat refusing to the fund the programme citing Mr. Ravi’s opposition, the organisers had crowd-sourced funds.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-cite-attempts-to-explode-petrol-bombs-to-stop-sringeri-literary-meet/article30545126.ece
113,2020/01/11,Congress MLC opposes Zameer Ahmed Khan’s Ballari visit,"Congress leader and MLC K.C. Kondaiah on Saturday objected to the proposed visit of MLA and party colleague B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan to Ballari on Monday, on the grounds that his speech could “disturb communal harmony” in the district.

Mr. Kondaiah demanded that the police not permit a rally by Mr. Khan as it would likely be provocative. He also made it clear that party leaders, including minorities, would take out a rally after Hampi Utsav demanding action against BJP MLA G. Somashekar Reddy for his “provocative speech” against minorities and those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Kondaiah said that in 2012, when B. Sriramulu resigned from his MLA seat and contested on BSR Congress ticket from Ballari Rural in the byelections, Mr. Khan, who was then with the JD(S), had visited Ballari and addressed a series of election rallies and made provocative speeches. A police complaint was registered back then, Mr. Kondaiah said in a press release.

A couple of days ago, Mr. Khan slammed Mr. Reddy for his speech. As his statements created a furore and there was a demand for his arrest, Mr. Reddy applied for, and was denied, anticipatory bail in a local court.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-mlc-opposes-zameer-ahmed-khans-ballari-visit/article30544835.ece
114,2020/01/11,Women throng anti-CAA rally,"Women members of the Muslim community attended a rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in large numbers in Hassan on Saturday. They took serious objections to the Act, which offers citizenship to persecuted people of all religions, except Muslims, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

Writer and advocate Banu Mushtaq, who chaired the meeting, said the women attended the meeting with fear about their children. The people who assume the seats of power should treat people of all religion as a mother. But the present regime had brought in a law, in violation of the basic principles of the Constitution, to discriminate against one community, she said.

“The Constitution is supreme and we feel secure because of it. We are worried about our safety because of this law. When the NRC is done, from where should we bring records to prove that our ancestors lived here”, she asked.

During the NRC exercise in Assam, many soldiers, many who served the country in different capacities for decades, have not been able to prove their citizenship. When the exercise is taken up across the country, people will have to stand in the queue with documents to prove their citizenship. Earlier, many people standing in queues for currency in front of banks, after demonetisation, lost their lives. They were all poor. None of the rich died.A similar scene would repeat if NRC is implemented”, she said.

Reacting to statements asking the Muslim people to go to Pakistan, she asked why should anybody from India go to Pakistan. “When there was an opportunity, our ancestors chose India and we have been living here and this is our motherland. Nobody has the right to ask us to leave this place”, she maintained.

115,2020/01/11,Don’t fall prey to black magic: Rationalist,"Illustratively describing how self-fashioned godmen and black magicians mislead people with claims of having supernatural powers, Hulikal Nataraj, a rationalist known for his demonstrations of exposing ‘miracles’, held that the blend of indigenous culture and science could be the best way to address it.

Speaking at Hampi on Saturday, the second day of Hampi Utsav – 2020, he dismissed the existence of ghosts and criticised black magicians for infusing fear among people for their personal gains.

“Black magicians and self-styled godmen use chemicals and some tricks to show that they had supernatural powers. They target the innocent, uneducated, and mentally weak people and exploit them. Such exploitations are often carried out in the name of god and ghosts. Don’t fall prey to them. If you find such incidents around you, please inform our team. We will come to the spot and expose them,” he said.

He advised students to get educated and develop a scientific temperament and rational thinking so that they could stay safe from the dangers of black magicians.

He also advised young people to develop a healthy lifestyle by having physical exercise and a healthy diet.

Mr. Nataraj, who has held demonstrations busting black magic in 52 countries, demonstrated a few black magic techniques and exposed the secrets behind them by scientific reasoning.

Shraddha Bilagi, Spoorthi Bhajantri, Keerthi Bhajantri and other students were part of the demonstrations.

In another event on the same stage, M.D. Kaushik, well-known magician, presented magic while presenting the selected poems of Mankutimmana Kagga penned by D.V. Gundappa.

He lifted a 160-kg stone to win for the eighth consecutive year.

As Mr. Arab, a well-known stone lifter in North Karnataka, walked into the arena, the crowd whistled and applauded. As he lifted the heavy boulder up to his knees, the applause got louder and it gained in crescendo as the boulder was on his shoulder.

Mr. Arab, a native of Kalloli village at Jamkhandi taluk in Bagalkot, is a farmer by profession.

117,2020/01/11,"Videos with ‘changed context’ being shared, says Mangaluru police chief","A day after former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy released 35 video clips of the December 19 violence in Mangaluru that left two killed in police firing, Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha said that some clips and pictures were being shared with their sequence and context changed.

While not directly referring to the clips released by Mr. Kumaraswamy, Dr. Harsha, in a video message, said, “Truth can be deciphered only when these visuals are examined in their proper sequence and context.” He said the police had brought in peace and order when a group assembled unlawfully, violating prohibitory orders, and resorted to violence. He added that the police would submit all evidence to the authorities investigating the matter.

On Friday, Mr. Kumaraswamy disputed the videos posted by the police earlier on their official Facebook page. He presented 35 clips as a counter, alleging that the police had exacerbated the situation. He also demanded the resignation of Dr. Harsha.

Meanwhile, a war of words continued in political circles on Saturday. Echoing the response of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and other BJP leaders to these videos, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa termed the clips “cut and paste videos”, released to stoke trouble. “It is clear that the violence was orchestrated by a group. Mr. Kumaraswamy and Congress leader Siddaramaiah must stop supporting these anti-national elements and desist from [indulging in] vote-bank politics,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kumaraswamy hit back at BJP leaders in a series of tweets. “I had predicted in my press conference that dismissing the videos would be the response of BJP leaders. Does the Chief Minister have the courage to get the videos I released forensically examined?” he asked. Responding to criticism that he was disturbing peace by releasing these videos, he tweeted, “Does stifling all dissenting voices, creating a suffocating environment, amount to peace?”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/videos-with-changed-context-being-shared-says-mangaluru-police-chief/article30543894.ece
118,2020/01/11,BJP MLA criticises Kumaraswamy,"Taking a dig at former Chief Minister H.D. Kumarswamy on releasing CDs of the recent Mangaluru violence over the CAA issue, BJP MLA Narasimha Naik (Raju Gowda) from Surpur said that “He (Mr. Kumarswamy) was a film producer before entering politics and he knows how to edit videos.” He was talking with reporters in Yadgir on Friday evening.

Mr. Naik, who was then associated with Mr. Kumara swamy and contested on a JD(S) ticket in the 2013 general elections and after defeat joined the BJP, said Mr. Kumaraswamy should refrain from “cheap politics” and work to protect the interests of the people instead of releasing “edited videos.”

Asking Mr. Kumaraswamy why he delayed releasing videos, the MLA said that the former Chief Minister could have released them immediately after the police had done so to prove his claims.

“I would suggest that he visit flood-hit areas and stay there for the night to bring problems to the notice of the government and find out solutions,” Mr. Naik said.

Asked about the JNU violence and Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone’ s visit to JNU, he said that “Police provided evidence on the violence and some actors acted as per someone’s direction, not on their own. We can only watch Deepika in movies. There is nothing to comment about her.”

To another question, he said he will not put pressure on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to induct him into the Cabinet. “Every MLA will have an ambition to become a Minister, including me.

Vidyarthi Vigyan Manthan (VVM) is a national-level talent search exam, organised by Vigyan Prasar, Vijnana Bharati and NCERT to popularise science and identify and nurture talented students from across the country.

According to the organisers, 1,17,484 students from across the country participated at the school and district level exams and 4,383 students from Karnataka gave the district-level exams in November 2019.

121,2020/01/11,Control of vector-borne diseases: Health workers begin survey,"Health workers have taken up an elaborate survey in every household in Mysuru district to test whether the community was conscious about methods to control vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya and identify one village primary health centre (PHC) each to award a Certificate of Recognition for meeting all parameters.

ASHAs (community health workers) and health assistants have taken up this task on the Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) model, distributing questionnaires of 14 questions in homes to check family members’ knowledge of diseases and preventive measures.

This survey was launched in December last and the Department of Health and Family Welfare hopes to cover households in Mysuru district in the next couple of months.

“We used to educate the community on these diseases. Now we are checking their comprehension on the same with questions, besides assessing the hygiene around the dwelling and in the village as well. This gives us an understanding of how alert the people are since the community is key to maintaining health standards,” said Chidambar, District Vector Borne Diseases Control Officer.

He told The Hindu that the health workers were meeting community members and handing out questionnaires. They assist the people in filling up the questionnaires, if they are not educated. “We get to know where they stand in terms of awareness on these issues. This will help us plan our programmes and activities.”

The ‘best’ villages will be recognised and certificates will be awarded to the PHC under whose limit the said village is located. This recognition will perhaps drive them to function better and the work closely with the community. “We do not give any ranking or position. The department will recognise the villages’ efforts since their responsiveness to the issue needs to be acknowledged,” he replied.

“If we don’t see places where there is no scope for mosquito breeding, we learn that people are conscious and keeping diseases away. Our idea is to engage and involve the community in an effective manner,” he added.

Since the beginning of this year, one dengue positive case has been reported in the district.

122,2020/01/11,‘Free Kashmir’ placard was about Internet shutdown: protester,"A day after the police booked a case of sedition against the organisers of the protest against the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), on Manasagangothri campus here, the focus turned to a woman protester who was reportedly holding a “Free Kashmir” placard at the demonstration.

The protester, identified as Nalini B., an alumna of the University of Mysore’s Department of Studies in Mass Communication and Journalism, reportedly claimed she was holding the placard during the demonstration on January 8. “Through the placard, I was trying to bring notice to the Internet shutdown imposed in the Valley,” said a statement attributed to her.

“From August 5, 2019, about 156 days since the abrogation of Article 370, there has been an Internet blockade which has resulted in the silencing of Kashmir. We haven’t heard from them for five months and two days. I wanted to remember and remind everyone that coming out to the streets to protest against the unconstitutional CAA, NRC, NPR is a privilege we have. We have been able to amplify our voices against it, while the Valley has been in darkness unable to voice out their dissent. This is all I meant by ‘Free Kashmir’. Nothing more, nothing less. None of the student bodies of the University of Mysore is responsible for the placard,” the woman’s statement reads.

Meanwhile, the University of Mysore Research Students’ Association and Dalita Vidyarthi Okkoota Sandesh, organisers of the protest, said in a statement, “We cannot be held responsible for an act committed by somebody we do not know.” The jurisdictional Jayalakshmipuram police said they were on the lookout for the woman. “We sent police personnel to her house, but did not find her there,” said an officer.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/free-kashmir-placard-was-about-internet-shutdown-protester/article30541421.ece

Some of them urged the Union Ministers to pressure the Union government to notify the decision of the Mahadayi tribunal that allotted water to Karnataka last year.

Due to the delay in this, the State government had been unable to start work on it, they said in a joint statement. They condemned the Maharashtra government for supporting the demand to merge Belagavi with Maharashtra.

Their other demands include shifting of important offices to Suvarna Soudha, immediate appointment of president of border protection commission, among others.

127,2020/01/11,Reservation is not just legal right but also human right: Das,"“A mere increase in the quantum of reservation serves no purpose unless it is properly implemented,” Nagamohan Das, former judge of Karnataka High Court and chairman of a commission to review the quantum of reservation to SCs and STs, said here on Friday.

“Reservation is not just a legal right, but a basic human right. It should not just be on paper, but should be properly utilised,” he said at a meeting to receive petitions about increasing the quantum of reservation for SCs and ST s in the State.

“What is the use of reservation if jobs are vacant and there is no effort to fill them? How can reservation be properly implemented if the government keeps withdrawing capital from public undertakings?” “There is some sort of opposition to the concept of reservation among some people. We need to address such issues and make sure that people understand the ideas behind such measures of affirmative action,” he said. “Organisations should take up this task of spreading awareness about reservation,” he said.

He pointed out that there were around 4,635 caste groups in India. “There are deep-rooted differences between communities about the social, economic, political and cultural opportunities they get. Some enjoy a disproportionate amount of privileges while others are deprived. Reservation is one of the modern-day tools to rectify such differences and build an equal society,” he said. They have had a significant positive impact on Indian society in the last 70 years, he said.

130,2020/01/11,Day of protests in Mysuru,"It was a day of protests in Mysuru on Friday with civil society groups and stakeholders’ associations demonstrating for demands that ranged from increased pension to amelioration of the conditions of primitive forest-dwelling tribals.

The Coordination of Bank Pensioners’ and Retirees’ Organisations demanded periodical enhancement of their pensions and cited a Supreme Court ruling in this regard. It said the SC has categorically held in its judgements that periodical wage revision invariably entails periodic updating of pension.

The retired employees said all bank pensioners — including SBI pensioners — were entitled to pension updation as given to RBI pensioners. “Despite there being a pre-existing provision in Banks Pension Regulation, its implementation to update our pension has been arbitrarily denied,” said the ex-employees.

The Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) drew attention to the plight of primitive tribal communities living on the forest fringes. The activists said the tribal communities have been denied their monthly quota of foodgrain under the PDS for the last four months owing to delay in tendering process. The SUCI said this has affected the tribal community as they are also without work in Kodagu or Kerala owing to two consecutive years of floods in those regions. They urged the authorities to restore the distribution of foodgrain to the tribals through PDS immediately.

The Karnataka Dalit Welfare Trust staged a demonstration in front of the DC’s office alleging an increase in atrocities against the community besides insults to the Constitution. They demanded the resignation of all Dalit elected representatives from their respective posts as a mark of protest and to bring pressure on the government to take measures to stop the alleged atrocities. The accused the representatives of failing to raise their voice against policies like CAA, NRC, etc., that went against the Constitution.

Similarly, a group of site aspirants who had invested hard-earned money in a private housing society, staged a demonstration against the delay in allotment of sites. The aspirants alleged that the society management had collected nearly ₹80 crore from them and had cheated all of them by failing to allot a single site.

132,2020/01/11,Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu to formally inaugurate HD-BRTS,"Vice President of India Venkaiah Naidu will visit Hubballi on February 2 to formally inaugurate the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), which is already ferrying close to one lakh passengers between the twin cities in its trial run.

Addressing presspersons here along with the former Minister Basavaraj Horatti, Chief Minister’s Legal Advisor Mohan Limbikai, MLA Prasad Abbayya and others, Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar said that the Vice-President had given a time slot of one hour between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on February 2 and accordingly, the programme would be organised.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi and others would participate in the inaugural function. The HD-BRTS has already won the national award for being the best among all the BRTS projects in the country, he said.

Incidentally, the ₹ 970.87-crore World Bank-funded project was sanctioned during Mr. Jagadish Shettar’s tenure as Chief Minister in 2012.

While the World Bank released 33 % of the project cost, i.e., ₹ 324.32 crore, the remaining was funded by the State government through budgetary allocation. Amid various complaints and a few remedial measures, HD-BRTS has been on trial run for the last one year.

Mr. Shettar said that apart from the 100 air-conditioned Chigari buses that were running on BRTS, an additional 55 electric buses have been purchased by HD-BRTS company at a cost of ₹ 44 crore. The manufacturing company would be delivering the vehicles shortly.

Replying to queries, the Minister admitted that there were still several issues pertaining to HD-BRTS and steps were being taken to address them. He clarified that the complaints regarding the flyover at Navalur were being addressed and an additional work worth ₹ 6.5 crore had been sanctioned in response to the plea by the residents of the locality. This apart, another work worth ₹ 1.30 crore to prevent water-logging near the Dharwad toll naka would be taken up shortly, he said.

Mr. Shettar said that a dedicated police station for the BRTS corridor had been proposed and he would pursue it at the government level. A dedicated police station would help address traffic-related issues pertaining to the bus corridor, he said.

133,2020/01/11,"Exhibitions, artworks and sportsevents attract large crowds","A large number of enthusiasts, particularly young men and women, thronged the exhibition stalls to watch artworks, paintings, sand art and other such items put on display at Hampi in Ballari district on Friday.

The exhibition was part of the two-day Hampi Utsav.

For the first time, Matsya Mela (Fish Festival) was made a part of the utsav. The Ballari Zilla Panchayat and the Directorate of Fisheries jointly organised this festival where 105 varieties of fish were put on display in aquariums.

Apart from locally found fish varieties, the organisers managed to collect those found in Africa, the Amazon, the United States, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and other parts of the globe.

People enthusiastically browsed through the aquariums that contained fish in different colours, shapes and sizes.

The sand art exhibition was another area that was found drawing in more crowds.

Besides the historic monuments at the World Heritage Site such as the Virupaksha Temple, the Ugra Narasimha statue, the Anesalu Mantapa, the Stone Chariot, artists also carved out in sand other monuments, including the Taj Mahal and the Sun Temple of Konark.

“I am feeling delighted that my sand art works are being appreciated by the people. People here are more supportive of artists than in other places, I guess,” Narayan Sahu, an artist from Maharashtra, said.

After inaugurating the exhibition stalls in the morning, Minister of Tourism and Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi termed the erstwhile Vijayanagar Empire as India’s pride.

“Vijayanagar was a great empire not just in terms of wealth but also of the revival of ancient Indian culture. The revival of ancient Indian culture was at its peak during the rule of the Vijayanagar kings. Hampi Utsav is meant to celebrate the glory of that empire. If I continue to be Minister for Kannada and Culture, I would include Hampi Utsav in the department’s calendar of events so that it could be held on specific dates every year without any ambiguity. This will help increase the government’s obligation in the organisation of the utsav and making budgetary allocation,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7h6xu0/article30538262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGHAMPIUTSAV1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/exhibitions-artworks-and-sportsevents-attract-large-crowds/article30538266.ece
134,2020/01/11,It’s not that queer,"Imagine meeting a doctor for a tummy ache, and instead finding yourself at the receiving end of “conversion therapy”! If you are a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, this could be a reality, and seeking professional help for your health can be an uphill task.

“The challenge begins with opening up to a doctor or counsellor — you aren’t sure if the person is homophobic, neutral or accepting”, says Dr. Prasad Raj Dandekar, a radiation oncologist and founder of Health Professionals for Queer Indians (HPQI). While judgemental professionals, who are dismissive of the patient or who hurl accusations of “sinning” are obvious red flags, Dr. Dandekar emphasises that, “You need someone who is not just compassionate, but working with you, for you”. Professionals have to understand the nuanced needs of the community, and HPQI aims to educate them on this.

Challenges aplenty

An upcoming conference by HPQI, in February, focusses on mental health issues faced by the community, and with good reason. “The queer community is one of the more marginalised within the field of mental health itself,” says Rajvi Mariwala, Director at the Mariwala Health Initiative (MHI), which funds mental health initiatives, especially those that grant access to help for marginalised persons and communities. She points to how, for a long time, homosexuality was declared a perversion and gender beyond the binary (i.e., of masculine and feminine) was pathologised. Members of the community still experience feelings of isolation and invisibility, and a fearfulness to trust those we would consider “traditional” caregivers (parents, teachers, and so on.).

Living with an identity that’s stigmatised across the board — in learning curriculum, law and in society itself — is bound to take a toll on one’s mental health. The challenge is to find a practitioner who understands this context.

Recognising this, MHI collaborated with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) to offer a course on Queer Affirmative Counselling Practice (QACP). This aims to equip mental health practitioners, or MHPs, with a better perspective on the community, the unique life stressors that its members face, and modified approaches to traditional mental health practices.

“Unless the therapist questions his/her own idea of what constitutes “normal” and “abnormal”, the “root” of a mental health problem will be traced to the individual’s inability to cope, without looking at the monumental challenges that the individual has to cope with,” says Pooja Nair, independent MHP and a faculty member in the QACP course. She emphasises the importance of listening to and learning from queer voices. In fact, the QACP course has been designed by people who are queer and MHPs themselves.

Reaching out

Over the decades, a lot of the heavy lifting for mental health has been done — largely unfunded — by queer collectives: members of the community, reaching out to provide emotional support to their peers through difficult times, even meeting with family members. Mariwala recommends that those seeking therapy also ask their counsellor for referrals to peer support groups, so that they have other queer people to reach out to.

There is still a long way to go to enhance the quality of care to the community. “What needs to be done is changing people’s mindset,” says Dr. Dandekar. He advocates doing this early. For instance, by training medical college students, “You develop inclusive doctors who are open to learning.” Similarly, Nair views educating students — both aspiring MHPs and others — as essential. “We need to push for the institutionalising of material that comes from the margins. The textbooks do not reflect the reality.”

Says Dr. Dandekar, “I change the mindset of doctors, but in each walk of life we need to do that. Don’t wait for the activists and others to do something about it.”

136,2020/01/11,Intelligence at play,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors across the world, and how! However, the surprise element is its ability to bring about a volley of changes even in a dynamic sector like sports. Its innovative application in the sports and gaming industry has steered the way forward for online platforms, like Roanuz Sports, India’s pioneering AI-driven fantasy sports platform.

Roanuz Softwares is a sports intelligence and technology company that makes applications and services using artificial intelligence. Its subsidiary, Roanuz Sports, offers application program interface (API), giving users access to quality sports data — at affordable cost with no long-term contract — that can be integrated into their own web platforms.

Anto Kaspar, Founder and CEO of Roanuz, tells us more about this application and how students can benefit from it.

Opportunity

“This platform has created a great opportunity for students to build a cricket, football, kabaddi fantasy app or live sports score website or blog by themselves with the support of our sports data. Once live, they can then sell to consumers and monetise their app or platform. During a live cricket/ football/ kabaddi match, students can approach cafes, e-commerce websites or any platforms that like to show live scores to their consumers, and pitch their fantasy app or sports website. By building such products, students can learn about sports data and the impact of AI in the sports industry and eventually build their career.

Support

“All they need is minimal knowledge of coding and the Roanuz team will support them with the rest. During the training, which is free, the Roanuz team will support the students until they complete the app and provide data during the live matches.

Variety

“Though cricket has been a dominant force in the sports industry, other sports are also getting enough attention these days with the emergence of Indian Super League (ISL) for football, Kabbadi League, Hockey Indian League (HIL), Premier Badminton League (PBL), Pro Volleyball League, and so on. As of now, we have our API in the following sports — cricket, football and kabbadi and will guide students in those areas.”

139,2020/01/11,Pore over the document,"What is the difference between ‘pour’ and ‘pore’? (Vinay Kohli, New Delhi)

Both words are pronounced the same way — they rhyme with ‘four’, ‘door’ and ‘bore’. The word ‘pour’ is mostly used as a verb to mean ‘to flow in a steady stream’. The word can be used with both animate and inanimate objects. For example, when we are in a restaurant, every now and then, the waiter comes and pours water into our glass. Whenever there is an agitation of sorts, newspapers report that people ‘poured’ into the streets. The use of the word suggests that people entered in large numbers in a steady stream. We also hear about ‘letters pouring in’ and ‘money pouring in’. The word ‘pore’, on the hand, can be used as a noun and a verb. A ‘pore’ is a tiny opening that allows things — liquid, gas, and so on — to go through. For example, sweat comes out through the pores in our body. The expression ‘pore over’ is frequently used in everyday contexts to mean ‘to focus intently’. When you pore over a document or a textbook, you go through it carefully. You are focussed on what you are reading.

When do we use ‘Yours sincerely’ and ‘Yours faithfully’ in letters? (S Radha, Chennai)

Do people actually write letters, nowadays? Both are used in formal letters and not intimate ones. If you mistakenly use either with your significant other (husband, wife, boyfriend, and so on), you have some serious explaining to do. It is unlikely to go down well with the person. The expression ‘Yours faithfully’ is mostly used when you are writing to someone whose name you do not know. Such letters usually begin with ‘Dear Sir/Madam’. The closing ‘Yours sincerely’, on the other hand, is mostly used in formal contexts when you know the name of the person you are writing to — Dear Dr. Rao or Dear Mrs. Raman. Books on usage suggest that Americans prefer to use ‘Yours truly’ instead of ‘Yours faithfully’, and ‘Sincerely yours’ rather than ‘Yours sincerely’.

What is the meaning of ‘run someone off her feet’? (Naresh Kumar, Tiruchi)

When you tell someone that she/he is going to be ‘run/rushed off her/his feet’, what you are suggesting is that she/he is going to be kept extremely busy for some time. She/he is going to have a series of jobs to do, one after the other, and will have little or no time to rest. She/he is going to be on her/his feet all the time.

It is your sister’s wedding. You can bet you are going to be rushed off your feet.

With both kids falling ill, poor Vrinda was run off her feet.

140,2020/01/11,"History, Hebrew and the future","Gone are the days when a handful of countries were considered to be desirable study locations for higher education. Now, there are no geographical limits as students are considering countries other than first-world countries. Countries, too, are putting in efforts to make themselves student-friendly. One such upcoming study destination is Israel.

It is globally known as ‘The Start-Up Nation’ and ‘the Land of Innovation’. One of the main reasons for it is Israel’s advanced higher education system, highly regarded worldwide, with institutes rated among the top 200 universities today.

“All these universities are armed with the best teaching staff and resources which can help shape the future of their students. For foreign students, Israeli universities, and other higher education institutions offer a wide range of programmes and facilities, in even niche research areas, at a much more affordable cost, relative to equivalent institutions across the globe,” says Yaakov Finkelstein, Consul General of Israel.

With 1.4% of its current student population being international, Israel is slowly gaining consideration amongst Indian students who are looking at quality higher education and research.

Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) is one of the leading institutes in Israel that has been attracting young India researchers. Located in Rehovot, and spread over 200 acres of land, this institute is one of the world’s top-ranking multidisciplinary research institutions. It was founded in 1941 by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel, has around 1,000 grants sponsoring the WIS’s research activity. At any given moment, approximately 1,200 research projects are carried out by its students and faculty who hail from different parts of the world.

WIS comprises almost 18 departments organised into five faculties: Mathematics and Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biology. In addition to this, there is the Feinberg Graduate School and the Davidson Institute of Science Education. Among its faculty are one Nobel Prize, seven Wolf Prize, three Turing Award, two Japan Prize and 33 Israel Prize winners.

To assure top-class quality graduates and to make sure that they leave the campus fully equipped with the best theoretical and practical knowledge of their field, the institute provides the best of equipment to its researchers.

Admission

The admission process for the WIS is straightforward. The institute offers master’s, doctorate and post-doctorate programmes in science, and the selection process is based on the practical and theoretical knowledge that the applicant possesses (which is tested by the respective faculty members), rather than a conventional merit-based system.

In order to be a part of the programmes, interested candidates need to draft a pitch of their work and contact the respective faculty. Following this, a video/voice interview along with an academic background check is conducted by the faculty. The selected candidates are automatically awarded a full scholarship.

Diversity

In order to attract international students and maintain diversity in the campus, the Institute’s official language is English. This not only helps the international students feel comfortable, but also helps the researchers and the Institute maintain a global image. Interestingly, WIS is one of the few institutes that has the highest number of Indian students, followed by Chinese and German students.

The few selected courses which are locally-based are taught in Hebrew but are translated aptly and simultaneously in English for non-Hebrew speakers.

The campus also comes together to celebrate festivals from different parts of the world. Be it Holi or Deepavali, the Indian community, with the help of the International Office (IO), hosts celebratory cultural evenings that are open to all.

The IO also helps the new-arrivals with sorting out their bank and accommodation processes to make the shift to a new country smooth. It also arranges Hebrew lessons for interested students which helps them in reading, writing and speaking basic Hebrew, making their stay easier.

Considering that many PhD and post-doctoral students come with their partners, the IO also extends support to their families, providing them a friendly lounge to meet and greet people from similar cultural backgrounds, and even supporting them during maternity periods for expectant mothers.

141,2020/01/11,A slice of freedom,"I distinctly remember my orientation day, Mr. Cody, the International Advisor said, “America is all about independence and choice”. As I enter the last semester of my Master of Electrical Engineering thesis programme, with a specialisation in power systems at Washington State University (WSU), I realise how much the statement has resonated with me and stayed on, over the course of the last 18 months.

Located in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. and set in a small town called Pullman, WSU offered me a wonderful opportunity to experience the American slice of life. The city is sparsely populated with just about 30,000 people.

Far away from the hustle and bustle, there are times in summer on campus when you are the only person in the building. Additionally, since the Indian student population is in the order of few hundreds, it provided me with a truly international experience. I have also tried cuisines from different countries including the Middle East, China, Taiwan and Europe, and have developed a sweet tooth, especially for doughnuts.

Independence and self-reliance

One major difference I perceived in the academic life in the U.S. is that a student is expected to be independent and responsible for their own course work and performance. Research experiences also vary depending on the faculty background and seniority. The courses are outcome-based and in some of them, there is a flexibility of deciding end-goals as well. In general, the programme involves a lot of self-reading and is quite intensive.

Following my sterling academic performance in the first semester, I was advised by my faculty to switch to thesis, though research had not been on my radar during the application process. As a thesis student, I got the opportunity to be a part of the department’s research work and also received a full tuition waiver and a generous monthly stipend.

Intensive

The power systems courses that I am pursuing involve actual case studies including those which the professors have worked on, guest lectures from industry experts, use of actual industrial software and discussion of recent events within the domain. The programme also sponsored my travel and stay expenses for IEEE Power and Energy general meeting and other power-related conferences.

In addition to the coursework, there are a lot of on-campus resources such as free Professional Development Initiative (PDI) events for communication, leadership skills, a robust career services office, numerous student organisations (close to 300) and recreation centre.

Leading up to my application process, I sought advice from the Education USA centre in Chennai. My adviser’s support and feedback on shortlisting universities, writing the statement of purpose (SOP) and the application process at large, was of great help. The U.S. has made me self-reliant, confident, and provided me with an insight into my academic purpose and career goals.

142,2020/01/11,Curiosity can kill the C A Ts,"India, at present, is ranked 52nd in the Global Innovation Index. Policy-makers would like the country to leapfrog into the top 25 in the next few years. One of the visible signs of the policy initiatives, both in the academia and the industry, is the increased number and scale of innovation contests. Invariably, these contests target the engineering students, guided by an implicit assumption that young minds are better equipped to find creative solutions for the persistent problems faced by the industry and society.

Challenges

While innovation contests are not a bad idea, they have their limitations in producing innovation due to two reasons. First, it is difficult for students to produce radically new and practically feasible solutions without a deep appreciation of the problem’s context. In most cases, the solutions tend to be techno-centric in nature like IoT/Blockchain-enabled farming. Second, students whose ideas are not shortlisted, lose interest in the problems and the contests. As a result, the contests may not be the best tools to seed a culture of innovation.

In order to develop a culture of innovation, it is important to pay attention to the key driver of creativity and innovation — curiosity. In the past couple of years, I have been doing a few exercises with students and experienced professionals to understand the relationship between curiosity, creativity and innovation. One of them involves asking the participants to observe things in their context and document on a piece of paper. To my surprise, I did not notice any difference in the way young minds and experienced professionals responded to the exercise.

For most of the participants, the context was either too familiar or did not exist at all and it did not trigger any curiosity. The few participants who did exhibit some curiosity, did not explore it. This behaviour can be traced to the fear of failure that is cultivated through our education, competitive exams, and risk-reward systems. And we seem to have accepted the phrase “curiosity killed the cat” as an axiom. I think it is time we put the negative connotation of curiosity to rest.

Types

Today, there is an improved understanding of curiosity, its inhibitors and enablers. Research studies indicate that five types of curiosity are relevant for professional work — specific, diversive, social, perceptual and epistemic.

Engineers typically exhibit specific curiosity, i.e., curiosity to engage with specific problems like mathematical equations or puzzles. However, this type of curiosity tends to decline when the problem is either ambiguous or the knowledge gap is high.

Diversive curiosity is an interest to know a variety of things (seeking novelty). However, the interest to know a variety of things related to professional work reduces with increased specialisation. One way to overcome this is by deliberately shifting from one topic to another or taking cross functional roles at different times and integrating the diverse experiences. Diversive curiosity helps deal with ambiguity in problem-solving and boosts creativity.

Social curiosity is the interest to know about other people. Cultivating social curiosity requires a pluralistic, non-judgmental way of engagement. Engineers can learn from anthropologists. Social curiosity can open possibilities for collaboration which can help address knowledge gaps and lead to new meanings.

The fourth type — perceptual curiosity — is very natural to all of us. Anything new in our context easily excites us. However, perceptual curiosity reduces as familiarity increases. We stop observing or seeing everyday routine things. Lack of perceptual curiosity can affect both diversive and social curiosity. Artists and designers know how to cultivate perceptual curiosity. That is the reason why engineers today are being asked to learn from artists and designers.

Finally, there is epistemic curiosity that is critical to developing creative confidence. It is the process of learning to create new knowledge, which can happen only by trying things out or testing the hypothesis, i.e., problem-based learning.

Academic institutions and faculty must do a serious rethink to cultivate curiosity among students. A good starting point is to revisit Anatole France’s observation that “the whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards”. Maybe the character ‘c’ in the word faculty is meant to highlight the central role of curiosity. In other words, what would be a faculty without the ‘c’?

One way to drive home the point is to make curiosity an important parameter in faculty evaluation and recruitment. If institutions take steps in this direction, then at least in 10 years from now, we can create an environment where increased curiosity among engineering students kills the blind pursuit of CAT, GATE and other competitive exams and enhances the creative confidence to pursue innovation and entrepreneurship. Only this can help the country make a giant leap in the Global Innovation Index.

143,2020/01/11,Indeed one of Malayalam’s better thrillers in recent times,"One often tends to associate some filmmakers with a particular kind of films that when they deviate slightly from their preferred route, it comes as a pleasant surprise. The shift taken by Midhun Manuel Thomas with Anjaam Pathira, woven around a serial killer on the loose, is much more drastic compared to the light-hearted, often goofy stuff he has been making till now.

The movie begins with a sequence reminiscent of the recent television series Mind Hunter, in which psychologists working for the FBI interview serial killers to study their thought process, to make use of the knowledge in future cases. Here we have Anwar Hussain (Kunchacko Boban), a consultant psychologist with the police department, interviewing a serial killer, who talks about killing with the only motive of enjoying the ‘ecstasy’ derived from the act. Soon, Hussain is called on to use some of his learnings, as a police officer gets kidnapped and murdered in a peculiarly gruesome manner. But, the killer, right from the beginning, seems to have a motive.

Midhun Manuel, who has also written the script, uses the usual serial killer tropes, like the similar pattern of the killings or the killer leaving behind a sculpture of lady justice without the blindfold at the crime scene. On the surface, it might seem like some other serial killer movies but what stands out here is the treatment given to that material. Amid all the eeriness of the atmosphere created by Sushin’s background score and Shyju Khalid’s night photography, the film retains a realistic feel, which is enough to send chills down your spine.

Well-crafted script

Midhun Manuel seems much more in control here, compared to the comic capers he has helmed in the past. The thickly packed script hardly ever deviates from the pursuit of the serial killer, with Hussain’s helplessness at being unable to track down the killer and hitting one dead end after another, afflicting us too. The slow unravelling of the motives is bound to put the audience in a spot, which is the sign of a well-crafted script.

Unnimaya Prasad, as a tough cop almost wilting under pressure, and Sreenath Bhasi, as a young hacker who is pursuing all leads to take revenge on a better hacker who hurt his ego, puts up good performances. Anjaam Pathira is one of the better thrillers in Malayalam in recent times.

144,2020/01/11,Pinarayi meets Aishe Ghosh in Delhi,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday met Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh and said the whole country was with the students in their protest against the fee increase in the institution and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Vijayan met Ms. Ghosh at Kerala House in New Delhi, expressed solidarity with the protest, and also gifted her the book Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi by Sudhanva Deshpande.

Head injuries

Mr. Ghosh had suffered head injuries during the January 5 attack on JNU students on the campus by a group of masked assailants.

“The whole country is with the JNUSU in their fight for justice. Everyone knows about your protest and what has happened to you in the fight for justice,” Mr. Vijayan told Ms. Ghosh after enquiring about her health and that of other students.

FB post

In a Facebook post, he wrote that the JNU students were fighting an “epic battle” against the Sangh Parivar.

“The Sangh Parivar is hoping to overcome the dissenting voices from the JNU using muscle power. However, the JNU has put up an uncompromising fight against them. Aishe Ghosh has been leading this battle with her injured head,” he said.

Aishe thanks Kerala

Ms. Ghosh, after meeting the Chief Minister, thanked the people of Kerala for standing with the JNU. “Comrade Pinarayi has said ‘go ahead’ and that is the inspiration I take and we will take this fight ahead. Whether it is the fight for rolling back the fee hike or against the CAA, I would like to thank again and again the people of Kerala who stood by us during all these attacks,” Ms. Ghosh told the media.

Ms. Ghosh reached Kerala House after her daily check-up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

145,2020/01/11,Cancer Care Board to be formed in State,"A Cancer Care Board will be instituted to coordinate cancer prevention and treatment in the State, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said.

The decision was taken at a meeting of senior officials at the Minister’s chamber on Saturday.

The Cancer Care Board, which will come into being as part of the Cancer Strategy Action Plan of the State government, will coordinate the cancer care facilities that existed in the three State-run cancer centres, medical colleges, other government hospitals and private hospitals across Kerala. The board would be mandated with evolving a protocol for cancer care, the Minister said.

State-level panel

It would have a State-level committee chaired by the Health Minister and comprising the Principal Secretary of Health, and Directors of the Regional Cancer Centres, Director of Health Services, Director of Medical Education, and globally renowned cancer care experts as its members.

Subcommittees

Subcommittees would also be formed under the State-level committee to oversee various activities including cancer prevention, treatment, and procurement of drugs and medical equipment.

The Cancer Care Coard would also have district-level committees, chaired by the District Medical Officers, Ms. Shylaja said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cancer-care-board-to-be-formed-in-state/article30545920.ece
146,2020/01/11,Governor flays State govt.’s anti-CAA advertisement,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has come out against the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front government’s anti- Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] advertisement on the front page of national dailies and said spending public money for political campaigning is “thoroughly undesirable.”

The State-sponsored advertisement, published on Friday, claimed that “the State is leading the efforts to protect Constitutional values” and its Assembly was the first to pass a unanimous resolution against the controversial CAA.

The Governor, who was in New Delhi, told television channels that spending public money for a political campaign was “thoroughly undesirable.”

“...public money is being used to campaign against a law which has been passed by Parliament. Sounds a bit strange to me..,” he said.

The Governor said it would not have been a problem if the advertisement was given by a political party.

Govt. ads

The Kerala government had published in three national dailies that the State had taken “bold initiatives to address the apprehensions of the public” and had stayed the National Population Register drive that could lead to the NRC (National Register of Citizens).

The State, which also leads in the human development index, is ranked first among the States in poverty eradication, health standards, education, gender equality and realising novel ideas, the advertisement claimed.

The State government had on August 7, 2017 published an advertisement in the national capital that the State had one of the lowest crime rates in the country, to counter a campaign by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh against the CPI(M) in Kerala over political killings.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-flays-state-govts-anti-caa-advertisement/article30545915.ece

150,2020/01/11,Alappuzha bypass gets nod for girders,"The Alappuzha bypass project has cleared one more hurdle. After a long wait, Railways have given its nod for installing girders as part of the construction of a rail overbridge (RoB) at Malikamukku.

The Alappuzha bypass project consists of two RoBs at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy.

The work had come to a halt after a delay in getting permission from Railways to place girders above the railway track.

Permission denied

Earlier, after inspecting the girders brought for the construction of the RoBs, Railways recommended structural changes and denied permission for starting the work.

“As per the direction of the railway authorities, necessary changes have been made in the girders. The authorities later conducted a second inspection of the girders and submitted a report to the Chief Bridge Engineer. Railways have given permission to place five girders at Malikamukku,” a press release from Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran said here on Saturday.

Mr. Sudhakaran said that necessary changes were being made on five girders of the second RoB at Kuthirapanthy.

“Modifications have already been made in three girders. Work on the remaining two girders will be completed without delay. We will provide all five girders to railway authorities for inspection soon,” the Minister said.

Mr. Sudhakaran has also written a letter to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal urging him to initiate steps to conduct the inspection of remaining girders at the earliest.

The Alappuzha bypass project was first mooted four decades ago. However, it had remained on paper until the work got under way on April 10, 2015.

The project, which was set to be completed in September 2017 got delayed on account of various reasons.

The deadline was initially extended to May 28, 2018 and further to August 31, 2018.

RoBs

According to officials 98% of the project has been completed, but the bypass can only be opened to traffic after the completion of two RoBs.

The 6.8-km two-lane bypass road will link Kommady on the north and Kalarcode on the south and pass by the western side of National Highway 66.

The road will have two major junctions at Kommady and Kalarcode.

One of the major features of the bypass is a 3.2-km stretch of elevated highway that pass by the Alappuzha beach.

The project is being implemented at a cost of ₹348.43 crore with equal shares borne by the Union and the State governments.

Once completed, the bypass is expected to bring relief to the Alappuzha town from the traffic bottlenecks.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alappuzha-bypass-gets-nod-for-girders/article30545875.ece
151,2020/01/11,Dileep moves SC for stay on trial,"Malayalam actor Dileep has moved the Supreme Court urgently for a stay of the trial in a case of abduction and molestation of a female actor in which he is one of the accused.

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar on Friday (January 10), senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi made an oral mention that the authenticity of a memory card containing certain visuals allegedly of the attack on the victim was being examined by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).

Lab examination

The trial court should wait till the laboratory finished its examination and submitted a report, Mr. Rohatgi said. He said his client's defence in the case would otherwise be impaired. This would amount to a transgression of the apex court's judgment protecting Dileep's right to a fair trial.

The Bench agreed to hear the plea next week.

It was the Supreme Court, in a judgment in November, which allowed Dileep to either personally inspect in court the contents of the memory card or seek a second opinion about its genuineness and credibility from an independent agency such as the CFSL. The court had upheld the actor's argument that the card should be considered as a 'document' under the Evidence Act.

The plea in the apex court comes a few days after charges were framed against him and nine other accused for the incident which occurred in 2017.

The trial court had dismissed a plea filed by Dileep to exclude him from the list of accused on the ground that there was prima facie evidence against the actor, who is eighth accused in the case.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dileep-moves-sc-for-stay-on-trial/article30545870.ece
152,2020/01/11,3 towers turn to dust at Maradu,"Sending a strong signal against the mushrooming of illegal constructions along the coastline of Kerala, apartment complexes H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene were razed to the ground on Saturday.

It was following a Supreme Court directive that the buildings constructed on the banks of Vembanad Lake, a Ramsar site, in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules were pulled down. Two more apartments Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram, which were also found illegally constructed, will be demolished on Sunday.

The demolition of two towers of Alfa Serene and H2O went on as planned. All the nearby structures, including homes, offices and Kundannoor overbridge, remained intact despite the powerful explosions.

Of the three that were pulled down, H2O Holy Faith was the first one to be blasted. The controlled implosion at the apartment complex was triggered at 11.18 a.m. Though the explosives were scheduled to go off at 11 a.m., it was delayed by 18 minutes as a helicopter of the Indian Navy did a sortie near the building. The blast was delayed on safety grounds as the aircraft flew past the buildings minutes before the blast, said officials of Edifice Engineering, which undertook the demolition job. While the controlled implosion at H2O appeared to be a sophisticated affair, the blasts that took place at Alfa Serene rattled the area with its loud noise and strong vibration.

153,2020/01/11,Decision to revise electoral rolls irks IUML,"The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has approached the Kerala High Court and the Election Commission against the revision of electoral rolls of 2015 for the forthcoming three- tier local body polls.

The party leadership demanded that the decision to revise the electoral rolls ahead of the local body polls was "" inappropriate"" and fraught with ""practical problems."" The electoral rolls which had already been revised before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls should be the criteria for the approaching local body polls this year as well.

The development comes as the State Election Commission has issued orders for the inclusion of new voters in the fresh list.

On behalf of the party, the IUML Nadapuram Assembly mandalam president Sooppy Narikkatteri and Feroke municipality standing committee chairman and mandalam vice president P. Hashif filed a writ petition in the High Court and registered a complaint with the Election Commission.

They said that about 200-300 persons were added to the voters’ list in each ward before the 2015 local body polls. Then again more voters were added when the electoral rolls were revised before the 2016 Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

If the electoral rolls of 2015 were made applicable, then many voters would be unable to exercise their franchise for the 2020 polls. To include more people on the voters’ list was also unworkable, they said.

Besides, the IUML leaders said that the criteria for the 2015 local body polls was the electoral rolls that had been revised ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. It was not the voters list employed during the 2010 local body polls. The same principle should be adopted this time also, they said.

They pointed out that Section 83 of Kerala Municipality Act of 1994 stipulated that the State Election Commission, if it deemed necessary, prepare the electoral rolls of the municipality by adopting the existing electoral rolls of the legislative Assembly constituency without conducting an enumeration. Now the proposal to conduct the polls based on the earlier electoral rolls would only complicate matters and deprive the eligible voters the right to exercise their franchise, they said.

About 90% of the voters in the electoral list of 2019 will be included when fresh electoral rolls are prepared. Such an exercise will also be cumbersome.

In fact, majority of the voters in the belief that they are already enrolled in the voters’ list would show reluctance to add their names further in the new electoral rolls. Moreover, they also said the process of revision would make the officials and common man go through hardship, the IUML leaders said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/decision-to-revise-electoral-rolls-irks-iuml/article30544126.ece
154,2020/01/11,"Holy Faith H2O, Alfa Serene razed","Sending a strong signal against the illegal constructions that mushroomed along the coastline of Kerala, two apartment complexes — H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene — were razed on Saturday.

The demolition of the two towers of Alfa Serene and H2O was uneventful and progressed as planned.

The structures located near the apartment complexes, including the houses and the Kundannoor bridge remained intact.

H2O Holy Faith was the first one to be brought down by controlled implosion at 11.18 a.m. Though the explosives were scheduled to go off at 11 a.m., it was delayed for 18 minutes as a helicopter of the Indian Navy did a sortie near the building.

The blast was delayed for a few minutes on safety grounds as the aircraft flew past the buildings minutes before the scheduled blast, said officials of the Edifice Engineering, which undertook the demolition job.

It was the tough stand adopted by a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra against the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations that culminated in the demolition of these apartment complexes. The court had found that the apartment complexes came up in violation of the rules.

The demolition of the apartments was the first such event of this magnitude in the State where thousands of instances of CRZ violations have been reported.

Two more apartments, Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram, will be demolished on Sunday.

Controlled implosion

While the controlled implosion at H2O appeared to be a sophisticated affair with sounds of explosives muffled, the blasts that took place at Alfa Serene rattled the area with its powerful sound and vibration. Splinters could be seen flying into the nearby water body at alarming speed. Some debris had also fell into the nearby water body.

The explosions rattled the nearby areas and the shock was felt even at buildings located at least 500 metres away from the demolished site.

The concrete structures that came down were quickly cloaked by dust that emanated from the scene. It took around ten minutes for the clouds to dissipate at the place where Alfa Serene stood tall a few seconds ago. The visibility in the area was also reduced significantly for some time as the dust settled. The palm fronts of coconut trees in the vicinity turned grey as the dust settled on them.

155,2020/01/11,Lumpy skin disease reported in 3 districts of Kerala,"The Animal Husbandry Department has warned dairy farmers to be on guard against the lumpy skin disease that affects cattle. It has been reported in three districts.

The disease, caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, is spread through mosquitoes, flies and ticks.

“The disease has been reported in cattle in Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram. But there is no cause for panic. Steps have been taken to contain its spread,” Animal Husbandry Director M.K. Prasad said.

The disease does not affect humans or other animals. Symptoms in cattle include fever lasting for three days, swelling in the limbs, and enlarged superficial lymph nodes. It can result in low milk production and infertility.

While the animals may recover in about three weeks, the reduction in milk yield can last for an extended period.

However, the mortality rates are low and so is the possibility of the spread of disease, the department said.

The department came out with the warning after the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, which tested samples, confirmed the disease.

As part of the preventive measures, the department has asked farmers to temporarily avoid the purchase of new animals.

Cattle exhibiting the symptoms should be quarantined and cattle sheds should be kept clean, it said.

The department has alerted animal disease investigation agencies, laboratories and clinics across the State. Special teams have been formed for collection and testing of samples.

The State Institute for Animal Diseases, Palode, the State-level referral lab of the department, is equipped for disease diagnosis, the department said.

Farmers can also contact the 24-hour helpline of the Animal Disease Control Project on 0471 2732151 for clearing their doubts regarding the disease.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uhdjyh/article30541343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-LSD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lumpy-skin-disease-reported-in-3-districts/article30541350.ece
156,2020/01/11,Wishes galore for Carnatic vocalist Yesudas,"Carnatic vocalist and playback singer K.J. Yesudas, who has enthralled music aficionados across the world with his profound and mellifluous voice for the last six decades, turned 80 on Friday.

Yesudas visited the Mookambika temple at Kollur in Udupi district of Karnataka on Friday along with his family, a practice he has been following for the last four decades. Draped in the traditional Kerala style kasavu mundu and shawl, ‘Dasettan’, as he is known among his hardcore fans cutting across ages, Yesudas offered prayers along with wife Prabha and sons and performed special pujas at the Goddess Saraswathi temple. Hundreds of music buffs gathered at the shrine to wish the octogenarian singer.

Regional newspapers came out with special pages and television channels with exclusive programmes as a tribute to the singer, who has recorded over 80,000 songs in various genres in almost all languages of India, including about 25,000 film songs, Carnatic bhajans and devotional songs.

Arabic, Latin, Russian

157,2020/01/11,RSS harping on religion-based India: Pinarayi Vijayan,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was implementing its agenda of a religion-based nation by continuously rejecting the secular credentials enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

“They (RSS) have never accepted the Constitution. The Sangh Parivar wants India to be a religion-based country. The latest incidents, including the Citizenship (Amendment) Act were part of the agenda promoted by the RSS to portray minorities as enemies of the nation,” Mr Vijayan said at the inaugural address at a Constitution Protection Meet held at Marine Drive here on Friday.

Blaming the RSS for not being part of the nation’s freedom movement, the Chief Minister said the Sangh had no idea about independence. “They had always opposed democracy while supporting the British colonial rule,” he said.

Recalling that RSS ideologue Golwalkar drew inspiration from Hitler’s Germany, Mr. Vijayan said the RSS was the only organisation that stated that the Nazi model can be emulated in India.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre has been trying to implement this RSS agenda since it came to power through various anti-people policies, including the abrogation of the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir. However, they never expected that thousands will rise up against the CAA and protest on the streets,” he said.

Stating that Kerala has set a model for the rest of the country by coming united against the CAA, Mr. Vijayan said only joint struggles cutting across party lines would have the power to defeat the divisive agenda of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vxx0nd/article30541278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TVTVCONSTITUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rss-harping-on-religion-based-india-cm/article30541279.ece

Hundreds of Congress activists, led by district president Satheesan Pacheni, took part in the agitation.

The Congress workers, who started the march from Kannur stadium corner, reached Payyambalam through Muneeswaran temple. Mr. Pacheni said that the Congress would never accept laws introduced by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah to destroy the plurality of the country. The fight against the laws that undermine the rights of minorities would be an extended one, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/g0evzr/article30538950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/payyambalam-beach,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/congress-throws-caa-papers-into-sea/article30538951.ece
159,2020/01/11,"RARS will be developed as centre of excellence, says Minister","Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has said that the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) under the Kerala Agricultural University at Ambalavayal will be developed as a centre of excellence in floriculture.

Speaking after inaugurating a State-level meet of floriculture farmers at “Poopoli”, a 12-day international flower show and agri fest organised jointly by the Kerala Agricultural University and the Department of Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare, at Ambalavayal in the district on Friday, Mr. Sunil Kumar said RARS would be developed as a centre of excellence in floriculture with the assistance of the Netherlands government.

“A farmer producer company will be launched in floriculture sector soon,” Mr. Sunil Kumar said, adding that 100 clusters of farmers, including 40 clusters in Wayanad and 60 clusters in Malappuram district, would be constituted as a part of it.

The Government would execute two agriculture-related projects including “Pushpa Gramam” and soil and water conservation projects worth ₹40 crore in the district this year, the Minister said.

160,2020/01/11,Fishers’ fight for livelihood ends on a happy note,"The family of Sailan A.K. was among several fishers who made a living by fishing with stake nets close to Nediyathuruthu island in Vembanad Lake till 2007. In 2007, the 11.5-acre island was bought by Kapico Kerala Resorts Private Limited. It soon started constructing villas there.

The project, however, changed the life of fisher families in the area after 13 licensed stake nets were removed for the construction of the resort.

“We used to fish using stake nets near Nediyathuruthu island before the construction of the resort. For several decades, it was our main source of income. We lost our livelihood after the nets were dislodged. We are delighted our fight against the illegal resort ended on a happy note,” says Mr. Sailan.

After the families lost their livelihood, K.R. Ratheesh, a relative of Sailan, moved the Cherthala munsif court in 2008, demanding that the villas constructed in violation of the Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) Act on the island be demolished.

The petition also sought damages and restoration of nets. However, the court dismissed the petition.

After the Cherthala sub-court issued a stop-memo to Kapico in 2010, the legal battle soon reached the Kerala High Court.

In the meantime, the Kerala Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi and others impleaded in the case. The rest is history.

First, the High Court ordered the demolition in 2013. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court verdict.

Historical verdict

The apex court verdict is seen as a major victory for the fishing community and a strong message against constructing structures violating the CRZ and other norms. Charles George, president, Kerala Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi (TUCI), termed the Supreme Court order a historical verdict. “It was a case of justice delayed but not denied. Kapico constructed the resort blatantly violating existing rules. It filled paddy fields and the lake for the construction of villas and other structures. They had colluded with bureaucracy and politicians to materialise the project,” Mr. George said.

Order welcomed

Panavally grama panchayat authorities have welcomed the order.

“We welcome the apex court order. Illegal constructions should go. But, we do not have the finance and expertise to demolish the resort. A decision on how to go ahead and implement the order will be taken after discussing the matter with the authorities concerned,” said Pradeep Koodaikkal, president, Panavally grama panchayat.

Officials with the Alappuzha district administration said that they would initiate further action after receiving the apex court order.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fxefiy/article30541362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17konav-1-AshtaGJ26F3CQD3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fishers-fight-for-livelihood-ends-on-a-happy-note/article30538176.ece
161,2020/01/11,From ‘Mrs. America’ to ‘High Fidelity’: 10 television shows to look forward to in 2020,"We have been living in the golden age of television for so long now that it feels like a reiteration to say so, but still 2020 comes our way with a dazzling array of riches that it’s hard not to feel overwhelmed. Last year brought about the end of some long-running TV staples such as Game of Thrones (The House of Dragon spin-off is in the works they say, but let’s wait and see), The Big Bang Theory, Fleabag and Transparent to mention some. But fear not, as the new year is packed with new offerings as well as old favourites returning in style: some for final hurrahs and others looking to knock the pretenders off their rightful perch.

With Apple TV+ and Disney+ also in the fray now (HBO Max and NBC’s Peacock are incoming soon), 2020 is only going to get more crowded — and confusing — for viewers struggling to keep up with the Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar offerings already available in the first place, not to mention casting an envious eye on Hulu shows overseas.

Picking 10 must-watch shows might not be a comprehensive enough guide to get through 2020, but atleast it gives you an insight into what to definitely not miss and renew/ sign up for subscriptions. Here’s a handy guide:

1) The Falcon and The Winter Soldier (Disney+)

Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie in ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’

Easily the most anticipated super-hero show ever to grace television, thanks to the spectacular success of the Avengers movies that shot both these relatively in-the-background characters (and actors) to worldwide fame. MCU mainstays Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) will return in this inaugural Marvel series for Disney+, and if their bromance in the earlier movies is anything to go by, fans will have a lot to cheer for. Not to mention, this could be the long-awaited transition for The Falcon to become the next Captain America.

Nothing much is known about the series as of now, but a Captain America: Civil War re-watch should get you excited enough, along with YouTube videos of Mackie and Stan’s cameraderie. What’s not to love?

2) High Fidelity (Hulu)

Zoë Kravitz in the ‘High Fidelity’ TV series

This alternative take on the hit 2000 John Cusack comedy (which in itself was based on the popular Nick Hornby book) stars Zoë Kravitz as a record shop owner, who narrates her past/ present romantic relationships, and the failures and lessons she has learnt from them. Kravitz, who was excellent in HBO’s Big Little Lies, looks to be a perfect choice to play the music snob who ranks the men she’s been with just like her favourite albums, with a background of modern-day pop culture, musical references and a killer soundtrack to boot.

Releasing on Valentine’s Day, the gender-flipped reboot also stars the brilliant Da'Vine Joy Randolph (who reprises Jack Black’s role from the original movie) and Jake Lacy from the final season of The Office.

3) Better Call Saul (AMC/ Netflix)

Bob Odenkirk returns as Saul Goodman in ‘Better Call Saul’

What more can be written to rave about this Breaking Bad spin-off which nobody thought would work, but miraculously also matched Vince Gilligan’s most famous creation in terms of writing and critical acclaim? Season five of the BB prequel sees the return of the criminally-underrated Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill/ Saul Goodman along with one of the best supporting casts in present day-television: Kim (Rhea Seahorn), Mike (Jonathan Banks) and Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) to mention a few.

Our favourite Albuquerque attorney has finally ‘broken bad’ in the previous season, and if Odenkirk’s comments that an “explosive” new season will be in store is anything to go by, is it too much to hope that fans could get a glimpse of — whisper it — Walter White?

4) Lizzie McGuire (Disney+)

Hilary Duff in the ‘Lizzie McGuire’ reboot

Disney+ has started the revolution to convince many former child stars to reprise roles that made them coveted in the first place, and brings families rushing to the new platform. No wonder then, that the Lizzie McGuire reboot has hustled up so much nostalgia from fans, and given Hilary Duff an update as a now-30-year-old millennial living in New York, and working as an interior designer.

Original series creator Terri Minsky will hope to replicate the success of the original that ran from 2001 to 2004 (along with a 2003 movie) which narrated the teenage life of 13-year-old Lizzie (Hillary Duff) and her best friends Miranda (Lalaine) and Gordo (Adam Lamberg).

5) Homeland (Showtime)

Claire Danes in the final season of ‘Homeland’

The eighth and final season of Homeland comes in February, starring Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin for their swansong as two of the most outstanding TV characters from the last decade. The espionage drama picks up after Carrie (Danes) has been imprisoned in a Russian gulag and is suffering from a loss of memory. The series was delayed due to the makers wanting to ensure they go out on a high. Indeed, Homeland, after being pretty much the best drama on TV in its first two seasons, lost steam, but has picked up heady momentum in recent outings to pave the way for a fond goodbye.

6) Bojack Horseman (Netflix)

‘Bojack Horseman’ will bid adieu to fans with its final episodes this year

Oh dear, the talking horse is back.

There’s a good case to be made for Bojack Horseman being the most important show of the 2010s. Did you ever imagine that an animated horse could get you in touch with your inner demons and confront them? With six seasons of outstanding writing that’s set a precedent for many years to come, show creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg faces the daunting challenge of ending Bojack’s journey, as a plethora of fans across the globe wait with bated breath to see if the series final will send them spinning into an existential crisis, yet again.

The new season sees BoJack out of rehab, and on his path to redemption, working as an acting professor and teaching students. On January 31, the crew of Diane, Todd, Princess Caroline and Mr. Peanutbutter all are back for the final eight episodes of season six that was split into two parts. Are you ready to be broken... one last time?

7) Avenue 5 (HBO)

Hugh Laurie in ‘Avenue 5’

A planet-hopping cruise spaceship led by Captain Ryan Clark, played by the indomitable Hugh Laurie: doesn’t that get you psyched already? The brainchild of the creator of the much-beloved Veep, Armando Iannucci, the show also stars Zach Woods, Josh Gad and Himesh Patel. With a stellar star cast known for their acting chops and comedic prowess, this comedy is sure to elicit many laughs.

This sci-fi comedy is set 40 years in the future, as a spaceship is on an eight-week cruise around Saturn. The show hints at sudden pandemonium on the ship, inciting the captain and his motley crew to deal with the mysterious threat and allay fears of the many passengers on-board.

8) Impeachment: American Crime Story (FX)

It doesn’t get more controversial than this. Ryan Murphy has cemented a stellar reputation for crafting complex narratives through Crime Story. The third segment of the anthology will chronicle the presidential scandal in the USA involving Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky. Clive Owen will essay the former POTUS, and Beanie Feldstein (after a wonderful 2019 with Booksmart) will play Lewinsky. Critics’ darling Sarah Paulson will be seen as whistle-blower Linda Tripp and Annaleigh Ashford stars as Paula Jones.

The script for the show is based on the book A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President by Jeffrey Toobin. The time is ripe for the show what with an impeachment trial underway in the US and the upcoming presidential elections.

9) Mrs. America (FX on Hulu)

Cate Blanchett as Phyllis Schlafly in ‘Mrs. America’

Mrs. America is set in the 1970s, but promises to be as relevant as ever as women exercise their right to vote in a pivotal US presidential election coming up in the year. The nine-episode series follows the civil movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment — and the opposition faced by it. The ERA seeks to end distinction on the basis of sex and guarantees equal rights to all in terms of employment, property, divorce and other issues.

A stellar cast including Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem, Uzo Aduba as Shirley Chisholm and Margo Martindale as Bella Abzug take on Cate Blanchett as Phyllis Schlafly.

10) Star Trek: Picard (CBS All Access)

A still from ‘Star Trek: Picard’

Star Trek: Picard is set 20 years after Star Trek: Nemesis, and Jean-Luc Picard is reeling from the death of Data and Romulan home planet, Romulus being totally destoryed. What hardcore Trekkers can get excited about however is Sir Patrick Stewart back in the captain’s chair. With the likes of Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis and Brent Spiner back in the mix, as several characters from The Next Generation also return.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ay6qku/article30544342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv2020,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/from-mrs-america-to-high-fidelity-10-television-shows-to-look-forward-to-in-2020/article30544343.ece
162,2020/01/11,Anurag Kashyap demands PM Narendra Modi’s father’s birth certificate,"With the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) coming into effect on January 10, Anurag Kashyap has raised his voice in protest once again. The filmmaker, who has been vocal against the CAA ever since it was passed by Parliament on December 11, has now launched a personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his family.

The CAA facilitates non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan getting Indian citizenship.

Protesting against this on Twitter, Kashyap launched a personal attack on Mr. Modi. Tweeting in Hindi, he demanded proof that Mr. Modi was educated, and wanted to see his degree in “entire political science.”

Kashyap also said that Mr. Modi should show his birth certificate, along with that of his father and his entire family, to the nation, and only then could he ask for papers from citizens. The filmmaker used the hashtag #f**kCAA as a mark of protest.

In a tweet calling the government “dumb” and comparing CAA to demonetisation, the filmmaker shared: “This government will do dialogue if they know how to talk. They cannot face a single question that’s not been vetted, they don’t have a plan, they haven’t put out a system. This is a dumb government. Their CAA is like demonetisation. No plan. No vision. Just bullying. #f**kCAA.”

Actor Swara Bhasker also protested against the enforcement of CAA. Sharing the gazette notification issued by the Union Home Ministry that says the Citizenship Amendment Act has been brought into force from January 10, 2020, the acotr called it a “Black Day for India.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vgjym/article28258522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/anurag-kashyapjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/anurag-kashyap-demands-pm-narendra-modis-fathers-birth-certificate/article30543562.ece
163,2020/01/11,‘Dracula’ review: Messy first season presents low bar for further adventures of opera-cloaked vampire,"The idea of a Dracula reboot by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat was thrilling. Gatiss and Moffat are the ones who dragged that consulting detective who hangs out at 221 Baker Street from the world of hansom cabs and dew-dappled cobblestones to the 21st century in BBC’s Sherlock.

Dracula follows Sherlock’s format of three 90-minute episodes. With Sue Vertue who also produced Sherlock as producer, one should not be blamed for having great expectations of a new take on the most famous vampire of them all. The trailer looked suitably gross — the fly in the eye reminded me of Catch 22 and Yossarian’s increasing frustration as Orr implacably insists that there are flies in Appleby’s eyes, which he cannot see, “because he has flies in his eyes.”

Also Read Holming into the new age

Danish actor and musician Claes Bang looks hot as the title character and visions of a repeat of Benedict Cumberbatch’s sexy, high-functioning sociopath turn as Sherlock began to form.

Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) is the Gothic tale of an English lawyer, Jonathan Harker, who goes to Translyvannia to help Count Dracula buy land in London. When he reaches the Count’s castle he realises Dracula is a vampire and planning to unleash his plague of the undead on England’s green and pleasant land. Harker barely escapes with his life and returns to England to defeat the Count with the help of a Dutch doctor, Abraham Van Helsing. Dracula established many ground rules about vampires including abhorrence of garlic, lack of reflections and profusion of bats and flies.

Dracula is truly undead and has been popping up on screens with metronomic regularity. There have been versions that are serious, scary, gory, funny and everything in between.

There was Francis Ford Coppola’s rather portentously named Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992) with Keanu Reeves (Harker), Winona Ryder as Mina, Harker’s fiancée, Gary Oldman as the blood thirsty Count and Anthony Hopkins hamming it up as Van Helsing.

There was also Mel Brooks’ howlarious Dracula: Dead and Loving it (1995) with Leslie Nielsen as Dracula, Mel Brooks as Van Helsing and Peter MacNicol as the fly-eating solicitor, Thomas Renfield.

So when Gatiss and Moffat spoke of being faithful and faithless to the original text, it all sounded so promising. But alas it was not to be. There is a gender swap with Van Helsing turning into Sister Agatha Van Helsing (Dolly Wells).

Dracula Season 1

Episodes: 3

Run time: 90 minutes

Created by Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat

The tone swinging wildly from gory horror to humour was unsettling to say the least. On the one hand, there are rotting nails, lots of blood, the aforementioned fly in the eye and on the other you have lines like, “I am undead, not unreasonable,” and when Harker tells Dracula he is a monster, the count replies, “You are a lawyer, nobody is perfect.” There is Dracula saying, “I cant wait to eat some atheists,” Agatha saying, “I am dying but don’t get distracted,” you get the drift.

The first episode, The Rules of the Beast, introduces Harker (John Heffernan) in the monastery recounting the harrowing story of his imprisonment at the hands of Dracula. There are all the things we have come to expect: the scary coach ride, the lack of servants, the Count’s mouldering castle, the fear of the cross and the scary house guests among other things. Harker is telling his story to Sister Agatha at the convent. The Count comes in search of Harker and crosses swords with Agatha.

Also Read The other Holmes boy

Dracula moves into whodunnit mode in the second episode, Blood Vessel, which is also the strongest. The count is travelling to London on board the Demeter and the passengers, including an Indian, Sharma (Sacha Dhawan), from the University of Calcutta, get picked off one by one. “I have a particular gift of eliminating suspects” as the count succinctly puts it. Literary allusions come thick and fast as the chess game between Agatha and the Count remind one of Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the chess game with death.

Episode 3, The Dark Compass, devolves into silliness and the inexplicable time jump does not help either. The tragic “bloofer” lady, Lucy (Lydia West) gets short shrift just like Mina , Dracula becomes a silly playboy and it all gets very annoying including Agatha’s accent. Gatiss makes a belated entry as Renfeld, absent-mindedly eating flies.

While the reverential fog was lifted off Holmes to present a fast-paced Sherlock with enough in it for the Doyle fan and the newbie, Dracula cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be taken seriously or played for laughs and suffers rather badly for it.

With the show doing very well, there are talks of Season 2. While Sherlock waited till Season 3 to unravel, the messy first season of Dracula presents a low bar for further adventures of the opera cloaked vampire.

But it was actor Martin Sheen, known for his work in the likes of Apocalypse Now and The West Wing, who inspired the most, quoting Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore during his speech to the crowds present. He was arrested by the police, along with the other actors, and later released.

During his speech, Sheen who followed Jane Fonda to the stage, remarked, “Clearly, the world will be saved by women. Thank god they outnumber us men.”

He then motivated the crowd, to take action for something in their lifetime that can lift upto the nation to the point, “Where the heart is without fear, and the head is held high,” using inspiration from Tagore’s poem Where The Mind Is Without Fear.

“Where knowledge is free

Where the world has not been broken up into fragments

Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way

Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit

Where the mind is led forward by thee

Into ever-widening thought and action

Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.”

166,2020/01/11,Actor Doug Jones talks ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ and his collaborations with Guillermo del Toro,"It is 12:30 am in Los Angeles when Doug Jones sits down for a Skype interview with MetroPlus. Despite being in between shoots for the new season of Star Trek: Discovery, he has the energy of a lithe teenager. It is a little jarring seeing the actor in his ‘sans prosthetics state’; the world is used to seeing him with frayed gills, distorted eyeballs or alien anatomies. But it is a comfort that throughout the interview, he speaks just as much with his hands as he does with his face.

The 59-year-old actor is quite literally, ‘the most famous actor you have never seen’ with major starring roles in the Guillermo Del Toro universe of films such as Hellboy and Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Pan’s Labyrinth, The Shape Of Water, as well as 2007’s Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer. After the physically and emotionally taxing work of The Shape Of Water, he had decided to “hang up his rubber bits,” but when a call came in asking him to speak with the producers of a new Star Trek project, he knew it was not time yet.

On Star Trek: Discovery, Doug portrays Kelpian slave-turned-commander Saru, a much-loved character in the Star Trek franchise. “When you’re given a new species to help create it’s very intimidating because this is a franchise with so much legacy, that I didn't want to get this wrong,” he starts, “I wanted to make sure this could help create a new species of alien that would be everything the writers hoped for: charming, witty smart and with his own full plate. Saru is a very emotional being as well as logical.”

Coming up with Saru’s physique was extremely fulfilling for Doug who wanted Saru to be different from any other character he has played — a big challenge given he has worked in the sci-fi world for over the 30 years. “When I saw the first designs and saw those hoof boots — his feet actually move like those of an antelope — and when I put those shoes on for the first time, it changed my posture and and I felt like I was walking around like a supermodel and my arms started naturally flowing behind me.”

Movement is everything

Doug’s background as a mime and contortionist paved the way for some memorable locomotion. Remember the aquiline Hellboy’s Abe Sapien? Or the somewhat insidious Pale Man from Pan’s Labyrinth? The actor has mentioned in past interviews that the flamboyant style of matadors influenced much of the way The Asset (or ‘amphibian man’) moved. “I think about flexibility and mobility when I play a character; all my body parts are employed that day, so I want the character to be embodied from head to toe. I want to explore how much I can do, as well as how much is appropriate for that character.”

Of course, a lot of training comes in handy. For 2002’s The Time Machine, he referred to the conceptual imagery for inspiration. On-screen, one can see the lead Spy Morlock (played by Doug) squatting with knees by his head, in an almost inhuman position.

Funnily enough, Doug points out in his years of wearing prosthetics and costumes of all kinds, he has not once had a hand in how they are done. After all, most of the designers are leading experts in the industry. But only once has he made suggestions: for Saru, mainly because the early design would have had a performance ramification. The early design featured a winged head and many eyeballs which would have been CG-enhanced. Saru’s hands also featured two-inch finger extensions which would have made doing anything difficult. “When they asked me my opinion, I said it’s extremely uncomfortable because I was hidden under it and it was extremely heavy,” he explains, “Concept artist Neville Page offered to make something ‘more Dougie’ so that I can express better.

On what we can expect for season three, Doug says, “At the end of season two, we jumped into the future and I think [the production team] has let it out that we we go about 900 or 1000 years into the future, so the big the big mystery is ‘what are we gonna find there?’ and, as far as my my future's future goes, I am sitting in the commander’s chair when we make that jump.”

Beguiled by Guillermo

The actor’s physicality continues to place him as a real Hollywood proponent in a time VFX can only do so much. And this understanding of character embodiment has made Doug a ‘director’s actor’ if his years-long collaboration with Guillermo del Toro is anything to go by.

In 2018, The Shape Of Water won Academy Awards including Best Director and Best Picture. The film marks yet another stepping stone in Doug and Guillermo del Toro’s evolving relationship as collaborators and friends. The two met in 1997 on Mimic on which Doug only worked three days as a fill-in bug creature. “He remembered me; five years later we did the first Hellboy movie where I played Abe Sapien, a supporting character... but we bonded more during that film and had established a non-verbal dialogue between the two of us; very little has to be said when he’s directing me. That is when he quickly became my favourite director. He is someone who understands all of his actors, and knows what buttons to push.”

Doug describes doing an encompassing one-camera shot for Hellboy in which he had to deal with three different props. “I tried to go through the action of picking up each prop and dealing with it and doing what I had to do,” he starts laughing as he continues, “and Guillermo says, ‘God, Dougie, you're boring me to death!’ so that’s all I had to hear.”

But it was Pan’s Labyrinth which marked a turning point in their relationship.

“In the film industry, people talk about that relationship of trust between the two of us where I would do anything the man says and he knows that [laughs] and he trusts me. For him to trust me with a role like The Fawn and The Pale Man in this passion project for him — he hardly had any budget to make it and he had to just pull favours from people — but we all knew we had a piece of art on our hands. That said, to trust me with that was extraordinary and I even got on that ride with him through awards season that year: the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs and The Oscars.”

Moving forward, Doug finds himself drawn to more humanesque roles; he expresses an unconventional role dream too. “I would love to be in a Hallmark Christmas movie, playing the dad offering his daughter some sage advice while wearing an ugly Christmas sweater,” he laughs.

167,2020/01/11,"‘Tabasco is how I call Tabu,’ says Ishaan Khatter on ‘A Suitable Boy’ co-star","Actor Ishaan Khatter says it was easy to romance Tabu in Mira Nair’s anticipated A Suitable Boy.

Asked why, Ishaan replied: “Because that person is Tabu, it really does half the job for you. I have said this before and I have said this in Dhadak as well, it is always easy for me to play the besotted lover. Because she’s mesmerising, she is and especially in this character. I am really excited for people to see Saaeda Bai.”

He has a nickname for Tabu as well. “It is Tabasco! Tabasco for Tabassum. I came up with it. She’s mirchi!” he said.

What would Ishaan like to gift Tabu? “My heart! I would like to gift her. I think I am very much in possession of my heart. I would gift her a book of Ghalib’s poetry,” Ishaan replied.

In A Suitable Boy, Ishaan plays Maan Kapoor, the rebellious son of politician Mahesh Kapoor (played by Ram Kapoor), who develops an attraction to the beautiful courtesan Saaeda Bai (essayed by Tabu).

Did he opt for Nair’s A Suitable Boy over Vishal Bhardwaj’s Midnight Children? “I wouldn’t frame it like that, I wouldn’t say I had the option of choosing between, for whatever reasons I was able to be a part of A Suitable Boy, I am really glad that it worked out that way because at one point it looked like I wouldn’t be able to do it. I sent her a WhatsApp message, if you must know, saying ‘How are you doing Mira di?’, because that’s what I call her.

“But, yes a lot of thought, a lot of critical thought goes behind decisions, at least for me. Both of them are different from the work that I have done before and they are different from each other. I don’t think I’ll be any good if I feel even slightly complacent on a set.

168,2020/01/11,‘Joker’ star Joaquin Phoenix arrested in climate change protest,"Fresh off his win at the Golden Globes, actor Joaquin Phoenix participated in a climate change protest and was arrested by the police.

The Joker star took part in the weekly protests against climate change, started by Hollywood veteran Jane Fonda.

According to Variety, the 45-year-old actor also addressed the crowd of close to 300 people.

In his short speech, he took aim at the meat and dairy industry for being the third leading cause of the climate crisis.

“Sometimes we wonder what can we do in this fight against climate change, and there is something that you can do today and tomorrow, by making a choice about what you consume,” Phoenix said.

“There are things I can’t avoid. I flew a plane here today, or last night rather, but one thing I can do is change my eating habits,” he added.

Besides Phoenix, veteran Hollywood star Martin Sheen also turned up for the protest and got arrested by the police. Actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Susan Sarandon were also present.

Capitol Police said it arrested 147 people who were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding. All the protestors were later released.

Fonda, who was on stage with Phoenix, called him “one of the greatest living actors today”.

She has been protesting weekly as part of her “Fire Drill Fridays” initiative since announcing she was moving to Washington “to be closer to the epicenter of the fight for our climate.” Her participation has ended in multiple arrests.

176,2020/01/11,Mechanised boats to come under scrutiny,"A thorough monitoring of the engine capacity of mechanised boats through the newly created Marine Enforcement Wing will prevent use of banned fishing nets, say officials of Fisheries Department.

The department has been teaming up with the Coastal Security Group, Indian Coast Guard and the Forest department to create awareness of the clause pertaining to safe fishing practices in 53 hamlets.

Clause (a) of Sub- section (1) of Section 5 of the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 1983) prohibits fishing by pair trawling or fishing with purse-seine nets by any fishing vessel / craft, whether country craft or mechanized boat, irrespective of their size and power of the engine in the entire coast.

Fishers are told that purse seine nets encircle incoming shoals and prevent them from moving towards the shore. Indulging in such a practice in inshore area will arrest movement of shoals towards the coast.

The absence of breeding of fish has led to depletion of fish stock, officials said.

Fishers know nets like the purse seine do an irreparable damage. “Though the response is positive, some flout norms. The department had to impound 46 mechanised boats in Pazhayar fishing harbour as owners did not conform to the directive that the engine capacity should not exceed 240 hp,” Amal Raj Xavier, Joint Director of Fisheries Department, Nagapattinam district, said.

The boats were impounded as some were found operating with engines of capacities up to 320 hp. The role of Marine Enforcement Wing will be instrumental in checking harmful practices and improving prospects for fish breeding. The force has been mandated with the task of conserving and managing fishing resources and handle illegal fishing and threats from the miscreants engaged in illegal fishing.

Nagapattinam district has been sanctioned 16 Marine Enforcement Wing personnel including two Inspector rank officials. They will be provided with space and facilities in the fishing harbours to operate, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mechanised-boats-to-come-under-scrutiny/article30540836.ece

The judge also imposed a penalty of ₹1,000 on her.

According to the prosecution, in 2015, when R. Vijayalakshmi was working as a teacher at the Government Middle School in Ramapuram, near Namakkal, she asked a Dalit student to manually clean the waste of a classmate.

The boy did as the teacher told him to and later informed his parents.

Protest

Following this, protests were held outside the school demanding action against the teacher.

The boy’s parents also filed a complaint at the Namakkal police station and a case was registered against the teacher under provisions of the Act. She was suspended from the school thereafter.

The case was investigated by T. Manoharan, Namakkal DSP, and a chargesheet filed before the Special Court for trial of cases registered under the SC/ST Act.

Maximum sentence

After hearing the arguments advanced by public prosecutor Madheshwaran and the defence counsel, sessions judge K. Dhanasekaran sentenced the teacher to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of ₹1,000 under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act.

“The teacher has asked a student from the Scheduled Caste community to clean human waste of another student manually. The court has awarded the highest punishment to the accused under the Act,” said Mr. Madheshwaran.

178,2020/01/11,Govt. may increase taxes to counter slump,"The State government, handicapped by a tepid growth rate of revenue collection in State taxes and a negative growth rate in realisation of its share in Central taxes, is thinking of increasing taxes such as State excise or vehicle tax.

A hint to this effect was dropped by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in a statement tabled in the Assembly on Thursday on mid-year review of trends in receipts and expenditure. In addition to mopping up tax collection, the government may take up “additional resource mobilisation as appropriate to make up for the revenue shortfall and achieve the revenue targets,” he told the House.

Initially, the government estimated that this year’s State Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), accounting for about 60% of the receipts, would grow at the rate of about 13.3% over the revised estimates of SOTR for 2018-19. But in the first six months, the rate of growth was a mere 3.42%.

Likewise, in respect of share in Central taxes, the State received ₹12,520 crore during April-September 2019, which was about 3.4% less than what it got in the same period last year. Expecting “a further significant shortfall in revenue” due to the Corporate Tax reduction announced by the Centre, Mr. Panneerselvam said “the negative trend in the share of Central taxes due to revenue under performance by the Government of India is a cause for serious concern.”

Revenue slump

Of the SOTR’s components, taxes on vehicles and stamps and registration had recorded the negative growth rate in their revenue collections, which were, in turn, attributed to the impact of “seasonal factors” and economic slowdown.

As for the share in Central taxes, the State received, in mid-December, ₹1,898 crore towards its share in Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation.

A senior official says if the Centre follows it up with the release of around ₹3,370 crore towards grants meant for local bodies and nearly ₹4,070 crore towards arrears of the Integrated GST (IGST), the State’s revenue deficit could be brought down substantially. Otherwise, the deficit figure may eventually be much higher than the initial estimate of about ₹14,310 crore.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/l6i8wc/article30538615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11cityRevenuecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-may-increase-taxes-to-counter-slump/article30538616.ece

Wigneswaran asked the Indian government to extend dual citizenship for them. They had stayed in India for over 30 years, he said.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Pongal festival organised by Tamiliyakam, here on various issues pertaining to Sri Lankan Tamils, he said they have been extended several benefits by the Indian government all these years.

He said over 1 lakh Sri Lankan Tamils live in the State and their children were born, brought up and educated here. “We want them to return to our country soon. They get several facilities here including higher education for their children. For that purpose they may need to extend their stay in India. To avail these benefits they need dual citizenship,” Mr. Wigneswaran added.

He added that as there was no specific treaty on dual citizenship, the Indian and Sri Lankan governments should work one out.

Mr. Wigneswaran added that there are over 10 lakh people who left the shores of the island nation and many of them want to return home. But the foundation was not set for their return, he said and assured that if his party wins the elections, it would ensure that their homecoming is facilitated. When the Sri Lankan Tamils return, the Sri Lankan government owes a huge responsibility to provide a conducive atmosphere for them to settle down, he said.

To a question on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s stand on Tamil population, Mr. Wigneswaran said the President did not get a sizeable support from the Tamils this time and his recent statements supporting Singhalese and Buddhists shows that he wants more support from them. With the Parliamentary elections round the corner, one has to wait and watch, he said.

Regarding the delay in the release of 7 life-convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Mr. Wigenswaran remarked that he does not think that they were directly involved in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. “Beyond that there may be political reasons behind that decision, which I do not know,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/argjpv/article30538575.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THTNWIGNESWARAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cv-wigneswaran-bats-for-dual-citizenship/article30538576.ece

The BJP filed a complaint with Deepak M. Damor, Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, seeking registration of case against the orator. He was arrested on January 2 night and remanded in judicial custody.

After the Palayamkottai Central Prison authorities refused to lodge in the jail, Mr. Kannan was taken to Salem Central Jail.

Case adjourned

Meanwhile, hearing a petition filed by Mr. Kannan seeking to quash the FIR registered against him, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court ordered notice to police and adjourned case to January 20.

Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira ordered the notice and adjourned the case to January 20. In his petition, Mr. Kannan said he had used a colloquial term in his speech which was misinterpreted. He said that he had no intention to hurt anybody or any particular community or religion and sought to quash the FIR registered against him.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nellai-kannan-granted-bail/article30538565.ece
184,2020/01/11,"After security cover goes, Stalin takes a dig at Centre","A day after the Centre withdrew the CRPF cover provided to DMK president M.K. Stalin, he thanked the personnel who had provided security cover for him over the past years.

While political leaders in the State condemned the move, Mr. Stalin thanked the personnel in a tweet. However, he urged “the Centre to utilise CRPF personnel to protect universities and students from those perpetrating violence in the name of religion”.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri i slammed the Centre for removing the CRPF protection given to Mr. Stalin. “The BJP government removed the SPG protection to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka. Now they have removed the removed the Z-plus security given to Mr. Stalin. “These are completely biased decisions and raise question marks over the security of the Congress-DMK leaders,” he said.

Mr. Alagiri said it was based on intelligence inputs that Z-Plus category security was given to Mr. Stalin. “I would like to ask them on what basis they are removing this now? Home Minister Amit Shah should provide an answer,” he said.

Vaiko slams Centre

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) founder Vaiko on Friday opposed the decision to withdraw the Z-category security cover provided to DMK president M.K. Stalin and condemned both the Union and State governments for the decision. Mr. Vaiko contended that Mr. Stalin had been defending challenges to the ideals of Periyar and former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai. Besides, Mr. Stalin has been countering the narratives being spread against the Dravidian movement.

“He [Mr. Stalin] is becoming popular day by day. There have been incidents where Periyar’s statues were damaged. While so, it is only just to continue security cover that was provided to Mr. Stalin,” Mr. Vaiko said.

He condemned the Union and State governments for withdrawing the security cover to Mr. Stalin.

185,2020/01/11,Dual citizenship for Tamil refugees unlikely to materialise,"The ongoing political discourse in Tamil Nadu seeking dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees is unlikely to lead to any major change in the Citizenship Act. The debate on the issue has been revived following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the campaign by the DMK-led opposition that it discriminates against Sri Lankan Tamils apart from Muslims. The ruling AIADMK has already petitioned Home Minister Amit Shah with the demand.

However, according to a senior government official, the authorities, both at the Centre and in the State, prefer voluntary repatriation of the refugees to any other option. Thus, prospects of any more amendment to the law in the near future are bleak.

One of the reasons for this position of the authorities is that the voluntary reverse flow of the refugees will strengthen the cause of Tamils in the neighbouring country who are demanding greater powers. On the other hand, any move to provide Indian citizenship to the refugees could disturb the present equilibrium in which Tamils are living in Sri Lanka.

HC order

If at all there is any change in the position of the Union government, this will come to the fore in respect of applications of 38 refugees of the Kottapattu camp in Tiruchi district for citizenship in the light of an order of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in June last year.

The applications were sent by the Tiruchi Collector to the State government in October which forwarded them to the Union Home Ministry in compliance with the court order.

Actually, 65 refugees of the camp had approached the High Court, seeking direction to the Central government to grant them citizenship on the ground that their ancestors were from Tamil Nadu and they were taken to Sri Lanka during the British era to work in tea estates.

The petitioners claimed that in the aftermath of the 1983 anti-Tamil riots, they had to flee to India along with Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, who hailed from Northern and Eastern provinces, but they should not be clubbed with the other category of refugees. In fact, they should be treated on a par with those who were repatriated to India under the 1964 and 1974 bilateral agreements.

However, the court, acknowledging that “citizenship falls within the exclusive executive domain of the Central government,” refused to issue any positive mandamus to the Centre but asked the Union government to issue “appropriate orders,” within 16 weeks of receiving the applications.

The Central government had also made it clear in the court that citizenship cannot be claimed as a matter of right, even if the petitioners fulfil all the criteria. Besides, only those who entered India after 1983 with valid travel documents can apply for Indian citizenship under Section 5(1)(c) [dealing with the option of citizenship by registration] of the Citizenship Act. All others would be regarded as illegal migrants.

It is the application of the term, “illegal migrants,” that has come in the way of giving citizenship even to stateless persons.

Narrow application

According to certain specialists, the term need not be narrowly applied as invariably all the refugees from Sri Lanka, only on “complete verification of their antecedents,” were shifted to refugee camps in the State, a fact not just known to the Union Ministry but also acknowledged by the Ministry in its annual reports. V. Suryanarayan, a long-standing expert, says the Union government’s standing instruction to the State government on applications from the refugees — as captured in two circulars issued in 1983 and again in 2007 — is the major obstacle to the authorities considering even genuine cases for citizenship.

As far as the Sri Lankan government is concerned, it is also for the voluntary return of refugees, as a matter of policy. Even though it is not outwardly making any effort to take back the refugees, it has been issuing birth certificates to children born to the refugees.

The issue of birth certificates is a pre-requisite to any one applying for Sri Lankan citizenship. Between 1988 and 2019, around 26,430 birth certificates were issued.

Two options

Observers of issues concerning the refugees are of the view that broadly, there are two options. The two countries will have to take concerted steps to provide a push to the process of voluntary repatriation and the steps include organising ferry services between Rameswaram and Talaimannar, a package of assistance for livelihood and educational opportunities for refugee-returnees and their children and re-empowerment of the refugee-returnees with their immovable properties, if any.

Two, in respect of those who see better employment opportunities in India than in Sri Lanka, residence permits can be issued to them so that their stay in India gets regularised.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/me1vfp/article30538528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THTNREFUGEES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dual-citizenship-for-tamil-refugees-unlikely-to-materialise/article30538529.ece
186,2020/01/11,Local bodies: Congress-DMK talks break down,"Fissures in the DMK-Congress alliance, brewing for some time, came out in the open on Friday ahead of the indirect elections to key posts in the rural local bodies with the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee accusing the DMK of not adhering to the coalition dharma and not allotting enough posts of chairman to panchayat unions.

Talks between the two parties, which have been taking place for about a week, broke down on Friday with the DMK refusing to concede to the Congress’ demands.

Sources said the Congress had sought at least one district chairman post, two district vice-chairman posts and 10 panchayat union chairman posts. But the DMK was willing to allot just two posts of chairman of panchayat unions.

A joint statement in the evening by TNCC president K.S. Alagiri and Congress floor leader K.R. Ramasamy said it was painful that the DMK was not adhering to the coalition dharma.

The two leaders along with former TNCC president K.V. Thangkabalu were negotiating with the DMK president M.K. Stalin and senior leaders T.R. Baalu and R.S. Bharathi for a week on the issue. As a follow-up, A. Gopanna, chairman of the Congress media cell, held four rounds of talks with the DMK but it fell through, sources said. “It was decided before the local body polls that seats where the parties will contest will be decided by the district leaders of both the parties. But there was no cooperation from the DMK,” the statement said.

“Even in seats where the DMK high command had advised to be given to us, we are being denied an opportunity,” the statement said.

Of the 303 panchayat union chairman posts, only two are being offered to the Congress.

The Congress ended up winning only around 133 panchayat union seats and its strike rate was about 25%. It won 15 seats for the post of district panchayats ward members. In village pachayats too, it clocked a similar strike rate. Comparatively, the BJP, which is facing a backlash in the State, managed to win about 85 panchayat union seats.

Sources in the TNCC told The Hindu that the party was even denied seats in Mr. Alagiri's home district of Cuddalore.

Chidambaram hopeful

Veteran Congress leader P Chidambaram when asked about the development, said, “I don’t know what happened. What I got to know is that Congress couldn’t get enough seats in the coalition. It is not late yet. The indirect elections are only tomorrow (Saturday). From now till morning, they have time and they should call Mr. Alagiri and hold discussions and sort out the issue,” Mr. Chidambaram added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/local-bodies-congress-dmk-talks-break-down/article30538487.ece
187,2020/01/11,"BJP spreading misleading information, says Minister","Minister for Roads and Buildings and Housing V. Prashanth Reddy has appealed to the people not to get carried away with the misinformation campaign being carried out by BJP and other Opposition parties on the implementation of Aasara pensions, housing scheme and KCR health kits.

Throwing a challenge to Member of Parliament D. Arvind to prove the Central government’s share of contribution in the Aasara pensions, he said that the Centre had hardly given ₹200 crore when K. Chandrasekhar Rao led TRS government spent ₹9,200 crore per annum for pensions. Similarly, in the two-bedroom houses and KCR health kits the Central share was bare minimum, he said.

Addressing a press conference along with the TRS general secretary Tula Uma at his home here on Saturday, he said that considering the amount of ₹1.50 lakh being offered by the Centre in the housing scheme, it was not enough to build a comfortable home for the poor. The State government made it ₹6.50 lakh to construct two bedroom houses. “When we spent ₹7,888 crore on the 2.83 lakh houses sanctioned, the Centre had released hardly ₹1,000 crore as its contribution,” he explained.

Mr. Prashanth Reddy said that where there was development there would be TRS and therefore people were with KCR in every election. In all the seven municipalities in the undivided old district works such as roads, central lighting, greenery improvement, drinking water supply and sanitation were going on at a brisk pace as ₹100 crore for Nizamabad, ₹60 crore for Kamareddy, ₹50 crore for Bodhan, ₹40 crore for Banswada, ₹30 crore for Armoor, ₹25 crore for Bheemgal and ₹15 crore for Yellareddy were released.

188,2020/01/11,Panthangi toll plaza opens all lanes to non-FASTag vehicles,"The difference between FASTag and non-FASTag vehicles was erased at the Panthangi toll plaza on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada road (NH65) on Saturday, as officials, unable to control the heavy Sankranti rush of vehicles towards Vijayawada, opened all the lanes to cash payment also.

The flow of the vehicles started in the early hours of the day, with thousands of them stranded up to 800 metres almost throughout the day.

Toll officials, anticipating heavy flow of vehicles ferrying people to home-town for the harvest festival, began the day by allotting nine of the 16 lanes to traffic towards Vijayawada and ran two exclusive cash counters, while others were ‘FASTag Express-No Cash’. However, by 8.30 a.m., the volume of traffic was so heavy that it stretched to about 2 km on the bottleneck leading to the toll plaza.

According to officials, the day started well, but traffic became uncontrollable as non-FasTAG vehicles outnumbered FASTag ones at the plaza. There were long queues and the ‘No Cash’ lanes also had to be opened to cash payment. The situation came under control only after 2 p.m., they said.

Largest gateway

The Panthangi toll plaza, the largest gateway between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, is also the second busiest plaza in the State. Even during usual days, the traffic towards the Narketpally-Addanki State highway and towards the Suryapet-Khammam highway touches this toll plaza.

Hourly figures, available till 6 p.m. on Saturday, showed that only 50% of the vehicles had a ‘FASTag exit’. Of the 27, 726 vehicles that touched the plaza in the Vijayawada direction, 13,958 had FASTag stickers.

Worried lot

FASTag riders were a worried lot, as the electronic sticker on their windshield served only the purpose of payment, but did not ensure a hassle-free, and time- and fuel-saving trip.

Officials, however, were bracing for more traffic on Sunday. To meet the situation, they would use hand-held devices for toll collection, besides creating awareness on FASTag sales.

They said FASTag stickers could be purchased even before reaching the Panthangi toll plaza at hotel Village Aaharam, Koyalagudem, in the Vijayawada direction, and at Hotel Vivera, N Grill and 7R near Suryapet in the Hyderabad direction.

Officials said that on Saturday, the total number of vehicles that moved in both directions was 40, 995, double the daily average of 20,136.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ac8bft/article30545883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12HYNALGONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/toll-plaza-opens-all-lanes-to-non-fastag-vehicles/article30545885.ece

190,2020/01/11,"‘Crop diversification, agroforestry can cut farm losses’","Speakers at a three-day training programme on agroforestry systems, raising, management and marketing of plantations have suggested that crop diversification, including agroforestry, is one of the effective and viable ways out to bring down losses in agriculture and make it profitable.

The training programme was organised at the Van Vigyan Kendra of the Institute of Forest Biodiversity (IFB) here from January 8 to 10 and was attended by some farmers. Speakers, including Director of the Institute D. Jayaprasad, Ratnaker Jauhari, G. Ravi Shankar Reddy and others, said most of the farmers in the country practice agriculture as a tradition and they hardly go for commercial crops, they are poor at adopting technology and they are not aware of how to time the produce by studying demand and supply system. As a result, they suffer losses more often than not.

One of the effective ways to overcome the problem was to go for crop diversification and include agroforestry in their farming. The concept behind it was the chances to increase the productivity of different kinds of produce from one unit of land, which would ultimately bring down losses, they said.

On the raising of red sanders plantations by farmers, the speakers said its marketing was difficult till the National Biodiversity Authority of India had framing rules facilitating liberalised sale of its produce. However, still there was need for establishing a certifying agency to stated that particular lot of red sanders was sustainably harvested in the farmlands and it was not from the forests. Bar coding of red sanders at nuclear level could help overcome the problem of unscrupulous elements’ efforts to sell the forest produce as the farm produce, they said.

Other agroforestry varieties such as ‘kasturi bhendi, seoni, melia dubia, malabar neem’ and others could also be cultivated by farmers along with their regular crops, they suggested.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/crop-diversification-agroforestry-can-cut-farm-losses/article30545372.ece

Rama Rao himself decided to settle the issue.

Mr. Taraka Rama Rao on Saturday invited the MLAs facing the problem of barrage of aspirants for discussions and also to thrash out differences between different groups in their constituencies. Apart from giving directions, he also gave a stern warning to them that rebel candidates should not be in the fray after the last date for withdrawal was over.

However, dissident candidates, supporters of rival groups, who filed nominations across the State refused to withdraw totally. Labour Minister and Mechal MLA Ch. Malla Reddy and his rival in the constituency M. Sudheer Reddy met Mr. Rama Rao separately to explain their stand. Mr. Malla Reddy was embarrassed after Darga Dayakar Reddy, an aspirant for Mayor post in the Peerzadiguda Corporation, joined the Congress party in the presence of Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy.

Winning him over

Mr. Malla Reddy and TRS leader from Malkajgiri Marri Rajashekar Reddy went to the residence of Mr. Dayakar Reddy and are said to have convinced him to come back. The grievance of the dissident was that the Minister was trying to promote a new entrant J. Venkat Reddy.

Mr. Rama Rao individually spoke to several of TRS leaders, including Jaipal Yadav, Kasireddy Narayan Reddy, Rohith Reddy, Jupally Krishna Rao, Redya Naik, Koneru Konappa, Diwakar Rao, Gadari Kishore, Kranthi Kiran, B. Mallaiah Yadav and also ministers T. Srinivas Yadav and Niranjan Reddy.

Some legislators gave details of how the rival groups were trying to sabotage the party.

While asking the MLAs to deal with the rebels, he also gave them directions on the campaign approach. He said local manifestos should be worked out taking into account local issues apart from reaching out to the beneficiaries of government schemes.

192,2020/01/11,Owaisi calls for stay on NPR in State,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday said that Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should take cue a from the Kerala government and put a stay on the implementation of the National Population Register.

Mr. Owaisi was addressing a public meeting in Narayanpet where he spoke at length about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, National Register of Citizens and described the CAA as a ‘black law’ and ‘anti-poor’.

“The NPR will begin in April 2020. This is why we have met the Chief Minister, and strongly demanded that like the Kerala government, your (TRS) government should also put a stay on it. This is against the poor. Akbaruddin Owaisi sought information under the RTI (Act) about how many people have birth certificates in Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The government said that 28% don’t have it. If this is the case, then imagine what it is in Narayanpet,” Mr. Owaisi said.

The Member of Parliament from Hyderabad said that the CAA goes against the Constitution of India. He maintained that laws in India cannot be based on religion. “This is India. This is not a neighbouring country which does not have a Constitution which we have. No other country has a Constitution like ours,” Mr. Owaisi said.

Earlier in the day, Mr Owaisi responded to news reports which reportedly said that the CAA gives citizenship, and does not take it away. Taking to Twitter, Mr Owaisi said: “If a law confers citizenship on 6 groups but excludes only 1, then it’s a law to deny citizenship.

193,2020/01/11,Officials lauded for conduct of free and fair elections,"The Indian democracy and electoral system are most unique compared to several other countries across the world and the conduct of elections to local bodies was highly challenging, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said here on Saturday.

Speaking after presenting Telangana State Democracy Awards given by the State Election Commission (SEC), she said conducting local bodies elections in a transparent and unbiased manner was very challenging. Complimenting State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy for conducting free and fair elections to rural local bodies last year she said providing equal opportunities to all contestants by training over 2.5 lakh personnel was a huge task.

She recollected that she had her vote registered in South Chennai before coming here as the Governor but the polling used to be less than 50% always in spite of the area having many educated families. About 90% polling registered in the rural local bodies elections in Telangana was an indication of high awareness among people, she noted.

Ensuring free and fair elections by resolving problems was commendable in our system, in spite of the influence of political, money and muscle power in elections, the Governor said.

Creating awareness

Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Errabelli Dayakar Rao said general awards would come in recognition of hard work but the Democracy Awards were the result of encouragement to create awareness at different levels. Conducting polling for 12,750 gram panchayats, 539 mandal parishad and 32 zilla parishads without any remarks and not much of repolling was highly commendable, he stated.

Stating that the role of State Election Commission was challenging the Minister said the election officials would have to face criticism from political parties and contestants even for minute mistake as part of conducting free and fair polls.

‘All laws followed’

Mr. Nagi Reddy said they had followed and implemented all election laws in the local bodies elections and the awards were being given in tune with a decision of the standing council of the State Election Commissions. Maharashtra had presented the awards first and Telangana was second.

196,2020/01/11,Rising prices of essentials hits labourers in old Adilabad district,"The cotton harvest season has been comparatively good for the farm labourers too but, that advantage is being lost owing to inflation in former composite Adilabad district.

The rising price of commodities in rural markets has put poor people to increased hardships since the last few days. “My income from picking cotton is ₹ 180 today and the price of one kg of edible oil is about ₹ 100,” lamented Kore Laxmibai, leader of a group of labourers from Hasnapur in Utnoor mandal of Adilabad district, as she tried to give an insight into the disparity between her income and expenditure. “To purchase one kg of palm oil I will have to work for nearly 5 hours picking cotton,” she added.

Picking cotton is an almost an exclusive preserve of women labourers like Laxmibai and other women in her group in the interior Agency areas who get work for 20 days a month on an average starting December. Their individual average earnings add up to ₹ 3,600 per month as they are paid ₹ 6 for every kg of cotton picked. The average pickings come to 30 kg for each of the labourers during an 8 hour stint in the field but the corresponding earnings are not sufficient.

Inquiries revealed that the price of commodities in villages is higher, as the items are sold in smaller quantities, when compared to that in district and mandal headquarters where the sale is in larger quantities. The increase in price, however, is not proportionate to the increase in transportation charges but higher.

The retail price of palm oil is ₹ 80 per kg and that of refined groundnut oil is ₹ 120 per kg in the bigger markets. Lentils or dals like the pigeon pea or toor dal is priced between ₹ 85 and ₹ 90 a kg.

According to a grocer in Indervelli, the prices have seen an upswing during the last 10 days. For example, palm oil was priced at ₹ 60 to ₹ 70 a kg in December, he said.

“The government should protect us from inflation or enhance our wages as they do in the case of farmers,” demanded Shivange Sangeetha.

He was responding to comments of Home Minister Amit Shah that opposition was spreading falsehood on the legislation and that the Act was meant to give citizenship and not take it away.

Mr. Owaisi also said if a law provides citizenship to six groups but “excludes one,” then it is only meant to deny citizenship.

“If a law confers citizenship on 6 groups but excludes one, then its a law to deny citizenship, Shah sb may not like the Constitution, but he has to work within its limits. Citizenship on religious basis is antithetical to our Constitution & that’s reason enough to oppose it,” Mr. Owaisi tweeted.

202,2020/01/11,Filing of nominations in Karimnagar brisk,"There was a brisk pace of filing nominations by candidates for the ensuing elections to Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar on Friday.

The contestants of all political parties and independents formed serpentine queues to file nominations to contest the elections from various divisions of the town. On the first day, a total of 84 candidates had filed 93 nominations till 5 pm. However, 50-odd persons were still waiting to file their nominations as they had entered the MCK premises before the scheduled time. The contestants, who filed nominations, belonged to TRS, BJP, Congress, MIM, CPI and independents.

It may be recalled that the elections schedule for the MCK were delayed following some persons approaching the court over delimitation of divisions 3, 24 and 25. On Friday, the district election authorities issued election notification allowing filing the nominations till Sunday. The elections in Karimnagar would be held on January 24 and the counting of votes on January 27.

After the issuance of notification, Collector K Shashanka, Joint Collector GV Shyam Prasad Lal, and Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy inspected the arrangements for the filing of nominations. The MCK authorities opened separate counters for filing nominations for all the 60 divisions in the town.

A total of 120 candidates filed nominations from 12 municipal wards of Kothapalli municipality on the outskirts of Karimnagar town on Friday, the last date of filing of nominations.

202 in Gajwel

On the last day of nominations, a large number of aspirants filed their papers for the municipalities in Sangareddy. Officials were yet to provide the total number of nominations filed and they were busy sorting out papers.

According to sources, as many as 202 nominations were filed for Gajwel municipality with 111 nominations from TRS followed by 42 independents, 39 Indian National Congress and 10 BJP candidates. There are 20 wards in Gajwel municipality.

At Sadashivapet, as many as 280 nominations were filed with 87 from Congress followed by 82 from TRS, 55 independents, 39 from BJP, eight from CPI(M), three CPI, five MIM and one TJS.

Though officially not declared, parties were projecting prospective chairman candidates, where they feel advantage. For instance, Congress MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy already announced that his wife and District Congress Committee president Nirmala Jayaprakash Reddy would be the mayor if Congress came to power.

Similarly, former chairperson B. Vjiayalakshmi is also contesting.

Sources confirmed that B. Murali Yadav would be chairman at Narsapur in the case of the party getting majority. Here the Congress become almost handicapped with shifting loyalty of former minister V. Sunitha Laksma Reddy to TRS. It was alleged that she had not allowed the second rung leadership to grow in the party.

Meanwhile, Collector M Hanumantha Rao informed that those whose nominations were rejected at Ameenpur, Bollaram and Tellapur municipalities could appeal at Ameenpur mandal revenue office followed by Sangareddy, Sadashivapet and Andol at Sangareddy revenue divisional office and for Narayankahed at local RDO office.

Many TRS aspirants

In the undivided Adilabad district, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) emerged most popular with councillor aspirants in all municipalities as nominations closed on Friday. Every ward had at least two aspirants filing nomination on TRS ticket. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also had aspirants making a beeline for party nomination. Among them were a good number who had lost hope of getting TRS ticket. The Congress looked like a beleaguered outfit, especially in Adilabad municipality, where it found it difficult to get good candidates from many wards.

There was a huge rush of aspirants wanting to file nomination at the designated centres and the correct number of nominations would be announced later. Authorities said nominations of all those who were in queue at the closing time would be accepted.

Till now, no party had declared the name of a candidate for the post of chairperson for any of the 11 municipalities in the undivided district where elections would be held on January 22.

More women voters

In undivided Khammam, all the five poll-bound Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have more women registered voters than men.

There are around little over 1.63 lakh registered voters eligible to exercise their franchise in the January 22 election in five municipalities – Sattupalli, Wyra, Madhira, Kothagudem and Yellandu, sources said.

Of these, around 84,944 are women, 78,787 are men and 14 belong to the third gender.

Kothagudem municipality and Madhira municipality in Khammam district are all set to have women heads.

The posts of chairpersons of the two key ULBs have been reserved for “Women (General)” and “SC women” respectively.

Although the post of the mayor of the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) has been allotted for Women (General), the election to the civic body would be held next year as the KMC’s elected council still has more than one-year term.

Long wait

In Nizamabad, filing of nominations for the Municipal Corporation of Nizamabad and six municipal councils concluded peacefully on Friday. The contesting candidates spent hours together in queues to get no-dues certificate from civic bodies to enclose with nomination papers.

204,2020/01/11,"Policeman, two Hizb militants held in Kashmir","Three, including a police officer and two Hizbul Mujahideen militants, were caught at a police checkpoint in south Kashmir’s Kulgam on Saturday. The police followed up the arrests with raids in the Valley where at least two rifles and ammunition were recovered.

A police official said a DSP-rank officer and two Hizb militants, including cop-turned-militant commander Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu, and his close associate Asif were spotted in a car near Wanpoh on the Srinagar-Jammu highway in Kulgam district in the afternoon. They were held during a random checking of vehicles on the highway.

“As far as my knowledge is concerned, nothing of this sort has happened,” SSP, Kulgam, Gurinderpal Singh said.

However, police sources said grenades were recovered from the car which was heading towards Jammu. Later, several rifles were recovered in raids carried out in Srinagar and south Kashmir. The police officer’s residence was also searched.

The arrest of Babu, who is Hizb’s second major commander after Riyaz Naikoo in Kashmir, is a “major breakthrough” for the police. According to the police records, Babu launched a major campaign against fruit traders to stop export of apples outside the Valley post August 5 and was behind the killing of 11 truck divers, non-local labourers and apple traders in south Kashmir.

A resident of Shopian’s Nazneenpora, he joined the J&K police in 2012 as a constable. He decamped with four rifles from the guard room of the FCI facility in Budgam’s Chandpora and joined the Hizb in 2017.

205,2020/01/11,War of words over Assam eviction,"Over a month after an eviction drive, officials in Sonitpur district of Assam have been accused of having selectively targeted 426 Muslim families at the behest of the local BJP MLA.

But the officials have said these families had encroached upon government land, had their petitions rejected by the Gauhati High Court twice and were in the way of a four-lane highway project. Furthermore, they said, the process of eviction, carried out on December 5 and 6, had begun in 2018.

On December 27, the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) said in a statement that the people of the Sootea Assembly constituency “have been let down” by their BJP MLA Padma Hazarika.

Nearly 1,800 people of the 426 families “were evicted mercilessly by the district administration, and their homes were demolished on December 6 at his behest”.

A JIH team, led by its national secretary Mohammad Ahmed, visited the evicted families who have been living in temporary sheds in the adjoining Tezpur constituency that Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) veteran Brindaban Goswami represents.

‘Communal colour’

Mr. Hazarika could not be contacted, but one of his loyalists said the MLA was being “unnecessarily dragged into a government drive against encroachers” that had been given a communal colour.

“A section is creating a controversy out of a non-issue.

The Chief Minister also urged the Centre to take measures to protect the indigenous people of the northeast, including Assam.

Much of Meghalaya is under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution where only the indigenous people enjoy land rights. Parts of State capital Shillong and some plains area of Garo Hills are, However, exempt from the provisions of the Schedule.

“We are thankful that the Government of India has exempted States like Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh and to a large extent Meghalaya but we demand full exemption be accorded to Meghalaya and measures for exemption of Assam as well,” Mr. Sangma said at the 15th annual general conference of the Council of Nokmas (chieftains) at Jengjal in West Garo Hills.

Stands firm

Reminding the gathering of the resolution passed in the Meghalaya Assembly for implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in the State, Mr. Sangma said, “We are very firm in our demand and would continue to engage with the Centre unless and until complete exemption and protection is provided to our people.”

Mr. Sangma said most of the northeastern States have been provided with measures for protection but Assam has been facing challenges from the CAA.

207,2020/01/11,Assam’s Rongali Bihu artists decry order on cheque payments,"Assam’s Goods and Services Tax authority has asked the Bihu committees across Assam to make all transactions, including payments to artistes, through cheques. If complied with, the artistes would have to pay 18% GST.

Rongali Bihu is a major source of income for singers, musicians, comedians, actors and everyone else associated with the entertainment industry in Assam. Bihutolis, temporary stages, are set up for cultural programmes that start mid-April and end with Bogahi Bidai (Farewell Spring) more than a month later.

Officials said this is not the first time that the Bihu committees have been asked to avoid paying artistes, bands, instrument players and technicians in cash.

“They have been asked to pay in cheques or transfer professional fees digitally on earlier occasions too. There is no reason why the artistes should avoid paying tax by opting for cash,” a government spokesperson said.

But the artistes are not amused.

“This is not a case of one singer or star making a lot of money. Bihu is the only festival that ensures a decent income for artistes, who have to sustain 20-25 families of musicians, technicians and helpers. It will be quite taxing for us if a big amount is deducted as GST after the cheques are deposited in the banks,” singer Bipin Chaodang, representing a group of artistes, told the media on January 11.

The Bihu committees insisted that functions organised during the springtime festival should be GST-exempt.

“The government can collect GST from professional artistes performing at major events but the traditional Bihu stages should be spared, more so as they provide space for folk artistes,” said Kailas Sarma, adviser to one of the oldest Bihu committees in Guwahati.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gl9shq/article30544014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RONGALIBIHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-gst-authority-wants-bihu-committee-artistes-paid-in-cheques/article30544015.ece
208,2020/01/11,Modi arrives in Kolkata amidst protests against CAA,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the city on Saturday evening on a two-day visit amidst protests against the contentious CAA and “Go back” slogans.

Mr. Modi on his arrival was greeted at the NSC Bose International Airport by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, city Mayor and state Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and other senior BJP leaders.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not present at the airport.

The PM’s visit comes at a time when West Bengal has been witnessing widespread protests against the contentious Act.

Hundreds of protesters holding black flags demonstrated outside Kolkata airport gate number one crossing.

The police had put up a barricade to prevent them from crossing over to the airport side.

From the airport he took a chopper to the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) and from there left for the Raj Bhavan.

As his convoy emerged outside the sprawling RCTC, protesters stood at the AJC Bose Road flyover flank and waved national flags and black flags and shouted slogans against CAA.

During his visit, Mr. Modi held a one-on-one meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday evening.

The meeting assumes significance as the new citizenship law has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the state. Ms. Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress is opposing the contentious legislation tooth and nail and the BJP is pressing for its implementation.

SFI activists assembled near Jadavpur University, Golpark, College Street, Hatibagan and Esplanade areas of the city with placards which read ‘Students Against Fascism.’ They burnt effigies of PM Modi and union home minister Amit Shah protesting against the “divisive Act“.

The Left Front activists staged protests on Saturday against the new citizenship law in various parts of North 24 Parganas district.

The prime minister will dedicate to the nation four refurbished heritage buildings in Kolkata — the Old Currency Building, the Belvedere House, the Metcalfe House and the Victoria Memorial Hall.

The Culture Ministry has renovated these iconic buildings and put up new exhibits, while curating the old galleries.

Mr. Modi will also participate in the sesquicentenary celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust on Saturday and Sunday.

The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister will share the dais at programme at Netaji Indoor Stadium. West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar will also be present.

Mr. Modi is likely to spend the night at Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission, on Saturday night.

The West Bengal administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the visit.

Heavy deployment of police personnel was made in different crucial points of the city namely Dharmatala, College Street, Golpark, Hatibagan, Jadavpur, Central Avenue owing to planned protests by several organisations affiliated to the Congress and Left Front parties against the CAA and the proposed countrywide National Register of Citizens.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/h8fx0g/article30543871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi-Kolkata-Visit,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/modi-arrives-in-kolkata-amidst-protests-against-caa/article30543818.ece
209,2020/01/11,Mamata Banerjee requests Narendra Modi to repeal Citizenship Amendment Act,"Following her brief meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday evening, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she had requested him to revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Ms. Banerjee met Mr. Modi at the Raj Bhavan close to the city’s central Esplanade area.

Mr. Modi will dedicate to the nation four refurbished heritage buildings of the city — the Old Currency Building, the Belvedere House, the Metcalfe House and the Victoria Memorial Hall.

“I have requested the Prime Minister to re-think about CAA and NRC. I would like to see those withdrawn,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists after the meeting. There was a nationwide movement going on against the CAA, the NRC and the NPR (National Population Register) and “any discrimination among people is not wanted.”

Till the time of going to press, Mr. Modi has not commented about his meeting with the Chief Minister.

Soon after her meeting with Mr. Modi, Ms. Banerjee was on the dais set up by the students’ wing of the Trinamool Congress (TMCP), opposite the Raj Bhavan, for an anti-CAA protest. Addressing the protesters, Ms. Banerjee said she would continue to oppose the “discriminatory” law.

“We do not accept the notification on CAA which has come yesterday. We do not accept NRC, NPR also,” the Chief Minister said.

Ms. Banerjee’s meeting with the Prime Minister and followed immediately by her address to the anti-CAA protest raised eyebrows among activists and civil society members.

“This is unthinkable that the Chief Minister decided to meet him (Mr. Modi) at Raj Bhavan, given that she has opposed CAA all along. Then within minutes of the meeting she came out to give slogan against CAA, NRC,” said Moushumi Bhowmik, an eminent musician and activist.

The thousands of activists who had gathered at the Esplanade crossing echoed the unease. “It is very unfortunate,” said Aditi Majumdar, a writer. Communist Party of India’s (CPI-M) Politburo member Md. Salim accused Ms Banerjee of “maintaining a double standard” by orchestrating “a drama.”

Earlier in the day, TMC’s general secretary, Subrata Bakshi told The Hindu that there is “nothing wrong in meeting the Prime Minister.”

“Why is it a problem? Can’t the Chief Minister meet the Prime Minister?” asked Mr Bakshi.

The protesters, who were not affiliated to any political party, however, were not happy with the explanation. At the Esplanade, slogans against both Mr. Modi and Ms. Banerjee were raised. “Didi-Modi, shame! shame!” was one of the repeated slogans along with “Narendra Modi, go back.”

The protesters armed mainly with black flags and balloons were prevented from gathering at the Red Road, which Mr. Modi took from the Race Course helipad, to reach the Raj Bhawan. The Raj Bhawan itself was cordoned off from completely and Section 144 was imposed in the area.

However, while the western side of Red Road was cut off, which houses Raj Bhawan, Section 144 was not imposed on the eastern part and the protesters carried on with their sloganeering.

Realising that the students and independent activists were upset, Ms Banerjee explained that she made a “courtesy call” to the Prime Minister.

“I visited the President too, so I met the Prime Minister while Firhad Hakim is the Minister-in-waiting on behalf of the State. I requested the Prime Minister to look into our [GST] quota of about ₹38,000 crore. He said he will look into it,” Ms. Banerjee.

The protesters meanwhile said they would stay put at the Esplanade which is not too far from the venue of Mr. Modi’s Sunday’s programme at the Netaji Indoor Stadium.

210,2020/01/11,National Conference appeals for early release political leaders in J-K,"The National Conference on Saturday appealed for early release of all political leaders, detained in August last year, for resumption of political activities in the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

Rejecting reports appearing in a section of the media, the NC said it was not working on any deal with the Centre to secure release of its leadership.

Terming the reports “baseless”, the NC said in a statement that both its patron Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah as well as other detained leaders of the party would never leave Kashmir.

“The party would like to place on record that no such deal has been offered nor would any deal ever be acceptable,” the statement said

It said that there was no question of any of the party’s leaders “going into exile or leaving the country“.

“All those detained in the first week of August 2019 should be released unconditionally and allowed to resume normal activities,” the statement said.

The Abdullahs were among a host of politicians detained on August 5 last year when the Centre announced abrogation of the state’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and its bifurcation into union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

211,2020/01/11,"For 91 meritorious backward community women candidates in M.P., a long wait for govt. jobs","Whenever neighbours jeered Huma Akhtar, 28, on her persistent pursuit for studies, she retorted: “It is the only sure way to get a job.” She didn’t stop at securing the third rank in the university in M.Sc. mathematics but aced the State Eligibility Test, grabbed SRF scholarship, and is in the last leg of a Ph.D. Yet her faith in academics seems to be wavering.

Clearing a government examination with a State rank of 58 would be enough to land the dream job of assistant professor, she thought, but the excruciating delay in the appointment of 91 candidates — meritorious women from backward communities — is slowly killing dreams, including hers.

“Was it our fault that we studied well and secured top ranks?” she asks. Left with just another year of ₹35,000 a month as scholarship, Ms. Akhtar, an OBC, supports a family of four in Bhopal — father who left work three years ago, an ageing mother, sister engaged in making bridal mehendi and a brother continuously switching jobs.

The 91 women — 70 from the OBCs, 18 from the SCs and three from the STs — who performed so well that they were adjusted in the unreserved category as per convention, faced the unprecedented wrath of unselected general category candidates who moved the court claiming infringement of rights. Initially, the High Court ordered a stay on the adjustment, but a month later directed the State government to restore them to original categories and allow them to pick colleges of their choice, thereby beginning the process.

The first rankers in geography and English and 11 candidates in the top 15 across the categories and genders come from the meritorious lot. “I gave up an opportunity at the Defence Research and Development Organisation in New Delhi just to prepare for the exam,” says Sanskriti Damade, from Bhopal. She secured the second rank in psychology, is a university topper, cleared the National Eligibility Test and is pursuing Ph.D. “Yet, those behind us in the merit list have joined work and we’re left on the streets to protest.”

Meanwhile, 2,600 other candidates, selected through the examination conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission (MPPSC) two years ago, joined duty on December 6. “Is this natural justice?” asks Kirti Patel, from Barwani district, who secured 52nd rank in law. “Capable women, that too from backward communities, are being held back from rising in society.”

In October, the court had directed the State government and the MPPSC to extend the date of filling choice by seven days, after candidates were restored to their original categories.

“Their seats have been blocked and no appointments have been made on them. The government is cautious about the legality of the matter,” Higher Education Commissioner D.P. Ahuja told The Hindu. Yet, he clarified, “Candidates were given the leverage of only choice filling according to the direction. Their appointment shall be kept in abeyance until a final clarification or order is issued by the court.”

At the next hearing on Monday, the State government would inform the court in case of no objection, it was ready to appoint the women. “The petitioners in the case are general category women seeking reservation in the unreserved category,” he said.

They were in the merit anyway, in the unreserved category or the reserved one, he said. “In case they are restored to their original categories, 91 at the bottom of the merit will be moved to the waiting list,” said Mr. Ahuja.

Furthermore, she said, the other candidates appointed in 2019 would have an edge in increments.

“At least for 10-15 years, seniority will depend on marks and not experience,” clarified Mr. Ahuja.

The government had exhorted guest faculty members, demanding regularisation through backdoor entry, to seek it through the examination, for which they enjoy age relaxation and extra 20 marks for a maximum of five years of experience. More than half of the 91 women have been guest faculty members.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/twvmpp/article30543441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-11-at-112943-AM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/for-91-meritorious-backward-community-women-candidates-in-mp-a-long-wait-for-govt-jobs/article30543442.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi have expressed condolences to the families of those who died in the accident.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced an ex gratia of ₹2 lakh to the next of the kin of the deceased and ₹50,000 to the injured. He has also sought a report from the district magistrate about the incident.

There were 45 passengers, including three staff, in the bus that was going to Jaipur from Farrukhabad when the accident occurred on the Grand Trunk Road near Chhibramau on Friday night, the police had said.

Charred bodies of 10 people have been recovered from the completely-damaged bus, District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said, adding one of the bodies has been identified as Rinku Yadav (32), the driver of the truck which collided with the bus.

IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal said both the bus and the truck caught fire after the collision and exact death toll can be established only after DNA tests.

Soon after the incident, the locals rushed to the spot and rescued many passengers by breaking the window panes. The injured were undergoing treatment at the Tirwa Medical college hospital and the district hospital, the IG said.

SP Amrendra Pratap Singh had said that around 20 people were feared to have lost their lives in the incident.

State police chief O.P. Singh had said a diesel tank apparently exploded under the impact of the collision and the bus burst into flames.

It took three to four fire engines about 30 to 40 minutes to douse the flames.

A passenger of the bus undergoing treatment at the Saushaiyya hospital in Chhibramau claimed that the bus had around 60 passengers at the time of the accident.

At the Tirwa medical college hospital the injured are still in a state of shock.

One of the passengers undergoing treatment at the hospital said that after the collision she lost consciousness and was not aware as to who brought her and others to hospital. Another passenger said they were dragged out of the burning bus.

A report from Farrukhabad stated that five members of a family from Kamalganj, who had boarded the bus are missing.

State’s Excise Minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri, who rushed to the district on the direction of the Chief Minister, met senior officials and also inspected the accident site. He met the injured undergoing treatment and handed over ₹50,000 cheque to each of the nine injured admitted in Saushaiya hospital.

216,2020/01/11,Punjab police bust narco-terror module,"The Punjab police on Friday seized two highly sophisticated Chinese-made drones, and arrested an Army Naik and two smugglers, allegedly a part of a narco-terror module, involved in smuggling of weapons and narcotics across the Indo-Pakistan border.

Punjab’s Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta told a press conference that the seizure also included drone batteries, custom-made drone containers, two walkie talkie sets, ₹6.22 lakh in cash, believed to be proceeds of drugs, and the magazine of an INSAS rifle.

“The drones, capable of travelling 2-3 km on either side of the border, were reportedly being launched from the Indian side to fly into Pakistan to pick up payloads of narcotics. They had apparently already conducted 4-5 sorties,” he said.

Punjab had recently seen drone activity along the border, which first came to light in August 2019.

Mr. Gupta said this was the first instance to show that drones were being used to smuggle narcotics, even though no drugs had been recovered. According to the DGP, the module members had revealed that they were involved in cross-border smuggling of drugs and weapons through drones over the past few months.

“Certain Pakistan-based drug smugglers who were sending the drugs and weapons from across the border in Pakistan had also come to notice,” he added.

Mr. Gupta said the three arrested persons had been identified as Dharminder Singh of Dhanoa Khurd village in Amritsar; Rahul Chauhan of Pooja Vihar at Ambala Cantt., in Haryana and Balkar Singh of Sarai Amanat Khan in Amritsar (Rural).

“While Dharminder was arrested from a place in village Hardo Rattan, about 3 km from the Indo-Pakistan border, Balkar had been lodged in Amritsar jail in an NDPS case and was brought on production warrant on Thursday. Rahul Chauhan, a Naik of the Armed Forces, was reportedly involved in procuring and supplying drones and training to cross-border smugglers,” he said.

Two members of the narco-terror module were still absconding and efforts were on to nab them, said the DGP, adding that further investigations were under way to ascertain details about the accused’s ties with terrorist outfits, radicals, drug smugglers and other anti-national elements.

Mr. Gupta said preliminary investigations had confirmed that Rahul Chauhan was directly involved in operating drone sorties across the border for picking up heroin as well as weapons from Pakistan, along with his associates in India and Pakistan. He and his accomplices were in direct contact with Pakistani smugglers on encrypted OTT platforms, said the DGP, adding that the plan was to send one of the walkie talkie sets across the border to Pakistan to facilitate two-way communication.

“The first drone, a Chinese-made DJI INSPIRE 2 drone (quadcopter) was recovered from an abandoned government dispensary building in Modhe village in Amritsar (Rural), where it had been hidden by Dharminder Singh and his associate drug smugglers. The second drone, a Chinese-made DJI MATRICE 600 PRO (hexacopter), was recovered from a house in Karan Vihar, Sector-6, Karnal (Haryana) on the disclosures of Rahul Chauhan. The house belongs to a friend of Rahul Chauhan,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-police-bust-narco-terror-module/article30538283.ece
217,2020/01/11,Akhil Gogoi remanded in custody,"A special court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday remanded activist Akhil Gogoi in judicial custody for 14 days.

The police arrested him at Jorhat in eastern Assam soon after the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December. He was handed over to the NIA after a case was registered in Guwahati for his alleged links with the Communist Party of India (Maoist).

Mr. Gogoi was produced before the court after 10 days in NIA custody during which the agency searched his house at Nijarapar in Guwahati and the office of his organisation, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, at Gandhibasti. Officials said books on Marxism and Mao Zedong were among several “incriminating documents” found during the searches.

The NIA booked him under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, including those relating to sedition and intention to cause riots.

While being taken out of the court, Mr. Gogoi said: “The protest against the dangerous CAA should continue.

218,2020/01/11,Nindar farmers suspend agitation,"Farmers of Nindar suspended their agitation on Friday to demand a fair compensation for their land bought for a housing project. The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has assured them of a solution.

The JDA has acquired 1,350 ‘bighas’ of land at Nindar, near the city, in several phases since 2010 for a plush housing project, though the owners refused compensation pegged at the 2010 rates. They alleged that the JDA’s survey was faulty, and the compensation was below the market rate.

The Nindar Bachao Yuva Kisan Sangharsh Samiti has launched the ‘Zameen Samadhi Satyagraha’, under which the protesters dug pits and trenches and buried themselves chest-deep. It has demanded that the government give compensation as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, which came into force on January 1, 2014. “Applying the 2010 District Lease Committee rates in 2020 is unfair,” Samiti convener Nagendra Singh Shekhawat said.

Mahesh Joshi, the government chief whip in the Assembly, visited the site of agitation on Friday and assured the farmers of “sympathetic consideration” of their demand. Mr. Shekhawat said the Satyagraha site would be protected during negotiations with the ,JDA, and the agitation would be revived if a satisfactory solution was not offered.

The farmers first resorted to this unique form of protest in 2017 when the JDA started getting possession of the land. The agitation generated immense public sympathy and forced the then BJP government to hold talks with the farmers.

The JDA has taken possession of 600 ‘bighas’ so far and deposited ₹60 crore in court for compensation after the villagers refused to accept the sum. It has also offered to allot the plots of developed land to the farmers in lieu of the land they have surrendered.

The JDA’s project at Nindar has been touted as its biggest scheme with 6,000 houses and residential plots. It has been insisting on possession of the entire 1,350 ‘bighas’, including 150 ‘bighas’ of mandir mafi land (exempted for temples), where houses have been built and the villagers live.

Land acquisition in the State is governed by a policy framed in April 2016 under the 2014 Act. Its emphasis is on negotiations with landowners and reaching consensus on compensation and rehabilitation based on the existing market value.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jvklu0/article30538174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nindarfarmers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nindar-farmers-suspend-agitation/article30538151.ece
219,2020/01/11,Former Bihar minister seeks tax-free status for ‘Chhapaak’,"Former Bihar culture minister Shiv Chandra Ram on Friday urged the Nitish Kumar government to make tax-free the Deepika Padukone-starrer ‘Chhapaak’ across the state, saying the movie raised the socially relevant issue of acid attack survivors.

The RJD leader, who had served in Kumar’s cabinet until the JD(U) chief returned to the NDA in July 2017 also lamented the government’s “indifference” towards culture and sports and claimed that several initiatives taken by him to promote these did not see the light of day.

“Deepika Padukone is one of our leading actresses and she deserves a salute for having the guts to play a de-glamorised role, based on a real life incident. Acid attacks have been a social menace and the movie sends a very important message,” he said,

“The government must follow the examples of states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and the film should be made tax-free in Bihar,” Mr. Ram told reporters.

He disapproved of the clamour, mainly on social media, to boycott the movie following Padukone’s recent visit to the JNU campus, where she stood in solidarity with students protesting the violence there.

Those who are having problems with the movie have their own peculiar mindset. I have nothing to say about them. But even if one acknowledges their right to believe in a particular political ideology, how does a socially relevant movie come in their way? “The government must not shy away from making it tax-free and support a good cause, Mr. Ram said.

Notably, the BJP is an alliance partner of Mr. Kumar’s JD(U). The Bihar government has granted tax exemptions to a number of movies, the most recent being Hrithik Roshan-starrer Super 30, which hit the screens last year and was based on the life of Mathematics teacher Anand Kumar.

A few years ago, when Mr. Kumar was out of the NDA and had given up the chief minister’s chair for a few months, upon his insistence the government headed by Jitan Ram Manjhi had extended a similar incentive to Amir Khan’s PK .

Mr. Ram also expressed dismay over the state lacking a policy on promoting films and sports.

“I had taken many steps in this direction while I held the portfolio. But this government seems to be totally indifferent,” he said.

Meanwhile, former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav — who has floated his own outfit Jan Adhikar Party, warned trouble makers at theatres.

I ask the administration to make fool-proof security arrangements at all cinema halls where Chhapaak is being shown. And if the government is found lacking in reining in mischievous elements, they should remember that our students’ wing is out in the open to deal with them, Mr. Yadav, who is known for his strong-arm style of politics, said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xxpibc/article30537268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chhapaak,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/former-bihar-minister-seeks-tax-free-status-for-chhapaak/article30537794.ece

221,2020/01/11,BJP’s minority cell members in M.P. consider quitting en masse,"Members of the BJP’s minority cell in Madhya Pradesh have invited party workers to a meeting on Saturday to decide whether they should quit en masse over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“Whenever there is something wrong, you should speak up,” said Javed Baig, the cell’s media in-charge. “The party has ignored us and the community has threatened boycott for supporting it. Where should we go now?”

Stating that the call was to members of all faiths, he said, “We had joined the party of leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But it has lost its way. We have spent our blood and sweat for it.”

Ahead of the party’s door-to-door awareness campaign - Jagrukta Mission - on the law, the party didn’t invite minority members to meetings, Mr. Baig alleged. “They have already considered us out. How do they expect people to listen if we are not involved?”

Moreover, he said, comments of BJP leaders against Muslims were hurting sentiments. “No one within the party is ready to talk to us.”

On the other hand, community leaders were asking them why they still stood by a party which didn’t respect them and their faith. “They have told us if we don’t stand by them now, they’ll boycott us from the community,” he said. “After all, they are the ones who take part in our functions and funerals.”

224,2020/01/11,West Bengal tops in 2018 acid attack cases: NCRB,"While there has been a marginal decline in the incidents of acid attacks in the country in 2018 compared to the previous year, West Bengal accounted for the highest number of cases of such attacks, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NRCB) report released earlier this week.

In 2018, 228 incidents of acid attacks were recorded across the country against 240 victims. Of these, West Bengal recorded 50 incidents involving 53 victims.

In 2017, 244 acid attacks were recorded across the country and Bengal came second on the list with 54 incidents of acid attacks, while Uttar Pradesh recorded 56 incidents. Women were the victims in 131 of the 228 attacks accounting for more than 57 % of the cases.

Of these, again Bengal recorded the maximum number of 36 cases followed by Uttar Pradesh with 32 cases.

“An analysis of NCRB report for the past five years reveals that West Bengal has recorded highest number of acid attacks most of the times followed by Uttar Pradesh. The reason [for the high number of attacks] has been same for the past five years [which is] lack of monitoring of the sale of acid on the part of police and security agencies,” Dibyaloke Rai Chaudhuri, coordinator- headquarters, Acid Survivors & Women Welfare Foundation, told The Hindu.

More women

Mr. Rai Chaudhuri said NCRB data over the past few years points out that two out of every three acid attack victims are women.

“The common perception is that acid attack are mainly targeted towards women, but in some cases enmity and dispute results in acid attacks on men as well,” he said.

The NCRB report shows that West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi contribute to almost half of acid attacks in the country. In 2018, the three States — Bengal (50) U.P. (40) and Delhi (11) — accounted to 101 of the 228 incidents accounting to 44 % of all cases. In 2017 the three States Bengal (54), U.P. (56) and Delhi (14) accounted for 124 of the 244 cases or 50 % of all attacks.

Acid attacks are registered under Section 326 A of the Indian Penal Code, with a minimum punishment of 10 years imprisonment. Activists like Mr. Rai Chaudhuri said other than a specific penal section there are clear orders by Supreme Court on restricting sale of acid and compensation of victims who suffer the “worst kind of violence”.

Compared to 2017 the number of people convicted for acid attacks in 2018 was higher at 28. In 2017, 20 persons (all males) were convicted whereas in 2018 the number was 28 — 23 males and five females.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vrj0dh/article30537253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REV-Acidcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-tops-in-2018-acid-attack-cases-ncrb/article30537254.ece
225,2020/01/11,Sulking Congress minister takes charge,"Five days after being unreachable, and amid rumours about his displeasure over the portfolios allocated to him, senior Congress minister Vijay Wadettiwar took charge of his departments on Friday saying he has no complaints.

To pacify him, he will now also be given charge of the Relief and Rehabilitation Department, which was allocated earlier to the Congress but later given to a Sena minister.

Mr. Wadettiwar was assigned the OBC, SEBC, VJNT Welfare Department and other smaller departments, and was said to be unhappy with the portfolios. He had neither taken charge of the departments nor had he attended the one-day special Assembly session.

State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat visited Delhi on Thursday night and informed the party leadership about the crisis, following which Mr Wadettiwar was asked to take charge with one extra department handed over to him.

The Minister said, “I was never upset with my party. I was absent in the Assembly session because I had family commitments. I had informed Thoratji about it.”

In the previous Assembly, Mr. Wadettiwar was chosen as the Leader of Opposition in the last term after erstwhile LoP Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil quit the Congress to join Bharatiya Janata Party.

226,2020/01/11,Pune’s Shia community stages protest against U.S. drone strike,"The city’s Shia community, along with other minority community outfits and political organisations, staged an anti-U.S. demonstration on Friday, protesting the death of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq on January 3.

The demonstration, condemning the killing of the 62-year-old head of Iran’s Quds Force, was also backed by the Bhim Army. While a rally was scheduled, it was cancelled owing to the Pune Police denying organisers permission.

“Our request for a rally was turned down by the Bund Garden police on grounds of law and order. The police said that Section 144 of the CrPC was in force,” said Anjum Inamdar, founder of the Mulnivasi Muslim Manch. The protest was instead held on the premises of Imambara, a century-old Shia shrine in Pune Cantonment.

‘Unlawful assassination’

Hundreds of demonstrators, including minority community members and Shia clerics, carried placards condemning the “unlawful and cowardly assassination of Gen. Soleimani by the Trump administration”. Shouts of ‘Long Live Qasem Soleimani’ rent the air, along with slogans denouncing the U.S.

“The Shia and Sunni communities stand united in the protest against Soleimani’s unlawful murder by the American administration of President Donald Trump. The protest saw the participation of local Iranians in Pune, the Shia community and people from different religious faiths and communities who collectively expressed their sorrow at Maj. Gen. Soleimani’s death,” Mr. Inamdar said.

Claiming that Soleimani had helped India on a number of occasions, Yusuf Baig, president of the Shia Brothers of Pune, said the commander had led an attack on Daesh/IS militants in Tikrit in Iraq and had helped free 40 Indian nurses held captive by the terrorists.

“Furthermore, he had raised his voice against Kulbhushan Jadhav’s indictment on espionage and illegal confinement in Pakistan. Today, not only Iran, Iraq and Syria, but the western world ought to be indebted to Gen.

227,2020/01/11,Programme at Raj Bhavan by sacked office-bearers irks govt.,"An invitation printed by the Punjabi Sahitya Academy (PSA) for a Gurbani recitation at Raj Bhavan has upset the State Minority Development Department, which has removed all office-bearers of the academy.

Department secretary Shyam Tagde has written to Raj Bhavan officials, saying the academy has not sought government permission for the January 20 programme.

The letter, which said the event has not been organised by the PSA, comes after office-bearers of the organisation refused to acknowledge the new government’s decision to remove them from their positions, to which they were appointed by the previous government.

According to the invitation, Rajan Khanna, executive chairman, PSA, the State government has organised the programme at Raj Bhavan.

Minority Development minister Nawab Malik, when asked about the letter, said, “[Mr. Khanna] has been removed from the position by the department. How can he conduct the event at the Raj Bhavan and call it a government programme? When this came to our notice, we informed Raj Bhavan about it.”

He said they were left with no option but to send the letter. “The government has cancelled all the appointments made by the previous government to all academies, including Urdu, Hindi, Sindhi and Gujarati. There will be fresh appointments. Therefore, we thought it was important to inform Raj Bhavan,” he said.

The PSA was set up by the previous government in October 2018.

Mr. Khanna said he has not received any communication regarding his removal from the academy. “We have all the permissions from the previous government and former minority development minister. The programme was fixed a long time ago. Whether it is a government programme or not, we will go ahead with it,” he told The Hindu.

He said Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari will also attend the event.

Sources in the Raj Bhavan said they will have to check whether they have received any communication from the department.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/programme-at-raj-bhavan-by-sacked-office-bearers-irks-govt/article30538423.ece
228,2020/01/11,"No tree will be cut for Thackeray memorial, says CM","Not a single tree will be felled at the site of the proposed memorial to Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray in Aurangabad, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday.

Speaking on the concluding day of his tour of Marathwada, Mr. Thackeray said, “Let me make it clear that not a single tree will be cut in the [in the 17-acre Priyadarshini garden] where the memorial is to come up. This park has a variety of important tree species like eucalyptus … Instead, we shall be planting more trees like jambul and magnolia to enrich the biodiversity of this place,” said the CM, who visited the garden and surveyed the site of the memorial and its plans.

Last month, the garden became a hotbed of controversy after Amruta Fadnavis, the wife of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, tweeted about media reports that the memorial would necessitate the felling of 1,000-odd trees.

Priyadarshini garden, located in the heart of the city’s CIDCO area, is a popular ‘green zone’ for residents and home to several species of birds and rare insects. This habitat consists of more than 8,700 trees.

Ms. Fadnavis’s tweet triggered protests by local residents and environmental organisations, who vociferously opposed any tree-felling action and accused the Sena of “doublespeak” on environment.

The Sena had vehemently opposed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s decision to remove trees at Mumbai’s Aarey colony to make way for a Metro car shed. One of the first decisions Mr. Thackeray took on becoming Chief Minister was to halt work on the Metro car shed at Aarey.

Hence, the Sena, which controls the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, was accused of hypocrisy after reports of felling trees for the Thackeray memorial surfaced. This had prompted Sena leaders in the city, including former MP Chandrakant Khaire and Nandkumar Ghodele, to issue hasty assurances that Mr. Thackeray had instructed them that not a single tree was to be cut.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/zic139/article30538396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bmuddhav,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-tree-will-be-cut-for-thackeray-memorial-says-cm/article30538397.ece
229,2020/01/11,Several feared dead as bus collides with truck in Kannauj,"Around 20 people were feared killed after a bus collided with a truck and caught fire in Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh late on Friday, said police.

Twenty-one passengers escaped from the bus, and were rushed to hospital, District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said.

Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation Managing Director Raj Shekhar said the vehicle was a private bus. “I have spoken to the District Magistrate, and he is on the spot. I have also asked the ARM to reach the spot and give correct information about the incident,” he said.

Ten to 12 among the injured 21 jumped from the burning bus to save their lives, Kannauj Superintendent of Police Amrendra Prasad singh said, adding the exact number of casualties will be known only later. There were around 45 passengers in the bus which was on its way to Jaipur from Farrukhabad at the time of incident, police said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has rushed his ministerial colleague Ram Naresh Agnihotri to the spot and sought a report from the DM Kannauj about the incident. The Chief Minister announced an ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh to the next of kin of those who lost their lives and ₹50,000 to the injured. It is a very unfortunate incident, the CM said, extending his condolences to the bereaved families.

Kanpur’s range Inspector General of Police Mohit Agarwal said efforts are on to contact family members of the victims. The blaze has been controlled and rescue operations are on, Agarwal said.

Uttar Pradesh police chief O.P. Singh in Lucknow said it appears that the diesel tank exploded under the impact of collision and the bus burst into flames.

230,2020/01/11,Don’t mind the spines,"We’ve been having a ‘thorny’ affair with the cactus for a couple of years now. First there were prints (everything from wallpapers to bedding), and, more recently, an upswing in demand for the real deal, with the prickly pear popping up on office desks and vertical gardens. 2020 promises to take this forward — from the launch of Desserto, a luxury cactus leather that fashion designers are excited about, to the all-new favourite, cactus water (made from the pink flower). Closer to home, the spiky perennial is finding form as sculptures and bar cabinets. Here are 10 ways to bring the desert vibe home.

Scarlet Splendour | Oasis Cabinet

Sleek and utilitarian, the Oasis Cabinet, by Dutch designer Richard Hutten, is a highly-visual piece, which the Kolkata-based brand says stands apart “in the vast desert of mundane design”. The 193-centimetre tall, cactus-shaped bar comes studded with 200 brass spikes. The surprises, however, don’t end there. Inside, the designer, known for his conceptual and playful designs, has also created tiny metal balconies and secret shelves to pique your interest constantly. ₹18,50,000, on scarletsplendour.com

Filicudi Marcantonio | Cactus Chair

You might hesitate to sit on this one, but we assure you this prickly pear doesn’t hurt. Inspired by Filicudi island — in the Aeolian archipelago of southern Italy — and its cactus-covered hills, this iconic armchair by Italian designer Marcantonio Raimondi Malerba, for furniture brand Qeeboo, recreates the magic of the Mediterranean in daily spaces. For both indoor and outdoor use, the chair with its brass legs is available in black, white, balsam green and bright green. Pre-order for approximately ₹47,450, on store.qeeboo.com.

Paul Smith | Miniature Gufram Cactus

In 2016, Paul Smith updated Italian furniture brand Gufram’s surrealist 1972 cactus coat stand with “hallucinogenic” stripes of pinks, blues and black. Now, the British designer has shrunk the sculptural piece that melded the influences of pop art, illusionism and naturalism. The 11 centimetre miniature Cactus is identical to the full-scale design, down to the 2,165 dimples across its stem and arms. Approximately ₹15,050, on paulsmith.com.

The House of Things | Joshua Tree Vase

Go stark, with this vase handcrafted from black nickel plate and natural bronze. American designer Michael Aram,who calls India his home, shares that he was inspired by the dramatic cacti and otherworldly landscapes he’d come across, on a recent trip to the Joshua Tree National Park in California. The 15.75 inch vase also incorporates the “sculptural interplay between the landscape and buildings” — but we like it for its minimalist appeal. ₹22,550, on thehouseofthings.com.

Baleri Tatone | Canapé Cactus Sofa

Look at those spines! Fashion and product designer, Maurizio Galante, gives us a larger-than-life cactus with this sofa. Using a photographic print of one of his clicks, he gives it a 3-D effect by printing it on bi-elastic textile. The flexible polyurethane is also reinforced with an internal steel support to offer comfortable seating while maintaining its shape. There’s a pouf, too, if you’d like to take the desert theme further. ₹44,790, on artemest.com.

Matteo Cibic | Domsai Hardy & Laurel

This Italian is not unfamiliar to India. He’s designed sculptural pieces for Scarlet Splendour and, most recently, a collection of 24 handmade carpets for Jaipur Rugs (showcased at the Salone del Mobile in Milan, in April). When he isn’t collaborating, the trans-media designer is constantly creating, his designs underlined by playful zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms. Like the Domsai collection of desk terrariums (for your cactus and succulents), with shapes calling to mind the famous Hollywood comic duo to playful pets. From approximately ₹9,900 (25 cm) to ₹3,64,340 (170 cm), on matteocibicstudio.com.

Alex Davis Studio | The Cactus

Designer, sculptor and artist, Delhi-based Alex Davis is mostly known for his expertise in metal. Often taking his inspiration from nature — his sculptures reimagine everything from puddles to water lilies — the cactus is a recurring motif. This set of four steel cacti combines laser-cutting and skilled craftsmanship. Polished to impart a “mercurial glow”, the installation will create an interesting highlight in your room. ₹32,040. Details: alexdavisstudio.com

Seletti | Cactus Lamps

Seletti brought the desert indoors last year, with these cartoon-like potted cactus lamps. Part of its Blow collection, in collaboration with Italian designer Marcantonio Raimondi Malerba (who explores the relationship between man and nature in his designs), the mouth-blown glass line was launched at Maison & Objet in Paris, in March. In three different shapes and sizes, complete with spines and topped by flowers, group them together to create an exotic garden in your living spaces. From ₹13,555 (small) onwards, on do-shop.com.

Lladró | Opuntia Cactus Diffuser

Part of the Cactus Fragrans Collection, this diffuser, handmade in Spain by the brand’s artisans, is shaped like the spiky Opuntia cactus in bloom. Combining a porcelain element — in the glossy finish of the cactus and the 26-petal flower — its base is made of absorbent ceramic to best diffuse the scent. Pick it up with the Night Approaches essential oil, a “floral perfume enriched with bamboo, blackcurrant, jasmine, and fine woods”. ₹14,675, it is available across all Lladró outlets in India.

Lalique | Cactus Round Table

This one’s a classic. Originally designed in 1951 by French visual artist, Marc Lalique, the table was created to display an aquarium setting, with crystal fish ‘swimming’ between the eight leaves of the giant translucent cactus. Now, brought back in shades of green, amber and black-and-white, the crystal table fits perfectly into contemporary interiors. Interestingly, it takes eight to 10 weeks to handcraft each of the legs, with over 18 kg of crystal.

231,2020/01/11,Art Street beckons onlookers to pause and reflect,"As part of Coimbatore Vizha, ‘Art Street’ was inaugurated on Race Course Scheme Road on Saturday with over 100 artists from across the State participating this year.

K. Periaiah, Inspector-General of Police (West Zone), inaugurated the third edition of Art Street. Thousands of artworks along with attractive exhibits adorned the entire stretch of the Scheme Road.

One of the exhibits, four tower-like structures with coloured acrylic glasses, was the cynosure of all eyes. According to Ashik Jaffer-Ali, one of the organisers, the towers, named ‘Beacons of Resonance’, are based on the theme ‘Of Reflections and Transition’. “As Coimbatore is in a phase of transition of becoming a Smart City, we as citizens tend to lose bearing of familiarity. These towers with their colourful reflections might help people to pause and reflect about the past and future of Coimbatore city,” she said.

Apart from artworks, events such as art workshops, food stalls and music performances were arranged. “We wanted to attract as many people as possible,” said S. Shrikumaravelu, one of the organisers. Art Street was conceived to offer more than regular art exhibition where artists exhibit their works for sale, enabling more people to support them, he said.

With both experienced and amateur artists participating, Ms. Jaffer-Ali said that no particular theme or topic was given for the artworks. “Having topics would limit the creativity of artists,” she said.

S. Sangeetha, a college graduate from Salem, exhibited 10 of her charcoal sketches of animals and portraits with intricate detailing. “I learnt charcoal sketching through YouTube,” she said, adding that shenever took any formal lessons.

R. Aaruthra from Tiruppur, who is in her final year of college, exhibited her hand-drawn calenders made with seed papers (handmade papers containing plant seeds).

Some of the experienced artists at Art Street include N. Bhagavathi Sundaram from Sivakasi, who has been a professional artist for 30 years and specialises in ballpoint pen sketches. V. Raju from Chennai, who specialises in sand art, said that he hopes to make some connections through this event to exhibit his works overseas.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/1zxbj5/article30546016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12ARTSTREET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/art-street-beckons-onlookers-to-pause-and-reflect/article30546017.ece

After the afternoon prayers, members of the Jama-ath formed a human chain on Oppanakkara Street, held national flag and placards to protest against the Act.

Jama-ath president A. Shahnawaz and trustee M.K. Aboo Sali led the protest that saw the participation of 1,000 people.

Karthik were also present. Mr. Jawahirullah said it was wrong to see the Act in isolation. It should be seen along with the NPR and NRC exercise. The Centre’s objective behind the Act and two exercises was to make Muslims a refugee in this country.

Mr. Natarajan said that after launching an assault on Muslims, the Centre had targeted Anglo Indians by removing the reservation for two seats in Lok Sabha. He also decried the Coimbatore City Police for not allowing his party, the CPI(M), to protest against the CAA and restricting the Muslims’ protest to the south of the city.

The petition filed by J. Dhanalakshmi said the FoP office-bearer assured her of arranging a 2,490-sq.ft. plot with an initial payment of ₹ 10,000 for agreement and monthly instalments of ₹ 2,500. The woman claimed that she paid ₹ 1.35 lakh from 2013. She said the realtor contacted her in November 2018 and said that the site he initially assured to give was yet to get due approvals and hence another site would be arranged after paying an additional sum of ₹ 3 lakh.

The woman claimed that she got a bank loan and paid ₹ 2.75 lakh as cheque and ₹ 25,000 in cash.

However, the realtor failed to arrange registration of the title deed, following which the woman and her husband enquired about the realtor’s office and the plot.

The woman alleged that she could not find the office in the address given in the receipt she had received for paying instalments. She alleged that she visited the place where the realtor assured her of arranging alternative site and found that it was already sold.

Her husband R. Jagadeeswaran alleged that an employee of the realtor threatened them when they questioned him about the alleged cheating. He added that the realtor also threatened them, claiming that he knew police officers of higher ranks including the Director General of Police, Tamil Nadu.

237,2020/01/11,Tiruppur police to have beat system,"As part of their efforts toward community policing, Tiruppur City Police are set to roll out a dedicated beat system to maximise their reach among the public.

Commissioner of Police Sanjay Kumar said the beat system would be officially launched by next week, although the preparatory works had been under way since November 2019.

Under the system, the city would be divided into 22 beats, with two police constables working in shifts for each beat.

“The constables must have at least 200 contacts in their phones from the respective beats,” Mr. Kumar said. The constables were advised to build these contacts from the public residing within the beat and form a dedicated WhatsApp group.

“Through this, whatever message we send will reach at least 4,400 people,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

Even at the preparatory stage, the response had been positive, with the public offering tip-offs (particularly in ganja cases) and even suggestions through the group, he said.

“This will be the backbone of policing system,” Mr. Kumar said, with the public functioning as the extended hands of the police.

On the crime incidents in 2019, Mr. Kumar said that out of 27 murder cases registered in Tiruppur city, 26 were solved and the accused were remanded in judicial custody.

The number of property theft cases decreased by 17% in 2019 in comparison to the previous year, with 252 out of 277 cases being solved and property worth ₹ 1,51,84,870 being recovered and handed over to the complainants, he said.

The Tiruppur police seized 118 kg of ganja and 2,322 kg of banned tobacco products in 2019.

Mr. Kumar said there was a decrease of 9% in the reporting of crime against women in comparison with 2018, with convictions in four cases at the Tiruppur Mahila Court. A total of 21 accused arrested for various crimes were detained under Goondas Act in the city last year, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/encjhw/article30538110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11cbakil,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tiruppur-police-to-have-beat-system/article30538111.ece

The new marketing initiative of the State Government helps weaver societies reach out to customers directly.

The bus travelled to Tiruchi, Palani and Chennai before arriving at Coimbatore. Its next destination is Pollachi.

According to G. Shankareshwari, Managing Director of Chenkumar Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative Produce and Sale Society, Chennimalai, the State Government sanctioned ₹32 lakh as grant for the project.

239,2020/01/11,Its food and festivity at Taste of Coimbatore,"Three evenings of music, shopping, and delicious food is what Taste of Coimbatore offers this year.

Inaugurated on Friday evening, the three-day food festival organised by the Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association has 130 stalls. Well-known brands, home-made food servers, and some of the new food outlets have set counters at the festival, held near Codissia as part of Coimbatore Vizha.

Spread over 4.5 acre, with two entry points and lot of vehicle parking area, the food festival took off with youngsters and children from three orphanages, invited by the organisers, walking in from 5 p.m.

Many of the stalls offer food at nearly 30 % lesser price compared to the price at their restaurants. “The idea is to help more people taste more food at the festival,” said D. Srinivasan, president of the Association.

There are vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, chaats, fast food, ice creams and more. “This is a plastic-free zone and food safety officials will check the kitchens regularly on all the three days,” Mr. Srinivasan said.

Hotels and restaurants in the city had come together on a common platform. The stalls promoted their brands in different ways. It was their choice, said Jegan Damodarasamy, executive committee member of the Association.

Chithirai Selvan, a Class X student and inmate of one of the orphanages, came to the food festival last year and has come this year too. He preferred to have a plate of chicken biryani. Jeeva, a Class IX student, also from the same orphanage decided to start with an ice cream.

Mohamed Asan, director of Courtallam Border Rahmath Kadai, said he had set up stall at Taste of Coimbatore for the second year.

The event gave improvement in visibility to the brand, which had two outlets in the city.

The food festival will be open from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Traditional dances and music concerts will be organised in the evening.

Anuradha Sriram will perform on Saturday and on the last day, it will be Diwakar and team.

240,2020/01/11,Residents oppose Corpn.’s compost centre,"Residents of G.V. Residency and a few other localities staged a protest in the area on Friday opposing the Coimbatore Corporation’s move to construct a micro composting centre (MCC).

Led by DMK urban district in-charge and Singanallur MLA N. Karthik, the residents raised slogans opposing the construction of the MCC.

Mr. Karthik said the Corporation, in executing its decentralised approach to solid waste management, was trying to build MCCs in places frequented by the public, parks, grounds and reserved sites. In G.V. Residency, it had encroached upon a public place to construct the MCC. This was against the law as it was the Corporation’s duty to protect such public places, he said.

The MCC would affect the residents of Thanthai Periyar Nagar, Dhanalakshmi Nagar, Indira Nagar, Bharathipuram and Masakalipalayam, said M.Sivakumaran, a resident and DMK member.

G.V. Residency resident N. Sathish alleged that the Corporation had misled the residents as it did not disclose that the construction under way was for an MCC. After constructing the MCC, the civic body had proposed to process wet, organic waste from nearly 10 wards. The odour and flies from the MCC would affect the residents.

To convince the residents, the Corporation had suggested that they visited the MCC in Kavundampalayam, Mr. Sathish said and added that even after the visit, the residents were not convinced of the project.

241,2020/01/11,20% cardholders get Pongal gift,"Nearly twenty per cent of the 9.70 lakh eligible public distribution system (ration) cardholders have thus far received the State Government’s Pongal gift.

As of Thursday evening, the administration had distributed the gift to 1.84 eligible cardholders, said A. Palanisamy, Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Coimbatore. Only those cardholders, who were eligible for rice (rice card), were eligible for the gift.

The government had announced distribution of a kg of raw rice, equal quantity of sugar, 20 gm cashew nuts, like quantity of dried grapes, five gm cardamom, sugarcane stump measuring two feet and ₹ 1,000 to each of the eligible cardholders.

The cost of the gift for each cardholder worked out to ₹ 1,135 and for the district, ₹ 112 crore. The administration distributed the gift through 1,401 fair price shops, run by various departments or groups.

It had instructed the shop managers to distribute the gift to not fewer than 250 cardholders a day so that they completed the task by January 12. And, for the cardholders who could not get the gift by January 12, the managers would disburse the gift the next day, Mr. Palanisamy added.

243,2020/01/11,Council conducts training programmes for tyre mechanics,"The Rubber Skill Development Council will train 10 lakh people in four years, including tyre mechanics and workers in rubber plantations and rubber product producing companies, to re-skill existing employees and bring in new skilled workers to the sector.

The training started in 2018 and this year about two lakh candidates will be trained, said Vinod Simon, chairman of the Council.

The Council has launched mobile training facilities to re-skill the tyre mechanics who are employed or have their own service centres. As many as 33 vehicles in nearly 12 States visit different parts of the State to train the tyre mechanics. In Tamil Nadu, one vehicle has been introduced for the Salem-Nammakal belt and one more will be brought in soon. “We want to have at least two vehicles for each State,” he said.

According to a data available with the Union Government, 12 % to 13 % of the road accidents are due to tyre-related issues. So, it is important to train the tyre mechanics.

Many of them work in rural and semi-urban areas and on Highways. The vans travel to the interior parts of the districts identified and conduct three-day courses. One day is for theory sessions, one for practical training and the third day for assessment.

The Council has prepared the standards and curriculum and a partner has been roped in to conduct the tests. Certificates are issued to the candidates after the re-skilling programme. “This builds their confidence and enables them to get higher income too. Some of them start their own service centres after the course,” he said. For every batch, 30 to 50 candidates are trained in the mobile unit.

The training programme is funded by the Union Government. The Council has 30 to 40 training partners and conducts sessions for the trainers so that there is uniformity in the programme.

“This is a re-skilling programme. We do training for new candidates also. It is for a longer period,” Mr. Simon added.

The Council and the Rubber Board train workers in the rubber plantations in the North-East and Kerala. In the case of rubber product producing companies, the trainers go to the shop floors of the companies, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/council-conducts-training-programmes-for-tyre-mechanics/article30538039.ece

250,2020/01/11,India Selectors have their task cut out for New Zealand series,"Hardik Pandya is likely to return to India’s squad after a four-month injury hiatus as the national selection panel, headed by M.S.K. Prasad, will announce on Sunday the squad for the five T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests to be played in New Zealand from January 24.

The allrounder, having recovered from a back surgery, is in New Zealand, along with the India-A squad for a shadow tour. Pandya is part of the India-A limited-over squad for the series that concludes on January 26.

However, if he proves his fitness in the two warm-up games for India-A, on January 17 and 19, he may be asked to join the India camp for the series-opener.

Pandya’s inclusion will not hamper Shivam Dube’s chances in the T20 squad, since the Mumbai allrounder has fared reasonably in his limited opportunities. Pandya is thus set to replace one of the four spinners who were part of the squad for India’s series against Sri Lanka, which concluded on Friday.

Besides Pandya, white-ball vice-captain Rohit Sharma will also be welcomed back into the fold after being rested for the Sri Lanka T20Is. It will be interesting to see if Sanju Samson loses out on the plane or the selectors announce a 16-member squad with an eye on the T20 World Cup in October-November.

Saha-Pant conundrum

The two-Test series, starting on February 21, will be a part of the World Test Championship. It has to be seen if the selectors retain both the wicketkeepers — Wriddhiman Saha and Rishabh Pant. Saha, who had recovered from multiple injuries, was preferred over Pant for the five-Test home stretch.

Even though Saha justified the faith shown in him, some in the selection panel and team management feel that Pant needs to be persisted with away from home with his more-than-handy batting. Prasad and Co. will have its task cut out in finalising the combination.

Besides, the selectors will also have a hard time in picking the back-up opener to Rohit and Mayank Agarwal’s settled combination. K.L. Rahul, having scored heavily across formats, is the front-runner, pipping the likes of Shubman Gill, Priyank Panchal, Abhimanyu Easwaran and Prithvi Shaw.

While the top four pacers select themselves, it is far from given that all the three spinners in India’s squad for the series against Bangladesh — R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav — will board the flight to New Zealand, with the selectors being tempted to draft in an additional pacer.

Jadhav in doubt for ODIs

As for the ODI series sandwiched between the T20Is and the Tests, the selectors will have to decide whether to stick with Kedar Jadhav.

With the Maharashtra batsman unlikely to last till the 2023 World Cup, the selectors may decide to look beyond him and try out either Ajinkya Rahane or Suryakumar Yadav, instead.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fwpq8g/article30545613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12HARDIK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-selectors-have-their-task-cut-out-for-new-zealand-series/article30545614.ece
251,2020/01/11,"Ranji Trophy | Mumbai batsmen step up, finally","After two successive defeats, Mumbai needed its batsmen to step up. Shams Mulani (87) and skipper Aditya Tare (69 batting) did just that, their fighting knocks rescuing the team from a precarious 129 for five against Tamil Nadu on day one of their Group B Ranji Trophy match at the M.A. Chidambaram stadium here on Saturday.

The duo added 155 for the sixth wicket, helping Mumbai gain a slight edge as it finished the day on 284 for six.

Missed opportunity

While the visitors will be happy with the way they fought back, the hosts will rue letting the opponent off the hook.

After Mumbai elected to bat, opener Jay Bista went after the TN pacers in his quickfire knock of 41 off just 48 balls with eight boundaries, including three in an over off K. Vignesh.

TN got its spinners in as early as the 10th over, and Sai Kishore delivered, taking the first three wickets. He bowled Bista and trapped Bhupen Lalwani with deliveries that spun into the right-handers.

Sai Kishore then had Siddhesh Lad with a ball that spun away as skipper B. Aparajith took a brilliant diving catch at first slip.

Double strike

Ashwin then struck twice in quick succession in the second session, sending back Hardik Tamore and Sarfaraz Khan, both caught at backward point.

However, Mulani and Tare capitalised on some ordinary bowling from the TN attack thereafter, scoring freely without taking any risks.

The duo never missed an opportunity to hit boundaries, with Mulani showing his wide repertoire of shots — from some crisp cover drives, cuts or pulls, to one that sailed for a six off Vignesh's bowling.

The left-handed Mulani made use of the reprieve he got on 22, when Indrajith dropped a sharp chance at first slip off Aparajith.

At the other end, Tare, who has had a torrid run so far, finally managed to find form as he looked in full control against Ashwin and Sai Kishore. He played some deft sweeps and cuts while making his first half-century of the season.

In the last two sessions, the TN bowlers looked flat and created no real chances until Ashwin struck in the final over of the day with a delivery that spun sharply, forcing Mulani to edge to slip. It was the second new ball that did the trick for TN, which will be keen to mop up Mumbai’s tail on Sunday.

The scores:

Mumbai — 1st innings: Jay Bista b Sai Kishore 41, Bhupen Lalwani lbw b Sai Kishore 21, Hardik Tamore c Indrajith b Ashwin 21, Siddhesh Lad c Aparajith b Sai Kishore 0, Sarfaraz Khan c Indrajith b Ashwin 36, Shams Mulani c Aparajith b Ashwin 87, Aditya Tare (batting) 69; Extras (nb-7, w-2): 9; Total (for six wickets in 89.4 overs): 284.

252,2020/01/11,Thought positive intent was the way to go: Mulani,"Despite his team struggling at 129 for five, the 22-year-old Shams Mulani showed maturity and composure beyond age.

Along with skipper Aditya Tare, he batted exceedingly well to put Mumbai in a comfortable position against Tamil Nadu after the first day on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Mulani said: “I had a positive mindset going into the innings. I was going to hit the deliveries which were in my area and that was my plan all along. I had confidence in my defence.

“I had a chat with Sarfaraz in the middle. We both thought positive intent was the way to go because you can’t keep defending and wait for bad balls.”

With some quality batsmen still to come, Mulani felt a total of 350 will be competitive on a wicket that will deteriorate and turn more as the match goes on.

After having Mumbai five down for not much, the Tamil Nadu bowlers let the game drift away and left-arm spinner R. Sai Kishore, who claimed three wickets, admitted the team should have done better.

“We could have bowled a lot more tighter with patience and discipline which we didn’t do and let the game drift away. In the second session, I could have bowled a bit better.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/thought-positive-intent-was-the-way-to-go-mulani/article30544999.ece
253,2020/01/11,Gavaskar questions Dhoni’s long break from game,"Sunil Gavaskar on January 11, 2020 questioned M S Dhoni’s sabbatical from the game since the World Cup semifinal loss in July, asking “does anybody keep himself away from playing for India for that long?”

Dhoni’s future has been a subject of intense speculation since India’s World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand on July 9. The 38-year-old has not played since that heartbreaking defeat but is likely to make a comeback with the IPL.

Asked if Dhoni can make India’s T20 World Cup squad, Gavaskar said, “Fitness is something that I can’t tell you anything at all. The question that needs to be asked is of MSD himself. He has not made himself available to play for India since 10th of July (9th actually).

“That is the important question. Does anybody keep himself away from playing for India for that long? That is the question and therein lies the answer,” said the former India captain after delivering the 26th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial lecture.

In a recent interview, head coach Ravi Shastri said Dhoni may soon end his ODI career but could be in contention for a T20 World Cup berth provided he is in good form.

Gavaskar also said that Ranji Trophy will remain a “poor cousin” of the cash-rich IPL until the player’s match fee in the country’s premier first-class tournament is substantially increased.

A player now gets approximately ₹2.5 lakh per match in the Ranji Trophy, a far cry from the meagre salary the cricketers would withdraw not long ago, but still the amount is no match to the millions the IPL stars earn.

“IPL dominates Ranji Trophy. Unless their match fees are increased substantially, it will be considered an orphan and poor cousin of Indian cricket,” Gavaskar said.

“I think 26 percent of the BCCI revenue goes to the the players, out of which 13 percent goes to the international players, 10 percent goes to domestic cricket, 1.5 to junior, 1.5 to women’s cricket. That has not really been increased over the past few years barring the Test cricketers.”

Gavaskar said there is too much disparity between the earnings of a first-class cricketer and an IPL recruit.

“I am hoping new president Sourav Ganguly will look into this. The disparity that you see between IPL players, who don’t always play first class cricket, and those who play all the domestic games, about 80 days and somebody who plays 14 days of IPL.

“There is big disparity. I am talking about the uncapped players. Hopefully that will be narrowed down as much as possible.”

On ICC’s proposal to trim Test cricket to four days from five, he added: “What I think doesn’t matter. It is what the current players think that matters. They should be consulted before BCCI takes a call.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ddcajj/article30544986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gavaskar-questions-dhonis-long-break-from-game/article30544987.ece
254,2020/01/11,Question marks over the No. 3 slot in Indian team,"A 78-run mauling of Sri Lanka on Friday night saw India’s longest home season of T20Is — with 12 matches, including two abandonments, in four series over the last three and a half months — coming to an end.

As the Men in Blue switch gears into the T20 World Cup preparation, despite India hardly being stretched at home, one cannot help but wonder whether the No. 3 slot in T20Is has emerged as the equivalent of No. 4 in ODIs prior to the 2019 World Cup.

Despite trying out around a dozen options between the ODI World Cups, India still struggled to find a reliable No. 4 at the mega-event. It was one of the decisive factors in the team’s stunning semifinal exit in England last July. The connoisseurs would be hoping the same story is not repeated ahead of the T20 World Cup, to be played in Australia in October-November.

Vaired results

In each of the last six completed T20Is, India has used a different batsman at No. 3. K.L. Rahul (52 off 35 balls, vs Bangladesh in Nagpur), Virat Kohli (94 n.o. off 50, vs West Indies in Hyderabad), Shivam Dube (54 off 30, vs West Indies in Thiruvananthapuram), Rishabh Pant (0 off 2, vs West Indies in Mumbai), Shreyas Iyer (34 off 26, vs Sri Lanka in Indore) and Sanju Samson (6 off 2, vs Sri Lanka in Pune) have all been tried out in the key slot with varied degrees of returns.

No doubt that the ploy is with an eye on trying out different combinations and individuals ahead of the marquee event and with its best XI on the park, India doesn’t really need to look beyond either captain Kohli or Rahul for the No. 3 slot. Perhaps that’s why opener Shikhar Dhawan isn’t concerned about the constant tinkering of the crucial spot.

“I’m sure that the management wants to try players. Today also we wanted to try other players who haven’t batted in the series and give them a fair chance because we’re only left with five T20 games (in New Zealand) and as a team we wanted to give chance to everyone and that’s why they’ve been rotating players. (Hopefully) Till the World Cup comes, everyone is refined and know their job as well,” Dhawan said after marking his return from a knee injury with a sizzling fifty on Friday night.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/inkqhr/article30545674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/question-marks-over-the-no-3-slot-in-indian-team/article30544287.ece

While Rohit Sharma, who was rested for the T20 series against Sri Lanka, is assured of the position, Dhawan and K.L. Rahul have been staking a claim to be his partner with impressive performances.

Dhawan, however, chose to put the onus on the selectors and the team management to choose the best combination.

“All the three players are doing well. Rohit had an excellent 2019. Rahul has been doing good since one-two months and he is a good player. Even mai bhi picture mein aaya ga hu, maine bhi aaj acha kar diya hai (I have also entered the fray with a good show),” Dhawan said.

“Toh picture achihi ban rahi hai abhi (the race is heating up), khair yeh sardaredi meri nahi hai (but this is not my headache). So I don’t think about it, because that is not in my hands. It is in my hands to perform and play well and I am happy and satisfied that I got two opportunities and was able to express myself… baki coaches aur captain ke upar hai, toh unki sardadi mai kyun lu?

256,2020/01/11,Four-day Tests will increase injury risk for fast bowlers: Misbah,"The risk of injury to fast bowlers will increase if Tests are reduced to four days, warns Pakistan head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq, joining cricket greats who have voiced their opposition to ICC’s proposal to tweak the traditional format.

“A fast bowler now routinely has to bowl 17 to 18 overs in an innings but if the duration is four days then his workload will increase to 20 to 25 overs. That puts him at a greater injury risk and more importantly bowling more overs means it will take the zip out of his bowling,” Misbah said on a PCB podcast.

“People want to come and watch bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Naseem Shah, Cummins, Jasprit Bumrah bowl at full speed. If they have to bowl more overs to make up for increased overs it will mean they will lose pace.”

India skipper Virat Kohli, legendary Sachin Tendulkar and Australian greats Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh have all advised against tinkering with the traditional format.

Misbah noted that normally teams played with four specialist bowlers in a five-day Tests and four-day games will create more difficulties for the bowlers.

“Will we have 90 overs or 110 overs in a day and don’t forget in countries like Pakistan, India or Bangladesh the domestic season is in winter and normally even 90 overs are not possible in a day. So if overs are increased what will happen then?

“There is still a lot more clarity needed on how four-day Tests will be managed. But in my personal opinion the duration of Tests should not be tinkered with.”

Misbah insisted that five-day cricket is the beauty of Test cricket.

“This week the England and South Africa Test was decided in final session of fifth day and there were lot of thrills for the spectators and viewers. Test matches are decided normally on fifth day when there is more wear and tear on the pitches,” Misbah said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/zi2q7u/article30450194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MISBAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/four-day-tests-will-increase-injury-risk-for-fast-bowlers-misbah/article30543907.ece

“It is always a great series, Australia and India. It has become a tradition. I think it is going to be an outstanding series. Everyone is looking forward to it already. Look there is no doubt it (David and Steve) will make our team stronger.

“But there is no doubt that India right now is the best all-round cricket side team in the world, they will welcome that challenge. It will be a series that people will remember for a long time,” Waugh told PTI shortly after landing in India ahead of the three-match ODI series beginning on Tuesday.

During the course of the ODI series, a decision could be made on if India will play a day-night Test during the Australian summer.

The Kohli-led squad had shown reluctance to play with pink ball in the previous series but having finally made their Day-Night debut at home in November, it would be difficult to say no to a game under lights in Australia. Waugh feels Kohli should take up that challenge.

“It is a real challenge for teams to play day-night cricket in Australia. Someone like Virat Kohli will welcome and embrace it. If you are the best side in the world, you are expected to win against all opponents in all conditions. India probably needs to tick that box,” said the World Cup-winning skipper, who is also a Laureus Academy Member.

On the upcoming ODI series in India, Waugh feels the home team starts favourites despite Australia winning the five-match series 12 months ago.

“Both sides play tough cricket, two best teams in the world. Australia have got an exciting line-up. They have got some new players like Marnus Labuschagne who is the in-form batsman at the moment.”

The come-from-behind win in India last year had given Australia the much-needed momentum and confidence going into the World Cup, following a tough period which saw Smith, Warner and Cameron Bancroft getting banned for their role in the ball-tamper scandal in South Africa.

“After what happened in Cape Town (2018), the Australian team has recovered really well. I don’t think you ever have the edge in India but you are right they will take a lot confidence from the last series. It was a great victory and beginning of the rebuilding of the side.

“It was a significant series, they started believing that they could beat anyone from there. But India in India start favourites,” said the 54-year-old.

Waugh also believes that it is a matter of time before India win an ICC event, something they have not done since the 2013 Champions Trophy triumph.

“It is not easy to win big tournaments. And you take it for granted when you are doing it. I think it just shows how special it is but India are very capable.

“They will be up there, top contenders in any competition. India fans you need to stay patient. Only a matter of time before they win something big again.”

Is it a mental block that India keep losing in the knock-outs?

“It is not mental. It is just sport. Like I said it is not easy to win big tournaments. Australia had a great run in World Cups. We didn’t do this time but we have had an incredible run.”

On the intense debate over ICC’s proposal to trim Test matches to four days, Waugh said the governing body should leave the longest format as it is.

“I am a traditionalist. Five-day Test matches work fine for me. It tests your skills and capacity in the best way. If you win inside five days, you get a day off in what is a a pretty busy schedule.

“I think the players would not want the schedule to be compressed any more. Some of the best Test matches have been five day games so why change? It is the basic of cricket and what it is all about. Leave it as it is,” concluded Waugh.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wn008/article30542844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SMITH-WARNER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-australia-australia-vs-india-test-series-steve-waughs-thoughts-on-the-tour/article30542845.ece
258,2020/01/11,Tendulkar in contention for Laureus Sporting Moment of last two decades,"Batting legend Sachin Tendulkar has been shortlisted as one of the 20 contenders for the greatest Laureus Sporting Moment 2000-2020 Award.

The moment is titled Carried On the Shoulders Of A Nation, a reference to the Indian cricket team’s 2011 World Cup triumph.

In his sixth attempt at the World Cup nearly nine years ago, Tendulkar became a part of a victorious team.

Carried on the shoulders of the Indian team, Tendulkar made a lap of honour, shedding tears of joy after the victory was sealed in his home city Mumbai.

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh, who is a member of the Laureus Academy, described Tendulkar’s nomination as a fantastic moment for cricket.

“It is fantastic for our sport. It is very hard to get nominated for Laureus. It was a remarkable achievement (2011) and Indian cricket is doing fantastic,” Waugh told PTI.

“I remember when we won the Laureus Sports Team of the Year (2002). It was a great moment for Australian cricket.”

The foundation has launched the Laureus Sporting Moment 2000-2020 public vote, which gives fans opportunity to choose one of the winners of the prestigious Laureus World Sports Awards.

“Happy Birthday Jammy! The way you batted always created huge jams for the bowlers. Have a great one my friend,” Tendulkar tweeted.

The duo have scored more partnership runs and have been involved in more hundred run stands than any other batting pair — 6,920 runs with 20 century stands — both are world records.

Dravid, popularly known as ‘The Wall’, played 164 Tests, 334 ODIs and one T20I in an illustrious career which spanned for over 16 years. He holds the record for facing the maximum deliveries in Test cricket. He faced a total of 31,258 balls, almost 3,000 deliveries more than Tendulkar in Test cricket.

He has also spent 44,152 minutes at the crease in Tests which equals to almost 736 hours, the most by any Test cricketer.

Widely regarded for his batting prowess in the Test format where he scored 13,288 runs at a staggering average of 52.31 including 36 hundreds, Dravid was also an impeccable white-ball player as he accumulated 10,889 runs in 334 ODIs at an average of 39.16, including 12 centuries.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kh6uig/article30542576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DRAVID-TENDULKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/you-created-huge-jams-for-bowlers-tendulkar-tells-dravid/article30542578.ece
260,2020/01/11,"ICC T20I rankings: Rahul is top-ranked Indian batsman, Kohli moves up","India opener K L Rahul retained his sixth position while captain Virat Kohli moved up a place to ninth in the batting chart of the ICC T20I players rankings released on Saturday.

The ICC T20 rankings were updated after the conclusion of the three-match series between India and Sri Lanka, which Kohli’s men won 2-0.

Rahul, the highest-ranked India batsman, has gained 26 points and is now on 760 rating points, just six behind Australia’s Glenn Maxwell after scores of 45 and 54 in his two innings against Sri Lanka.

Kohli, top-ranked in Tests and ODIs, is in ninth position while left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan, too, has climbed a rung to be placed 15th.

Manish Pandey has also advanced four places and is ranked 70th.

The Indian fast bowlers have made notable gains in the first T20I update of the year and would be encouraged as they prepare for the ICC men’s T20 World Cup, to be held in Australia later this year.

Player of the Series Navdeep Saini has rocketed 146 places to 98th while Shardul Thakur has re-entered in 92nd position after both finished with five wickets apiece in the series. The fit-again Jaspreet Bumrah has gained eight places to reach 39th position.

For Sri Lanka, Dhananjaya de Silva has gained 72 places to reach 115th among batsmen after aggregating 74 runs, while spinner Lakshan Sandakan has moved up 10 places to reach 29th after grabbing three wickets in the series.

In the ICC Team Rankings, India have gained two points but remained static in fifth position with 260 points, while Sri Lanka have lost two points and now have 236, the same as Afghanistan.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/91jgil/article30542534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KLRAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-t20i-rankings-rahul-is-top-ranked-indian-batsman-kohli-moves-up/article30542535.ece
261,2020/01/11,"NZ tour: Hardik could be back for limited-overs leg, Gill or Rahul for 3rd opener in Tests","All-rounder Hardik Pandya could be the only notable inclusion in India’s limited-overs squads - which are unlikely to be significantly tinkered with - for the upcoming six-week tour of New Zealand.

Starting January 24, India will be playing five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Test matches, and squads for the tour will be picked on Sunday.

India will be playing eight white-ball games in New Zealand, and it will be interesting to see if the selectors pick a 16 or a 17-member squad, instead of 15.

With the India A team’s shadow tour coinciding with the seniors’ visit, it gives the selectors an option to draft players on SOS basis if the need arises.

The selectors will primarily focus on zeroing in on the core for white-ball cricket considering that this is a T20 World Cup year.

While the T20 squad that played against Sri Lanka in the just-concluded series all but picks itself, Pandya, who is already in New Zealand with the A team, is expected to be included once he proves his fitness in the first couple of List A games against New Zealand, apart from two warm-up one dayers.

With India A’s three List A games only ending on January 26, Hardik, returning from a back surgery, might be included by the time the January 29 third T20 International comes calling.

“About Hardik, it’s only about checking out if he is fully fit for international cricket or not. He is very integral to India’s World T20 plans,” a senior BCCI official, privy to selection matters, told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

It will be interesting to note if the ODI team is an extension of the T20 squad.

The Jadhav question

The weakest link in the ODI team is Kedar Jadhav, who has managed to hold onto his 50 over slot amid pressure to replace him.

In New Zealand, Jadhav’s technical frailties could be exposed and his lack of overs in recent times makes him a case for exclusion.

In case the Indian team looks for technical solidity, Ajinkya Rahane could make a comeback, but if the team management is thinking in terms of treating 50 over games as an extension of T20 series, Mumbai player Suryakumar Yadav’s explosive power hitting at No. 5 or 6 could be an option.

Both Suryakumar and Sanju Samson are in the A squad.

The Test squad wears a very settled look with the only contention being the third opener’s slot.

Picked as a reserve for the home series, the young Shubman Gill deserves to be the third opener, but KL Rahul’s current form and experience in Test cricket could also be considered.

The selectors will also deliberate on if a third spinner (Kuldeep Yadav) is needed for the two-match Test series instead of a fifth pacer (Navdeep Saini) to accompany Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma.

The rest automatically pick themselves in case there are no fitness issues.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wa4mmf/article30542408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PANDYAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nz-tour-hardik-could-be-back-for-limited-overs-leg-gill-or-rahul-for-3rd-opener-in-tests/article30542409.ece
262,2020/01/11,"IND vs SL T20I: Contributing with bat crucial for team, says Shardul Thakur","India seamer Shardul Thakur on Friday showed once again how potent he can be with the bat coming in at No. 8.

The 28-year-old smashed 22 off 8 balls and his late burst with Manish Pandey helped India recover from a middle order collapse and post 201/6 in the third T20I against Sri Lanka here. In reply, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 123, thus losing the match by 78 runs.

Thakur had earlier given a glimpse of his batting prowess with a match-winning 17 off 6 balls in the 3rd ODI against the West Indies last month which helped India chase down an imposing 316.

“I believe I have the ability with the bat and I have been practicing hard,” Thakur said in the post-match presentation ceremony on Friday after being named the Man of the Match.

“If I can contribute at number eight, it is always crucial for the team,” he said.

Thakur then put in a shift with the ball and in the field. He ended the match with figures of 2/19 and was part of India’s fine fielding effort which stifled Sri Lanka for runs.

“With regard to my action, I can bowl outswingers, so the focus was to swing the ball early,” said Thakur.

Though Thakur has been part of the India squad for quite some time, he is now getting selected in the playing XI on a more consistent basis. However, Thakur said he never felt left out at any point.

“I have spent quite some time in the team ever since I broke into the side in 2016.

263,2020/01/11,We dominated the series: Dhawan,"If the second T20I at Indore was a cakewalk for India, the final one saw Virat Kohli’s men demolish Sri Lanka with a clinical performance. Despite trying out 14 of the 15 members in the squad, India was never really stretched.

Shikhar Dhawan stressed that India dominated the series. “We obviously dominated the series, but there were challenges. I would say for me, it was to play well after coming back from an injury. I had to perform... so everyone had different challenges,” said Dhawan when asked whether India was tested at any point during the series.

“Some of the new players coming in, they had their own goals and challenges. The pressure to perform is always there in international cricket. I would say we still dominated the series and everyone overcame their own challenges.”

The series saw Dhawan, Navdeep Saini and Jasprit Bumrah prove their fitness and skill after returning from injuries while Sanju Samson and Manish Pandey got game-time on Friday.

Sri Lanka captain Lasith Malinga took full responsibility for the team’s loss.

Outplayed

“We were outplayed. I was the seniormost and main bowler and I had to perform, but I couldn’t pick a single wicket in the series. I take full responsibility,” said Malinga. “Overall, it’s a learning experience for the youngsters and, hopefully, they will keep improving in future.”

265,2020/01/11,Whatever is built must reinforce the character Lutyens imagined: Bimal Patel,"Last October, HCP Design, Planning And Management, an Ahmedabad-based private company, won the bid to design a new Parliament and redevelop the Central Vista. Extensive debates followed the announcements, but the absence of any reliable details in the public domain created confusion. Dr. Bimal Patel, Director, HCP, speaks here about the project and the ideas behind it.

What is the need to redevelop Central Vista?

There are multiple objectives. First, Parliament facilities need modernisation. Second, government services need to be consolidated and synergised by building a Central Secretariat. This was considered in the government’s previous term.

The offices of the Vice President and Prime Minister, and their residential facilities, need substantial improvement. Currently, the PM’s office is far away and a lot of disruption occurs due to his frequent movements. It needs to be housed near the Secretariat. The Central Vista itself is in disrepair. Landscape features, pavements, civic amenities, all require refurbishing.

There are two contradicting views about the redevelopment. One, that the space signifies colonial dominance and needs to be modified to reflect a resurgent India. Second, that the space represents excellent civic design; the buildings are historical landmarks and need to be preserved. What is your view?

There is no doubt that New Delhi, and Central Vista in particular, were built during the Raj, and meant to signify colonial power. However, after Independence Indians appropriated them and made them their own. In the minds of many Indians, Central Vista and the buildings around it are very much part of the nation-state. One must keep in mind that though the designers were British, Indian builders built most of it and the space testifies to their accomplishments too.

Is it true that the new design plans to demolish many heritage buildings?

That is not true. In the final proposal, none of the listed heritage buildings is demolished, unless some think a few office buildings are heritage structures.

The Vista’s importance lies in how the buildings hold the beautiful views, the long avenues, the axial path leading to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. There is concern that the new buildings will overpower these features?

The Vista indeed gets its significance from these landscape features. Our intention is to maintain all these aspects. Lutyens himself in the original proposal planned for structures along the Vista. In that sense, what we propose is not anything new. The point is, whatever is built must strengthen the essential features and reinforce the character that Lutyens imagined. We are doing that.

What about the existing guidelines meant to preserve Lutyens’ Delhi?

In spirit, we are following what the guidelines are advising.

At a time when offices and work can be easily networked, what’s the need to bring all government offices into one place?

The view that the Internet would disperse people and activities has been there since the 1970s. Many people thought there would be no need to agglomerate and cities would be dispersed. This has been proved wrong over and over again. Face-to-face contact appears to be crucial in getting things done. Hence the need for a Central Secretariat.

Won’t this increase traffic problems, create security issues, with compound walls that mar the appearance?

Two Metro lines that pass through this place provide an excellent opportunity to bring the Central Secretariat here. There will be a seamless connection between the Metro stations and proposed buildings through a people-mover as you see in airports abroad. This will encourage people to use public transport. We are also carrying out transport studies, and if they point out any issues, we will undertake measures to mitigate them. Nothing is to be walled that is not presently walled. In fact, a few walled places will be opened up.

What about the environmental impact?

Dust can be taken care of by constant humidification, noise can be limited by barriers. And construction workers will mostly be housed in sites at a distance but connected by Metro. It will avoid adding a new population of workers to the area. This does not mean there will be no impact, but we will put in place all measures to mitigate the effects.

You have proposed a triangular-shaped Parliament. Did you intend to contrast the circular shape of the existing one with a unique shape? Is a triangle functionally efficient?

When we worked out the function arrangements, there were three key spaces: the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and the common foyer. The trinity of functions immediately suggested a triangular arrangement. The new building and the existing one should sit comfortably next to each other and work as one ensemble, with the former housing new facilities.

Your design proposes a spire over Parliament. Does it have any symbolism?

No. The spire doesn't have a specific symbolic meaning. But in a vibrant democracy such as India’s, Parliament can be thought of as a ‘sacred’ building. Therefore, the spires may be seen as a reference to the spires of temples and churches.

What will be the architectural style?

The Central Vista works as an icon since it is seen as one ensemble. We will do nothing to disrupt this. Naturally, we will use stones similar to the existing buildings. In office buildings with courtyards, the exteriors will have stone while hi-tech façades with steel and glass will open into the inner courtyards.

Central Vista is an accessible public open space attracting lots of people. Will the new design reduce the public area or the access to public areas?

The public space will expand. When we convert North and South Blocks into museums, we will add 20 acres to public space. In the west end of Rashtrapati Bhavan, behind the Mughal garden, there is a proposal to add a public park. Access to public space won’t reduce. In fact, it will expand.

Architects are complaining that the selection process could have been open, without such restrictive entry requirements.

Such sentiments are understandable. However, any mature professional will understand that undertaking a project of this scale and complexity requires that whoever is selected have some experience and proven capacity to do it. Perhaps such concerns may have led to the high entry requirements.

There hasn’t been any public consultation on this project of public importance so far.

The consultation process could have been better. A process of consultation within the government is underway now. I recently made a presentation to senior editors of newspapers and others. Going forward, we will make many presentations so that people can respond in an informed way.

Mr. Vijayan met Ghosh at Kerala House in New Delhi, expressed solidarity with their protest and also gifted her a book, Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi by Sudhanva Deshpande.

Ms. Ghosh had suffered head injuries during the January 5 attack on JNU students in the campus by a group of masked assailants.

“The whole country is with the JNUSU in their fight for justice. Everyone knows about your protest and also about what has happened to you in the fight for justice,” Mr. Vijayan told Ms. Ghosh after enquiring about her health and that of other students, who were injured.

In a Facebook Post, the CPI(M) veteran wrote that the JNU students were fighting an “epic battle” against the Sangh Parivar.

“Sangh Parivar was hoping to overcome the dissenting voices from JNU using muscle power. However, the JNU has put up an uncompromising fight against them. Aishe Ghosh has been leading this battle with her injured head,” Mr. Vijayan said.

Ms. Ghosh, after meeting CM Vijayan, thanked the people of Kerala for standing with JNU when the campus was under attack.

“Comrade Pinarayi has said go ahead and that is the inspiration I take and we will take this fight ahead. Whether it is the fight for rolling back the fee hike or against the CAA, I would like to thank, again and again, the people of Kerala who stood by us during all these attacks that we are continuously facing,” Ms. Ghosh told the media.

Ms. Ghosh reached Kerala House after her daily check up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

267,2020/01/11,Allies JD(U) and BJP in a fix over Delhi Assembly poll,"The ruling alliance partners in Bihar — the Janata Dal (United) and the BJP — are caught in a strange situation over the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls.

The JD(U) has announced that it will contest the election in Delhi on its own. Further, the party’s national vice-president Prashant Kishor’s consultancy firm is managing the Aam Aadmi Party’s campaign strategy against the BJP.

Lok Janshakti Party, the third partner in the ruling alliance in Bihar, is also likely to throw contest in the Delhi polls. The JD(U) and the LJP are yet to announce how many seats they would contest.

“It is strange that JD(U) is contesting the Delhi Assembly poll against the BJP and the Aam Admi Party, but its own national vice-president Prashant Kishor is working hard for the AAP to win the poll. I think both the JD(U) and Mr. Kishor are playing a fixed match to defeat the BJP,” senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari told The Hindu.

Mr. Tiwari said that it was quite obvious that the JD(U) would cut into the vote share of the BJP in Delhi. However, JD(U) leader and Bihar Minister Neeraj Kumar said, “We don’t care who says and does what, but for us the party has always been bigger and more important than an individual”.

BJP leader and party MLC Sanjay Paswan said, “Mr. Kishor has no knowledge about politics. He is only a poll manager of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.”

Mr. Paswan, of late, has been saying that the people of Bihar want a BJP Chief Minister. His remark had prompted JD(U) to tell the BJP to “rein in the party’s motor-mouth leaders”.

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) too is said to be mulling over contesting the Delhi Assembly elections. “We’ve identified10-15 seats in Delhi to contest but it will be decided and announced by our party chief soon,” said a party leader, seeking anonymity.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/xvhtqv/article30439297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BH-KISHOR-JD-U-GIR6TTL5A3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/allies-jdu-and-bjp-in-a-fix-over-delhi-assembly-poll/article30537970.ece

The final report, filed before Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav, also named former CMD of Religare Enterprises Ltd. (REL) Sunil Godhwani (58) as an accused.

In the chargesheet, filed by the ED’s Special Public Prosecutor Nitesh Rana, the probe agency has accused all three of money laundering, punishable under Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The court took cognisance of the chargesheet and issued production warrant against them for January 20. All the three accused are currently in judicial custody.

The ED also named RHC Holdings Pvt. Ltd. as an accused in its chargesheet.

It said the accused had acquired proceeds of crime to the tune of ₹150 crore through Star Artworks Pvt. Ltd., derived out of criminal activities and utilised the amount in repayment of its existing liability towards RFL by projecting it as untainted.

“Therefore, accused persons were involved in acquisition and utilisation of proceeds of crime generated out of criminal activities and its projection as untainted property, thereby have committed the offence of money laundering as defined under Sections of PMLA,” said the chargesheet, filed through advocate A.R. Aditya.

The ED had alleged that both the brothers, along with others, transferred an amount of about ₹1,000 crore to various persons from entities linked to the corporate loan book and finally, the money was siphoned off.

The EOW registered an FIR after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.

“They put RFL in a poor financial condition by disbursing loans to companies with no financial standing and controlled by them. The companies to which the loans were disbursed willfully defaulted in repayments and caused a loss to RFL to the tune of ₹2,397 crore,” the police had alleged.

The RFL said in a press release that since the time the offence took place, the company has undergone a complete revamp of its Board of Directors.

“All efforts continue to be made to rebuild the business, mobilise fresh capital and correct the transgression and legacy issues of the past. The management and internal controls at the Group and all subsidiaries’ level have also been revamped, bringing in much-needed assurance to employees about a stable and action-oriented management,” it said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ed-charges-fortis-promoters-in-money-laundering-case/article30538831.ece

At the meeting, DUTA said, senior HRD officials committed to the implementation of the assurances made by them on December 5 last, which teachers complained had still not been done in entirety. With regard to the union’s key demand of one-time absorption of ad hoc teachers, officials maintained that only the government could take a call on the same, DUTA said. Its representatives were also informed that its demand for the release of the “corrected concordance tables for revision of pension” and the withdrawal of a special leave petition on pensions were before the Finance Ministry.

271,2020/01/11,City court frees DJB engineer and contractor in graft case,"A Delhi court has acquitted a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Junior Engineer and a director of a private company in a corruption case, saying that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has not been able to bring on record unimpeachable evidence against them.

The probe agency had charged them with entering into a conspiracy for allegedly embezzling a portion of the money released for boring a tube well.

It alleged that the Junior Engineer fraudulently certified that the company director, who was given the contract for boring the tube well, carried out the work as per the agreement by using pipes of a particular company.

It further alleged that the payment amounting to ₹2.13 lakh was made to the contractor on a forged invoice submitted by the private accused person.

Additional Sessions Judge Anjurag Sain, however, dismissed the charges as the investigating agency was not able to produce sustainable evidence before the court.

“The court is of the opinion that since it was the duty of the Finance Department of the DJB to verify the genuineness of invoice, accused Junior Engineer Pritam Singh Meena, who has personally supervised the material and work and issued the satisfaction certificate qua installation of Johnson Pipes in the borewell in question that has also been signed, checked and cross-checked by the officers of the DJB, cannot be held criminally liable for the commission of alleged act of criminal conspiracy in the present case,” the judge said.

“It is apparent that no substantive evidence has come on record to show that the accused persons have committed the charged offences. Thus, the court holds that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case against both accused persons beyond shadow of all reasonable doubts. I accordingly, acquit both the accused persons,” Mr. Sain said in his judgment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/city-court-frees-djb-engineer-and-contractor-in-graft-case/article30538818.ece
272,2020/01/11,Chhapaak gets good response on Day 1,"Amid calls for a boycott by some a faction of right-wing supporters, Bollywood movie Chhapaak that hit the screens on Friday, garnered good response from viewers.

The film was embroiled in a controversy after actor Deepika Padukone went to Jawaharlal Nehru University to express solidarity with its students and faculty.

However, the opening of the film seemed largely unaffected by it.

Free screening

Rishi Verma, a 32-year-old businessman, who was at the theatres to watch the film said: “It’s an important film that highlights the issues faced by an acid attack survivor and it was worth watching... We are not involved in politics. These calls for boycotts are irrelevant.”

A free screening of the movie was organised by former MLA Alka Lamba for college students in Daryaganj. “After Deepika’s visit to JNU, a group started campaigning against this film and I felt that was not a good sign for a democratic country. So, we decided to organise a special screening,” she said.

Another 19-year-old viewer, Anindita Chawdhary, a student of Delhi University expressed disappointment over those protesting against the film. She said: “If you can ask others to boycott a film based on such a sensitive issue then it just shows what kind of a person you are.”

Most viewers expressed indifference to the “unnecessary” outrage over the movie.

Vineeta Singh, a 28-year-old homemaker, said she did not understand how anyone, driven by political opinions, could stand against a film on acid attack survivors.

“It was a thought-provoking film,” she said.

The film also received significant support online with hashtags — #ISupportDeepika and #HumDekhenge — trending with users posting photos of their tickets on social media platforms. A tweet reading: “People who carried acid in JNU are boycotting Chappak”, are doing the rounds on social media.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kg0nx2/article30538807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11CHHAPAAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/chhapaak-gets-good-response-on-day-1/article30538808.ece

The incident happened during a training session and the arrow pierced her shoulder.

Ms. Gohain was airlifted from Assam and brought to AIIMS on Thursday night. She was training at Dakha Devi Rasiwasia College at Chabua on Wednesday when the incident happened.

“Ms. Gohain is stable after having undergone a very complex surgery. She was brought to AIIMS from Dibrugarh in Assam on Thursday night. The arrow had damaged a part of her neck, vertebra and the left lung. She has now been shifted to the ICU for observation,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS.

The arrow, he explained, was touching the vertebral artery which supplies blood to the brain stem. A part of the arrow measuring about 15 cm was removed from her upper body. “Around 0.5 cm of the arrow was stuck in front of the spinal cord. It was a very complex surgery,” he said.

The operation, which lasted three-and-half hours, was performed by a team led by Deepak Gupta, a neurosurgery professor at AIIMS.

276,2020/01/11,Dip in occupancy rate brings no relief to overcrowded Tihar jail,"The occupancy rate in Tihar jail has lowered by over 70% since 2015, but the issue of overcrowding in the prison is a problem that persists, Prison Statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau has stated.

According to the data, in 2018, the capacity of Tihar jail was 10,026 and the number of inmates was 15,468 that led to the occupancy rate of 154.3% with 16 jail. In 2015, the occupancy rate was 226.9% with 10 jails, the capacity being 6,250 and the number of inmates being 14,183.

The situation got better in 2016 after Mandoli Prison Complex was inaugurated and the number of prisons increased from 10 to 12. The occupancy rate lowered to 179.8% in 2016 with 14,058 inmates and a capacity of 7,818.

In 2017, the number of prisons increased to 16 and the capacity increased to 10,026. The occupancy rate also lowered to 151.2% with 15,161 inmates.

However, like in 2017, Delhi recorded the third highest occupancy rate in the country in 2018 as well and also had the most overcrowded jail among the Union Territories. Among the States, prisons in Uttar Pradesh were the most overcrowded (176.5%) followed by Sikkim (157.3%) and Chhattisgarh (153.3%), the report said.

Responding to the issue of overcrowding, Tihar Director General Sandeep Goel admitted that overcrowding is a persistent problem and as on January 10, the occupancy rate was 175%. A few remedies, including building a new prison complex, however, are being considered. “To increase the lodging capacity, it is being considered that land be procured in Narela and a new prison complex be built there. Another plan that is being considered for future is that existing jails with single storey be turned into double and triple storey,” he said.

Overcrowding in prisons leads to issues like poor hygiene, lack of sleep, among others. Keeping in view the human rights of the prisoners, it is essential that they are given reasonable space and facilities in jails, the report noted. In the recent years, overcrowding is one of the biggest problems being faced by prison inmates.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/b0zb09/article30539977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11TIHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dip-in-occupancy-rate-brings-no-relief-to-overcrowded-tihar-jail/article30538762.ece
277,2020/01/11,"BJP’s education model ruining children’s future, says Sisodia","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday said its government’s education model is one of building the path for the prosperity of children and also the nation, while the BJP’s education model is aimed at ruining their future.

Education Minister Manish Sisodia, at a press conference, talked about two of the government’s educational schemes — Happiness and Entrepreneurship curriculum — and challenged the BJP to present its models.

“Delhi Assembly election not just between two parties but between two models of shaping the country’s future. Under the Kejriwal government’s education model, the Happiness Curriculum was launched for students from nursery-Class VIII of government schools. Such was the visible impact of the curriculum on the psyche of the children within a year of its launch that several private schools of Delhi also launched this curriculum,” he said, adding that education models of the BJP and Congress stand out only for its absence of any vision on the quality of education.

“They are caught between whether to include references to Gandhiji and Nehru in the syllabus. The BJP has now introduced a course in ‘Bhoot Vidya’ in universities, which focusses on training in curing mental illnesses through primitive methods. Their education model is pondering on questions like whether the Internet existed in the age of Mahabharata or if ducks swimming creates oxygen in water,” said Mr. Sisodia.

Allegations on Shoaib

Responding to statements allegedly made by the BJP that Shoaib Iqbal, who joined AAP on Thursday, is a murder accused, Mr. Sisodia said: “If any AAP leader or anyone joining the AAP is a murder accused then BJP should be ashamed that he is outside the jail. For six years, the police have been under you...you could have got him arrested. If you can’t run the police then leave it. We will run it. If there is any murderer in our party or your party, we will put him behind bars.”

Comments on Chhapaak

“You [BJP] are scared of a film, which has been made on an acid attack victim? You are scared of a film? You are scared of films, you are scared of education,” Mr. Sisodia said about BJP leaders allegedly protesting against Bollywood movie Chhapaak, which released on Frida.

“The party will focus on roadshows. We will also carry out buzz campaigns at metro stations and major areas such as Connaught Place. AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders will start campaigning after the list is announced. There will be about 50 volunteers per booth campaigning for the election and 1.3 lakh volunteers, 10 in each booth, working on the last three days before the poll and on the day of voting,” the leader said.

Party volunteers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will also start coming to Delhi in the coming weeks to help with the campaign.

281,2020/01/11,Students hold silent protests on university campus,"As Delhi Police held a press conference on Friday regarding its probe into the violence that broke out on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on January 5, women students of the university as well as members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad held separate demonstrations on campus condemning the attacks.

Policemen were deployed in large numbers in the university area as ABVP members held a silent ‘peace march’ — holding up posters condemning ‘Red Terror’, referring to Left groups — from Sabarmati T point to the JNU main gate.

During the peace march, a human chain of women students stood on the sidelines holding up posters condemning the ABVP. Several of them had tied black bands across their heads and held up posters such as “Here to watch the march of shame” and “ABVP go back”.

Among those participating in the peace march was Pranav Kumar, a teacher in the School of Social Studies, who said that the rally was an appeal to start classes with a cool head, and that it was not to “blame any side”.

Calling the claims made by the police on Friday “a litany of distortions, half truths and outright lies”, the JNU Students’ Union accused the force of carrying out a “political investigation”.

Meanwhile, the ABVP said that the “truth of Left-perpetrated violence in JNU stands exposed”.

In a statement, the JNUSU stated: “The police named all Left outfits but the name of the ABVP was curiously missing... the ploy to implicate the Left in the violence is an indication that this probe is a political investigation with a clear agenda to placate [Home Minister] Amit Shah and the ABVP, which can employ violence with impunity on the basis of its State backing.”

‘Sinister motives’

It added that the “sinister motives” of the police is revealed in the fact that it has implicated JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, “upon whom a murder attempt took place” in the January 5 violence.

The JNUSU also condemned the police for not taking action on various incidences of violence, allegedly perpetrated by ABVP members on January 4, a day before violent mobs went on a rampage on campus.

It alleged that “ABVP members thrashed the JNUSU general secretary, broke the leg of women students, and injured several others... complaints were filed but there has been no FIR registered”. The union added that the police press conference on Friday was carried out to “save the ABVP and deflect attention from the spine-chilling horrors perpetrated by right-wing hooligans”.

“It is regrettable but not surprising given their past record that the police has flushed integrity and honesty down the drain and is undertaking this exercise to defend the V-C and the ABVP.”

The union also pointed out that various media reports had made it clear that the violence was perpetrated by the ABVP, with the joint secretary of the students’ body admitting that its members were carrying lathis.

“The police has done a shoddy job as evidenced by the alleged incorrect identification of one of the accused, all of which it said were based on videos from ABVP-leaning pages,” it added.

‘Impartial probe’

Meanwhile, the ABVP termed the police probe “impartial” and said that “in several universities Left organisations are continuously and violently targeting students who dare to disagree with them”. It added that those who disagreed with “the communist ideology are discriminated against by Left-wing professors”. The group said it was hopeful that strict action would be taken against those fiound guilty.

In an appeal to the public, the JNUSU said it hoped that all would “see through this malicious propaganda being spread against JNU”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xkzc6x/article30539745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DEABVP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-hold-silent-protests-on-university-campus/article30538711.ece

Mr. Nadda, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, Union Minister and MP Dr. Harsh Vardhan and senior leaders from the party’s State unit addressed a meeting where representatives from the five Assembly Constituencies of Tri Nagar, Wazirpur, Sadar, Timarpur and Burari were present.

“BJP is the only political party which has a large number of dedicated workers and it will register a victory in the Delhi poll. You have to apprise the voters about the achievements and policies of Modi government framed for changing the present and future of Delhi,” Mr. Nadda said.

He added that the Centre has done all such works for the people of Delhi, which has not been possible by the AAP government till date.

“The BJP workers have to give the message of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas to every household,” he said.

Mr. Tiwari said “all the political parties had been doing politics” in the name of regularising unauthorized colonies. “Previously, the Congress misled the people for 15 years and after that AAP for 5 years but in his second tenure, the Narendra Modi government made a historic decision of regularising unauthorized colonies,” he added.

Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Vijender Guptaaccused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of “withholding the ration” being provided to the poor residents of the city by the Centre.

“The Kejriwal government has always deprived the poor residents of Delhi of the welfare schemes of the Centre...whether it is to give houses to poor or food grains.

283,2020/01/11,ABVP activist claims on camera to have mobilised mobs,"Two JNU students claiming to be Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad members were seen admitting to their role in the JNU violence in 'sting' videos aired on India Today TV.

Reacting to the exposé, Delhi police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said they will obtain these tapes from the television channel and include it in the ongoing probe being conducted by a Special Investigation Team. “The role of the people caught on camera will be verified and their presence on campus during the violence will be checked,” he said.

Akshat Awasthi, a first-year student of the French degree programme at Jawaharlal Nehru University, was seen on camera saying that he mobilised mobs for the attack on campus on January 5 from within and outside the campus. He claimed to be an ABVP activist. “After we were attacked, I immediately mobilised a large number of students and attacked Sabarmati Hostel,” he was heard saying in a video.

Another student, Rohit Shah, was also heard on camera saying that he gave his helmet to Awasthi before the latter set out for Sabarmati Hostel.

In another tape, Left activist Geeta Kumari was seen saying that she was involved in shutting down the university servers. Justifying her action, she said Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar was communicating with the students only online and avoiding meeting them, so they decided to target the server room in order to force the administration's hand.

Responding subsequently to the 'sting operation', she tweeted: “JNU VC increases our fee a thousand times. He sends punishment letters for demanding right to education. I myself have received countless such letters. We are fighting for our rights. We are in civil disobedience. That's what I have said.

284,2020/01/11,JD(U) and BJP in fix over Delhi Assembly polls,"The ruling alliance partners in Bihar — Janata Dal (United) and BJP — are seemingly caught in a strange situation over the upcoming Delhi assembly elections, voting for which is scheduled on February 8.

I-PAC and AAP

The JD(U) has announced to contest poll in Delhi while its national vice-president Prashant Kishor’s political consultancy firm I-PAC has been repoed in by AAP.

The Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal, though, has taken a swipe over JD(U) and Mr. Kishor’s “fixed match to defeat BJP in Delhi elections”. However, JD(U) leader and Information and Public Relation Department Minister Neeraj Kumar said: “We don’t care who says and does what but for us, the party has always been bigger and important than an individual.”

The third NDA partner in Bihar — Lok Janshakti Party — too is likely to throw its ring in Delhi poll. However, JD(U) and LJPare yet to announce how many seats they would contest in the poll. In the recently concluded Jharkhand Assembly elections, JD(U) and LJP had contested separately but failed to win even a single seat. “It is strange that JD(U) is contesting Delhi Assembly poll against BJP and AAP but its own national vice-president is working hard for AAP to win the poll…I think, both JD(U) and Mr. Kishor are playing a fixed match to defeat BJP”, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari told The Hindu. He added that it was quite obvious JD(U) would cut into the vote bank of who else but the BJP.

285,2020/01/11,JNU compromise formula back on the table,"The compromise formula currently under discussion between agitating students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University and its Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar is the same as the agreement that was under discussion a month ago and led to the transfer of then Higher Education Secretary R. Subrahmanyam.

On December 11, following talks between both sides, Higher Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank took the decision to give the V-C an ultimatum to implement the agreement or resign, according to a senior government official. However, neither side implemented the terms of the agreement.

On December 13, Mr. Subrahmanyam, who had been coordinating the talks, was transferred, and the students’ agitation resumed.

On Friday, current HRD Secretary Amit Khare separately met the V-C and the leaders of the students union. This is the Ministry’s latest attempt to broker peace in the two and a half month long standoff, initially sparked by a hostel fee hike, that has led to mass street protests and attacks against students and teachers on campus last weekend.

Following the discussions, Mr. Khare told reporters that as the JNU administration has met the basic demands of students with regards to hostel fees, they should withdraw the agitation and return to classes. He pointed out that the cost of service and utility charges are not being charged to students and would be borne by the University Grants Commission instead, although students will still pay a higher room rent.

However, Mr. Khare was non-committal on students demand for notification of their elected Union, only saying that “while many other demands may be there, the basic demand has been met.”

Hostel fee

The hostel fee compromise as well as the notification of the Union were both part of the agreement which had been worked out on December 11. It had also stated that students would call off their protest while the JNU administration would ""take a lenient view"" of incidents that occurred during the agitation. Students had demanded that all FIRs filed against them and proctorial investigations be withdrawn.

On Friday, the V-C told the Ministry that he was “taking all steps to implement the decisions arrived at” as per the December 11 agreement. However, so far, action has only been taken on the issue of hostel fees.

Student leaders said they would take the Ministry’s proposal back to the Union office-bearers and counsellors for further discussion.

“The HRD Ministry has listened to our issues. We have conveyed our demands, and they are trying in their way. They will send us a circular. Once we have discussed with our office-bearers, we will decide whether to call off the protests or not,” said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, who was injured in the attacks on Sunday. She added that the cases against students must be withdrawn, speaking even as Delhi Police named her as a suspect in their probe into Sunday’s attacks.

Contrasting the dialogue with the HRD Ministry with the accusations being made by the Delhi Police,

‘V-C must go’

JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon said, “You can infer that we have faith in the HRD Ministry, not in the Home Ministry.” On one point, the students remained adamant. “We have lost all faith in the vice-chancellor. We will not budge from our demand that the V-C must go,” said Ms. Ghosh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/htay23/article30538675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DEJNUKHARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-compromise-formula-back-on-the-table/article30538676.ece

287,2020/01/11,The harrowing tale of two British ships wrecked on an Andamans island in 1844,"On August 12, 1844, the 80th Regiment of Foot of the British Army marched out of Australia’s Sydney barracks and set sail for Calcutta on four ships — Briton, Enmore, Lloyds and Royal Saxon. With 431 people on board, including 35 women and 43 children, Briton sailed smoothly.

A month-and-a-half later she called at Timor Island to replenish water and other provisions, and reached Singapore three weeks later. Briton then entered the Strait of Malacca, where she withstood some strong winds and squalls.

Briton faced some hostile weather the next month too, with the onset of the northeast monsoon. On November 10 winds turned into a raging storm and battered the ship before subsiding. The soldiers and crew cleared the debris and captured scads of birds — hawks, kingfishers and nightjars that were blown on board from nearby islands. After a brief lull, the storm returned vigorously. Briton rolled heavily. Soon, the quarter boats, meat safe and hencoops were blown away; one horsebox was thrown down the hatchway, snapping the horse’s forelegs.

The cyclone did not let up even the next day: Briton lost its longboat and cooking coopers, another horse was crushed in its box and several soldiers were injured while bailing out water from the ship. When the storm subsided partly, the men noticed a vessel behind them, about half a mile away.

The winds picked up again and amid thunder and lightning, Briton laboured and rolled. Despite the soldiers’ best efforts to prevent leakage, the lower deck was flooded by midnight. Briton trembled from stem to stern and looked like it would break any moment. Families of the soldiers gathered in panic; someone read from the Bible, and the group prayed for safety.

Shipwrecked

The night was pitch-black, almost nothing was visible. And then, during the flashes of lightning, the crew spotted trees — the ship had drifted ashore. The frightened souls on board were relieved. After a 50-hour-long stormy voyage, everyone was finally able to sleep.

The next morning, the 776-ton Briton was found perched high on the shore, in a mangrove swamp. About a quarter of a mile away from it lay the vessel that the crew had spotted the previous day. It was Runnymede, a troopship, transporting the 10th and the 50th Regiments of Foot of the British Army from England to Calcutta.

Runnymede had left Gravesend in England on June 20, 1844, with about 200 people on board, including 12 women and 14 children. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the vessel entered the Indian Ocean, called at Penang in October and left for her final destination on November 3. The cyclone in the eastern Indian Ocean badly hit Runnymede and finally threw her onto a reef of rocks.

Briton and Runnymede had wrecked on the same island — John Lawrence. It was unbelievable that almost everyone had survived the raging tempest. But it was not the end of the ordeal. The castaways were in the Andamans, a dreaded archipelago the very mention of which would send chills down any sailor’s spine. Several parties of seamen that had unwittingly landed or shipwrecked off these desolate islands in the past were never seen again.

Dreaded islands

The Andaman Islands were infamous as an abode of ferocious ‘cannibals’. Marco Polo, in The Travels of Marco Polo, portrays them thus: “[these] people are without a king and are idolaters and no better than wild beasts… all the men of this island have heads like dogs, and teeth and eyes likewise; in fact, in the face they are all just like big mastiff dogs! ...they are a most cruel generation, and eat everybody that they can catch, if not of their own race.”

It poured on November 12. The crew assessed the damage and mustered the stock of food on Briton, a large portion of which — flour, bread and sugar — was already spoilt. All the animals and poultry, barring one pig, had either washed away or perished. The crew cooked and fed the famished passengers, who had eaten nothing in the past 72 hours barring a few biscuits and some rum.

Now a strong gale was blowing. Briton seemed stable and safe, but Runnymede was in a precarious state. Fearing that the ship might sink at night, all its soldiers, women, children and crew were accommodated on Briton.

The weather cleared up the next day. Runnymede, which had a fair stock of provisions, did not go down at night. Over the next few days, the soldiers and crew offloaded the food, cleared the jungle, dug wells and rigged up tents on the shore.

The castaways found the island hopelessly inhospitable. The weather was hot and the islanders hostile. Water was scarce and tasted bad; mosquitoes, flies and snakes were everywhere. Thick vegetation covered the island that bore no fruit or vegetable. There were, however, plenty of wild hogs and shellfish to keep the people alive — at least for some time.

Hostile reception

The island’s inhabitants, the Andamanese of the Aka-Bale tribe, surrounded two sailors who had gone to collect shellfish; the soldiers chased them away. At night, the indigenes tried to approach Runnymede but fled when shots were fired in their direction. One day, a fatigue party was ambushed while collecting shellfish on the beach.

The islanders’ unprovoked antagonism and the scarcity of food and water perturbed the castaways. Shellfish, initially abundant, quickly became scarce some two miles around the coast near the camp. The soldiers tried to befriend the indigenes so that they could procure food from them, but the latter remained implacably hostile.

In a quest for resources, some soldiers ventured deeper into the island. But the thick jungle and fear of getting ambushed held them back. The islanders desperately wanted to exterminate the castaways and ransack their ships for iron, nails and other useful material. But the soldiers’ muskets had so far kept them at bay.

Maladies were rife in the camp. Runnymede was turned into a hospital where some patients had already passed away. There seemed little hope of survival without assistance from outside. The carpenters, who were instructed to revamp the only remaining boat in sound condition, got it ready by the end of November. She was named The Hope. A party left the island for the nearest port.

The Hope was gone for 20 days, but there was no sign of succour. The marooned people were now nearly on a starvation diet.

In mid-December, an earthquake struck the island. Hardly had the tremor abated, when a man shouted from a lookout tree — “a sail! a sail!” Suddenly, the camp was in commotion, everyone wanted a glimpse of the sail. Runnymede’s ensign was hoisted and a gun was fired to attract the vessel’s attention. After two hours, a schooner approached the bay. The entire camp cheered, and the soldiers gave her a 12-gun salute.

The Hope had reached Mergui, an archipelago off southern Myanmar, in 12 days. The schooner then set sail, loaded with meat, rice, tea, sugar, salt, fish, yams, young buffaloes and ghee. The camp was euphoric.

On December 28, a brig and two schooners arrived with more supplies. In the next two days, two ships, Ayrshire and Elizabeth Ainslie, arrived. They left the island with the 80th Regiment within the next few days.

On January 3, another ship, Agnes Lee, arrived to rescue the remaining soldiers, women and children. That night, scores of Andamanese surrounded the camp. A picket opened fire to drive away the party; one brig zeroed in on a large gathering and fired two shots and a shell. The indigenes disappeared in panic.

Agnes Lee left two days later, ending the 55-day sojourn of the castaways on the hostile island. Before departing, the soldiers engraved a rock tablet with the names of their comrades who had died on the island.

Over a decade, the crews of many vessels had similar harrowing experiences in the Andamans — Emily (1849), Flying Fish (1849), Tenasserim (1852), Sesostris (1854) and Faiz Baksh (1855). Finally, the East India Company resolved to intervene. The British had first manoeuvred to colonise the Andamans in 1789 by establishing a settlement on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman. In 1792, the settlement was shifted to the northeast part of the island but the inhospitable climate led to its closure in 1796, and the islands were left alone for the next 62 years.

The regular massacre of crews was the excuse for the Andamans’ reoccupation, and this was expedited after the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. A penal settlement was established at Port Blair in 1858, which expanded steadily and thrived until Japan colonised these islands (1942 to 1945) during WWII.

Extermination

The re-occupation of the Andamans created a haven for the shipwrecked crews — but it exterminated the islanders. When the Andamanese resisted the colonisation, punitive as well as friendly measures were undertaken to ‘tame’ them. Their organised resistance culminated in the Battle of Aberdeen on 17 May 1859, when scores of indigenes were annihilated.

Soon, the Andamanese were confined to ‘Andaman Homes’ where alien food, clothes, tobacco and alcohol were imposed on them. Consequently, epidemics — syphilis, measles, pneumonia, ophthalmia, mumps, influenza and gonorrhoea — critically depopulated them from 3,500 in 1858 to 90 in 1931. Of the 10 Andamanese tribes, six became extinct.

The Andamanese population in December 2017 was 56. These remnants of a once-strong hunter-gatherer community that inhabited almost all of Great Andaman are now confined to permanent settlements in Strait Island, where they survive on government doles.

Postscript

The Andaman archipelago, until it was colonised, remained terra incognita. The inhabitants of the islands were dubbed fierce cannibals. Their hostility towards strangers was interpreted as a manifestation of their inherent wickedness. In reality, it was nothing but a survival strategy. In the past, Malays, Burmese and Chinese had visited the Andamans for slaving expeditions; they had captured indigenes who they later sold as slaves in Ceylon, Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula. It created an enduring hatred and distrust among the Andamanese for all outsiders.

So the unprovoked attacks by the Andamanese on the castaways of Briton and Runnymede were only a reflection of their fear of strangers and their motives. A fear that was far from misplaced. Following the colonisation of the Andamans, the entire Aka-Bale tribe, which had inhabited John Lawrence Island for millennia, suddenly became extinct soon after 1931.

288,2020/01/11,People confuse multiple myeloma with other health complications,"Owing to lack of awareness on multiple myeloma ( a type of blood cancer), people tend to confuse its symptoms with other health complications and they slip into stage-II or III form of the cancer by the time the blood cancer is diagnosed.

Addressing a press conference on sidelines of The Indian Myeloma Congress-2020 held at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Punjagutta, on Saturday, medical specialists said that one of the agendas of the congress is to raise awareness about multiple myeloma - which affects bone marrow.

If haemoglobin levels are low, bones become weak, kidneys fail, infection is detected, people have to suspect multiple myeloma. They can consult a medical oncologist or any cancer care centre for the diagnosis and treatment.

People tend to overlook the possibility of the cancer and consult a physician when haemoglobin levels decreases, approach an orthopaedician when bones become weak, and a nephrologist when kidneys fail. Every year, at least 100 new patients suffering from multiple myeloma consult doctors at NIMS. Head of Medical Oncology Department at NIMS, G Sadashivudu said that most of the patients were in stage-II or III of the disease. While prevention is not known, Dr Sadashivudu stressed that early diagnosis will be of help.

NIMS Director Dr K Manohar said that bone marrow transplantation is offered free of cost at the institute to people who are beneficiaries of Aarogyasri Health Scheme. From 2017, over 50 people availed the treatment under the scheme at the institute. The treatment costs up to ₹ 10 lakh at corporate hospitals.

Speaking at the press conference, Dr Shaji Kumar said that lifespan of blood cancer patients has increased from two to three years, to more than 10 years because of the medicines available for treatment. Medical specialists said that the best medical care available in developed nations is offered in India too.

289,2020/01/11,Course corrections put metro rail on track,"Construction of first phase of Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) has been done and dusted, with the last remaining corridor — Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS) of about 11 km getting ready to be commissioned for commercial operations later this month.

In the last nine years of construction, the project for sure has undergone several trials and tribulations, but the most interesting are the changes forced upon by the metro rail authorities in the viaduct alignment and also in the stations placement. These are due to land acquisition issues, prevailing social unrest then and the uncertainty over taking the metro line into the interior of the Old City as in between MGBS and Falaknuma. Corridor II or the Green Corridor was originally planned to intersect Corridor III — Nagole to Raidurg (28 km) at Parade Grounds serving as the interchange station with JBS connected by means of a walkway.

However, the Green Corridor is also now connected to Corridor III through an extra one-kilometre-long elevated viaduct with eight piers veering away from the Bhoiguda junction towards new Gandhi Hospital and through the Padmaraonagar road towards Chikalguda but with no stations in between.

“The plan was to have a maintenance depot for every Corridor but with the Falaknuma depot on a 17-acre site not happening we had to do this link so that we can bring metro trains to the Uppal depot,” informed senior metro rail officials.

Those keenly following the metro rail construction may have noticed that MGBS was never planned to be either the terminal station for Corridor II or even an inter-change station for Corridor I — Miyapur to L.B. Nagar (29 km). With the 4 km stretch to Falaknuma given up, it became the terminal station.

Also in the original drawings, Osmania Medical College (OMC) was supposed to be the inter-change station for Corridor I & II. With Telangana agitation at its peak and strong opposition not to let any metro alignment into the premises, the authorities shifted the interchange to MGBS, pushed the OMC stations further ahead, as also Sultan Bazar station.

It led to building a complicated engineering feat of taking Corridor II & I, one over the other, for a distance of about 200 metres at Rangmahal. Then, a ‘reversal’ of about 580 metres of viaduct was also built going beyond the MGBS inter-change station for Green Corridor trains to reverse and return. “We had to do course corrections throughout to push the work,” averred HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qbb6y5/article30545991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11HYDERABADMETRORAILLIMITEDTRIALRUNS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/course-corrections-put-metro-rail-on-track/article30545992.ece

291,2020/01/11,Woman injured in bomb blast in Yemen operated upon in Hyderabad,"Doctors at a corporate hospital here performed ‘Modified Capanna’s technique’ on a 24-year-old woman who had suffered fracture of the left femur (thigh bone) in a bomb blast in Yemen five years ago. As per the technique, which was said to be the first in the Telugu states, an allograft (femur bone) and free vascularised fibula are placed. She lost 15% bone in the blast.

Earlier in 2015, an implant was placed but it failed and she was not able to walk. The patient, Suaad Ahmed Hamed, was brought to Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, in October 2019 when she started undergoing medical procedures.

“Usually, such bone losses are seen only in major road accidents and bomb blasts,” said Dr AV Gurava Reddy, Managing Director, Sunshine Group of Hospitals.

An orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital, Dr Vasudeva Juvvadi said that although other methods such as distraction osteogenesis (bone formation) could be used, treatment was prolonged and needed multi stage procedures.

The doctors decided to perform ‘Modified Capanna’s technique’ — a single stage reconstruction, using a combination of free vascularised fibular graft with allograft.

“Allograft was brought from bone bank in Bangalore and vascularised fibula was taken from the patient with the support of plastic surgeons Ravichander Rao and Venkatesh. Fibula was pegged into the allograft and was placed in the gap of bone loss and fixed with plate. Vascular anastomoses (surgical connection between adjacent blood vessels or other channels of body) was done,” said Dr Vasudeva.

The 10-hour surgery was performed on November 26. The patient began to walk with the help of crutches, without putting weight on the operated leg.

Depending on X-Ray reports, progressive weight bearing and full weight bearing would be initiated. “The average time for bone union will be six months” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/woman-injured-in-bomb-blast-in-yemen-operated-upon-in-city/article30545865.ece

296,2020/01/11,‘Poll expenses must be checked’,"Money is required for politics but it should not be illegitimate. It is also important to define ‘illegitimate’ election expenditure, said Election Commissioner of India Ashok Lavasa.

Speaking at the plenary on “Illegitimate expenditure in Indian Politics”, he said that governments and political system alone should take the initiative for controlling expenditure in elections. Change for the better would happen fast when citizens adhered to social and moral values, he said.

Mr. Lavasa admitted that a situation was prevailing where no one but ‘crorepatis’ would win the elections. Yet, the Election Commission beyond a point has no power to control the expenditure in elections. In the last election, ‘crorepatis’ accounted for 37% of MPs elected and this time, the number shot up to 87%.

In a recent election in a State, it was proved that those who were awarded contracts a few months before the election gave large amount of donations. “A discussion on election expenditure should be held from various angles, including the campaign involving celebrities and media owned by political parties,” he said.

BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said that they, in principle, supported the proposal for direct election of Mayor, Chief Minister and Prime Minister in the form of Presidential election. But without adopting the presidential form of institutions in other countries, a discussion should happen to suit conditions in our country.

“Huge amounts of money were being spent because of lure for power vested in political posts. At present, power was centralised at the highest level instead of being vested with people. Delegation of powers to local governments alone would bring down the monopoly of MLAs and MPs,” he said.

FDR general secretary Jayaprakash Narayan, who chaired the session, said that parties and leaders could bring forth reforms to make democracy work better and meet people’s aspirations.

“The Modi government has the wherewithal to bring in reforms for direct election of CM and PM, proportionate representation and decentralisation of power to local bodies and Mr. Ram Madhav should take initiative,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/poll-expenses-must-be-checked/article30538166.ece

The damage to the backwaters will be assessed within a few hours and officials from the district administration, including district collector S. Suhas are at the site to examine the debris and the extent of the problem.

However, the angle of the fall of the buildings has been satisfactory, said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, PESO.

The scene of the blast at H2O was near perfect with the compound walls staying quite intact.

The dust level too was less than expected and the traffic movement was restored within 20 to 30 minutes of the second blast, a testimony to the efficiency with which the blasts were coordinated.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/7uqzzk/article30542101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H2O,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-flats-demolition-pcb-assessing-impact/article30542109.ece
299,2020/01/11,Marudu flats demolition: Residents in area unhappy with arrangements,"Residents in the neighbourhood of Alfa Serene, one of the two apartments being pulled down on Saturday for violating CRZ norms, were an agitated lot, as they accused the authorities of not doing enough to safely evacuate them to temporary shelters ahead of the planned implosion.

Unlike the impression created by the Sub-Collector and other authorities through the media that all arrangements had been made for the evacuation, nothing was done on the ground and that they were completely in the dark about the evacuation protocol, they alleged.

“Except for a notice served by the municipality a few days ago, we were told literally nothing about the evacuation. We are moving out on our own volition out of fear for our lives. In fact, there was no clarity about our evacuation and return before and after the demolition,” Riyas Kadavil, one of the local residents.

Last minute arrangements

Motioning towards people doing a last-minute scramble to cover their dwellings from the dust and debris caused by the implosion, Jasbeer, another local resident, said that they literally had to fight with the authorities last night to even get the sheets for covering their houses.

But not everyone got the sheets, as the elderly couple V.N. Subramanyan, a retired High Court employee, and his wife Nirmala vouched. “None of us were told anything about the protocol to be followed nor were we given any material for covering our houses,” said the 77-year-old while taking a break from covering the house with his wife’s old saris.

Siraj, another resident, said that the geotextile and sandbags promised to cover and fortify the houses never came. “We are not going to the evacuation centres, which are quite some distance away from our homes. We want to stick around to ensure that our homes are intact,” he said.

“There are children in families and no arrangements were made for food or snacks while evacuating them,” said Shahul Hameed.

Door-to-door delivery of notices

Standing outside her small house, which had developed multiple cracks since the pre-blast demolition, 58-year-old K.D. Sarasakshi was anxious about the safety of her dwelling. “While the apartment owners were given lakhs in compensation, the authorities are maintaining complete silence about repairing our houses. This is a small house but it is all I have and there is no way I will be able to rebuild it,” she said.

Disha Pratapan, municipal councillor of ward 33, said except for door-to-door delivery of the notices about the precautions to be taken on demolition, not even a meeting was convened by the Sub-Collector to discuss the evacuation. “It is only natural that people are aggrieved and the majority of them have chosen to stick around in the neighbourhood rather than the temporary shelters, which are quite far away from their neighbourhood,” she said.

Though two buses were arranged to evacuate residents from the area around H2O Holy Faith, the buses ran mostly empty to the temporary shelter set-up at Sacred Heart College, with most residents choosing to stay with family.

Shaji Antony and his family, who live near the apartment, decided to stay away from the camp, choosing to stay with relatives instead. “My elderly father is unwell and we are unsure of the medical facilities available at the shelter,” he said.

Besides, residents also chose to stay with family since they were unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes. “We were not told exactly when we can return. Some of us plan on coming back to check if the houses are all right a few hours later, though we may not come back to stay the night,” he said.

Sarasu Subramanian, who left with her family to the shelter at Thevara, said that they stayed in one of the bylanes a little away from the flat, but she was worried about the dust exacerbating her existing breathing troubles.

Joseph Nedumparambil, whose house is a few metres away from the flat, plans on sticking around to watch the implosion, while his family heads to church to light candles for the safety of their house, he said.

There are not many takers for the temporary shelters opened by the authorities at Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) at Nettoor, over a kilometre away on the national highway, and at Sacred Heart College, Thevara, for evacuees from the surrounding areas of Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith.

The police started evacuating the families from the neighbourhood of Alfa Serene shortly after 8 a.m. While the residents moved out of their houses, most of them declined to move to the shelters.

“They were reluctant to move out for a short span of time lasting about three hours. So, the majority of the residents near Alfa Serene chose to move to their ancestral homes in the neighbourhood and just about 20 people from near Holy Faith were shifted to Sacred Heart College,” said P. H. Nadeera, Maradu municipal chairperson.

Besides, people who were already agitated about the perceived apathy in arranging proper evacuation were not willing to move far away from their houses, many of which had already developed cracks in pre-demolition works.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/i95kzh/article30541506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/maradu-neighborhood,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/marudu-flats-demolition-residents-in-area-unhappy-with-arrangements/article30541507.ece
300,2020/01/11,When a big bang happens in the neighbourhood,"Sitting in the portico of his home exuding an old-world charm, 82-year-old E.J. Ambrose was pouring over newspapers spread out on a table before him.

Living just a stone’s throw away from H2O Holy Faith, one of the two apartments to be demolished at Maradu on Saturday, reports on the impending demolition, unsurprisingly, had all his attention.

His ancestral home, built way back in 1882, has survived the vagaries of time and the exertions of pre-blast demolitions. “The house is reasonably strong, and we expect it to be unaffected by the blast as well. We are banging on the assurance of the authorities that the blast will have little impact on life and properties,” said Mr. Ambrose, who felt that there was indeed an element of surprise since there was no precedent for such massive demolitions in the State.

Sicily Antony, a 73-year-old housewife in the same neighbourhood, however, was tension personified, with the demolition just hours away. She had adequate reasons to be anxious as her house had already developed some cracks.

Those cracks appeared on the day they demolished the car parking area of the apartment, said her daughter-in-law Tashy.

“Our family has been here for over two centuries, and we moved to this house from our ancestral property in the neighbourhood just 13 years ago. This house is the sweat of my son’s hard work,” she said even as she bemoaned the alleged lack of clarity about the time when they could return to the house after being temporarily evacuated before the blast.

Her 83-year-old husband Antony is suffering from cancer, so the family has chosen to move to their daughter’s house at Nettoor rather than to the temporary shelter arranged by the authorities.

Nazeer, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh who had been engaged in pre-blast demolition work for the last couple of months, was nonchalant about the whole thing when stopped on his tracks.

“Humara kam tho katam huwa. Kal angrezi log sammalenge (Our job is over and tomorrow the demolition team will take over),” he said before striding away drawing deep on the cigarette.

All the while onlookers were stopping and taking selfies from the Kundannoor-Thevara bridge, which turned the preferred vantage point for the soon-to-be-demolished apartment and a makeshift parking space by curious motorists.

“No destruction is a pleasant sight and this is particularly disturbing for me as I had transported sand and cement during the construction of this structure. It could have been used for the benefit of the poor rather than demolishing it using the taxpayers’ money,” said Pushpan, a driver from Aluva.

Babu, a 72-year-old security guard from Edappally, however, backed the demolition and, in fact, wanted more such illegal structures to meet with similar fate. “The tainted politicians and officials should also be thrown behind bars,” he said.

Raja, a 24-year-old from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu employed with a premier hotel in the vicinity, had left his lodging at Maradu earlier for his afternoon shift to make time for a selfie with the apartment as the backdrop.

“The demolition of even a small house is so painful, and this is such a huge one. No matter whether you are rich or poor, seeing your beloved house going down in a heap can be so harrowing,” he sighed.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-a-big-bang-happens-in-the-neighbourhood/article30538980.ece
301,2020/01/11,Maradu flats demolition to go down as record for future generations,"All aspects of the demolition of the four residential apartment complexes at Maradu, from the angle of pull to flying debris to dust accumulation, will be recorded minutely for future generations to study and learn from. “It will not be a simple act of bringing down massive structures, but an exercise that will profit future generations,” said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), here on Friday.

Speaking to The Hindu on the eve of the first-ever such exercise in Kerala, Mr. Venugopal said the demolition process would be recorded live and sent to the control room at the Maradu municipal office complex, where a team of engineers from various agencies will monitor every aspect on a minute-to-minute basis.

The recordings are being done using unmanned cameras established on Le Meridien hotel complex and BPCL Kochi office premises by PESO. They will be in action from two hours before the blasts and last well an hour after the event.

The unmanned cameras will catch every aspect of the blasts live, the most significant of them being the angle of pull or the angle at which the buildings will collapse as the detonators get to work. The timing of the blasts, flying debris, height of the debris pile, and dust accumulation will be recorded and scrutinised. A team of scientists from IIT - Madras will study tremors generated by the blasts. Scientists from the Pollution Control Board (PCB) will examine the environmental impact.

Mr. Venugopal said everything should go as planned. A team of engineers laboured 24 hours a day for around a month to see that everything was ready. It has been a great example of cooperation, he said, He marked out structural engineer Anil Joseph and engineer Subhash for special praise. The Central and State agencies worked closely. Cadre services and engineers drawn from agencies as different as local self-governments, Public Works Department, and the Kochi metro put their heads together for the project.

Such collaborations have made life a little easier, said Mr. Venugopal, who described the task as a challenging one. Lakhs of tonnes of explosives have been detonated under PESO supervision, but bringing down massive building complexes is the first-of-its-kind operation taken up by the agency, he pointed out.

“We have gone over the blast plan several times. The emergency plans, explosives calculations, ensuring four-layer fencing of the pillars, pre-weakening of all no-load-bearing walls, fixtures, plumbing, and stairways were part of the work. Four-layered fencing, with chain link fencing, including covering with geotextile fabric to contain fragments scattered by the blasts, and covering of the surrounding buildings to prevent damage from flying fragments have been ensured,” he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lnnly9/article30538964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-KI-AIR-QUALITYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/demolition-to-go-down-as-record-for-future-generations/article30538965.ece
302,2020/01/11,Evacuation of people from neighbourhood to begin at 7.30 a.m.,"Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will be in force within 200-metre radius of the Maradu apartment complexes being demolished on Saturday, District Collector S. Suhas has said.

He added that restrictions would be withdrawn before 5 p.m. if circumstances permitted. He was announcing the final arrangements for the demolition of the apartment complexes on Saturday and Sunday.

Evacuation of people from the neighbourhood will begin at 7.30 a.m. Pick-up vehicles will be ready to shift them to Sacred Heart College, Thevara, and Fisheries College, Panangad, for temporary shelter.

Those who need special attention will also be attended to, said Mr. Suhas. No drones and boats will be allowed in the prohibited area, he added.

Houses in the neighbourhood will be searched to ensure that there is no one left behind. All are requested to switch off household electrical equipment before they leave home. Windows should be shuttered and doors locked properly to prevent entry of dust into houses.

There will be sirens at 10.30 a.m., 10.55 a.m., 11 a.m., 11.05 a.m, and 11.15 a.m. The last siren will be sounded when the green signal is given for the blast. Fire and rescue personnel will inspect the sites after blasts to give the all-clear signal.

The Collector said stage was set for the demolition work, and the drill had helped in improving arrangements. He added that he expected everything to move in accordance with plans.

A total of 800 police personnel will be deployed to ensure smooth operations. There will also be four fire trucks at each of the building complexes.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/oizl9b/article30538923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-KI-COLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/evacuation-of-people-from-neighbourhood-to-begin-at-730-am/article30538925.ece
303,2020/01/11,Blasts to bring down Maradu apartments today,"H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene, the apartments built in violation of CRZ rules at Maradu, will be knocked down on Saturday using emulsion explosives.

The first blast will take place at the extreme right corner of the ground floor of H2O Holy Faith at 11 a.m., which will then spread to other floors at lightning speed. The explosive materials will go off one after the other at regular intervals, which have been pre-set using delay detonators. It may take 5.6 seconds to reduce the 16-floor building to rubble.

An expert team from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), which inspected the apartment complexes on Friday evening for one last time, suggested relocating the initiation point from where the blast would be triggered at Alfa Serene. The initiation point was relocated some distance away from the earlier spot so as to minimise the possible impact of the demolition of H2O reaching the site. The new location will be 130 metres away from the building, said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, PESO.

The PESO team conducted the final round of inspections on Friday evening so that the sites were free of workers and officials. All wire connections and electrical connectivity were inspected. The wind conditions of the area were also gauged. Since the area is unlikely to have strong winds, the dust should settle in a few minutes after the implosion, said Dr. Venugopal.

The authorities have fully secured a house located close to H2O Holy Faith using geo textiles. No dust or fly-off material will reach the building. Going by the preparations, the first blast should take place at H2O Holy Faith at 11 a.m. and the second at Alfa Serene at 11.05 a.m., he said.

The technicians of Edifice Engineering, which will demolish H2O Holy Faith, will connect the wires from the initiation point to the building at 9 a.m. on Saturday. All connections were re-checked during the day to ensure that the blast takes place as planned. Eight sophisticated action cameras and four drones will be deployed to record the blast. The team members will arrive at the site at 8 a.m. to perform a pooja before the blast, said Uttkarsh Mehta, partner of Edifice Engineering.

Mr. Mehta exuded confidence that the buildings would come down as planned.

Alfa Serene will be connected to the initiation point at 10.30 a.m. on Saturday. Technicians of Vijay Steels, the agency that will bring down the structure, went around all floors of the building, checking the connections on Friday. The connections to all delay detonators were checked.

It was also ensured that all the 3,000-odd holes filled with explosives were connected, said Anand Sharma of Vijay Steels.

304,2020/01/11,Maradu residents rattled by the exercise,"Archa Ashokan, a resident of Ward 16 near Maradu Municipality, along with her Ayalkootam members had a busy day on Friday dishing out fruits and juices at a roadside joint on the Kundannoor-Thevara bridge as a large police force and fire force and media personnel hung around H2O Holy Faith apartments awaiting a drill of the implosion.

“While we cannot question the Supreme Court’s decision, it is sad that the building is coming down,” said Archa as she served cut watermelon to the thirsty. “We are among those who have to move away from home tomorrow. The ordinary people here have much at stake in tomorrow’s event as all houses are under threat,” she added.

The specifics of demolition were known for long, but local residents had never been taken into confidence by the municipality on the likely plan of action like shifting of residents from their homes, said Archa.

“It was only after many of us went to the municipality on Thursday that officials issued notices on clearing the area for around four hours. For no fault of ours, so much trouble has been caused,” she added.

Joseph and Mary stay just around 100 metres away from H2O apartments. A native of the place, Joseph works as a mason. He said his father’s relatives had lived there for 88 years. “There are fears about our house. The municipality has to support us if something happens. It was only yesterday [Thursday] that the municipal authorities came to our house to say that we have to move out for a few hours,” said Mary.

305,2020/01/11,Firemen to be the first responders at blast sites,"Over 100 firemen from 18 fire stations under the Department of Fire and Rescue Services in Ernakulam will be the first responders to reach the sites after the implosion of H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene apartment buildings on Saturday morning.

In what is termed as its first-ever experience with an implosion of such magnitude, fire force personnel are keeping their fingers crossed hoping that the entire process will be over without hiccups. The operation is being approached as if the department is tackling a natural disaster.

“We will be stationed near the 200-metre radius marked by the district administration from the buildings. A siren will be heard immediately after the implosion, and we will rush to the site as the first responders within two minutes to ensure that there are no casualties,” said Gogy J.S., District Fire Officer.

Eight firetenders, thousands of litres of water stored in firetenders and additional water tankers deployed near the blast sites, hydraulic equipment, and a scuba diving team will form part of the firefighting apparatus.

“We will first rule out casualties or impact of the implosion on nearby buildings. The department has deployed both large and small firetenders at the sites to ensure that help is available at once in case of an emergency,” he said.

Meanwhile, firemen pointed out that they did not have a larger role in controlling the dust emerging from the implosion. “It will be addressed by the agencies involved in the implosion. However, our team will be ready to provide all help,” they said.

A scuba diving team will remain alert, especially to tackle emergency situations arising out of the possible impact of the implosion on the nearby Vembanad lake. “We are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the safety of all those who are involved and likely to be impacted by the implosion,” said a fire force official.

307,2020/01/11,Kochi mosque hosts leaders of other religions,"In a friendly gesture, the Kochi Grand Mosque at Kacheripady threw its doors open to members of other religious communities to attend Friday’s congregational namaz at noon.

For its first ‘open day’, possibly the first such in the State according to organisers, the mosque committee had invited believers of different religions to observe the jumma prayer and listen to the khutba, the sermon delivered by the Imam, that precedes the prayers.

“The committee hopes to make the open day a regular affair, inviting not just prominent people to attend prayers, but also encouraging believers to bring their friends, at least once in two months. Attempts will be made to encourage this in mosques across the State,” said Imam M.P. Faisal, whose sermon for the day stressed on the idea that the world subsists on compassion.

Members of the committee said in the current political climate, such a gesture was thought necessary to familiarise people with Muslim customs and religious practices to dispel the fear of the unknown.

The invited guests observed the prayers from the back of the prayer hall and addressed the congregation after the namaz.

Justices Devan Ramachandran and Alexander Thomas of the Kerala High Court who attended the prayers pointed out that it was the first time that they had got to witness the namaz.

“This could be the starting point for inter-religious dialogue and fraternity,” said Justice Thomas.

Fr. Vincent Kundukulam, professor at the St. Joseph’s Pontifical Seminary, Aluva, said such a gathering of people for prayers was in keeping with the diversity of the country, and would send out a strong message that could bring down the walls between religions and allow for conversations among those who practise different faiths.

308,2020/01/11,Need diversity for long-term survival: Nobel Laureate Michael Levitt,"“Each individual life is a matter of pure chance. We do not choose who we are,” Michael Levitt, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, has said.

“Life is not fair. All measures have a distribution. Some individuals are lucky, others are not. There is no natural law of equality,” he said at a lecture held at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) here on Friday.

Mr. Levitt, who won the prestigious honour for the development of multi-scale models for complex chemical systems in 2013, said that “the time-dependent equations governing life are not deterministic – just like three billiard balls or water molecules, they are chaotic.”

Stating that we have to learn from biology, Mr. Levitt said “the important [aspect] is we did not create. We did not create flower. We did not create people. With time Eukaryotes [an organism consisting of a cell or cells in which the genetic material is DNA in the form of chromosomes contained within a distinct nucleus] have become more complicated and therefore more diverse.”

“This way they have more different behaviours rather like a smart investor that diversifies his investments. Because the future is unpredictable, the most diverse species have more chance to survive.

“Evolution of Eukaryotes is not survival of the fittest. It is survival of the most diverse,” he said.

Mr. Levitt said society was better when there were lives of decency for everyone.

“We cannot make people identical as we need diversity for long-term survival. We cannot prevent bad things happening to some individuals,” he said.

Mr. Levitt, who had faced the ire of protesters while holidaying with his wife on the Alappuzha backwaters on January 8, praised Kerala for its scenic beauty. “The world needs more places like Kerala,” he said.

Mr. Levitt also inaugurated the Prof N.R. Madhava Menon Inter-disciplinary Centre for Research Ethics and Protocols under the School of Legal Studies on the occasion. Vice-Chancellor K.N.

309,2020/01/11,The Aahvaan Project has their ektara comment on society,"Vedi Sinha, 27, was drifting along for a while trying to find her niche. The singer-storyteller, who grew up in Delhi, finishing school at Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, and later graduating from a film and video course at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, felt uncertain and out of place for a gruelling few months. It was a chance volunteering stint at the week-long travelling folk music festival in Rajasthan, called the Kabir Yatra, that was a point of pivot in her life.

“I went there sometime in 2015 I think. And I went as a volunteer because I had no money at the time,” she recalls. The first few days were busy and a blur. When she finally had the time to attend a performance in full, she was moved. “It was when a singer, Prahlad ji was singing. I felt everything around me fade. For the next two hours, I was so affected,” she says, adding that she “realised how in the garb of spirituality, the idea of humanity gets shoved in the background, and religion takes over.”

She started writing again, weaving her observations and thoughts about the world into stories. “It is a meditative release of emotions of things I’m seeing and feeling around me. I always wanted to understand and tell stories,” Vedi, who has also been conducting storytelling workshops in government schools, through not-for-profit initiatives like Anjuman, Miracle Foundation, Greenpeace, and Balwadi pre-schools, says. She then bought an ektara,a single stringed instrument that produces a distinct twang, and is often heard accompanying travelling folk singers.

“My sister and I learned classical music for a little while as kids, but I never felt like I was fully able to sing. Folk however, allows you to really let your lungs go,” says Vedi.

It felt like a calling — and so, finding collaborators to put the pieces together, she called her effort The Aahvaan Project. The core members today include her twin Pakhi, and long-time collaborators guitarist Ujjwal Raj Sen and percussionist Makrand Sanon.

The group has been performing in intimate gatherings. Their first gig was just a couple months ago at the Indian Women Press Corps, and later at smaller sabha-styled spaces. Kintsugi Studios, a Delhi-based recording space for indie artists has already had a Kintsugi Singles video recorded and produced The Aahvaan Project’s Chakka (up on YouTube).

Tonight, they will perform an hour-long set, called Kahani Lashon Ke Pul Ki. The piece is told through the eyes of Vedi’s ektara, which observes the stories of people and the state of things as it travels through the country along with the artist.

In addition to Vedi’s words, the set includes snippets of poetry by Ali Sardar Zafri and Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

310,2020/01/11,"Neil Peart, Rush's star drummer, dies aged 67","Neil Peart, the drummer and lyricist of the Canadian rock group Rush, has died at 67 in California of brain cancer, the group announced on Friday.

“It is with broken hearts and the deepest sadness, that we must share the terrible news that on Tuesday, our friend, soul brother and band mate of over 45 years, Neil, has lost his incredibly brave battle with brain cancer, glioblastoma,” they said in a statement posted on Twitter.

Rush was founded in 1968 and Peart joined in 1974, replacing John Rutsey, alongside singer and bass player Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson.

After starting out in hard rock and moving gradually toward jazz rock, Peart was known for his flamboyant style and very precise technique, which won him a legion of admirers among professionals and fans.

Questlove, the drummer for hip-hop group The Roots, posted a black and white photo of Peart on Instagram sitting behind his imposing drum set, sending his condolences.

Danish drummer Lars Ulrich of Metallica also said on Instagram that Peart was a big inspiration for him.

Rush entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.

311,2020/01/11,The best in Indian theatre in 2019: a poll,"Continuing with a tradition that has been bordering almost 10 years now, I asked a bunch of theatrefolk (150 this time, mostly from Mumbai) to vote for their favourite play in 2019. And as is now the norm, this article is about the information we gathered.

The results this time were somewhat unusual. Usually, we have at least 8 to 10 plays with lots of votes, and then a smattering of others. But this year, we have just five productions with lots of votes, and then a big gap, followed by a hell of a lot of plays bubbling under. I don’t have any ground-breaking inference, except that I think that members of this sample have been expanding their horizons as audience members. A case in point is actor-choreographer-director Amey Mehta, who recently posted that he watched 17 plays in 2019, across genres and styles, which is a commendable figure.

In the past couple of years, mental health has become a topic of much concern and healthy discussion. It both makes sense and feels good that two of the plays in the top 5 deal with this, the first of which tops the list as the most loved play of the year.

Every Brilliant Thing by Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahoe — A one-man show, performed with ease and effervescence by the underexposed and underrated Vivek Madan, and deftly directed by the wonderful Quasar Thakore Padamsee. This is a highly interactive show, with the audience members participating, some even stepping in to play characters. I’m usually petrified of engagement while watching a play, but this production made it so organic that it didn’t bother me one bit. It is also an important play, about a man trying to compile a list of things that make life worth living, prompted by his mother’s attempted suicide when he was just a boy. A moving, must-watch experience that, in my opinion, deserves to be top of the heap.

It also makes me happy that I was involved with two of the top 5 plays, as was Padamsee, who took on the very difficult task of lighting the play with the second highest number of votes: The Kite Runner by Matthew Spangler, based on Khaled Hosseini’s novel. Also the first of the two Aadyam productions on this list, the advance booking of this play made me realise what a phenomenon the novel is — nine sold-out shows in massive venues. Spangler has pulled off the impossible and managed to siphon the essence of the novel into a two-hour script. Despite being set in Kabul and San Francisco, against the backdrop of the politics of Afghanistan and the U.S., the human story at the core of it seemed to strike a chord with Indian audiences.

Coming in third is Sounding Vanya, Rehaan Engineer’s experimental reinterpretation of Anton Chekov’s classic, Uncle Vanya. The cast boasted some powerhouse women performers, including Ira Dubey, Kalki Koechlin and Puja Sarup.

Bubbling under

Next is another play on mental health: What Planet Are You On? deals with a schoolboy who realises he has attention deficit disorder (ADD) and his journey then on. Siddharth Kumar, well in his 30s, plays the protagonist from ages 9 to 13 in an endearing and sincere performance. This is a feel-good play that has resonated with parents and teachers as much as children.

Rounding off the top 5 is another Aadyam production, A Few Good Men directed by Aadyam doyen Nadir Khan. This play by Hollywood writer Aaron Sorkin is what the movie was based on. Rajit Kapur played the part made famous by Jack Nicholson, while Neil Bhoopalam and Ira Dubey took on the roles essayed by Tom Cruise and Demi Moore. The production remained gripping, and the actors brought new things to the roles, particularly Bhoopalam, who infused an irresistible quirky energy into Daniel Kaffee. Also, the play had one of the finest sets I have seen on the Indian stage. Hats off to the production designer.

There is a whole bunch of plays in the ‘bubbling under’ category that got a significant amount of love. Motley’s Aurat Aurat Aurat, a collection of pieces by Ismat Chugtai, and Adishakti’s Bali, a retelling of an episode from the Ramayana, have been around and popular for a while; Baksa, a play with no dialogue, from the latest edition of Thespo, was widely appreciated; a production from Delhi, Bhagi Hui Ladkiyan, made some waves and received a jury mention at the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards; Mohit Takalkar’s Chaheta, adapted from a Palestinian play, added to his impressive oeuvre; Man Maana Square, which premiered at Thespo 2018, continued to win praise. And last but not least by a long shot, the new Patchworks Ensemble production, Shikaar, a devised comedy about chudails (witches), seemed to have earned a loyal following. I’m hoping to catch the next shows of some of these.

312,2020/01/11,"Amidst protests, PM Modi and Mamata meet at Raj Bhawan","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met on Saturday at Raj Bhawan, amidst ongoing protests across Kolkata against the amended Citizenship Act.

The agenda of the meeting has not been disclosed.

The politically significant meeting between the two leaders took place a short time after the PM arrived in Kolkata on a two-day visit.

The meeting comes at a time when new citizenship law has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the State, with Ms. Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress opposing the contentious legislation tooth and nail, and the BJP pressing for its implementation.

Mr. Modi, who will be in Kolkata on Saturday and Sunday, is scheduled to attend the function marking the 150th anniversary of Kolkata Port Trust on January 12 and other programmes.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tpjcmp/article30476345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03MAMATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/pm-modi-arrives-in-kolkata-on-two-day-visit-amidst-protests/article30543334.ece
313,2020/01/11,The anatomy of resistance: how the anti-CAA movement took shape in West Bengal,"Abdul, 37, works at a roadside barber’s shop in Agarpara. He does not know too much about what the NRC is or what it means for him. “I know more now from having walked in rallies, though,” he says.

When I ask him if he will participate in future protests against the NRC, he says nonchalantly, “If need be.”

“Our area is mini India; we have people from every State here. We don’t know any differences,” he says.

Afterwards, he asks me if I am a journalist. “You can draw a cartoon of a great ghost,” he suggests, “Label it ‘NRC.’”

On December 19, Kolkata saw a 60,000-strong rally which managed to bring together people cutting across social, economic, cultural and religious groups.

Deliberations on resistance began in Kolkata in August 2019, a year after about 40 lakh people were left stateless after the publication of the second draft NRC for Assam.

""At first, it was only a vague idea: that we must do something to counter this,"" said Sukhendu Sarkar, Associate Professor of Economics at Sivanath Shastri College and social activist for over four decades. The 'No NRC' Movement group was formed with an organising committee of seven. On September 5, 2019, the organisation created a public Facebook group and within one month and five days, the member strength rose to one lakh.

The committee adopted several resolutions. ""One of them was to not engage political parties or their frontal organisations in their organisational capacity. It was an open call to the people to be a part of the movement, so that anyone could be included"" says Mr. Sarkar. ""Our movement works on one core principle: that whoever is now residing in India and whose ancestors used to live in pre-1947 undivided India, must be treated as citizens of India.""

At first, district-preparatory units were constituted. ""We campaigned in 10 districts. In Howrah, North 24 Parganas, Birbhum, Maldah and Nadia, we were able to form district-level units,"" said Mr. Sarkar. From September to December, the ‘No NRC’ Movement held 84 street-corner meetings and three rallies, and printed10,000posters and 5,400 booklets. ₹1,50,000 was collected in donations. ""We place our monthly accounts every month before our members,"" said Mr. Sarkar.

However, on the day of the rally, the organisers were faced with an unforeseen issue. ""After the CAA came into being, people came down to the streets spontaneously throughout the State, and in some areas, incidents of violence erupted. Long-distance trains were stopped, thus leaving out people from two of our key districts — Maldah and Murshidabad,"" said Mr. Sarkar. These were the two places from where 30,000 participants were expected. Yet, the proportion that the rally assumed belied expectations.

It brought together students, teachers, artists, social activists; from queer communities and hijab-clad women, to jute mill workers. ""The funny thing was that we had not been given formal permission for the rally. However, on the 19th, the police started requesting us to hold the rally adjacent to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation office — the same place which had earlier been refused by the administration,"" said Mr. Sarkar.

Biplab Bhattacharya of Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, who was also a key convener of the December 19 rally, said youth participation at the district-level meetings was unprecedented. ""At places like Chanchol or Harishchandrapur, we had 10,000 and 12,000 footfall respectively, which exceeded our expectations by far. With the CAA, the government has firstly managed to insult the sensibilities of the youth, having asked them to prove their citizenship. Secondly, it has hurt the Bengali identity.""

Mr. Sarkar agreed: “In Bengal, about two crores have been branded ghuspaithiyas - which is 20% of the State population. Of the 19,06,657 left out of the NRC in Assam, 18 lakh were Bengalis — coincidentally, that is also 20% of Assam’s Bengali population.”

However, while the protests have proceeded more or less unhindered, the situation is far from ideal, said Mrinmoy Sarkar, a member of Progressive Democratic Students Federation, who has campaigned for various protests in the State.

He has been a part of student protests in various institutions across Bengal, including Jadavpur University, Medical College, Indian Statistical Institute, Biswa Bharati, Presidency. On December 21, a rally of about 5000 students was conducted.

While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's declared anti-CAA stance has helped, it is not a situation that brings much hope, says Mr. Sarkar. “When the amendment to the Citizenship Act was brought in 2003, there had been complete political silence. That was the root of today's troubles,"" said Mr. Sarkar.

Debotri Goswami, member of ‘Feminists in Resistance’, was recently in news after she and her colleagues were attacked while trying to hold a peaceful information campaign in Kolkata's Baghajatin. A man beat them up with bamboo sticks while chanting 'Jai Shri Ram'. Ms. Goswami believes their attacker had been ""brainwashed"". ""When we tried asking him questions after he was subdued, he kept chanting 'Jai Shri Ram'. When people who had gathered around pounced on him, we tried to stop them. We offered him water but he refused it, saying he was sure we had poisoned it.""

Even at the face of violence, Ms. Goswami believes peace is still the answer, ideologically and tactically. ""People could see we had been singing and distributing leaflets when we were attacked. Solidarity poured in for us the next day,"" she said.

The way forward

The ‘No NRC’ Movement now aims higher. Their plan of action is to organise resistance through all the 23 districts of West Bengal.

Sukhendu Sarkar calls it a civic resistance expedition. On January 6, 2020, the group called for a meeting to devise a plan of action. Invitation to participate has been thrown open to the masses.

It has now added the cause of the JNU students who were violently attacked by masked miscreants to its agitation.

Ms. Goswami and ‘Feminists in Resistance’ organised a flash mob, comprising 100 women, on January 4, 2020. “The idea was for it to be like what happened in Chile,” she said.

Their members have attended rallies organised throughout the State. In Kolkata, they have targeted the colonies of mostly settlers in the southern region, where they have distributed leaflets and conducted information campaigns.

“We really believe in the power of music to spread messages,” she said. “Of course, we wouldn’t go for Brahma sangeet. We know the masses wouldn’t take to that.” Instead, the group plans to use music like that out of renowned Bengali film ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’.

Mrinmoy Sarkar also said that protests are now planned to go beyond first tier education institutes in the State. On January 8, the organisation participated in a State-wide students’ strike against police violence on students and privatisation of education. Campaigning is expected to reach out to districts like Hooghly and Murshidabad where student response has been massive.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/xapkjj/article30542512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/modi-effigy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/the-anatomy-of-resistance-how-the-anti-caa-movement-took-shape-in-west-bengal/article30542590.ece
314,2020/01/11,TMC youth wing to protest during Mamata’s meeting with Modi,"Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), the youth wing of Mamata Banerjee-led party will be holding a protest near the Governor's House at 4 pm on Saturday, even as she will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi around the same time.

After the meeting, Ms. Banerjee is expected to walk to the nearby Rani Rashmani road around 5 pm to join the TMCP's sit-in demonstration.

Senior TMC leaders said there was “nothing wrong in it.”

“Why is it a problem? Can’t the Chief Minister meet the Prime Minister?,” asked Subrata Bakshi, a senior TMC leader.

Mr. Bakshi was stationed at an enclosure diagonally opposite Governor’s House at the outer edge of Rani Rashmani road where the TMC’s students’ wing will demonstrate from morning.

The “sit-in demonstration” is directed against Mr. Modi.

“Is there a doubt that it is against him [Mr. Modi],” asked Mr. Bakshi.

Section 144 of CrPC has been imposed around Governor’s House stretching almost up to the edge of the river to prohibit any large-scale assembly, the police officials said.

However, Section 144 has not been imposed on the other side of the road, where the TMC’s stage is raised to protest against the visit.

The protest is also directed against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Meanwhile, civil society activists largely comprising students, have brought out multiple rallies from various parts of the city which are expected to converge near Governor's House.

Mr. Modi will land at Kolkata airport around 3 pm. He will later be flown in to the city in a helicopter.

He is expected to land at the Race Course, adjacent to Eastern Command Headquarters and drive the two-km distance to Raj Bhavan.

The Chief Minister is expected to meet Mr. Modi before he starts his engagements in the city at Governor’s House, early in the evening.

The area, with giant billboards of Mr. Modi, has been sanitised by the joint forces of security.

Water cannons are placed strategically along the stretch, particularly behind the TMC’s stage.

However, the student leaders of the TMC are not expecting a huge turnout.

However, more than two dozen civil society groups, human rights organisations, social groups and activists are expected to throng the stretch, protesting against CAA, which came “into force” from Friday.

The activists will protest against the implementation of the NRC and Mr. Modi’s visit.

Both Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force personnel are guarding the stretch between the helipad and Governor’s House.

The entire area has been cordoned off with temporary barricades made of bamboo. Movement of vehicles will be stopped closer to Mr. Modi’s visit, the police officials said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/8l4hsh/article30542090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trinamool-Congress-students-wing-protest-venue,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tmc-youth-wing-to-protest-during-mamatas-meeting-with-modi/article30542091.ece

316,2020/01/11,Mamata likely to meet Modi in Kolkata,"Union Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the State Secretariat and extended her an invitation to attend the sesquicentenary celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust ( KoPT) on Sunday, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also scheduled to be present.

The development has triggered the strong possibility of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister sharing the dais at the event.

Sources in the State secretariat said Ms. Banerjee had accepted the invitation and was likely to participate in the event.

The Prime Minister will arrive in the city on Saturday afternoon and attend an event organized by the Ministry of Culture at the Currency Building in Dalhousie, followed by the inauguration of a light and sound show on the Howrah Bridge at Millenium Park and later a visit to the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission at Belur in Howrah district.

Speculation is rife that the Chief Minister can meet the Prime Minister at the Raj Bhawan on Saturday evening itself. According to sources a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders may be organised on the sidelines of a dinner hosted by the Raj Bhawan where the Prime Minister is staying.

The likely meeting of the Chief Minister and Prime Minister assumes significance amidst widespread protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act led by the Chief Minister herself. Ms Banerjee, however, has refused to participate in the anti-CAA protests by Opposition in New Delhi on January 13.

Meanwhile elaborate security arrangements have been made considering Prime Minister’s visit as here is apprehension among security agencies that protesters may try to protest in front of the Prime Minister convoy.

The route of Prime Minister’s convoy is being sanitized and on Friday police put barricades near Kaikhali near Airport where protesters are likely to gather. Another protests is planned at Esplanade from where the protesters are likely to march to the Raj Bhawan.

It is still not clear whether the Prime Minister will travel by road or take the ariel route. On Friday morning security officials also tried to take a stock of the riverine route at Millennium park from where the Prime Minister could take the a vessel to Belur, avoiding the road travel of about 9 km. “There will be strong deployment of police since saturday morning. We will keep of watch for any flash protests along the route of Prime Minister’s convoy,” a senior police official said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/9s3zyj/article30538192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mamata-Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/mamata-likely-to-meet-modi-in-kolkata/article30538146.ece
317,2020/01/11,DPC chairman post goes to AIADMK,"The AIADMK wrested the district panchayat council chairperson post in the elections held on Saturday.

Indirect elections were held for the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson of district panchayat council, and chairmen of panchayat unions in the district.

According to officials, R. Sathya of the AIADMK was elected as chairman of the DPC. Of 12 panchayat unions in the district, the AIADMK bagged 6, the DMK 4 and the AMMK one.

Election to the Kovilpatti panchayat union chairman could not be held as the official Jayachandran was stated to be ‘sick.’

The DMK bagged PU chairmen posts in Thoothukudi, Udangudi, Alwarthirunagari and Oddapidaram.

The AIADMK won in Tiruchendur, Srivaikuntam, Satankulam, Karungulam, Vilathikulam and Pudur. The AMMK won in Kayathar PU.

The intra party feud in the DMK in the district was exposed in the indirect elections held in Oddapidaram panchayat union chairman post. According to officials, two factions - one belonging to Geetha Jeevan and another in support of Anitha Radhakrishnan - were in the fray. As they bagged equal number of seats, the PU chairman has to be elected by vote. Out of 22 ward members, the DMK polled 12, AIADMK 5, Independents 2, CPI (M) 2 and Congress 1. The DMK ward member Kasi Viswanathan, owing allegiance to Ms. Geetha Jeevan, and Ramesh, a supporter of Mr. Anitha Radhakrishnan, polled 11 votes each. As the verdict ended in a tie, the polling officer Sugumar picked up the names of two contenders - Kasi Viswanathan and Ramesh - and dropped it in a box. A retired official, on request, picked up the name of Ramesh from the box and thus he was declared winner.

Meanwhile, senior DMK leader and Thoothkudi MP Kanimozhi, who was here to participate in a Pongal festival celebration held at a college, visited Kovilpatti after the cadre complained of the election being deferred.

Collector T.G. Vinay clarified on Friday that bull tamers aged between 18 and 45, who maintained good health and met other criteria specified by the Health department, could take part in jallikattu events to be conducted in Madurai district.

An official communication from the district administration on Wednesday had stated that only those aged between 21 and 45 could take part in the events at Avaniyapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur.

Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, the Collector said the decision to fix 21 years as the minimum age initially came from a report submitted in 2018 by the Health department which said most participants who sustained injuries were in the age group of 18-21. “Hence, there was a recommendation in this regard. However, there has not been any formal communication. Those who were above 18 years and maintaining good health would be allowed to take part,” he said.

Pon. Kumar, a jallikattu enthusiast from Alanganallur, said the people between 18 and 21 years were usually college students, who were now deeply interested in jallikattu. “Although this news will be received with joy, they will have lost a day in registration. If they had clarified in advance, many youth would have queued up on Friday itself,” he said.

Dr. Vinay said there would not be any problems in extending the date for registration for the three events. “I will inform my staff to permit those who are between 18 and 21 years to participate tomorrow (Saturday) morning as well,” he said.

On the first day, 800 applications were received, of which 55 were rejected. The 745 participants selected for the event satisfied the conditions put forth by the administration, including having a body mass index between 19 and 25.

Vedavyasa Kamath, Mangaluru City South MLA, has said that ₹1.22-crore grant had been given for various development works for Kudroli ward as per the public’s demand after the Congress rule ended in the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC).

In a statement here, Mr. Kamath said ₹60 lakh was released from the Minorities Welfare Department while ₹10 lakh was released for road-widening at Kambala Cross near the Protestant church.

Karbal Road was improved at a cost of ₹20 lakh, he said, adding that development works near Vishranthi Nilaya Church have got ₹20 lakh grant.

He said ₹10 lakh grant, released from natural calamity funds, will be used to repair the embankment of the stormwater drain from Barke to Automatrix Apartments.

The ₹30 lakh grant given from the Chief Minister’s special grant would be used for the development of Alake market.

The MLA further said that ₹5 lakh was given for stormwater drain works, another ₹5 lakh for drain works at Kudroli, and ₹5 lakh for underground drainage works, out of the ₹15 lakh grants from the MCC common fund.

Mr. Kamath said that ₹4 lakh was provided to address drinking water problem in the ward while ₹2.5 lakh was given to fix UGD pipeline issue at Kandathpalli.

Another ₹1.5 lakh was given for drinking water pipe linking work in Kudroli, he added.

323,2020/01/11,Education should develop critical thinking among youth: V-C,"Underlining the need for colleges and universities to focus on sunrise technologies, Gautam Buddha University Vice-Chancellor Bhagawati Prakash Sharma on Saturday said it was necessary to reinvent the infrastructure of higher education institutions and bring in innovations in the teaching method.

Delivering the keynote address at a conference on ‘Challenges of Higher Education Teacher Initiatives’, Mr. Sharma said that if the country has to progress, the youth need education that helps to develop their critical thinking.

“Education is not packing human minds but developing critical thinking and building innovations,” he said.

The young graduates, he said, should be sensitised about emerging technologies.

Rather than sunset technologies, colleges, universities and research institutions should focus on sunrise sectors and technologies and include it in the curriculum. This curriculum should not be disjunct from country’s natural ethos but provide scientific, social and other information in our ancient texts, he said.

Infrastructure in many universities and institutes of eminence, he said, was far from the desired level to foster innovation. “Many institutions, including that of mine, still do not have systems with 16GB RAM necessary to teach artificial intelligence,” he said.

Expressing his concern over Indian universities not figuring among the top institutions in the world, Mangalore University Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya said the higher education institutions should focus on making youth employable.

Experiential learning should be encouraged and 30% of curriculum should have skill-based component, he said.

325,2020/01/11,Mangalore University’s Narayana Guru Chair to get a building of its own,"Mangalore University will construct a building to house the Brahmasri Narayana Guru Study Chair on its premises at an estimated cost of ₹ 3.5 crore.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya said that the building will be constructed in phases.

To start with, the university will construct a part of the ground floor out of the ₹ 50 lakh given by B.K. Hariprasad from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme Funds. The remaining construction will be taken up with further grant of funds, he said.

The Vice-Chancellor said that the ground floor will have the reformer’s statue which will be placed in such a way that sunlight will fall on his face.

The ground floor will have a courtyard, a meditation hall, two meeting rooms, library and administrative office. On the first floor, the university proposed four classrooms, a museum, a library and two rooms for lecturers.

This building will come up in the land that is close to the residence of the Vice-Chancellor. The university proposes to build offices of 19 other study chairs around this building if funds are made available. “We want to have all study chairs in this place,” he said.

The foundation stone for the work will be laid at 10.30 a.m. on Sunday. District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivasa Poojary and Mr. Hariprasad will be present. Mr. Poojary has promised additional funds for the building, Mr. Yadapadithaya said.

More funds

Each one of the study chairs, he said, requires a fixed grant of at least ₹ 2 crore for effective functioning. At present, grants vary and heads of the chairs are expressing difficulty in conducting programmes with the available funds. The university has asked State government for a grant of ₹ 2 crore in addition to the ₹ 1 crore that has been granted for the Yakshagana Study Chair, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/46tt0s/article30538382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MNPSYADAPADITHAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mangalore-universitys-narayana-guru-chair-to-get-a-building-of-its-own/article30538383.ece

Inaugurating the 10-day Karavali Utsav at the Karavali Grounds here on Friday, Mr. Shetty said that through his film Sarakari Hiriya Prathamika Shale Koduge Ramanna Rai he has thrown light on the fight against the closure of a Kannada-medium school and the dislike of parents for Kannada-medium schools. “I have in the film shown the atmosphere that prevailed during my schools days,” he said. “I have used the medium I know to reflect on the problem of Kannada-medium schools and find a solution,” he said.

Incidentally, on Friday, the State government adjudged the film as the best entertainer for 2018.

District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said that the people from the coastal area are very passionate about their art, culture and language. This was reflected in the way people took up the legal battle to retain the traditional sport Kambala.

Mangaluru South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath said that the festival has enough events that will bring relief to citizens who had gone through some stressful days.

327,2020/01/11,Automakers in south tap exports,"Some automobile majors in the south have resorted to increasing their exports to partially offset the impact caused by the ongoing economic slowdown. Shipping vehicles or chasses to neighbouring countries, other parts of Asia and Africa, have helped keep the tempo up for these automakers

From January to December 2019, two ports located in Chennai collectively handled 3.43 lakh units, an increase of 10.28% over the previous year. The vehicles included passenger cars, buses, trucks, car accessories.

Hyundai Motors was the biggest beneficiary, posting a 13.33% growth over the previous year, exporting 1.52 lakh units. These figures do not include vehicles sent overseas as completely knocked down units.

H2 better than first half

Renault-Nissan exported 84,000 units against 74,464 units. The volume in the first half of 2019 was muted but picked up in the second half due to new launches such as the Renault Triber, Kwid and Duster. Ford posted a marginal increase of 4% in its export volume at 90,000 units, while Toyota showed 9% growth. Honda, which has a manufacturing unit in the North, stopped exporting cars from Kamarajar Port and opted to do so from the West coast due to the logistics cost of sending vehicles from Noida.

New entrant Kia Motors shipped 11,000 units in three months from the Chennai Port. It is likely to increase its export volume and product variants too, said a company official. Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland, which was also impacted by the slowdown in the segment, exported about 170 units against 64 units in 2018. Daimler posted 19% growth to end the year with 5,295 units.

Kamarajar Port handled 1.9 lakh units against 1.76 lakh units in 2018.

The company has raised term loan facilities of €1.75 billion from 19 banks.

“This represents a reduction of €500 million versus the external debt outstanding in Tata Steel Europe as of March 2019, enabling the standalone European business to have a more robust balance sheet, while also putting in significant efforts at restructuring and improving its operating performance,” the company said in a statement.

These facilities have also been contracted at ‘favourable terms and more efficient pricing’, besides extending the maturity profile relative to the existing ones.

330,2020/01/11,Former Boeing CEO gets $62.2 million but loses some benefits,"The Boeing CEO who was ousted last month for the company’s botched response to two crashes and the grounding of its best-selling plane will walk away with $62.2 million, the company disclosed Friday.

Boeing said, however, that Dennis Muilenburg will not get additional severance or a 2019 bonus, and will forfeit stock awards worth $14.6 million.

Mr. Muilenburg, who spent more than 30 years at Boeing, also has unexercised stock options that he has held since 2013 and that are worth more than $18.5 million at Friday’s closing price.

Mr. Muilenburg was fired in late December after failing to get the company’s 737 Max jetliner back in the air.

Boeing board Chairman David Calhoun will take over as CEO on Monday. He is a former General Electric and Nielsen executive with a reputation as a turnaround specialist.

Mr. Calhoun, 62, will get a base salary of $1.4 million but potentially several million more in bonuses and stock awards, including $7 million if he gets the Max back in service.

The Max was grounded last March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. It has taken far longer than Boeing expected to fix the plane. This month, Boeing will halt production until it is clear when changes to the plane will be approved by regulators.

Mr. Muilenberg was named CEO in 2015 and presided over a rapid rise in the Chicago-based company’s stock price. The shares have dropped 26% in the last 10 months, however, as the Max’s recovery stalled.

Months before Mr. Muilenburg’s ouster, some lawmakers and relatives of passengers who died in the Max crashes had asked him to resign or take a cut in pay.

At a congressional hearing in October, Mr. Muilenburg parried questions about his compensation by saying it was set by Boeing’s board. A few days later, he announced he would not take a bonus for 2019 - that he would walk away from “tens of millions” of dollars as a signal that he was taking responsibility for correcting problems with the Max.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/w28cc7/article30382158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOEINGCEO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/former-boeing-ceo-gets-622-million-but-loses-some-benefits/article30541769.ece
331,2020/01/11,Taking a holistic approach to dengue,"The advent of a new tetravalent vaccine against the dengue virus has thrown new light into the evidence-based management of dengue. An article recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that this vaccine confers about 80% protection to children vaccinated between 4 and 16 years of age without any major side effects. It was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multi-centre trial which included 20,017 participants from the dengue-endemic countries. However, apart from promoting the use of the vaccine, gaining control over dengue will also require a holistic approach that has to include within its ambit vector control and proper case management.

Dengue is essentially a tropical disease that occurs in the countries around the Equator; hot weather and intermittent rainfall favour the sustenance of Aedes aegypti — the vector transmitting the dengue virus —and Aedes albopictus, a minor contributor. Aedes eggs can remain dormant for more than a year and will hatch once they come in contact with water. Urbanisation, poor town planning, and improper sanitation are the major risk factors for the multiplication of such mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes cannot fly beyond a hundred metres. Hence, keeping the ambience clean can help prevent their breeding. Further, these mosquitoes bite during the daytime, so keeping the windows shut in the day hours is also useful.

Shortage of skilled manpower

Many other source reduction activities can be undertaken, including preventing water stagnation and using chemical larvicides and adulticides. These chemicals need to be applied in periodic cycles to kill the larvae that remain even after the first spray.

Unfortunately, the number of skilled workers available for such measures is low; many posts in government departments remain vacant despite there being a dire public health need. Due to this deficiency of manpower, active surveillance is not being done in India, says the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program.

Also, dengue cases are often under-reported due to political reasons and also to avoid spreading panic among the common people. Further, there is a lack of coordination between the local bodies and health departments in the delivery of public health measures. A comprehensive mechanism is required to address these issues.

Moreover, epidemiological measures are essential in the management of any communicable disease. Singapore uses one successful model of mapping and analysing data on dengue, using Geographical Information System (GIS). This involves mapping the streets with dengue cases for vector densities.

Dengue is mostly an asymptomatic infection, and only a very few develop severe disease. Those very young or very old and those who have a chronic ailment are at a greater risk of developing severe disease. But the worldwide case fatality rate is as low as 0.3%. The dengue virus has four serotypes and only a second infection with a different serotype will cause a severe disease.

Fluid management is the cornerstone in the management of severe diseases like dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Here, the role of platelet depletion in exacerbating the condition of a patient is overemphasised even by many medical personnel. Contrary to the common belief, platelet transfusions are not needed even in cases of active bleeding, as per the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). Coagulation abnormalities are not due to a reduction in the number of platelets alone. This is why the WHO recommends fresh whole blood or packed cell transfusion in the event of bleeding. The platelet count will increase automatically as fever subsides.

Alternative medicine drugs

Finally, despite the adequate and well-formed guidelines for the management of dengue cases by the WHO and the Indian government, the usage of complementary medicines like Nilavembu kudineer (a Siddha medicine) and papaya leaf extract are rampant among the people. Nilavembu sooranam, which reportedly contains about nine different substances, has been widely promoted for use to treat dengue fever despite the safety of and complex interactions among its different constituents not having been tested.

The efficacy of Nilavembu kudineer in the management of several other diseases is based on very primitive forms of research like case reports, in-vitro studies, and animal studies. There are case reports where Andrographis paniculata, an active constituent of Nilavembu sooranam, showed anti-fertility effects in animal models, causing abortion. Even meta-analysis of various studies has shown that there is no credible evidence for the use of papaya extract in dengue fever. However, for unknown reasons, even some pharmaceutical companies are being allowed to market papaya extract pills.

In Tamil Nadu, complementary medicine practitioners often argue that a proper double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial cannot be conducted as it involves huge money and manpower. Though this argument is partially correct, patients cannot be treated as guinea pigs. For any medicine, safety is more important than efficacy. Every modern medicine drug has come out after rigorous safety and efficacy studies for around 10 years, with an informed declaration of the side effects. Hence, instead of carrying out distribution of medicines like Nilavembu kudineer, the government can concentrate its energies on other public health activities.

Modern medicine is not against any complementary medicine; when such a medicine is approved after rigorous testing, modern medicine will absorb it, and there are many examples of that. However, in the absence of evidence, the efficacy of such medicines remains in the realm of belief instead of science.

332,2020/01/11,Eloquently reticent: On validity of J&K curbs,"If enunciating the law and laying down norms for the exercise of executive power were the only functions of a constitutional court, the Supreme Court’s verdict on the prolonged lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is indeed admirable. However, the apex court is also a court of justice, one duty-bound to enforce fundamental rights. It cannot limit itself to opinions on the extent to which those rights can be restricted. It has to give effect to the principles it enunciates and rule whether the state violated the fundamental rights of its citizens. The disappointing aspect of the verdict is the court’s failure to give a ruling on the validity of the government’s actions. It fails to hold the government to account for the manner in which it exercised its powers. It states categorically that an indefinite ban on the Internet is impermissible, but fails to direct the restoration of services. When it says Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure “cannot be used as a tool to prevent the legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights”, it makes a comment worthy of being treasured in these times of frequent resort to that section. Yet, the court does not go beyond directing the authorities to review all their orders and restrictions forthwith.

There are indeed valuable takeaways from the judgment. A key holding is that the use of the Internet as a medium for free speech as well as for trade and commerce is constitutionally protected. It also lays down that any reasonable restriction on fundamental rights, be it an Internet ban or a Section 144 order, will have to survive the test of proportionality, that is, the restriction should be proportionate to the necessity for such a measure. At the same time, it cautions against the “excessive utility” of the proportionality doctrine in matters of national security. Of great value to future challenges to executive action is the principle that there can be no ‘secret orders’. The government is bound to publish all orders it passes regarding such restrictions so that they can be challenged in a court of law. It is here that the verdict acquires another unusual character. Having rejected the government’s stand that it could not produce all the orders on the restrictions imposed since August 4, 2019, the court fails to strike them down on that ground. After all, it concurrently says every order imposing a restriction should state the reason, the exigency that necessitated it and the features that make it clear that it is the least intrusive measure. The absence of such order in the public domain is evidence that the state failed to demonstrate its necessity. It is a sign of the success of the ‘national security’ narrative that undergirds the government’s position on J&K that an apex court judgment in a fundamental rights case appears to have the character of an advisory opinion.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eloquently-reticent-on-validity-of-jk-curbs/article30537388.ece
333,2020/01/11,A health emergency: On risk of international spread of poliovirus,"Based on the risk of international spread of poliovirus, the World Health Organization announced on January 7 that polio will continue to remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for three months. The decision was taken based on the recommendation of the emergency committee under the international health regulations that assessed the situation last month. The committee arrived at the unanimous decision based on the “rising risk” of international spread of wild poliovirus type-1. Polio was declared as PHEIC in 2014 and has continued to remain one since then. There were 156 cases of wild polio type-1 cases in 2019 compared with 28 in 2018. With 128 cases, Pakistan accounted for the most number of cases, while Afghanistan reported 28 cases. Besides the four-fold increase in cases, there were instances of the wild type-1 virus getting exported from Pakistan to Iran and Afghanistan, as also on the spread from Afghanistan to Pakistan. In addition to the virus causing polio in children, it was found in the environment in Pakistan and, to a lesser extent, in Afghanistan. This is particularly a concern as the number of children not vaccinated in Afghanistan has been increasing. In 2018, a total of 8,60,000 children in Afghanistan did not receive polio vaccine due to security threats. The situation did not improve in 2019 and, as a result, a large cohort of children in the southern region of the country remains unprotected. Therefore, even other parts of the country that have been free of the virus in the past are at risk of outbreaks.

An equally disturbing development is on the outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus cases in 16 countries; in all, there were 249 vaccine-derived poliovirus cases in 2019. Surprisingly, of them, only 30 were in countries where vaccine-derived poliovirus is endemic. “The rapid emergence of multiple circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2 strains in several countries is unprecedented and very concerning, and not yet fully understood,” the committee noted. But, not a single case of vaccine-derived poliovirus was reported from Afghanistan, while Pakistan had just 12 cases. In comparison, the number of cases in Angola was 86 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo was 63. While Nigeria reported 18 cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus, not a single case of wild poliovirus type-1 has been reported from the country for over three years; the last reported case was in August 2016.

334,2020/01/11,Namma Metro’s discount for smart card holders least among major cities,"Come January 20 and Bengaluru’s Namma Metro discount offered to smart card holders will be the least among the incentives offered by metro services in other major cities.

Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has announced that the discount offered on smart cards will be reduced from 15% to 5% with effect from January 20. Regular passengers using Namma Metro have expressed their anger against slashing of discount and alleged that BMRCL’s move would discourage people from using public transport.

Delhi Metro offers 10% discount to smart card passengers. In addition to this, smart card holders get 10% more discount if they travel during non-peak hours. Kochi Metro offers 20% discount for every metro ride. Hyderabad and Chennai metros too offer 10% discount.

Nayana, a metro passenger, said: “BMRCL has drastically reduced the discount offered for smart cards. Like other metros, they should have at least kept the discount at 10% instead of reducing it to 5%.”

Akash Narayan, another passenger, said: “The government should support public transport companies like BMRCL by compensating revenue loss and subsiding the fares. The State government had earlier announced that they would give financial support to BMTC to reduce the fare, but they are still buying time. Only public transport can help reduce the traffic and pollution in the city.” The daily ridership in Namma Metro has touched 4 lakh and 62% of the passengers are using smart cards to commute on both purple and green lines.

BMRCL, while making the announcement about reducing the discount, had cited increasing operational cost as one of the factors.

Ajay Seth, Managing Director of BMRCL, said: “For the current year, BMRCL is estimated to collect ₹400 crore as fare box revenue and ₹40 crore as non-fare box revenue and to meet the operational expenses, it requires ₹380 crore and ₹120 crore to pay as interest for loans borrowed. There is a revenue gap of ₹60 crore. Operational cost has increased owing to various factors that include induction of six-car trains, maintenance, security, and increased salary costs.”

When asked about other metros offering a discount of 10% and more, he said: “Since 2011, BMRCL has not made significant changes in the metro fare while Delhi has made revisions twice. In addition to operating the existing network, BMRCL has to plan the future expansion of metro network in the city and mobilise capital for it.”

Mr. Seth also said that BMRCL had incurred revenue loss of ₹10 crore as there is a ban on outdoor advertisement. He said that the State government has been requested to allow the display the advertisements on metro properties by making required policy changes.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xvsgjy/article30546002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/namma-metros-discount-for-smart-card-holders-least-among-major-cities/article30546003.ece

336,2020/01/11,"Over 4,000 saplings planted along Ulsoor lake","It was bright and sunny on Saturday morning when hundreds of people gathered at Ulsoor lake and planted more than 4,000 saplings of different species under the banner ‘Koti Vraksha Sainya’.

Several organisations, including Citizens for Bengaluru, Halasur Residents’ Welfare Association, Heritage Beku, and Citizens4Citizens, came together to plant the indigenous species along the one-km stretch next to the storm water drain in Ulsoor lake. The aim is to plant more than 8,000 saplings in the same stretch with the objective of creating a mini-forest.

According to a press release, to tackle the problems of depleting groundwater, high pollution and reducing green cover, the Koti Vraksha Sainya is committed to creating many such mini-forests, biodiversity parks, and neighbourhood trees. This, as many studies have concluded that it’s the best way to increase green cover, improve groundwater level, and reduce pollution, will be done by planting more trees using urban dense afforestation technique.

“I opted to come here for the betterment of my city,” said Aditya Thakur, an IT employee. There were others like Koustub, who travelled to Ulsoor all the way from Nagasandra. They, along with several members of the local community, planted saplings. “I have lived here for long. I am happy to see so many saplings being planted at once,” said Lokesh Nayak, a local resident.

Not just adults, several children also participated with much enthusiasm. Twelve-year-old Aisha Kumari said: “I'm really excited to plant trees that will only help make our future better.”

“This is a great initiative taken by the BBMP and civil society. This will help recharge underground water and restore Bengaluru’s glory of being a Garden City,” said Sachin Gowda, a local resident.

Two non-governmental organisations — Saytrees and Biotasoil — have sponsored the saplings and will be maintaining them for the next two years.

337,2020/01/11,Customers panic as RBI puts curbs on urban co-op. bank,"Customers of Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamita panicked and gathered on the bank premises in Basavanagudi on Saturday morning after a public notice outside the bank announced that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had imposed restrictions on withdrawals.

The RBI notice, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, says that the urban cooperative bank has been effectively barred from any operation — granting new loans, making investments or accepting new deposits — except for allowing withdrawal of a maximum of ₹35,000 of the total balance in any account. While it clarifies that this does not mean cancellation of banking licence, it said restrictions will continue “till its financial position improves”.

This created panic among the bank’s customer base, many of whom gathered outside the premises and demanded answers from the management.

Rajalakshmi, 60, a resident of Basavanagudi, was angry and fearful. “My parents are suffering from chronic ailments and are bedridden, and have invested all their savings in the bank. Now my mother needs money immediately for her surgery. Who will be responsible if something happens to her?,” she told The Hindu.

Another customer, Aparna B., had her parents’ savings deposited in the bank and a significant chunk was supposed to be withdrawn this week. “My sister is getting married this month-end and we had planned to go shopping this Monday. We don’t know what we should do now,” she said.

The bank’s website claims it has won four awards among urban cooperative banks, including for total business, highest profit and deposit mobilisation. The bank has posted financial statements only till 2017-18, which shows it had a profit of over ₹28 crore.

‘Deposits are safe’

One of the bank officials, Muralidhar, addressed the customers and assured them that their deposits were safe. “There has been a default of ₹350 crore on loans over the past three months, attracting RBI restrictions. But these loans are secure with assets taken as securities. Even if they default, we can recover the loans by taking over the security,” he said.

On the restrictions, he said the bank would seek clarification from RBI on Monday. “ATMs will function normally from Monday,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pkyshz/article30545954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/customers-panic-as-rbi-puts-curbs-on-urban-co-op-bank/article30545955.ece
338,2020/01/11,BU students brawl at birthday party in hostel,"A birthday party of a postgraduate student in Bangalore University’s (BU) hostel on Friday night turned into an intense fight between two student groups, creating commotion on the Jnanabharathi campus.

One of the students lodged a police complaint and said that they were harassed verbally and physically. Following this, the police reportedly detained eight students.

The student, in his complaint, said: “Around 11 p.m., my friend and I went to a friend’s room for a birthday party. During the same time, another group of students, who have been overstaying in the hostel even after completion of their course, began abusing us from the window. They later barged into the room and abused us verbally and physically.”

After this incident, several students gathered at the hostel block and protested demanding intervention of the university authorities. They demanded better security and wanted the hostel warden to be changed. They also refused to eat the food served to them and urged the Vice-Chancellor to come to the hostel and address their grievances. They also requested for police personnel to be deployed at the hostel for a few days.

Vice-Chancellor K.R. Venugopal visited the hostel and the students raised their concerns. “I have asked the students to withdraw the complaint as the future of the other students may be jeopardised if they have a police complaint against them,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bu-students-brawl-at-birthday-party-in-hostel/article30545903.ece
339,2020/01/11,Police prevent students from distributing pamphlets on CAA,"Four students who were spreading awareness about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and distributing pamphlets on a talk related to it at the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) were allegedly prevented from doing so by the police on Saturday.

While two students are from NLSIU, the others are from other colleges in the city.

According to sources, the students were standing in Church Street and holding posters and distributing pamphlets about the talk at NLSIU on Sunday, which is being organised by the Student Bar Association and the Law and Society Committee. “The students, apart from the pamphlets and posters, had a copy of the Constitution and text of the CAA. We have no idea why they were prevented from doing so,” a source said. Videos accessed by The Hindu show that the students had anti-CAA and anti-NRC posters.

“The students were not doing anything legally wrong. This is a scare tactic. Tomorrow, they may stop us even from doing something as small as a flash mob or street play,” said Simranjit Singh, a final year student at NLSIU.

The Cubbon Park police, however, said that two students were summoned to the station and asked not to carry out these activities in public places. “We only made them write their names and addresses and let them go,” said a police personnel. They said that they were doing so for security reasons so that it does not affect law and order. “If students want to protest, they have to ask for prior permission and we will grant it,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-prevent-students-from-distributing-pamphlets-on-caa/article30545899.ece

345,2020/01/11,Injection well built at Sankey Road underpass,"To prevent underpasses from flooding and also replenish groundwater table, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has constructed an “injection well” on a pilot basis.

The pilot was taken up at the Sankey Road-Cunningham Road underpass, near Bangalore Golf Club, which sees flooding and waterlogging when it rains, especially during the monsoon.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar tweeted that the same would be constructed in other underpasses and road under bridges that are prone to flooding and inundation.

They are Puttenahalli, Kadirenahalli, Tagore Circle, Kadubesanahalli, Cunningham road Le-Meridien, Doddanakundi Railway underpass, K.R. Circle, Palace Road, Kasturinagar (that connects it to Outer Ring Road), and Hebbal grade separator.

At the Sankey Road-Cunningham Road underpass, a trial run was recently conducted with 10,000 litres of recycled water. The test enabled water to flow down the underpass slope. It funnelled into the groundwater recharge pit, which is nearly 230 ft deep, including the impermeable layers. The huge volume of water was discharged into the well in less than five minutes. A well and a kerb-side drainage system has also been constructed.

348,2020/01/11,Kannada scholar Chidananda Murthy passes away,"Noted Kannada scholar, epigraphist and activist Chidananda Murthy passed away early on Saturday. He was 88.

He was ill for sometime and was being treated for age-related illness at a private hospital, where he breathed his last at around 3:30 a.m.

Murthy was known for his work on Kannada inscriptions. His work played a key role in deciding the antiquity of the Kannada, which helped get the language Classical Language status from the Union government in 2008. He was also a vocal Kannada activist, leading Kannada Shakti Kendra in 1970s and 1980s.

Later, he became a champion of the Hindu Right-Wing cause. He was one of the key articulators of the argument against Tipu Sultan. He had also launched a campaign to save the monuments of Hampi. Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa renamed Hyderabad Karnataka — a group of six districts formerly under the administration of Nizam of Hyderabad — as Kalyana Karnataka, as demanded by Murthy.

“He was a thinker, researcher and historian who always worked for the interest of Kannada. His place in history is unique and irreplaceable.

350,2020/01/11,‘Mend pothole-ridden Pazhavanthangal subway’,"The pothole-ridden Pazhavanthangal subway is posing a risk to motorists and the many pleas of the residents of Nanganallur and Pazhavanthangal to the State Highways Department to mend the road seem to have fallen on deaf ears.

Says V. Rama Rao, director of Traffic and Transportation Forum, Chennai, says, “Motorists have to drive carefully on this stretch. Though the subway facilitates easy connectivity to Pazhavanthangal, Nanganallur and GST Road, the bad condition of the road is forcing motorists to take other routes. The road connecting MGR Nagar in Meenambakkam and Nobel Street in Pazhavanthangal is severely battered.”

A. Rajesh, a resident of Nanganallur, says that some patch work was carried out about a year ago but it has failed to improve the condition of the road. “Riding motorcycles on this stretch is a back-breaking experience. Besides, the wheels take a beating,” he adds.

Residents urge the State Highways Department and the Southern Railway to widen the stairs leading to Pazhavanthangal railway station and replace the broken railings. “Senior citizens and differently-abled find it difficult to climb the stairs. The authorities should also take steps to clear the encroachments from the roadside and pavements,” says another resident.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mend-pothole-ridden-pazhavanthangal-subway/article30543786.ece
351,2020/01/11,Residents seek vehicular subway near Korukkupet railway station,"It is a common sight to see motorcyclists sneaking in through narrow gaps between vehicles to cross the closed level-crossing at Kannan Street and Thiyagappa Street near Korukkupet railway station. They tilt their bikes and sneak under the gate to cross to the other side. The motorcyclists seem to have no regard for their safety or that of the others.

Pedestrians too often risk their lives and cross the gates and the tracks.

The residents of Korukkupet have made a request to the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Southern Railway to construct a vehicular subway at Level Crossing 2.

Says B. Pandian, a motorist and resident of Korukkupet, “When the gates of the level-crossing closes, vehicles pile up on Kannan Street and Thiyagappa Street till Ennore High Road. When the gates open, motorists indulge in rash driving to cross the gates. More than a decade ago, the Corporation proposed to build a vehicular subway connecting Ennore High Road and Kannan Street. The proposal was dropped after the residents protested and approached the Madras High Court against land acquisition.”

“We warn pedestrians and motorcyclists not to cross the tracks when the gates are closed.

352,2020/01/11,GCC organises ‘swap-shop’ event to promote recycling,"The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is organising an event called “Swap Shop: Reduce and Reuse Sale” on January 12 (from 12 noon to 8 p.m.) and on January 13 (from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) at TNHB Community Hall, Besant Nagar. The event allows people to offer items that have sparingly-used and are still intact, for a nominal price. The following are some of the items suggested by the GCC: books, utensils, kitchen appliances (like kettle and toasters); electronic gadgets, furniture, toys, umbrella, raincoat, artificial jewellery, backpack, trolley suitcase, bag, wallet, purse and footwear. Besides, clothes, blankets, bedspreads and pillow covers that have been washed and ironed are acceptable.

Participants can also exchange such items.

The aim of the event is to promote sustainable living and propagate the message of reducing waste footprints by consciously reducing consumption.

“Here, we would like to make it quite clear that this sale is not meant for discarding products that are in shreds and tattered beyond any use. In case there is a large amount of reusable items, the Corporation may consider making arrangements to come and collect them at one’s doorstep,” says the Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), GCC, Alby John.

353,2020/01/11,A vehicle for conveying an upcycling message,"Fourteen just-crafted sculptures are temporarily parked at Chennai Higher Secondary School on Bharathidasan Salai in Thiruvanmiyur, and expected to be installed soon at prominent locations to drive home an upcycling message.

A Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) official has said that the civic body is yet to decide on suitable locations for these sculptures, each of which weighs somewhere between one and 1.5 tonnes. What makes these artworks singular is that they have been made from automobile-metal scraps of vehicles discarded by GCC.

Sculpted images of animals predominate the collection. Representations of human beings, as engaged in their trade, also figure prominently in it. With automobile parts tracing the anatomical features of humans and animals, there is a surreality to the sculptures. The placement of shock-absorbers is unmissable in some sculptures, especially a metallic panther.

Structural channels — also known as “C-type channels” — which go into the making of structural frames of automobiles have been as base for the sculptures. Iron pipes have largely been used to trace the “skeletal structure” of the subjects. Easily-recognisable automoile parts make up sections of certain sculptures. So, you have petrol tanks of varying sizes being used to define the shape of the claws of a crab; and the carapace of a tortoise.

“There are plans to have them displayed at Tidel Park and Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar. The installation would be done in such a manner that they are beyond easy reach, or else miscreants would rip off the metal parts. We are also toying with the idea of displaying them in an indoor gallery with light effects,” says the official.

GCC maintains a scrap yard at Pudupet where it discards its sport utility vehicles, excavators, cranes, trucks and compactors.

The Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), GCC, Alby John says this endeavour seeks to underscore the concept of upcycling where a discarded item gets an added value.

The sculptures include the following themes: A farmer with a spade; a fisherman with a paddle and a boat; a sailor with the steering wheel of a ship; a man trying to tame a bull; a Bharatanatyam dancer; a mridhangam player; a mermaid; a tortoise; a shrimp; a crab, a shark, two deer, a panther and an eagle.

The team

Sixteen sculptors were part of this exercise. Srinivas Padakandla, Academic Associate, Acharya Nagarjuna University College Of Architecture And Planning, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, who led the team of artists, says, “Our guiding principle is to create art forms in an environment-friendly manner. Now, junk art is gaining in popularity due to a humongous amount of automobile and electronic waste being generated. In this GCC project, around 15 tonnes of metal scrap have gone into making 14 pieces of sculpture.”

355,2020/01/11,‘MTC stopovers should make a comeback’,"Residents want two stopovers on Arcot Road near Kamala Theatre to make a comeback, and they have apprised the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) of their wish. One stopover should be located on the side where Kamala theatre is located, and the other one should come up on the opposite side.

Their argument is that at present, the nearest bus stops are the one at the MTC terminus in Vadapalani and another near the Lord Murugan temple on Arcot Road. Both these points are considerably distant from Kamala theatre, they add.

Residents point out that until a few years ago, there were two stopovers on the said location, one located on the Kamala Theatre side, and the other on the opposite side. However, they were done away with to facilitate re-laying of Arcot Road. The stopovers had shelters and boards bearing the route numbers, recall residents.

“Citing poor patronage and traffic congestion, the stopovers were not restored even after the completion of the road work. However, now, auto-rickshaws can often be seen parked there,” says B. Satish, a resident of Vadapalani.

“Appropriate measures will be taken, keeping commuters’ convenience in mind,” says an MTC official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p3urde/article30543523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DCTNGRMTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mtc-stopovers-should-make-a-comeback/article30543524.ece
356,2020/01/11,Openers power WGCA to title,"Openers S. Pranav and D. Pranav were on song as WGCA cruised past FSCA by nine wickets in the final of the Ashok Leyland under-14 tournament held at the Asan Arts and Science College ground recently.

Chasing a modest target of 87, the Pranavs took the team home in the 16th over.

Earlier, leggies R. Vishal and V. Siddharth proved unplayable on the turf wicket as they spun out the opponent for 86.

In a remarkable coincidence, WGCA had bundled out Sunshine School for the same score — 86 — in the semifinal and went on to win by six wickets.

“Both Vishal and Siddharth are 14, but have shown maturity beyond their age. They will be representing IOC in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association’s (TNCA) fifth division league this year,” revealed S.P. Lekshmi Kumar, head coach, WGCA.

He also had words of praise for coach C. Ganesh Kumar. “Ganesh has been guiding the boys and pushing them to the next level,” said Lekshmi Kumar. That the boys are on the right track is evident from the fact that this is WGCA’s fourth title triumph this season.

The scores

Final: FSCA 86 in 26.3 overs (R. Vishal three for 22, V. Siddarth three for 17) lost to WGCA 88 for one in 15.3 overs (D. Pranav 30, S. Pranav 33 not out).

Semifinal: Sunshine School 86 in 20.1 overs (D. Pranav four for 20) lost to WGCA 87 for four in 24.3 overs.

357,2020/01/11,A bumpy ride near Teynampet Metro,"Delay in mending the battered portions of the road between Cenotaph Road junction and the Metro Rail station in Teynampet on Anna Salai, is posing a threat to the safety of motorists. The stretch comes under the maintenance of the State Highways Department.

Motorists are complaining that most of the bitumen topping was washed away during the recent rains and the pothole-ridden road is becoming dangerous.

After two-way traffic arrangement was implemented on Cenotaph Road a few months ago in an effort to decongest Nandanam junction, the stretch has been witnessing a heavy flow of vehicular traffic.

A traffic police officer says that the stretch has not been laid since the Metro Rail station at Teynampet opened last year.

“Motorcyclists are the worst-hit as the uneven surface of the road often causes the riders to lose balance,” says S. Vignesh, a motorist from Alwarpet.

As per the present traffic arrangement, motorists coming from Nandanam can proceed straight towards Gemini flyover and also take a left turn at the junction near the Metro Rail station in Teyanampet to reach Pondy Bazaar and T. Nagar.

The existing traffic arrangement was introduced in 2012 to facilitate Metro Rail work on Anna Salai. Despite the opening of Metro Rail stations between Washermenpet and DMS (Directorate of Medical Services) in Teynampet, the stretch has been ignored.

Interestingly, most of the other sections of Anna Salai — DMS in Teynampet, Nandanam junction and LIC Building — have been relaid and also widened. An official from the State Highways says that shortage of bitumen and continuous flow of traffic, even during the night hours, are causing the delay in re-laying the portion of the stretch. “Steps will be taken to re-lay the road soon,” says the official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4myiik/article30542947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DCANNASALAITEYNAMPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-bumpy-ride-near-teynampet-metro/article30542948.ece
358,2020/01/11,South Cooum Road in Pudupet freed of encroachments,"South Cooum Road in Pudupet has got a fresh lease of life after the officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation removed the abandoned vehicles and the garages of scrap merchants. The stretch looks much wider and has also got better street lights.

Civic body officials said that the eviction drive was carried out to check the traffic chaos and also to prevent traders from leaving old vehicles along the river bund, which is being strengthened by the Public Works Department.

The stretch serves as a short route for motorists to reach Anna Salai from Pantheon Road instead of taking the congested Ethiraj Salai. “Clearing the encroachments is a welcome move, as it increases pedestrian safety on the stretch,” says S. Dinesh, a resident of Egmore.

GCC carried out an eviction drive on East, West and South Cooum roads in June 2018 and about 450 families were resettled in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) colony in Perumbakkam near Sholinganallur, off OMR. However, within a few months, most of the scrap dealers reoccupied the stretch in Pudupet, which prompted the second eviction, say GCC officials.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ojpnt5/article30542861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DCSOUTHCOOVUMRIVERROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/south-cooum-road-in-pudupet-freed-of-encroachments/article30542862.ece
359,2020/01/11,‘Close right turn at school zone in Ambattur Old Town’,"To ease traffic congestion on CTH Road, a section of motorists have sought closure of a right turn at the junction in front of Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School in Ambattur Old Town.

At present, motorists coming from interior roads such as Cholambedu Road and High School Road, which intersects at CTH Road in front of the government-aided school, take a 'right turn' to reach CTH Road.

The junction also provides motorists with a short-cut to reach two sections of Ambattur. Motorists point out that allowing a right turn for a small count of vehicles from these interior roads slows down traffic on the arterial road, especially during rush hour.

“During weekdays, vehicles can be seen lined up till TI Cycle Road near the bridge, from the junction. As the intersection is also narrow with a bend towards Ambattur Old Town bus terminus, traffic moves at a snail’s pace during rush hour,” says K. Prakasam, a motorist from Thirumullavoyal. Motorists are confident that closing the right turn will work. They cite an example to illustrate the point. Recently, the intersection was closed on counting day for the local body elections. Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School was the counting centre, where cadres of many political parties had gathered near the intersection. To prevent any untoward incidents, the right turn at the intersection was closed.

Motorists coming from Cholambedu Road and High School Road were diverted to take a 'U' turn near Rakkie theatre and TI School Road respectively.

Motorists say such an arrangement is required as motorists violate traffic rules by not halting at the junction, which leads to accidents.

Further, container lorries and other vehicles skip the triangular junction near Rakkie theatre in Ambattur where a police booth is located by taking interior lanes to reach CTH Road.

The CCTV cameras at the intersection have not been working for many months due to electrical faults. Besides, motorists on CTH Road are unable to see motorists coming from the two stretches, due to overgrown trees near the junction. “Steps will be taken to ensure smooth traffic flow at the junction,” say police sources.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ghemv2/article30542821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12dcangrrightturnJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/close-right-turn-at-school-zone-in-ambattur-old-town/article30542822.ece
360,2020/01/11,"On Brick Kiln Road in Chennai’s Purasawalkam, there are more encroachments than road space","On Brick Kiln Road, Purasawalkam, encroachments rule the road. Garbage, discarded furniture, damaged vehicles, footpath shops, food carts and haphazard parking have all contributed to very little space for vehicles. Residents of the area also complain that there is no space for pedestrians.

The road is also full of potholes, stagnant water pools, overflowing sewerage, and un-cleared garbage. Suman Agarwal, a resident said, “In the last four years, I have made many complaints to Chennai Corporation at 1913 and received acknowledgements by SMS. But there is not much improvement on the road. It appears that this road is controlled by a few who are politically influential and not by the Chennai Corporation or the Traffic police.”

Mr. Agarwal added the Corporation staff informed him that they have sought police help to remove the encroachments, but in fact the situation has not been changed in the last 2 years. The Corporation has not removed the unauthorised encroachments, he said.

“Almost everyday, one new shop is opened on the footpath and people who live in encroached spaces are converting their huts into godowns and supply points,” said Sharad Jalan, another resident.

Mukesh Gupta, another resident, said the pavement was being encroached upon by shopkeepers and others and there was no place to walk. Free flow of traffic is also affected on the stretch.

Residents feel that unless and until the civic body with active help and force from the police initiates a determined initiative to clean up the road, it will continue to remain in the condition it is in.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8qwqjv/article30542815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11JANTH-Brickilnjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/on-brick-kiln-road-in-chennais-purasawalkam-there-are-more-encroachments-than-road-space/article30542816.ece
361,2020/01/11,Here’s how discarded plastic items took the shape of a security cabin in Mumbai,"At a football ground in Bandra, Mumbai, stands a security booth scoring goals for sustainability. Called ‘BoTo’, it combines wacky upcycling with a strident message about the impact of plastics on our environment.

With a bamboo cladding, the 10x10 booth liberally uses recycled plastic items, which largely include tetra packs and plastic fibres. “Eco-bricks” and biodegradable materials further build the sustainability theme, the brainchild of Global Shapers Mumbai, a network of young people who shape their cities through community projects.

The initiative engaged with children from various schools so as to create awareness about various aspects of waste management and sustainability, including waste segregation and the need to avoid plastics, where it can be avoided, and recycle them, where they can’t be avoided.

“We had students from 50 schools help us build the eco-bricks,” says Amishi Parasrampuria, co-lead for the project. Eco-bricks are made of recyclable plastic bottles packed with thin plastics and non-biodegradable waste. With the help of NGO Greenline, workshops were conducted at schools.

“The students collected some of the recyclable waste that was necessary for the project,” says Amishi, adding that in two months more than 5,000 PET bottles were collected. The exercise prevented 3000 kg of non-biodegradable waste from going to the landfills.

The project had its challenges, with Shapers having to wait for close to one-and-a-half years just to get the go-ahead from the authorities.

“And then finding the right construction partner, sourcing the right materials and doing necessary quality checks took time. Overall, it took over two years to get the structure ready,” says Ruchie, an architect by profession and co-lead for the project.

She says the security cabin is well-used. Inside, the temperature drops by three to four degrees celsius.

Global Shapers Community, an initiative of the World Economic Forum, is present in a few other cities as well, and the local chapters are known as hubs.

“Delhi hub has shown interest in having this project started in their city,” says Amishi.

According to a post on the Mumbai hub’s Facebook page — (www.facebook.com/GlobalShapersMumbaiHub/ post) — the group has partnered with Swiggy and InfinityBox for a pilot project with certain restaurants, on reusable food containers.

“We believe that this Welcomhotel property on the commercially vibrant GST Road, will attract discerning domestic and international business travellers,” Anil Chadha, Chief Operating Officer, ITC Hotels, said.

“The south of India has emerged as a key market in India’s tourism landscape. Good infrastructure and connectivity augur well for Tamil Nadu’s growing potential as a business and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) destination,” he said. “MICE is also an important segment that has led to an increase in the city’s inventory.

365,2020/01/11,"Why aren’t you laying plastic roads, asks HC","The Madras High Court on Friday questioned the reason for Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) continuing to opt for bitumen roads instead of laying plastic roads which had been proven to be more durable and long lasting.

The court also expressed dismay over most of the roads in the city riddled with potholes and craters.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha broached the subject during the hearing of a case filed by Arappor Iyakkam, a non governmental organisation, seeking a Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) probe into award of tenders by GCC for laying roads on bus routes and constructing storm water drains.

Poor quality

In his submissions, the petitioner’s counsel V. Suresh told the court that several irregularities including rigging, tender fixing, collusion, cartelisation of contractors and award of tenders at very high costs than the prevailing market rates had led to very poor quality of storm water drains as well as roads having been laid across the city.

Concurring with him, the judges wondered why the corporation was not utilising a better and proven technology of laying plastic roads. “What for is the technology available, if you are not going to use it,” the senior judge in the Bench asked and pointed out that even the roads near the residence of judges and ministers were in bad shape.

“Good roads are a basic requirement for all, be it the rich or the poor. Cars, bikes as well as bicycles require good roads. If even that basic requirement is not fulfilled by the corporation, we do not know what to say,” Justice Sathyanarayanan lamented before directing the DVAC to submit a status report on its preliminary enquiry by February 19.

Additional Public Prosecutor C. Ayyapparaj told the court that the DVAC had obtained sanction for the preliminary enquiry, on the basis of a complaint lodged by the NGO in November 2018, from the Chief Secretary and commenced the probe on March 11, 2019.

He agreed to file the status report before the court in a sealed cover after a month.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y54ty1/article30538846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THPLASTICROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/why-arent-you-laying-plastic-roads-asks-hc/article30538847.ece

Murugadoss, announced that it will be removing controversial dialogues in the film, deemed to be a reference to V.K. Sasikala, the jailed aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

Darbar, which released on Thursday, has two scenes where characters speak of prison inmates being allowed to go out and shop.

The dialogues are not mouthed by Mr. Rajinikanth in either scene, though the actor is present in the shot in the movie.

Following the film’s release, Sasikala's advocate, N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, took objection to the lines and threatened to sue the producers, Mr. Rajinikanth, Mr. Murugadoss, and fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar (for his later remarks with reference to the particular scene) if the said scenes were not removed.

‘For entertainment only’

On Friday, Lyca Productions released a statement on Twitter that read: “In Darbar, particular words and dialogues having references to prisoners or inmates going out of jail or prison during their imprisonment was only included with an intention of providing entertainment to the audience and not intended to refer to any specific individual or to offend anyone.”

“However, since some of those words seemed to have hurt some people, we have hereby decided to remove the same from the film,” the statement of the production house added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w5zryo/article30538840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPRajinikanth-Darbar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/controversial-scenes-to-be-removed-from-rajinis-darbar/article30538841.ece

368,2020/01/11,"Organ donations, transplants pick up pace in govt. hospitals","After a slow start, organ donations and transplants picked up pace in a few government hospitals during the last two to three months of 2019. Tissue donations, particularly skin, corneas and bones, after cardiac deaths were improving slowly at these hospitals.

The first half of 2019 saw 13 donors in four government hospitals. By the end of the year, the government sector had a total of 22 donors and 77 organs when compared to 27 donors and 74 organs in 2018. The fag end of the year broke the lull in organ donations and transplants in the government hospitals, officials of the Health Department said.

In November, the Health department held a meeting with deans of all government medical college hospitals to take steps to improve the deceased donor programme and conduct more organ transplants to benefit the poor patients, an official said.

Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) that had five donations till July ended the year with a total of 10 donors; five donations happening in the last three months. The Government Stanley Medical College Hospital had a nine donors.

Officials of the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu said tissue donations after cardiac arrests was picking up in a number of government hospitals such as Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital.

“We have a biomaterial centre since 2018. We want to improve tissue donations by creating awareness among people. In cases of natural deaths, like donating corneas, skin too can be donated. Skin is harvested only from the thighs and there is no disfigurement,” she said.

RGGGH has kick-started the new year with a heart transplant a few days ago. R. Jayanthi, dean, said, the institution continues to motivate families and promote organ donations.

369,2020/01/11,"In 3 months, facilities for women in all public toilets","The Chennai Corporation will create facilities for women and children in public toilets, including breastfeeding rooms, at 220 locations across the city in three months.

Inaugurating a modern toilet complex in T. Nagar near Panagal Park on Friday, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said the modernisation of the toilets would use CSR funds.

“People will be permitted to use the toilets free of cost. At least four employees will clean each of the toilets. The cost of maintenance of the toilet in T. Nagar’s Panagal Park is estimated at ₹9 lakh every year,” he said. The toilet has been renovated using CSR funding from Star Health Insurance.

371,2020/01/11,Girl plays truant to keep High Court date,"Six-year-old R.B. Adhigai Mutharasi, a Class II student, played truant from school on Friday to visit a most bizarre place for kids — the Madras High Court.

The girl walked into the court buildings right royally, and not even the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), guarding the court campus, could prevent her entry, as she was a litigant, and thereby rightfully entitled to follow the proceedings in her case.

What’s more is that the girl had filed the case against the headmistress of her own school — the Minjur Panchayat Union Primary School in Ponneri Taluk of Tiruvallur district — complaining about the lack of infrastructural facilities.

The girl sought for a direction to carry out all repair works in the school buildings, evict encroachments on the school property and keep the institution neat and clean at all times.

On finding the girl wait for long in the litigants’ gallery, along with her lawyer father, Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha called her to the dais and had an interesting chat. After asking her name and other details, when the judges wanted to know why she hadn’t gone to school, the uninhibited child did not hesitate to tell the judges that she had bunked her classes to come to court.

Amused by her answer and appreciative of her confidence, the senior judge in the Bench told the little litigant that it was wrong to avoid going to school.

“How will you study well if you don’t go to school regularly. You should not avoid school like this,” the judges told the girl, before she ran back to her father and asked: “Appa (father), is the case over, can we go home now?”

In response to her writ petition, School Education Department officials filed a status report, along with certain photographs, to claim that most of the concerns raised by her had been addressed, and the school was being maintained well. However, the girl’s counsel contested the claim, and contended that the school continued to be in a bad shape, despite having been an institution established way back in 1964.

After advising the officials to take sincere action to rectify the defects pointed out by the petitioner, and not to turn egoistic just because a lawyer had filed the case in the name of his daughter, the judges said if funds were a reason for poor maintenance, then it could be arranged through CSR activities.

After asking the petitioner’s counsel to peruse the status report fully, the judges adjourned the case. “So, should I come back again,” Mutharasi asked her father A.E. Baskaran, who smiled and reminded her of the judge’s advice.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hxn7x6/article30538747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG202001101307053,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/girl-plays-truant-to-keep-high-court-date/article30538748.ece

374,2020/01/11,‘Scrap shops and ragpickers key to waste management’,"Over 2,000 scrap shops in the city are set to play a major role in waste management this year, reducing the waste dumped in landfills by 70%, according to data compiled by a private sector player.

Speaking at a session on ‘Past, present and future of waste management’, Kabadiwalla Connect founder and CEO Siddharth Hande said 1,70,000 tonnes of waste is collected by the 2,000 scrap shops in the city every year.

“Hyperlocal collection has to improve for solid waste management. In six months there will be a demand for low-value plastics. Cement plants will use the low-value plastics as fuel. Bigger brands have a bigger commitment for promoting innovation,” said Mr. Hande.

‘Cut out landfills’

The private entities are expected to reduce the waste sent to landfills in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur.

Currently, Chennai Corporation generates 5,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste, including plastics and non-recyclable multi-layered plastics.

“Over 40% of the plastics generated in the city goes uncollected, reaching the landfills and waterbodies. Scrap shops and ragpickers have been roped in.

Smart bins have been placed in 30 apartments in Myalpore. Ragpickers get one tonne of plastic every week. Over 20% of the plastic is multi-layered. It is being disposed. Other plastics are recycled,” said Ganesh Kumar, Chief Operating Officer of Kabadiwalla Connect.

“Urban India is generating 70 million tonnes of waste every year. Over 91% is dumped in open landfills. We have to improve informal waste infrastructure. Microfinance for the scrap shops and ragpickers as a product will improve conditions. It is a very profitable business. Residents should segregate waste to promote such business,” said a participant.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/f72nyj/article30538719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/scrap-shops-and-ragpickers-key-to-waste-management/article30538720.ece

377,2020/01/11,"Metro special class, at two times the regular fare, begins to gain traction","Ever since Chennai Metro’s phase I project was completed in February, the number of people travelling in the ordinary class has seen a steady increase, with the average monthly ridership touching 1.15 lakh recently. On the contrary, the special class continues to be mostly empty, with fares ranging between ₹20-120, which is two times the regular fare.

Latest data shows that 1,546 people used the special class in December. Interestingly, the data shows the number of people using it has gone up in the last nine months. In April, 978 people travelled in special class, and by December, the users grew to 1,546, registering an increase of 58%. From April to December, 9,617 people travelled in the special class.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), a majority of the special class users are one-time travellers. In December, for instance, of the 1,546 users, 1,508 bought tickets (tokens) at the counter. Only 22 purchased smart cards and the remaining used tourist and trip cards.

“Usually, regular travellers don’t buy tokens and hence we think these are one-time travellers. And, we also found that many of these passengers were travelling to Chennai airport. There was a dip in May and August, but that apart, in all the other months, we saw people opting for the special class,” an official said.

Asked if special class will be changed to a normal coach, officials said that it may not happen. “There is no such plan to convert it to a normal coach as of now,” another official said.

While the tokens for both classes look the same, the smart cards for the special class have a golden colour. If a person claims to have a token for the special class, officials can find out. “But most often, no one checks. So, there is a chance that it may be misused. When we go for inspection, we check randomly,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metro-special-class-at-two-times-the-regular-fare-begins-to-gain-traction/article30538502.ece

380,2020/01/11,Human rights are not solely an ‘internal matter’,"The human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) following the dilution of Article 370 and the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) have brought renewed international focus on India’s human rights practice. Responding to criticism made by the United Nations agencies and others, the Indian state asserted that both J&K and CAA are entirely internal matters and there cannot be any interference in such sovereign decisions.

What is remarkable about modern international human rights law is its recognition of individuals as subjects. Classic international law governed the conduct between states and did not recognise the rights of individuals. Countries made agreements on the premise that a sovereign state had the exclusive right to take any action it thought fit to deal with its nationals. Such a notion of absolute sovereignty was challenged in 19th century with the emergence of humanitarian intervention to protect minorities living in other states. Later, in 1919, the evolution of labour standards led to the establishment of the International Labour Office (ILO). In 1926, the Slavery Convention adopted by the League of Nations prohibiting slave trade heralded the first human rights treaty based on the principle of dignity of a human being. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations, was the first comprehensive international human rights document. The Universal Declaration has acquired the force of law as part of the customary law of nations. It has provided the basis for binding human rights treaties and non-binding guidelines/principles that constitute a distinct body of law known as international human rights law.

Unsustainable claim

This progress of international law in the last 100 years makes the Indian state’s assertion of its sovereign right unsustainable. The evolution of international human rights law is also about the gradual weakening of the concept of unrestricted sovereignty. The Indian government has ratified several international human rights treaties and submits periodic reports to the respective treaty bodies. By doing so, it has acknowledged the principle that the treatment of its citizens is not entirely an internal matter, and such measures do not enjoy an absolute sovereignty.

The Indian government’s response to concerns about its human rights practice has always been that international scrutiny is unwarranted since the country is the largest democracy in the world with an independent judiciary, free media, and an active civil society. These claims sound less credible after the recent developments in J&K and the passage of the CAA.

Non–discrimination is a fundamental principle of human rights. Discrimination in various forms occurs in all societies, but what is of concern is institutionalised discrimination. Apartheid was pronounced as a crime against humanity since it institutionalised discrimination based on race. Similarly, for the first time in post–Independence India, a religious group has been excluded from the purview of a law dealing with citizenship.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which is the lead agency within the UN system on all aspects related to human rights, has expressed its concern stating that the CAA “is fundamentally discriminatory in nature”. It has also said that “although India’s broader naturalization laws remain in place, these amendments will have a discriminatory effect on people’s access to nationality.”

International human rights law includes safeguards against unwarranted foreign intervention and stresses the exhaustion of domestic remedies before an issue is considered by an international body. The Indian state always assured the international community that the judiciary, mainly its Supreme Court, would provide adequate remedies to victims of human rights violations. However, of late, the faith of the common people in the higher judiciary has been weakened. In the face of serious allegations about human rights violations in J&K, the Supreme Court has “ducked, evaded and adjourned”, as put across by advocate Gautam Bhatia.

Weakening of civil society

While responding to criticism against its human rights practices, the Indian government also refers to the role of free media and civil society in protecting the human rights of vulnerable groups. However, in the context of J&K and the ongoing struggle against the CAA, the media has not come out any better. As for civil society organisations, the government since 2014 has systematically targeted them, including by making it difficult for them to receive funds from foreign donors. Since 2014, the government has cancelled the registration of about 14,000 NGOs under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). It has also mainly targeted its own critics.

Indian and international human rights groups are getting increasingly concerned about the actions of people associated with the ruling party who are engaged in the intimidation of critics, attacks against minorities, and restrictions on the freedoms of artistes. The brazen attack on JNU students on January 5 by armed goons and the total lack of response by the police is emblematic of free reign given to non-state actors in various parts of the country.

The international community is sympathetic to governments that are committed to upholding human rights but lack human and other resources to pursue it. In the case of India, it is not a question of resources but an unwillingness to uphold human rights. The government’s action in J&K, the passage of the CAA, and its response to protests on the CAA demonstrate that the present regime is not fully committed to upholding human rights and does not respect international human rights standards. Of course, it is possible for the Indian government, due to its diplomatic clout, to avoid robust intervention by the UN Human Rights Council and other UN human rights mechanisms. However, it would not be able to avoid scrutiny by the international community, which would complement the struggle of the Indian civil society to reclaim the Indian Constitution and advance human rights.

381,2020/01/11,'Sarileru Neekevvaru' review: Mahesh Babu's film is a partly entertaining mixed bag,"A bomb is ticking away. But the atmosphere isn’t that tense. As the camera shows us a nervous Prasad (Rajendra Prasad), we see the stage is set for some masala moments, even though everyone involved in the operation is from the Indian Army. Bomb diffusion can wait, Major Ajay Krishna (Mahesh Babu) must have coffee first!

Unlike the recent Hindi films that stoke the fervour of nationalism in all seriousness, when a Telugu superstar plays an Army officer, there’s room for mass masala moments with a rousing background score by Devi Sri Prasad. It goes without saying that the bomb is diffused and the culprits are hunted down.

In another instance, on a rescue operation to save children who are held captive by terrorists, the hero tells the terrorist ‘tumne gaali diya, maine goli diya’. How’s that for a punchline?

Sarileru Neekevvaru Cast: Mahesh Babu, Vijayashanti, Prakash Raj, Rashmika Mandanna

Direction: Anil Ravipudi

Music: Devi Sri Prasad

Anil Ravipudi who directed the comic F2, infuses quite a bit of comedy in Sarileru Neekevvaru’s initial portions purportedly happening in Kashmir, dropping hints that he’s presenting a fun film. There’s even a song featuring Tamannaah as a celebrity visiting an Army camp and dancing with the officers.

Mahesh’s introduction happens in Kashmir where he stands in awe and respect of the Indian flag, but we know that the action will shift to Kurnool because of Vijayashanti’s introduction (as professor Bharathi), and also because we’ve heard so much about the filmmakers building a grand set resembling the Konda Reddy Fort (art direction by A S Prakash).

Mahesh and Prakash Raj had clashed in the backdrop of the Charminar in Okkadu (2003), and years later, the Kurnool fort stands witness. Sarileru isn’t as racy or interesting as Okkadu, it’s more in the Dookudu mode with the director trying to make Mahesh loosen up and have some fun. And the actor seems to have thoroughly enjoyed the outing.

When Mahesh is sent to Kurnool to meet Vijayashanti and her family, he tags Rajendra Prasad along. The train journey is where he meets Sanskruti (Rashmika Mandanna), her sisters and parents (Sangeetha and Rao Ramesh). Sanskruti spots the “cute, sweet and handsome” hero (she repeats the phrase so many times, lest we forget it) and sees him as the way out of the wedding her father has planned for her.

The theatrics that Rashmika, Sangeetha, Hari Teja and others unleash on the train lead to a few laugh aloud moments. The women seem to have had fun delivering the synchronised phrases with exaggerated body language and Mahesh too chimes in, but the comedy isn’t consistently in good taste. A girl faking molestation in the name of comedy isn’t cool. By any stretch of imagination, it’s unacceptable to look at issues pertaining to sexual harassment as material for comedy. What were the makers thinking while writing these sequences?

This isn’t a part by which Rashmika can be judged, because all she gets to do is fawn over Mahesh.

The film gathers momentum when Mahesh finally reaches Kurnool. The premise of Vijayashanti as the single mother and a righteous professor locking horns with politician Prakash Raj (he’s fabulous) seems promising, more so because of Vijayashanti’s persona. She’s a superstar in her own right but this time, since Mahesh is around, he’s the saviour. She does get her moments and owns the screen, but it could have been even better. It would be interesting to see her take up an author-backed role where she plays her age and wields power.

Meanwhile, Anil Ravipudi isn’t content showing Mahesh Babu as a superstar, he compares him to Alluri Sitarama Raju. You got to discover how this develops in between the action episodes.

The villain’s mansion is populated with comic characters — Raghu Babu as the teacher who’s taken to task for his moral lessons that Prakash Raj feels are of no value and the father Jayaprakash Reddy repeating a few dialogues in his trademark style.

The clash between Mahesh and Prakash Raj, which also involves a host of other characters played by Posani Krishna Murali, Brahmaji, Subba Raju and Vennela Kishore, are engaging enough. There’s a fun tractor sequence too. Mahesh also gets to troll a few other characters and remark that someone gave a 3 or 3.5 star review for a blockbuster film!

When the Kurnool clash is almost witnessing a closure, the Army angle is brought in again and Prakash Raj gets a taste of the significance of being a soldier. The Sarileru… anthem arrives at a crucial juncture and is moving, especially since it’s centred around Vijayashanti’s character and what she stands for.

Sarileru Neekevvaru is a mixed bag; it’s partly entertaining and at other times rather lame. Make what you will of lines such as ‘meow meow pilli, milk boy ki pelli’, referring to Mahesh as milk boy repeatedly.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/tsgo57/article30542419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sarileru-neekevvaru-in-963907,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/sarileru-neekevvaru-review-mahesh-babus-film-is-a-partly-entertaining-mixed-bag/article30542423.ece

The sex racket was busted after a team of police personnel led by Deputy Commissioner of Police D.S. Swami conducted a raid on the hotel on Thursday night after receiving a tip-off, the official said.

“Bollywood actor Amrita Dhanoa (32) and model Richa Singh were arrested for allegedly supplying girls for prostitution at plush hotels,” he said.

As part of the operation, decoy customers were sent to the hotel, who met with the suppliers. The police team then conducted the raid, during which two women were rescued from the hotel, he said.

384,2020/01/11,BJP’s rout in Nagpur ZP polls shocking: Saamana,"The Shiv Sena on Friday termed the poll result in Nagpur Zilla Parishad (ZP), where the BJP was ousted from power by the Congress, as “sensational and shocking”.

Polling for six ZPs (332 seats) in Maharashtra — Nagpur, Akola, Washim, Dhule, Nandurbar and Palghar — and the Panchayat Samitis (664 seats) falling in their jurisdiction were held on Tuesday and the results were declared on Wednesday.

The BJP lost control of the ZP in Nagpur, the home district of party stalwarts Devendra Fadnavis and Nitin Gadkari. The BJP won just 15 of the 58 seats in Nagpur ZP, where the Congress secured a tally of 30, while its ally the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) pocketed 10.

An editorial in the Saamana, a mouthpiece of the Sena, pointed out that except Dhule, the BJP suffered defeats in the remaining five district councils. In these five districts, the Congress, the NCP, the Sena and the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) have done “very well”, the Marathi daily said.

The editorial said the BJP’s defeat in the home turf of Mr. Fadnavis, the former chief minister, and Mr. Gadkari, the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways and MSMEs, was “sensational and shocking” and the outcome shows the rural population was “fed up” with the party. “The Congress had performed well in the Assembly elections in Nagpur [held in October] and now it has wrested the district council from the BJP,” the Sena publication said.

The paper said in Nandurbar and other ZPs, if the Congress had fought the polls in alliance with the Sena, the BJP would have been “finished”. The Sena is in power in Maharashtra in alliance with the Congress and the NCP. In the 56-member Nandurbar ZP, both the Congress and the BJP won 23 seats each, while the Sena, which had no presence earlier in the council, bagged seven.

“No party can get power in the district council without the support of the Sena. The anger of losing power in Nandurbar was so much that BJP goons attacked the Sena party office in Akkalkua,” the paper noted.

However, despite losing in Nagpur, the BJP emerged as the single largest party in the ZP polls, winning 109 of the 332 seats on offer.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4a7f3i/article30540866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMNAGPURZILLAPARISHAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjps-rout-in-nagpur-zp-polls-shocking-saamana/article30540867.ece
385,2020/01/11,Mumbai gangster’s compulsive habits gave him away,"A flashy dressing style that gangster Ejaz Lakdawala had been using for decades helped the Mumbai Crime Branch team to spot him in the middle of a crowded bus stop in Patna on Wednesday. Besides, his preferred brand of cigarettes and the marks left by an attack on him further confirmed his identity.

Mr. Lakdawala (50), who had been on the run for over 20 years, was arrested in Jakkanpur and brought to Mumbai on Wednesday night. He is wanted for a series of crimes, including murder, attempt to murder, and extortion, in Mumbai and Thane.

According to Crime Branch officers, the challenge for the anti-extortion cell was to positively identify him. Sources said even his daughter Shifa, who was arrested on December 28, did not have a current photograph of him and could only provide a rough description.

“After we reached the spot where Mr. Lakdawala was supposed to be coming, we only had that rough description. The dossier on him mentioned that he had a taste for flashy clothes, and his daughter had confirmed that he still retained it. We first spotted him as he was entering the bus stop wearing a dark brown leather jacket, with a pink scarf tied around his neck,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said when he was asked about his identity, he responded with a made-up name. A search of his pockets, however, revealed a pack of Marlboro cigarettes, which has always been his favourite brand. The AEC team also examined his neck and found marks consistent with a surgery. The Crime Branch dossier on him said when he was attacked in 2002, he took seven bullets, including some on his arm, upper torso, and neck.

“The scarf was as much a device to hide the distinctive marks on his neck as it was a fashion statement,” the officer said.

Inquiries indicate that after the attack, which forced him to spend several months recuperating in hiding, Mr. Lakdawala became extra-careful to the point of being paranoid. He stopped trusting anyone within his gang and preferred to travel alone, never even informing his gang members about his movements.

“The precaution was for two reasons. First, every gangster has one or two trusted aides that he always keeps in the loop and by default, these people are looked at as his successors. But the risk is this might give rise to a desire in the aide to replace his boss before time, which Mr. Lakdawala wanted to avoid. Secondly, he had started suspecting that the attack on him had been executed with the help of a mole in his gang,” another officer said.

Ironically, it was for this same reason that relations soured between him and his former boss Rajendra Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan, who is now lodged in Tihar Central Jail, Delhi.

The Crime Branch is interrogating Mr. Lakdawala about his activities in the last 20 years, and also about the 25 cases and 80 applications received against him. The last case against him was registered on January 5, after he allegedly called up a Mumbai-based builder on January 3 to extort him.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7d38vy/article30538545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMSwag,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-gangsters-compulsive-habits-gave-him-away/article30538546.ece

The students performed songs, a skit, and displayed posters on quitting smoking. Bhushan Udgirkar, who teaches art in BMC schools, said, “The quality of the posters was good. One can actually see the level of maturity these kids have.”

Sagar Lele, a trained singer who was one of the judges at the competition, said, “These children will contribute a lot to this country when they grow up.

387,2020/01/11,Mahul residents will get 300 MHADA houses soon: BMC,"Months after several court orders and assurances from the State government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi promised residents of Mahul that they would be soon allotted 300 houses on a priority basis.

On Friday, a delegation of project affected persons (PAPs) met Mr. Pardeshi and he told them that 300 Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) houses will soon be allotted to them.

Mr. Pardeshi also told them that 16,000 new houses will be constructed for PAPs and they will be allotted on a priority basis.

The residents continue to demand that the BMC set a timeline to hand over the houses as every day their health is worsening owing to the toxic air in Mahul.

However, Mr. Pardeshi told the delegation that the BMC will not be withdrawing its challenge in the Supreme Court to the High Court’s order favouring the residents.

On September 23, 2019, a Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog had directed the BMC to shift around 5,000 families from Mahul and pay a rent of ₹15,000 per month for 12 months till arrangements for alternative accommodation are made.

The residents said they will be meeting Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on January 14 to press for their demands. In Mahul, the PAPs have been staying in a complex of 72 buildings. The area is surrounded by refineries, fertilizer plants, petroleum companies and industrial units. Reports by the National Green Tribunal and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay declared Mahul unfit for habitation.

On April 3, 2019, the High Court had directed authorities to pay an additional ₹45,000 as refundable deposit in the bank accounts of thousands of residents.

388,2020/01/11,‘Resume foodgrain supply to government-aided institutions’,"The State government has requested the Central government to revoke its March 2019 decision to stop supply of foodgrain to government-aided institutions and SC/ST/OBC hostels under the Allocation of foodgrains under Welfare Institutions and Hostels Scheme.

Chhagan Bhujbal, State Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, has written to Ram Vilas Paswan, his counterpart in the Central government, requesting him to reconsider the decision as it has affected over two lakh students in Maharashtra.

In March last year, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had written to all State governments and Union Territories (UTs) informing them about the change of norms in the scheme.

According to the new rules, only welfare institutions and SC/ST/OBC hostels either owned or run by States, UTs or administrative ministries are eligible for the allocation of foodgrain.

Inadequate supplies

In Maharashtra, the change in rule affected 2,289 government-aided institutions and hostels and 2,19,151 students. The State then issued a government resolution on August 8, 2019, stating that foodgrain will be made available only to 97,609 beneficiaries in government-owned institutions. The State government then provided aided institutions ₹900 per student per month, which was reportedly inadequate.

Mr. Bhujbal said, “The grant turned out to be just ₹30 per day. It is impossible to provide two meals and breakfast to one student with this amount. We have requested the Central government to ensure that government-aided institutions are brought back into the scheme. They are doing the work that the government should do. We can tighten the supervisory mechanism, but it is not right to deprive students of food.”

He said a copy of the letter has been sent to the Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, who has agreed to follow-up on the issue with the Centre.

Mr. Bhujbal said as per the norm, each student requires around 30 kg of foodgrain and the addition of government-aided institutions would mean increase in supply of 39,000 tonnes per annum. “We are talking about helping over two lakh students from deprived communities. I hope the Central government will take a positive decision in this matter” Mr. Bhujbal said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/b9ns62/article30538391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMFOODGRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/resume-foodgrain-supply-to-government-aided-institutions/article30538392.ece
389,2020/01/11,"Sena, MNS plan major events on same day","The Thackerays are set to clash in a show of strength in the city on January 23.

While the Shiv Sena has organised a public felicitation for party president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray at BKC, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray will be addressing the party conference at Goregaon.

On Friday, Sena leader and State Transport Minister Anil Parab said, “Uddhavji had promised his father, the late Balasaheb Thackeray, that the Sena will be in power in the Mantralaya, and he has fulfilled that word. It is to mark the dedication and tireless efforts of Uddhavji that we will be publicly felicitating him on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Balasaheb Thackeray.”

When asked whether the January 23 rally will be the party’s show of strength in Mumbai, Mr. Parab said the Sena never required to put in efforts to display its might. He said, “Everybody knows the Sena’s strength. On this day, lakhs of people will come to witness the public felicitation of Uddhavji by eminent personalities from across the country.”

Meanwhile, the MNS will be holding its conference on the same day with party president Raj Thackeray likely to announce the party’s future strategy at the event.

Recent political developments have indicated that the MNS and the Bharatiya Janata Party, who were once bitter enemies, are trying to establish closer ties. Mr. Thackeray even held a meeting with former chief minister and Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, sparking speculation.

Mr. Parab, while replying to a question on the increasing closeness between the MNS and the BJP, said he wished both parties the best in their future endeavours.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5db5rq/article30538328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMUDDHAVTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sena-mns-plan-major-events-on-same-day/article30538329.ece
390,2020/01/11,Congestion to drop drastically by 2031: MMRDA study,"Congestion in the city will come down by 100 percentage points by the end of this decade primarily due to the construction of Metro corridors, a study conducted by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said. The congestion is set to drop from 137% in 2017 to 33% in 2031. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the study said, it is expected to reduce to 9% in 2031 from 97% in 2017.

The MMRDA is implementing around 146 km of Metro lines across Mumbai, and aims to take the Metro network to nearly 337 km by 2026. “Once the network is completed, we expect over 50% of people travelling by Metro. The overall share of the public transport adoption would also increase from around 64% in 2017 to 71.3% in 2031,” Shankar Deshpande, joint projects director (town planning), MMRDA, said.

By 2031, the study said, of the 1.2 crore people travelling daily in the MMR, around 65 lakh will use Metro. The study also said on an average, people will travel around 16.4 km on Metro and Monorail every day in 2031, as compared to 5.9 km at present. The impact would be felt on the roads, MMRDA officials said, as fewer people will use cars improving the average speed.

The study calculated congestion on the basis of the amount of time taken to cover a distance on a daily average, also known as average trip length, at 40 km per hour. In 2017, the average trip length for Mumbai was 10.9 km which took around 41 minutes to travel by road, which should ideally have been covered in 21 minutes. The study said the Metro network will also lead to the reduction of the average trip length in Mumbai to 8 km by 2031, which on an average will be covered in 16 minutes.

However, doubts remain as to whether the construction of Metro lines alone can result in such a large reduction in congestion. “The experience with the Delhi Metro has not suggested that congestion can be reduced only by the Metro network. One needs to put in place measures such as congestion pricing, and also address first and last mile connectivity issues to bring congestion down,” Amruta Ponshke, associate fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, said.

Mr. Deshpande said they are working on a series of measures to make sure their stations are connected seamlessly to foot overbridges and also have multimodal integration. “We first need to provide an alternative, which is comfortable and efficient. Without an alternative, it would not be possible to bring in measures like congestion pricing,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yg6m0c/article30538323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bmtravelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/congestion-to-drop-drastically-by-2031-mmrda-study/article30538324.ece
391,2020/01/11,"Congress plans programme to inform people about CAA, NRC, NPR","The Mumbai Congress will start a public outreach movement to inform people about the flaws in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR).

According to Mumbai Regional Congress Committee president Eknath Gaikwad, party members will visit each ward in the city within 15-20 days and organise an interaction in every block. The move comes days after the Bharatiya Janata Party announced an outreach campaign in support of CAA.

Mr. Gaikwad said, “The Central government has attacked the foundation of citizenship by introducing CAA, NPR, and NRC. The Mumbai Congress has been opposing it since the beginning. Now it is time we informed people about how these laws will cause trouble.”

On Friday, party members attended a training session at the Mumbai Congress office, which was conducted by members of Hum Bharat ke log, an organisation working to oppose CAA, NRC and NPR. Advocate Mihir Desai, activist Feroze Mithiborewala, journalist Jatin Desai, and Bombay Catholic Sabha president Dolphy D’souza were among those present to impart training.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/congress-plans-programme-to-inform-people-about-caa-nrc-npr/article30538240.ece
392,2020/01/11,"Chapters to oppose CAA, NRC in city, State formed","Representatives of over 80 organisations in the city and across the State came together on Friday to form an alliance against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Called the Chapters in Mumbai and Maharashtra, both the bodies will be led by Justice (retd.) B.G. Kolse Patil of the Bombay High Court. He was appointed as the convener for the Mumbai and the Maharashtra Chapters.

A steering committee with 10 co-conveners from different organisations and communities like Jamat-e-Islami Hind, Bombay Catholic Sabha, and Punjabi Sanjhi Sabha, was also set up, with 82 organisations pledging their support to the alliance.

Abdul Hasib Bhatkar, co-convenor of the Mumbai Chapter, said, “Scores of protesters, mainly youths, were detained while protesting against the laws. We will help anyone caught in such a situation in legal ways to ensure that they can protest peacefully.”

Mr. Kolse Patil said he had spoken to Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, who will be holding a meeting with ministers of States which are not being governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

“Though the States under the BJP government are opposing the CAA and NRC as much as they can, at least the non-BJP States should come together to show a full-fledged opposition. I have also written to the Supreme Court to use its extraordinary jurisdiction to work in this matter. If the extraordinary jurisdiction can not save the country, what will?” he asked.

He likened the recent attacks on students at various universities in the country to the Bhima–Koregaon violence, alleging that all the attacks were planned.

Meanwhile, members of different organisations representing the Muslim community are planning to meet Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to submit an application requesting him to not implement the laws in Maharashtra.

“In December last year, when we met Mr. Thackeray, he had committed for non-implementation of CAA, NPR, and NRC in the State. He had also said that no detention centres would be set up. We are again planning to take an appointment to hand over an application so that a formal resolution to this effect can be passed,” Saiyad Arif, secretary of Muslim Seva Sangh, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chapters-to-oppose-caa-nrc-in-city-state-formed/article30538175.ece
393,2020/01/11,Molestation case: wife of DIG claims constable is scapegoat,"A day after a departmental enquiry was initiated by the Mumbai Police against constable Dinkar Salve for allegedly threatening the father of a 17-year-old victim of molestation, wife of Deputy Inspector General (Motor Transport), Pune, Nishikant More, has claimed that Mr. Salve has been made a scapegoat.

Knishika More said Mr. Salve had gone to court on Tuesday for a personal matter when she saw him. “I have known him for years as he was previously my husband’s driver. He is my rakhi brother. He knows about the case, and was avoiding eye contact with me. But I spoke to him briefly and the girl’s father used the opportunity. He shot a video on the court premises where use of phone is not allowed. He then made a fake story that Mr. Salve threatened him. First they made false allegations against my husband, now against Mr. Salve,” Ms. More said, adding Mr. Salve’s only fault was that he was known, and spoke to her.

The girl, who alleged that Mr. More had molested her last year, has been missing since Monday night. Mr. More’s wife claimed that it was a plan to not let her husband get anticipatory bail. “One of the news channels had run some CCTV footage in which the channel claimed that the girl was spotted with a boy. I know the boy; he is a friend of the girl’s brother, who also works in her father’s shop. I am sure it was planned so that my husband didn’t get anticipatory bail. It could be either with the knowledge of the parents or could be that she got frustrated with her family’s constant lies. But the girl has clearly not fled for committing suicide due to my husband, as claimed by her in the letter,” Ms. More said.

Meanwhile, the girl’s father said no father would ever make such false claims about his daughter. “No matter how cheap a man would be, he would never make such claims about his daughter. We are worried for her and are waiting for some news about her safety and return,” he said.

On Thursday, Mr. More’s anticipatory bail plea was rejected by Panvel sessions court. His wife now plans to move the Bombay High Court. Based on a report by the DGP recommending disciplinary action against Mr. More, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh suspended him on Thursday. After an FIR against Mr. More was filed with the Taloja police on December 25, he had gone absconding. On Thursday, the family also lodged a non-cognisable offence against Mr. Salve with Panvel City police station.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cy7vyo/article30538114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMMore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/molestation-case-wife-of-dig-claims-constable-is-scapegoat/article30538115.ece
394,2020/01/11,Khobryachi vadi – the god of fudgy things,"The first time I took my husband to visit Sushi Atya, my grandmother’s paternal aunt, she was in her 90s. A tall and broad-framed woman with the most beautiful features even at that age, Sushi Atya was confined to a four-poster bed as close to the dining room and kitchen as she could possibly have it placed. I imagine her worst nightmare would have been to not know the goings-on in those departments, never mind the mini jungle of overgrown jasmine and oleanders that had practically covered the once palatial mansion she called home.

Sushi Atya lived alone with a nurse-cum-domestic help for company in that large two-storeyed house, most of which had been locked away; she occupied the ground floor, which comprised a few rooms, at the centre of which was the kitchen, adjacent to a dining room. I don’t remember ever seeing the main door shut; people traipsed in and out all day; family from across the courtyard, friends from across town, and unexpected relatives like us.

Hidden delight

Miheer sat as awkward as a new son-in-law in this enchanting forest of sorts as the rest of us dug up old memories and caught up. A few minutes later, Sushi Atya asked her caretaker to finally bring out what I was expecting the moment we planned the visit — khobryachi vadi or, for lack of a better translation, coconut fudge squares. Even in that near-immobile state, Sushi Atya always had a box of vadi ready to serve; she would instruct the help and make sure that the dented old steel box was always full. Hers was a firm vadi that could be stored for a week at least at room temperature. This was achieved by adding a little extra sugar to candy the coconut and, hold your breath, grated potato for starch! Like all things forbidden, it had a certain lure. My adult taste buds couldn’t bear to eat even one whole vadi that day but I remember sneaking a handful of them as a child, while Sushi Atya rested and the other adults of the household busied themselves in gossip. A devoted fan of coconut himself, Miheer was smitten at first bite. Come back to eat more vadi; I’ll make it for you myself, she told him as we left. Alas, that was not to be.

There is another khobryachi vadi that I am partial to — one that has stayed with me for more reasons than one. This was from my maternal great grandparents’ home in Bengaluru. Thursdays in this house were for the family deity, Dutta. The prasad was always the same — khobryachi vadi. It is this vadi that has spoilt me for life.

On the morning of the aarti, one of us children would be asked to bring two coconuts from the back of the house, where the homegrown coconuts would be stored. These were still in their husks, so the first order of day was to dehusk them.

The naked coconuts would be brought in and broken; the water would be distributed among the children of the house, and the flesh inspected for any yellowness or unpleasant smell. Once considered fit for vadi (the flesh must be white, sweet smelling and moist), the coconut would be scraped over a vili; we watched as ethereal white laces of coconut fell to the plate below. The scraping had to be careful; you couldn’t let any of the scraping close to the brown shell get in, for that would ruin the flavour and colour of the vadi.

No flavourings

A mini mountain of coconut would then be measured into a pan and mixed with whole fat milk (milked right at the doorstep that very morning), fresh cream (straight off the top of the milk pot) and sugar, and cooked over the gentlest of heat to achieve a fudgy consistency. No flavourings were necessary — the sweet coconut and lactose from the milk were valiant enough. The fudge would then be patted into a lightly greased and much-used oval-shaped tray and left in the devghar, the puja room, where it was out of bounds for everyone until evening.

Sneaking in

When the adults were napping in the afternoon, I would sometimes sneak in to enjoy the collective smells of the freshly made sandalwood paste, incense, and the cooling vadi all blending with the aromas of aartis and prasads from decades and decades, all permeated into the walls, establishing ever so gently why maternal homes are so special.

Come evening, my grandmother’s brother would drape his purple silk dhoti and all of us would assemble for the aarti, spilling out of the puja room like an overfilled popcorn box — the adults seemed to pray more truthfully than us younger lot, who were sincerely more interested in the vadi. Mothi Aai would lovingly place a square on each of our hands after we had done our namaskars. After hours of cooling, the squares would have acquired a thin, sugary crust and the insides would be soft. The vadi would be gone in mere seconds but the anticipation and now the memory of it helps the flavour linger much longer.

Khobryachi vadi

Ingredients:

1 whole fresh coconut, scraped

3/4 cup sugar

1 cup milk

2 tablespoons fresh cream

2 tablespoons milk powder (optional)

1/2 teaspoon green cardamom powder (optional)

Method:

1. Place the coconut and the sugar in a blender and pulse to have a slightly homogenised but not completely blended mixture.

2. Pour this mixture into a non-stick pan along with the sugar and cream. Cook on medium heat until the sugar dissolves, stirring constantly.

3. Continue to cook for a further 10-12 minutes or until the mixture is thick and fudgy.

4. Add the milk powder and green cardamom powder and mix well. By now the mixture will have come together into a soft ball.

5. Spread the mixure onto a lightly greased metal tray and allow to cool for 5-6 hours.

6. Cut into squares and serve.

395,2020/01/11,Mr. Mathrubootham is already golden colour. No sun cream needed,"Respected Madam/Sir,

How are you? Do you have 10 minutes? Just some daily talks. What else can happen in life of retired persons. All the youths are doing revolution and all. What should retired peoples do. We should say what mannangkatti we did in 70 years? Big talks, nothing else. If constable is even walking on the road means we will get scared and cross the road. This much revolution we have done.

Better to keep quiet and avoid nose-cutting by youths.

Just some daily talks only, Madam/ Sir.

Have you seen superhit Keanu Reeves film The Matrix? Twenty years back itself I saw first day first show. Yenna action, yenna thrills, yenna music. One scene inside lobby of one building. Everything is quiet and calm and then suddenly shooting and somersault and what and all is happening. Exactly like that life is with Mrs. Mathrubootham. At 5:15 p.m., house is quiet like anything. Even voltage stabiliser on fridge you can hear from bedroom. Bzzzzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzzzzzz.

Then at 5:16 p.m., total death and destruction and chaos. Today what happened? I am sitting and enjoying superhit novel The Hammer of the Gods by Ken Follett, when suddenly Mrs. M came and said, “Old man have you even heard of moisturiser? Since 1976, you are putting same old Spice and Nivea. Whether you have any shame? This is why your face is looking like surface of karunai kizhangu. Will you do something or not?”

I said, “Kamalam, please have basic decency. If you want to eat my head, please eat, but give reason also.” She said, “Old man, just now on Instagram, Mrs. Nalini from Ladies Association has put family photos from Goa Christmas trip. Have you seen?” I said, “Kamalam, maximum I have 30 years left on this earth, whether I will waste it looking at other lady photos? I stopped after marriage itself.”

She said, “Look at Mrs. Nalini’s husband. He is same age as you. But any comparison is there? He is wearing jeans and T-shirt and cooling glass and all. You are having two-three pants and 10 shirts, five in cream colour and five light blue.”

“My god, Kamalam,” I said, “tell me what you want? You want jeans and T-shirt? Immediately I will go and get from tailor.” She said, “First of all, what buffoon goes to tailor for jeans. Next you will go to telegram office to send WhatsApp message. Second of all, do something about face. Everyday you are loafing around Anna Nagar. Whether you can put some sunscreen and moisturiser? Shall I buy for you?” I said, “No need I will purchase myself.”

So I went to nearby pharmacy and said, “Thambi give one nice international sun cream. Export quality only.” He said, “Uncle one model is there that foreigners are buying, shall I get?” I said, why not.

Madam/ Sir, I used before evening walk. And Kamalam said, “Oho some effect is there. Skin is softer than before.” Next day I used, she said, softness and some shining is there. Third day she said, “What nonsense you are putting on face, you are looking like musambi.”

Immediately, Kamalam took sun cream packet for details and then she is laughing like anything. Buffoon in pharmacy is giving sun cream that foreigners are using to get nice golden colour. Mathrubootham is already golden colour. No extra colour needed. Kamalam laughed and laughed. I called pharmacy, and rascal said it will take minimum one week for normal skin colour. Kamalam said to throw it out. I said, “Kamalam don’t talk nonsense have you seen price? I am now using it on all parts of body that is not for public consumption.”

Yours in moisturisation,

396,2020/01/11,Notes from Obidos,"A benevolent fate took me and four others — a hispanist, a poet, a novelist and the secretary of the Sahitya Akademi — to the village of Obidos. I had never heard of Obidos before I saw the castle in whose walls it is located looming on the horizon as we drove towards it from Lisbon.

The whole landscape had by then taken on a dreamlike quality. This feeling intensified when our car barely squeezed through a couple of medieval arches and stopped at the hotel. We tumbled out of the car and stepped back a few centuries. Since we weren’t princes we carried our luggage up and down a couple of cobbled streets to another section of the hotel set higher up.

In a time capsule

Obidos (Latin for citadel) is a time capsule. Occupied and inhabited since Palaeolithic times by (in turn) the Celts, Phoenicians, Romans and Moors, the castle was finally wrested from the last mentioned occupier by the Portuguese king in the 12th century. Cited by the UNESCO as a heritage village, Obidos is, for the most part, preserved in its original motor-free state and close to the way it was many centuries ago although a mammoth earthquake in 1755 did some damage. Patronised by the queens of Portugal since 1210 when it was first gifted to Queen Urraca, it has an informal title: town of the Queens.

In Dec 2015, UNESCO named Obidos a literary village, as part of the creative cities network programme designed to promote cooperation with and between cities that have identified creativity as a strategic factor for urban development. Obidos has just over 3,000 permanent inhabitants but hosts 14 bookshops, nearly all in Portuguese, though Spanish and French do have their language share with English bringing up the rear. Even a fruit and vegetable shop is stacked with shelf upon shelf of books.

Books everywhere

The highlights of our visit were The Literary Man restaurant and the Santiago Bookshop. The Church of Santiago a place of worship dating back to the 13th century is now the bookshop, Grande Livraria de Santiago. The altar, pulpits and pews spaces filled with books adds to the sacrality of the atmosphere. Livraria da Adega was the other memorable experience. Located in a wine cellar and restaurant filled with antique books, we were welcomed by the proprietor, Jose Pinho. On learning that we were from India he showed us a book on elephants, written in Latin and printed in the late 15th century. A collector of rare manuscripts and books he never travels without his two-foot high statue of goddess Saraswathi.

Is there a better way to find routes and roots in the world than through the domain of books topped off by the superb liquor which is a speciality of the region? Oppidum Ginja de Obidos — a cinnamon-flavoured liquor brewed from ginja berries is served most memorably in tiny chocolate cups. For rapid transport to a higher loka, drink the ginja and eat the chocolate cup before moving from one bookshop to the next.

397,2020/01/11,CPI flays Kiran Bedi on State Election Commissioner appointment,"The Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi’s decision to overrule the appointment of former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan as the State Election Commissioner (SEC) by the government has eroded the law-making power of the Legislative Assembly, State Secretary of the Communist Party of India A. M Saleem has said.

In a statement on Friday, Mr. Saleem said the Lt Governor has taken the law “unto herself” in the issue of the appointment of the SEC. The territorial administration was duty bound to hold the local body polls as per the directions of the Supreme Court.

As a first step, the Cabinet put up a file, seeking her sanction to appoint the State Election Commissioner. She ignored the Cabinet recommendation and instead floated an advertisement to appoint the SEC.

Sensing “foul play,” in the appointment, the Speaker gave a direction to the government to immediately appoint the SEC. Following the ruling given by the Speaker, the government appointed Mr Balakrishnan as SEC, the statement said.

“The Lt Governor without consulting the Chief Minister referred the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan to the Union Home Ministry. As per the Constitutional provisions, the election of local body comes under the State list. Therefore the matter is covered under relevant provisions of the Union Territories Act,” he said.

Concurring with the Chief Minister’ stand that an SEC cannot be removed through executive orders, Mr. Saleem said the action by the Lt Governor was an “infringement of constitutional morality and spirit of democracy.”

The unnecessary feud over appointment of SEC has caused delay in conducting civic polls, he added. The party also reiterated the demand for the recall of Lt Governor.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cpi-flays-kiran-bedi-on-state-election-commissioner-appointment/article30543801.ece
398,2020/01/11,Congress MLA in Puducherry accuses government of ‘misdeeds’,"Congress legislator N. Danavelou on Saturday said he would formally complain to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi about the “misdeeds” of the ruling party members in the Cabinet.

Addressing a press conference at the Legislative Assembly, the Congress legislator said the entire cabinet was “unfit to govern” due to the malpractices. “I will provide the proof to Mr. Gandhi. I have been suffering for the last three-and-a-half years,” he said.

Responding to Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy’s remarks that the Pradesh Congress Committee had complained to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) about his earlier outburst against the government at a protest rally in his Bahour constituency, Mr. Danavelou said he would remain in the Congress and expose the “misdeeds.”

The MLA said he would continue with his protest against the government in spite of the threat of disciplinary action. He also came out strongly against AICC in-charge for the Union Territory Sanjay Dutt for not listening to the grievances of Congress workers. Mr. Dutt was not interested in building the party, he added.

400,2020/01/11,Ramadass faults GGI methodology,"M. Ramadass, former MP, has flagged “glaring shortcomings, methodological flaws and serious calculation errors” in the recently released Good Governance Index (GGI) report, which incidentally had placed Puducherry at the top among Union Territories.

In a memorandum to Jitendra Singh, Union Minister for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, he said the net result of these failings “tended to diminish the utility of the report, mar its credibility and also mislead the public” and sought withdrawal of the report from public domain.

According to Mr. Ramadass, the GGI is chiefly constructed as the composite score (ranging from 2.97 for Lakshadweep to 5.62 for Tamil Nadu) aggregated from the normative values of ten broad sectors and 50 related indicators. Strangely enough, most of these indicators do not exactly and directly fall in the realm of Good Governance thereby making the official GGI less relevant and inappropriate, he pointed out.

Good Governance encompasses sound citizen-centric public administration characterised by responsiveness, accountability, rule of law, transparency, equity and inclusiveness, an efficient and effective public sector, people’s participation and decentralised power sharing , democratisation and democracy, political empowerment of people, human rights, equity, sustainability and values of fairness. In fact, governance of a State may be good or bad depending on the presence or absence of these attributes.

Unfortunately, the GGI has not used these relevant indicators for measuring Good Governance of States. In other words, the report has not focussed on major components of what constitutes governance — what Government does and how it does and how it safeguards the interests of stakeholders.

Contrarily, development performance in sectors such as agriculture, industry, human resource, health, infrastructure, social welfare, environment etc, have been used which have partial and indirect bearing on governance.

These sectors and indicators identified from them may be directly relevant in the construction of Development Index for the State but not good governance index, was his argument.

While it is true that good governance may result in good development of the State, good governance is not fully and always determined by achievements in the development spectrum alone, as sometimes, good development occurs even without proper governance at the State level.

Lack of proper weightage to citizen-centric governance as one of the three qualitative variables, the other two being economic governance and judicial governance, has distorted the results, he said.

He felt it was inappropriate that all States and Union Territories (36) have been assessed for governance by grouping them into three categories — Big States (18), North East and Hill States (11) and Union Territories (7). Structurally, all seven UTs do not have same status and instruments of governance.

The Union Territory of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi have elected Legislature while the remaining UTs are without legislature and are almost directly governed by the Central Government through the Lt. Governors.

Governance in UTs with legislature will have to be citizen-centric and responsive to the needs of the people as they are elected by the people with a committed pre poll manifesto while UTs without legislature have no such compulsion.

Alternatively, since Puducherry and Delhi have matured into States and exhibit all the characteristics of a State, they should have been grouped with States — North East and Hill States just as Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) or with other States just as Goa. When the Union Territory of J&K without legislature is included in the category of North East and Hill States, why not Puducherry and Delhi?

“The best course of action would have been clubbing of 36 States and UTs together without categorising them as is done by the present GGI study itself for the purpose of applying Dimensionless Index Method,” he said.

Equal weightage

Mr. Ramadass pointed out that sectors included for the analysis are incorrectly assigned equal weightage of 1 implying that all 9 sectors are of equal importance. Agriculture, for instance, is not of same significance to Delhi and Tamil Nadu.

The fact is that all nine indicators are of varying importance to all States and UTs and assigning equal weightage to the sectors would only distort the overall picture of ranking.

All UTs except Chandigarh suffer from inaccuracies in final score. In sum, among the 36 States and UTs considered for GGI, composite scores calculated by the government are inaccurate in the case of 35 States and UTs and also disrupt the ranking scale.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/6l199k/article30539321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11PONDYMETTUPALAYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ramadass-faults-ggi-methodology/article30539322.ece
401,2020/01/11,Narayanasamy moves Madras High Court on free rice scheme,"Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Friday moved the Madras High Court to declare as illegal and ultra vires, the action of the administrator of the Union Territory in differing with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with regard to the free rice scheme.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan, before whom the petition filed by the Chief Minister came up for hearing, directed the Registry to number the petition and post it for maintainability. In his petition, Mr. Narayanasamy sought a direction for the continuation of the policy of the Puducherry government as per its free supply of rice, edible oil and other essential food grains every month to all ration cardholders in kind.

He said immediately after coming to power, the Cabinet at its first meeting on June 6, 2016, decided not only to continue the supply of rice in kind, but also to enhance it from 10 kg to 20 kg. From August 2016, the distribution of free rice to all ration cardholders was enhanced to 20 kg.

The petitioner said funds for the implementation of the scheme came from the government of Puducherry and not from the Centre. While so, in January 2018, under the guise of financial approval, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi arbitrarily interfered in the supply and food security without any jurisdiction or manner of power, ordered reduction of distribution of free rice from 20 kg to 10 kg for the APL cardholders.

She gave a directive that in respect of APL cardholders, only Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) as cash should be done, the petitioner said. In view of the ‘authoritative’ acts of the Lt. Governor, his government took up the issue of continuation of their policy and the matter was placed before the Cabinet for deliberations at the June 7, 2019 meeting, he said.

After deliberations and various complaints, the Cabinet decided to continue the distribution of free rice in kind rather than as DBT, he said.

However, by September 5, 2019, the administrator differed with the views of the Cabinet and the Council of Ministers and referred the matter to the Union government. She also passed an interim order that the rice would not be supplied in kind but the benefit would only be DBT (cash) mode pending the decision of the Centre.

Now, the Union government has issued an advisory to the Union Territory of Puducherry to continue with the DBT scheme in lieu of distribution of free rice, he added. Earlier, Mr. Narayanasamy had accused Ms. Bedi of functioning in an “atrocious” manner by “blocking” the free rice scheme and interfering in the appointment of the State Election Commissioner.

The Chief Minister, who has been at loggerheads with Ms. Bedi on various issues, also said he has moved the High Court over the issue. While the government has been insisting on distribution of rice to ration cardholders, she has pushed for remittance of cash equivalent to the quantum of rice into bank accounts of beneficiaries, saying the Centre has given such direction.

Mr. Narayanasamy claimed approval has been obtained from Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan for distributing rice to the cardholders through the PDS instead of cash. But, Ms. Bedi, meanwhile, wrote to the Home Ministry insisting on Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), which was accepted by the latter, he said.

The Chief Minister said PWD and Local Administration Minister would also soon challenge in the Madras High court, Lieutenant Governor’s current move to appoint a State Election Commissioner through a newspaper advertisement. Her earlier ‘attempt’ was thwarted by the territorial Assembly and a resolution was adopted appointing retired IAS officer T.M. Balakrishnan as the SEC to conduct the civic polls, he said.

While Mr. Balakrishnan, subsequent to his appointment, started carrying out duties to conduct civic polls, Ms. Bedi got the Home Ministry nod for recruiting the SEC through a Selection Committee headed by the Chief Secretary, the Chief Minister said.

Reacting to the Chief Minister’s remarks, Ms. Bedi in a WhatsApp message, said he was repeatedly making “unfounded” statements.

She said, “Regrettably, the honourable Chief Minister is repeatedly making very unfounded statements. I leave it to the people to understand. Unfortunately, telling lies is not an offence.

Responding to questions at a press conference, the Chief Minister said party leadership would decide on the course of action against Mr. Danavelou. “We don’t need his certificate. The Government of India and NITI Aayog have recognised the work of this government,” he said.

Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao, who was present at the press conference, refuted the legislator’s allegation that Primary Health Centres in Bahour constituency were short on medicines and drivers for ambulance. He said there were two ambulances and six drivers.

Mr. Danavelou was angry because the Health Department did not heed his request for appointing his candidate as a driver. The Lt. Governor was free to inspect any of the hospitals herself to confirm the availability of medicines, Mr. Rao said. The MLA, while speaking at a demonstration in a village at Bahour on Thursday, had termed the government as “non-functional and unfit.”

406,2020/01/11,Bedi trying to appoint her ‘favoured’ officer as SEC: CM,"Continuing his tirade against Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on the appointment of State Election Commissioner (SEC), Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Friday said Ms. Bedi was insisting on inviting applications for the post of SEC with the sole intention of anointing her “consultant cum Officer on Special Duty” G. Theva Neethi Dhas to the position.

Addressing a press conference, the Chief Minister said Ms. Bedi overruled the Assembly decision to appoint former bureaucrat T.M. Balakrishnan with the intent to appoint her “favoured” officer.

‘Why a second ad?’

“Otherwise, why should the same advertisement which was cancelled by the Speaker through a ruling be floated again with the same conditions. The 25-years work experience included as a criteria is to fit in Mr. Dhas for the post,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

Reiterating his assertion that the Lt. Governor has no authority to remove Mr. Balakrishnan, the Chief Minister said the SEC could be removed only through the legislative route as in the case of judges.

On the Lt. Governor’s remark that she was only implementing directions of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, the Chief Minister said Ms. Bedi’s double standards were apparent when it came to implementing MHA directions.

The Government of India issued an order delegating more financial powers to the Cabinet and gave the Cabinet power to sanction programmes and projects worth ₹50 crore. The file was still pending with the Lt. Governor, Mr. Narayanasamy said.

‘No right to talk of rules’

In the case of re-appointment of Mr. Dhas after serving as Secretary to the Lt. Governor, the MHA on the request of Ms. Bedi posted him as only a consultant for her. However, the Lt. Governor on her own appointed Mr. Dhas as consultant-cum-OSD, the Chief Minister said adding that Ms. Bedi had “no right” to talk about rules.

Perumal.

Addressing a press conference along with other party leaders on Friday, Mr. Perumal said the House should be convened to pass an anti-CAA resolution along the lines of the Kerala Assembly.

The CPI(M) fully endorsed the views of the Congress government on its right to take decisions whether it was on the issue of appointment of the State Election Commissioner or distribution of free rice. The Lt. Governor had “crossed all limits,” by overruling the decision of the Assembly to appoint a former bureaucrat as SEC, he said.

Veteran leader T. Murugan said he had written a letter last month to the Chief Justice of Madras High Court for early listing of his case challenging the authority of the Lt. Governor.

408,2020/01/11,Art exhibition gets under way at Auroville,"A group show featuring a variety of genres, styles and media gets under way at Auroville from Saturday.

Hosted by Centre d’Art, Auroville, ‘Emptiness’ showcases paintings by E. Ezhilarasan, B. Vengatesh, S. Danasegar and K. Sridar at the Centre d’Art, Citadines. The show is on till January 28.

According to organisers, what drives the artists is a desire to capture the messages of the invisible —— to become the vectors of a world to which we have no access, rarefying in their work the elements of distraction and uncovering latent mysteries beneath the surface of things.

For Ezhilarasan and Vengatesh, who tirelessly return to the places they are fascinated by, respectively the Himalayas and Varanasi, it is also a metaphorical journey with shifts of consciousness.

Danasegar decides to empty himself and go deep within, letting his hand trace signs on the surface of the canvas that he refuses to control, and become “the water flowing through the pebbles...the line..” and be freed from his existence.

Each artist bears inside a wealth of knowledge, memories and sensory experiences which are essential to his/her artistic evolution. But sooner or later, freed from the bonds of the past, the artist feels the need to get rid of that baggage and to reach into new, unexplored regions.

Sridhar’s father was an artist, and from the temple of his childhood he kept memories of marvels and an absolute devotion for the masterpieces he could admire throughout India, and make his own - the sculptures, the bas reliefs, the frescoes by Ellora and Ajanta.

The echoes from this prodigiously ancient world continue to filter through his porous-looking stratigraphies, like those of a mural.

Common thread

The common thread that connects the four artists from the city, rather like the underground river where their journeys meet, may be found in the sculptures of Ezhilarasan, portraying a group of nine small studies of human beings caught in the familiar positions of common daily life, which the artist calls the nine planets.

The gallery hours are 11.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. (barring Sundays).",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/art-exhibition-gets-under-way-at-auroville/article30538241.ece

410,2020/01/11,Police turn lifesavers for Kollam native,"The Kerala Police turned lifesavers for Kollam-native Madhu Divakaran when a highway police team ensured his timely arrival at a hospital after he suffered a heart attack.

A post by Mr. Divakaran’s on Facebook in which he narrated his experience has won plaudits for the yeoman service that was rendered by the police in his time of need.

Recounting his ordeal that had taken place during the wee hours of December 28, the resident of Koottikkada described the difficulties that he and his family faced in seeking healthcare after he developed a severe chest pain at around 1 a.m. After attempts to alert autorickshaw drivers in the locality turned futile, Mr. Divakaran, who is employed in a gas godown as a loading worker, braved his pain to ride his two-wheeler to a nursing home where an electrocardiography (ECG) test detected an abnormal condition.

No ambulance

His hardship did not end there. A doctor’s attempts in seeking the services of a ‘108’ ambulance turned in vain, prompting the patient, his wife and son to walk for a short distance before they could hire an autorickshaw to head for the Kollam district hospital. With Mr. Divakaran’s condition getting worse as time went by, the autorickshaw driver stopped on seeing a highway police team which was stationed near the Thattamala school on the highway.

The police team, which comprised senior civil police officer K.J. Daniel and civil police officer Umesh Lawrence, lost no time in transferring the patient to the jeep and rushing to the hospital. . Mr. Divakaran was also provided first-aid in the vehicle until it reached their destination. After being subjected to emergency treatment, the patient was later referred to the Government Medical College Hospital here, where he recuperated to emerge out of critical condition.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/police-turn-lifesavers-for-kollam-native/article30538177.ece
411,2020/01/11,VACB finds graft in land purchase fund disbursal,"The subsidies and grants meant for the landless, homeless and needy among the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State are easily usurped by well-heeled persons with the tacit help of corrupt local body officials, according to the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB).

The VACB flagged the startling nepotism and graft in SC/ST development offices in municipalities and block panchayats after the agency wound up a State-wide surprise inspection code-named ‘Operation Rights’ on Friday.

The offices illegally diverted funds, meant for landless persons to purchase housing plots, to ineligible persons.

Similar diversion

The agency also noted similar diversion of housing funds for SC/STs with smallholdings.

Investigators said the money allotted for SC/ST students to construct study rooms rarely reached the eligible. The government offered up to ₹6 lakh to landless SC/STs to buy housing plots.

It also offered a grant of ₹4 lakh to those seeking to build houses in the land they already owned.

Officials said SC/ST development officers often operated under a cloak of secrecy.

They were empowered to select beneficiaries based on reports submitted by local bodies and the LIFE Mission. However, investigators said the selection process appeared opaque.

And many ineligible persons had benefited from the State welfare targeted at the marginalised communities that had faced centuries of oppression and deprivation.

They somehow seemed to get revenue documents proving caste and attestations by village officers to grab the subsidies.

The agency found many such depositions submitted for getting the grant to be false.

Investigators said SC/ST development officers often mired genuine applicants in red-tape and stonewalled their application for benefits citing various rules. They rarely published the list of beneficiaries or applicants at offices or on the government websites.

For instance, in Kollam, the SC/ST development officer had allotted money for the purchase of housing plots to persons who had already benefited from a similar scheme in 2011.

Without vetting

The officer had accepted the applications without vetting them and disbursed funds without question possibly at the behest of local ruling front politicians. The same pattern was seen repeated in other districts.

412,2020/01/11,Councillors raise issues at adalat,"The city Corporation witnessed an unusual adalat on Friday, with the councillors raising the issues that they have been facing regarding works in their wards and in dealing with officials of the various sections.

Mayor K.Sreekumar convened the adalat with an aim to provide councillors who are often unable to raise local-level issues in council meetings, with a platform to raise the same.

Stormwater drain

Officials of all the sections were also present in the meeting to explain the status regarding the various issues raised by the councillors. One of the major issues raised was the slow pace of work on the stormwater drains at the SS Koil Road in the Thampanoor ward.

An official from the engineering department said that the work of the drains on the left and right sides of the road have been awarded separately, with the right side progressing moderately faster.

Although there is an option to terminate the contract over tardy progress, restarting the work with another contractor would take months.

The Mayor said that the works standing committee chairperson would hold an urgent meeting with the contractors and others concerned to ensure that the work is completed at the earliest.

The SS Koil Road had experienced water-logging during the rains last week too.

Another councillor complained about the slow response to requests for tar cutting, despite there being an instruction that permission should be provided within 10 days.

The councillor of Thirumala ward complained about the lack of maintenance of the Thirumala market.

Action taken report

The Mayor, in his reply, asked the officials of the engineering section to submit a report on the status of the action taken on each of the complaints with a week. The health section officials have been asked to ensure no new wayside eatery is opened without licence.

They have been asked to take steps regarding setting up vending zones and issuing license to the existing vendors.

417,2020/01/11,LIFE flats to come up at Corpn.’s own land,"After having struggled for over two years to purchase plots for the construction of flats as part of the second phase of the Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing project, the city Corporation has decided to use land already in its possession for the same.

A council meeting held on Friday decided to use the lands in Poonkulam as well as Kalladimukham for the purpose.

Part of the land in Poonkulam was bought in the past using funds from the Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan and was lying unused. In Kalladimukham, the land remaining after the completion of a previous housing project will be used for constructing houses under LIFE.

The civic body had initially formed a search committee to identify land for constructing flats under the LIFE project. The team had identified several pieces of land mostly in the outskirts of the city, close to the borders of the Corporation area.

Market rates

After the Corporation issued a call for suitable plots for construction of flats, many had also responded from different parts of the city. But a majority of them turned back as the rates offered by the civic body were much lower compared to the market rates.

The civic body has been requesting the State government for more flexibility in the fixing of the rates, but there has been no response so far.

The Fisheries Department had earlier last year issued such an order for some of its housing projects, enabling the acquisition of land at rates close to the market rates. Some of the lands which were identified last year were later found unsuitable, due to their location and slanted geography.

With the need to get things going before the end of the financial year in March, the civic body finally decided to begin the work at land already in its possession.

418,2020/01/11,Plus One score may soon matter,"There are indications that managements of arts and science colleges in central districts are keen to follow the latest practice of leading institutions in western districts of considering Plus One score of applicants for admission into B.A., B.Sc., and other UG programmes.

“The experience of fixing cut-off for admission to UG programmes based on the marks in Plus Two score alone has not been good. Students from private schools admitted with high scores in Plus Two have been found to struggle with their subjects due to skipping a bulk of Plus One portions,” says a functionary of a self-financing arts and science college.

Teachers in government higher secondary schools, who are necessitated to concentrate only on Plus One portions in the first year of higher secondary unlike in the case of their counterparts in private schools, say it is simply impossible to complete what they describe as “voluminous portions” under the new syllabus.

For instance, there are close to 1,000 pages of content to be covered in botany and zoology put together, each of which has two volumes.

Likewise, there are two volumes each for mathematics, physics and chemistry, they pointed out.

In fact, teachers in government schools had to rush through the portions by working consecutively on Saturdays. “It is another matter that we were not in a position to make the special classes compulsory for fear of being victimised by a section of unattentive students who would allege inhumane treatment,” a senior teacher said.

Now that the revision exams have begun, there will be no more time to hold classes for revising the portions. “The students, unfortunately, have to fend for themselves,” the teacher said, citing shortage of teaching-learning days caused at the start of the academic year due to late arrival of books and the need to attend orientation classes on the new syllabi.

Most of the private schools are seemingly focussed only on coaching students for NEET. Preparation for the public exams has indeed become incidental, a teacher in a private school admitted requesting anonymity.

The managements of private schools do not seem to realise that those who miss out on NEET must be in a position to secure admission in courses of their choice in leading arts and science colleges, the teacher said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/plus-one-score-may-soon-matter/article30545798.ece

Delivering the convocation address at Srimad Andavan Arts and Science College, he said eradicating poverty, ensuring inclusive growth, making agriculture more reliable, remunerative and viable, bridging the urban-rural divide, empowering women, ending illiteracy, making effective use of programmes such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ would help in building a prosperous new India.

Public-private partnership was essential to improve infrastructure. “I urge the private sector to join hands with the government to assist with in development,"" he said.

Mr. Naidu stressed inculcation of the idea of ‘Indian-ness’ in youth.

“Our language, our clothes must reflect our Indian-ness. We are a great nation with a rich and vibrant history. We must follow our culture in letter and in spirit,” he said.

Indians across the country should be proud of their culture and not discriminate on the basis of caste, region, religion and gender. “Who has defined what is upper caste and what is lower caste? Learn how to respect one’s motherland through the works of great Indian scholars such as Ramanujacharya, Subramania Bharathi, Veerapandiya Kattabomman,” he said.

Mr. Naidu said he stopped and alighted from his car to take in the glory of the Cauvery en route to the college.

“Water flowing in the Cauvery has become a rare sight now. Water is getting scarce. We must take care of traditional ponds and lakes,” he said and urged students to involve themselves in gardening and tree planting. “For the past few decades, we have been seeing the adverse impact of global warming and climate change. We have tinkered with nature for too long and now we are experiencing the impact of nature’s fury.”

On Friday, a team of Food Safety officials seized nearly 2,000 kg of jaggery in Pudukottai town from 24 wholesale shops. “Although we do not know the contaminating substance, manufacturers mix sulphur with the jaggery, making it bright yellow as opposed to the dark brown colour of pure jaggery,” an official said.

421,2020/01/11,"AIADMK bags panchayat chief posts in Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Karur districts","The AIADMK has won the chairperson posts in Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Karur districts.

Despite being short of a majority in Pudukottai, the AIADMK managed to win the district panchayat chairman post, apparently with the support of the Congress.

Out of 22 district panchayat wards, the AIADMK won eight wards and its ally TMC one. The DMK candidates won from 11 wards and its ally Congress captured 2 wards. Since the DMK alliance won in 13 wards, it was expected to be a cakewalk for the DMK to capture the district chairman post.

But, the AIADMK candidate, T. Jayalakshmi, romped home with the support of 12 councillors as against 10 votes secured by the DMK candidate, Kalaivani, in the indirect election. Apparently, three ward members belonging to the DMK-Congress combine cross-voted in support of the AIADMK candidate.

In the district vice-chairman election too, the DMK suffered a jolt by losing the post to the Congress. In the election held under a surcharged atmosphere later in the afternoon, Congress candidate Uma Maheswari was declared elected through lot. Both Uma Maheswari and DMK candidate Kalaivani polled 11 votes each, forcing the Returning Officer to opt for a draw of lots to choose the winner. The AIADMK and the TMC backed Uma Maheswari.

The Congress reportedly requested the DMK to allot the district vice- chairperson post to it. However, the DMK did not accede to the demand. Sensing trouble in the DMK alliance, the AIADMK played its cards close to its chest to get the crucial support of the Congress in the district chairperson election and, subsequently, the AIADMK extended support to the Congress candidate in the district vice-chairperson election.

The election to vice-chairperson of Annavasal Panchayat Union was postponed due to lack of quorum. When voting was called for in the afternoon, the AIADMK members did not turn turn up, thereby causing shortage for the mandatory number of members to be present for holding the election.

However, the DMK captured nine out of 13 panchayat unions in the district. Its rival, the AIADMK won in just four unions. In Viralimalai panchayat union, the home town of MLA C. Vijayabaskar, the DMK candidate M. Kamu was elected as union chairperson. She secured 17 out of 21 votes.

Ariyalur

The AIADMK and its ally, the PMK, captured all panchayat union chairperson posts in Ariyalur district, except Thirumanur, which went to the DMK.

While the AIADMK candidates won in Andimadam, Ariyalur and T. Palur, the PMK candidates were declared elected from Jayankondam and Sendurai unions.

High drama was witnessed in the indirect election to the post of Sendurai panchayat union chairman as the AIADMK and its ally, the PMK, locked horns directly. PMK candidate Deivamani with the support of the DMK, won the election by defeating the AIADMK nominee with a margin of two votes. Interestingly, Manivelan, lone member of AMMK, was elected unopposed as vice chairperson. Similarly, the AIADMK candidate won the vice-chairperson election of Thirumanu panchayat union by defeating the DMK nominee by one vote. One member of the DMK apparently cross voted in favour of the AIADMK.

In the panchayat union chairperson election held in the morning, the DMK candidate defeated the AIADMK candidate with a margin of one vote. The AIADMK candidate P. Chandrasekar was elected unopposed to the post of district chairperson.

Karur

The AIADMK won handsome victory in all eight panchayat unions and the district panchayat chairman post in the indirect election held here on Saturday.

M.S. Kannadasan was elected unopposed to the post of chairperson of the district panchayat.

In the election to the panchayat union chairperson post of Krishnarayapuram (Reserved), A. Chandramathi, who was elected as a ward member on the DMK ticket, became the chairman as the AIADMK nominee.

In the run up to the election, she had crossed over to the AIADMK. Though it emerged as a single largest party in the 20-member union, the AIADMK did not have any councillor belonging to the Scheduled Caste. The AIADMK reportedly roped in Ms. Chandramathi and fielded her as nominee.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/aiadmk-bags-panchayat-chief-posts-in-pudukottai-ariyalur-and-karur-districts/article30545765.ece

425,2020/01/11,"DMK sweeps Tiruchi, Perambalur in indirect poll to rural local bodies","The DMK made a clean sweep in the indirect election to rural local bodies in Tiruchi district on Saturday.

Besides winning the chairman’s post of the District Panchayat Council, the party also bagged the chairperson post in all 14 panchayat unions.

With a comfortable majority of 18 wards councillors in the 24-member council, DMK candidate D. Rajendiran was declared elected unopposed as chairman.

The AIADMK bagged five wards and the Congress one. K.S.M. Karunanidhi was elected unopposed as vice-chairman.

The DMK cornered a lion’s share of seats in the panchayat unions, winning 146 out of 241 seats, helping it to win the chairperson posts in all 14 panchayat unions. Such was the dominance of the party that 10 of the panchayat union chairpersons were elected unopposed. There were contests only in Lalgudi, Tiruverumbur, Thuraiyur and Vaiyampatti. But even here, the DMK candidates won without much ado. Nine of the elected chairpersons were women.

Nagapattinam

The DMK also won the chairperson post of the District Panchayat and eight of the 11 panchayat unions in Nagapattinam district.

Although the DMK had a clear majority in the 21-member District Panchayat Council with 14 councillors, there was contest in the indirect election held on Saturday as there were two contestants from the party for the post of chairperson (General-Women).

426,2020/01/11,Cascade aerators set up to remove iron content in Kollidam water,"Tiruchi Corporation has set up two cascade aerators in Kollidam to purify water sourced from the river bed.

The move follows complaints from residents in areas connected to the drinking water supply augmentation scheme that the water is often muddy or discoloured.

Tests show that the water has high iron content, but within limits and does not pose any health hazard, corporation engineers say.

However, the residents have been consistently flagging the issue. “The quality of water is tested every month and documented. But the residents are concerned. Taking cognisance, the idea to set up cascade aerators was mooted,” an official says.

Water from the two collector wells in Kollidam will pass through the aerators of 12 metre diameter. It will cascade down and the iron content in the water will react with the oxygen in the air, oxidise and separate.

“The purified water will be led into the common collection sump from where it will be supplied to nearly 73 over head tanks (OHTs) in the city, while the iron by-product will be removed,” a senior civic official said.

Of the total 137 OHTs across the four zones in the city, 73 are filled with water from the Kollidam. The tanks are located in Ariyamangalam and Golden Rock zones. Although similar aerators have been installed in other municipal corporations in the State, this is the first attempt at removing the iron content in water in Tiruchi.

The one crore needed for the project was drawn from general fund of the corporation and was done with the consultation and design of Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and Commissionerate of Municipal Administration.

The total capacity of water at the common collection tank is 60 million litres per day (mld). Nearly 90% of the work is completed and multiple tests have been successful. The aerators will be put to use within 20 days, the official says.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qxmwpi/article30554890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY12-CASCADE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cascade-aerators-set-up-to-remove-iron-content-in-kollidam-water/article30544315.ece

429,2020/01/11,Premier League | 10-man Arsenal held by Palace as Aubameyang sees red,"Crystal Palace were held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired the visitors ahead and was sent off after Jordan Ayew scored a fortuitous equaliser for the home side.

The result provisionally left Palace ninth in the standings on 29 points from 22 games, one ahead of 10th-placed Arsenal whose manager Mikael Arteta criticised his team for conceding a sloppy goal.

“The first 35 minutes is exactly what I want our Arsenal team to play like,” the Spaniard told the BBC. “After that we started to give free-kicks and give balls away.

“In the first 15 minutes of the second half, credit to them because they pushed. We switched off completely for the goal and thats unacceptable.”

His counterpart Roy Hodgson said Palace deserved the point they earned for their second half pressure.

“The first third of the game wasnt much fun to watch,” he said. “We realised well have to give up some of our protection we did that and it started to fit into place for us.

“In the last two-thirds of the game Im really delighted with the team. I thought in terms of general play and the amount of questions we were asking, we were good value for the point.”

Aubameyang struck in the 12th minute, steering a low shot past goalkeeper Vicente Guaita after he was put through by Alexandre Lacazette, with Arsenal dominating an uneventful first half at Selhurst Park.

Ayew levelled in the 54th minute with a heavily deflected shot which left keeper Bernd Leno stranded after it came off defender David Luiz, as the visitors failed to clear a tame-looking low cross from the right.

Aubameyang was shown a straight red card midway through the second half after a VAR check, following a rash tackle on Max Meyer which forced the Palace forward to limp off injured.

Palace, who gained the upper hand in the closing stages with their numerical advantage, missed their best chance to grab a winner when Sokratis Papastathopoulos cleared a James Tomkins header off the line in the 78th minute.

They were let of the hook three minutes later at the other end as Guaita tipped Nicolas Pepe's fierce low shot on to the post and then smothered Lacazette's close-range follow up.

Palace defender Gary Cahill was not entirely happy with the outcome.

“We're frustrated not to get the win, but in the first half they were very good,” he told BT Sport.

“It was difficult to deal with their pace and movement. When we got to grips with the game we did well. Were doing OK, but we need to keep pushing and keep working hard.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/7g3113/article30545297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-ENGLAND-CRY-ARSREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-10-man-arsenal-held-by-palace-as-aubameyang-sees-red/article30545298.ece
430,2020/01/11,Manchester City fans given five-year bans over racist abuse,"Two Manchester City supporters have received five-year bans from football matches and lifetime suspensions from the Premier League champions' stadium after being found guilty of racist abuse.

Ian Baldry, 58, made a racist comment towards City and England winger Raheem Sterling as he celebrated scoring a goal in a Premier League game against Bournemouth at the Etihad Stadium in December 2018.

The defendant from Yorkshire pleaded guilty in September to causing racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.

On Friday, he was sentenced at Manchester Magistrates' Court and also ordered to complete 200 hours of community service and pay £170 ($222) court costs.

In a witness statement against the defendant, another supporter present at the match told police “it was disgusting in this day and age that this was going on.

“I was shocked and offended and felt sick to my stomach when I heard it.”

Baldry's friend, James McConnell, from Manchester, was heard making racist remarks about two match stewards at the same game.

Witnesses described McConnell as being drunk and abusive throughout the first half and regularly using foul language to insult the players on the pitch, said Greater Manchester Police.

The 57-year-old went on to make a comment about the race of a Bournemouth player, reportedly defender Tyrone Mings.

A fellow fan confronted McConnell about his behaviour and later reported him to stewards.

McConnell was also spotted shouting similar comments at a City player who took a corner at a home game against Newcastle two months earlier, said police.

He was also sentenced in Manchester after pleading guilty.

In a statement, City said: “Following the sentencing of Ian Baldry and James McConnell at Manchester Magistrates' Court and in line with Manchester City's zero tolerance approach to discrimination, lifetime bans have been issued by the club.

“The club would like to thank Manchester City supporters for reporting both incidents and their cooperation throughout the investigations.”

Racism continues to scar football, with England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria twice stopped due to racism in the stands earlier this season, while Gareth Southgate's team encountered the same issue in another match in Montenegro.

Last season, a banana was thrown at Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang by a Tottenham fan, while Sterling was subjected to alleged racist abuse in a match at Chelsea.

Numerous football fixtures in Italy have also been marred by racism.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/peore0/article30541853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHEEMK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/manchester-city-fans-given-five-year-bans-over-racist-abuse/article30541854.ece
431,2020/01/11,Chennaiyin cruises home,"It was a familiar script with bottom-placed Hyderabad FC suffering yet another embarrassing defeat, this time a 1-3 loss against former champion, Chennaiyin FC, in the Hero ISL football league championship at the GMC Balayogi Stadium here on Friday.

Chennaiyin took the lead in the 40th minute, thanks to the brilliance of Rafael Crivellaro, who showed fine opportunism to position himself at the right spot inside the ‘D’ for a perfect cross from the right by Nerijus Valskis to beat a diving goalkeeper Kamaljit Singh.

And, just before the break, Andre Schembri was lightning quick on the right flank to pick up a long ball from the midfield and sprinted a few yards towards the top of the ‘D’ to give a quick and short pass to Valskis, who cleverly dribbled further towards the left-flank and then executed a beautiful left-footer which beat a diving Kamaljit Singh and stunned the home camp.

Equal to the task

Not the kind of first-half the host would have hoped for when it had its chances. But, it was obvious Chennaiyin defence, manned by Lucian Goian, Eli Sabia Filho and Jerry Lalrinzuala, was equal to the task the few times Hyderabad FC forwardline, especially the omnipresent Marcelo Pereira, threw up a challenge.

In the second-half, Hyderabad was on the offensive from the word go but it badly needed Marcelo to break the shackles again.

And, against the run of play, it was Chennaiyin which took a 3-0 lead in the 65th minute when a one-on-one effort between Crivellaro and Valskis resulted in the latter scoring deftly from close range.

Finally, Marcello was on target with another of this typical runs down the centre with a stinging left-footer in the 88th minute. But, it was too late to change the outcome.

The result: Hyderabad FC 1 (Marcelo 88) lost to Chennaiyin FC 3 (Crivellaro 40, Valskis 43 & 65).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rlwdw3/article30538563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11VALSKIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/chennaiyin-cruises-home/article30538564.ece

433,2020/01/11,"Acknowledge GVMC efforts, Municipal Commissioner appeals to citizens","Active participation by citizens with necessary feedback on further improving Visakhapatnam will help the city do better in the Swachh Survekshan-2020 and citizens should take interest by acknowledging the corporation’s work, Municipal Commissioner G. Srijana said.

The participation was all the more important since an award for citizen participation had been introduced, she said at a press conference here. As of now, in citizen feedback the city stood first among the 4,000 ‘Survekshan’ cities and 49 above 10 lakh population with 80,000 participating downloading the Swachhta App and ‘Vote for your City.’

The civic administration had done its bit in waste segregation, door-to-door collection, home composting, garbage-free city, plantation, community toilets, maintenance of storm water drains, reducing the use of single use plastic, among other things. Timelines have been introduced to lift compact and dumper bins with photographic evidence. She appealed to citizens to acknowledge the visible change.

For the drains flowing into the sea, screens have been installed at various places to arrest the flow of garbage or plastic.

In the previous Survekshan GVMC getting two-star rating instead of three-star it had applied for garbage-free city rating lowered its marks dragging it down the ladder of ranks. Besides the segregation of waste that was around 40 %, now improved to 80 to 85 %. It’s already certified as ODF++ city.

The WhatsApp number given, Twitter and Facebook could be used to follow or bring any shortcomings or areas that needed improvement to her attention, Ms. Srijana said.

Single use plastic was banned but more intense effort needed to be made and the livelihood issues also must be kept in view, she said.

The Swachh Survekhan team will visit any time and directly observe and interact with citizens. Of the total 6,000 marks, 1,500 are for service-level progress, 1,500 for direct observation, 1,500 for citizen feedback, 500 for open defecation free and 1,000 for garbage-free city certifications.

435,2020/01/11,In defence of the word: Works of Cicero,"Is it relevant to channel Cicero at this moment when reasoned argument appears to have little value? Perhaps not. But let us pretend that debate and discourse are still relevant and have use, even in this nation and in these times. In any case, Cicero is relevant for another reason: he is the first martyr to free speech, preferring to die rather than permanently capitulate.

His crime was to publicly oppose dictatorship and one-man rule. The man he opposed was, of course, Julius Caesar and later Mark Antony. What we think of as parliamentary debate has its origins in the speeches given by men in Greece and Rome. And the exemplar of this form of defiant communication is Marcus Tullius Cicero.

Unadorned prose

He made translations of Plato, wrote tracts on philosophy and religion, and was a prolific correspondent, penning many letters. But it is for his rhetoric that he is justly famous, not only in his time but also in ours. His legal speeches — against Verres, for Quinctius, among others — and his political speeches — against Mark Antony, in particular — have survived and come down to us as textbook examples of quality style.

Cicero wrote unadorned prose. He praised Caesar’s writing style, quite similar to his, though he opposed his politics. Cicero’s writing was transparent and direct and so effective that by words alone he could get potential dictators to flee Rome (the Catiline Orations of 63 BC).

Three years later, in 60 BC, Caesar invited Cicero, who was widely respected, to join as fourth member of the initial triumvirate he led with Pompey and the wealthy financier Crassus. Cicero declined, remaining loyal to the idea of the Republic.

Harassed, he went into exile and focussed on his writing.

When Caesar broke with Pompey, Cicero sided with the latter believing that he would be more republican than the great warrior. Alas, at the Battle of Pharsalus, Caesar’s smaller but vastly more competent force routed the legions of Pompey (in an engagement reminiscent of the rebel Aurangzeb’s victory over the Mughal banners at Samugarh).

Dying with dignity

Caesar entered Rome triumphant — in the actual sense of the word — and was elected dictator for life. He pardoned Cicero, who had returned to the city. On 15th (Ides in Roman) of March, Caesar was assassinated by Romans who wanted the republic restored. Cicero initially reconciled with them, siding with some against the others. This did not last, and inevitably his fierce rhetoric against Mark Antony made him a target again. Cicero was hunted down and executed.

Like Saddam Hussein at the gallows, Cicero went to his death with great dignity. “There is nothing proper in what you are about to do,” he told his executor, “but please try to kill me properly.” He was beheaded and his hands and head were put on display. It is said that Mark Antony’s wife pulled out Cicero’s tongue from his head and stabbed it, as vengeance against his words.

After the fading of Rome and the rise of Christianity, for more than a millennia, his works were all but forgotten. The Arab scholars who ignited the European Renaissance of the 12th century had more interest in science and philosophy than rhetoric and literature. They were reintroduced by the Italian scholar Petrarch. His discovery of Cicero’s letters is thought to be one of the catalysts for the 14th-century Italian Renaissance.

The church recognised Cicero’s qualities and deemed him to be virtuous even though a pagan, an act of great pragmatism by the Christians. This has helped preserve his works for us. We can revisit them in these times and take inspiration and comfort from the fact that those who defiantly used words against weapons, the ages have not forgotten.

436,2020/01/11,Review | The book of laughter and loneliness: Naguib Mahfouz’s ‘The Quarter’,"Writers who have spread the fragrance of joy and wisdom in this grief-ridden world of ours” — the phrase could well have been written about the late Naguib Mahfouz, but it is actually what Mahfouz said, with characteristic generosity, about other writers in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, the transcript of which is included at the back of this new book.

Mahfouz in the speech goes on to speak of the great Pharaonic civilisation, choosing not its pyramids and carvings but the story of an ancient Pharaoh who, when asked to award instant punishment to some people, asked instead for the truth to be investigated before he delivered justice. This, says Mahfouz, is a far greater sign of civilisation than conquests or statuary. At a time when a nation’s Prime Minister has said that troublemakers can be identified by their clothes, these words spoken in 1988 ring loud today.

Committed to optimism

The speech is a powerful one, demanding that intellectuals“exert themselves to cleanse humanity of moral pollution”; granting with conviction the task of torch-bearing to that much-maligned breed. Mahfouz speaks of Africa, Palestine, the “moans of

mankind” that must be heard. Yet, this collection of stories, so unexpectedly discovered among his old papers, does not hint at any despair. As the speech hints, the writer of these stories is someone clearly “committed to optimism”. And so, each story unfolds with parable-like simplicity; indeed, to say that they ‘unfold’ is to impute too great a complication. The tales merely are; they lie like little glowing embers in a warm hearth. We pick them up and blow on them and they spark to life in our heads.

In these 18 tales, Mahfouz returns to the quarter, the hara, a tiny, self-contained urban unit whose inhabitants are all familiar with each other; where there is a baker, a beggar, a merchant, the imam and the sheikh-al-hara, the quarter’s administrative head, the doctor and the police chief. There is a mosque and a fort and a cellar or qabw near it; there are ghosts and visions and mysterious voices. There are petty crimes and major tragedies; justice is sometimes served and sometimes not. The hara, in short, serves as a microcosm of the larger world around it.

Zen-like

The quarter had become the site for his fiction by the 1940s, but it was the publication of The Cairo Trilogy that catapulted Mahfouz to fame as a draughtsman of the minutiae of urban life. Then, by the 1980s, Mahfouz’s fiction, while still set in the quarter, became increasingly symbolical, allegorical and economical, often containing charged political commentary. These stories thus could date to the later stage of his writing, as translator Roger Allen concludes, each one zen-like in allusiveness and brevity.

In the two pages that the story ‘Shaikhun’ occupies, for instance, a young man leaves the quarter and returns after many years. His long absence and sudden return are enough to confer upon him a status of exaltation. He smiles mysteriously, he speaks words of wisdom, he becomes a ‘saint’. Until he is discovered and taken back by the officials of the asylum from which he has escaped. With the minimalism of a Kabir doha, Mahfouz conveys the eager gullibility of a people eternally seeking the crutches of a saviour.

Sufi thought

In ‘Bad Luck’ the unlucky Hassan has been married thrice, and each time the woman has died. Now nobody will give him a bride. Then Sunbula enters the household as servant to his mother. She is not beautiful, and he is not attracted, but she responds to Hassan and that is enough for him. Then he treats her badly and she rejects him, saying she has enough misery of her own. Hassan replies, “So have I. Each of us needs the other.” In 600-odd words, less than the length of a newspaper column, Mahfouz packs in grief and cruelty, loneliness and compromise.

Mahfouz was deeply interested in Sufi thought and it is clear that these narratives are modelled along the lines of Sufi aphorisms. The writer takes each story and hones and polishes it until it’s shorn of every excess, and gleams smooth and bare like a pebble from a riverbed. It is fascinating to see a writer refining his prose to such a fine intensity that he begins to cavil even at an excess of words, the very tools of his craft.

Each narrative acts like a koan, leaving the writer with a question or a paradox or a mystery that doesn’t yield easily to reason or logic. Instead, it demands that we turn it over in our minds, come up with our own answers, and chances are each reader might arrive at a different one. And that is as it should be.

Just like the sudden epidemic of weeping that breaks out in the quarter in ‘Your Lot in Life’ and ends, just as suddenly, with an outbreak of laughter, life is inexplicable. And wondrous. And Mahfouz seems to suggest that nothing more is asked of us really than that we live it with honesty.

437,2020/01/11,Review | The mirage of miracles: Cyrus Mistry’s ‘The Prospect of Miracles’,"A prospect, by definition, is an as yet unrealised possibility that has power to motivate human endeavour — provided it is held to with faithfulness. Absent such commitment, prospects may multiply in number, but they diminish in importance, finally yielding no more than a thicket of flirtations, all more or less mirages. Cyrus Mistry’s new novel, The Prospect of Miracles, unfortunately illustrates this, even as it offers many tantalising flourishes.

The setting is rich with possibilities. After a long, slow illness, the beloved pastor of a small evangelical community in rural Kerala has died. His widow, Mary Agnes, the Syrian Christian daughter of a landowner, is taking up her pen to tell the true story of the man she married, and the deceptions he had practised on her and on others.

But all that is potentially gripping in this narrative soon dissipates, much like the apparition of the Pastor, appearing to Mary the very morning after his death, gives way to a piece of tinsel physical theatre that even movies have outgrown (“I shot up in bed realizing I had been dreaming”).

Admittedly, clichés lie in wait for every story, but they must be overcome with an effort of vitality, and Mistry does not accomplish this. In Miracles, the hypocritical priest remains a trope, as does the gaslighted wife. This is because neither of these central storylines acquires any thematic heft from their context and surroundings. In the place of unifying themes, Mistry offers gestures towards a range of such (perfectly relevant) topics as organised religion, end-times revelations, and the lush beauty of the natural world. His writing seems satisfied at that, and the novel lurches from interesting ideas to unexpected incidents, without ever embracing the people involved.

Having said that, Miracles features the prospect of such ambition as merits attention. Just as Mary Agnes feels called by God towards a prophetic vocation, so the reader senses a power and freshness in Mistry’s voice that await proper realisation.

The writer is the author, most recently, of The Outraged: Times of Strife.

438,2020/01/11,Review | Voices from the top: ‘The Greatest Odia Stories Ever Told’,"This is an edited volume of the translation of 24 Odia short stories written over the last 121 years by 23 authors; the only writer who has two stories here is Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843-1918). It seems reasonably certain that all 23 authors belong to the three castes at the top of the Odia caste hierarchy — Brahmin, Karana (a scribal jati corresponding to the kayasths of North India) and Khandayat (a landowning warrior caste). But the translators and the editors cannot be faulted for this: this is a problem that plagues Odia literature per se. The Odia literary field has been dominated by privileged castes (especially men) for the longest time and literary modernism arguably only helped consolidate this stranglehold.

While the margin does not speak in this volume, many stories like ‘Savara’ by Chaudhury Hemakanta Misra, ‘The Tale of the Snake Charmer’ by Chandrasekhar Rath, and ‘Ghania celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi’ by Surendra Mohanty place the lives of Dalits and other downtrodden people at the centre of the narrative. At the same time time, a story like ‘A River called Democracy’ by Akhil Mohan Pattnaik portrays the Dalit protagonist in a casteist, unsympathetic and politically naive manner. If the aim of the volume were not to focus on works of celebrated writers of short fiction but to bring in the really ‘great’ short stories, then those by marginalised writers like Bijay Prasad Mohapatra, Basant Satpathy and Phaturananda would have merited inclusion.

If one leaves aside political and thematic concerns, stories like ‘News of the Day’ by Kanheilal Das draw readers with their innovative storytelling.

Despite reservations, this volume is a valuable addition to the growing corpus of Indian fiction available in English translation. Some, like ‘Mother India’ and ‘The Tale of the Snake Charmer’ invert many stereotypes and promise to become classics. Taken together, these stories also help us draw the contours of the vernacular Odia social universe. The translation is smooth, and makes for a book that deserves to be widely read and discussed.

439,2020/01/11,"Off with your heads, facts: An extract from Naomi Datta’s ‘How to be a Likeable Bigot: A Handbook for the Savvy Survivor’","I can anticipate what you are expecting here. You expect a reference to Noam Chomsky. He is the usual done to tedium suspect. Chomsky is the apostle of many a precocious journalism student and who with Edward S. Herman co-wrote the seminal Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media thirty years back. The book has had many revisions since 1988 and has sold millions of copies. What Herman and Chomsky famously said amongst many things was that the media could not afford to question power by virtue of its corporate ownership and its dependence on advertising. Therefore, the myth of a free and fair media was just that — a myth. In reality, media was a by-product of market forces and it made sense for it to play along with the powers that be. Therefore, at best, the media was a status quoist and at worst, a propagandist. And it toed the line without explicit coercion. I see you are perplexed. You have no idea who or what Chomsky is. Save yourself the trouble of doing an Internet search for him. His views are absolutely irrelevant to the scheme of this book. You have passed an important test — you are the ideal reader for this book.

We can now cheerfully proceed with the true objective of journalism, which is to make sure we stay in a bubble of self-involved knowledge. We choose to know only that much that suits us. And that is where later thinkers, say Chomsky and Herman, might have erred a bit by assuming that the reader/ news consumer doesn’t know — it is more likely he or she chooses not to know. We have already established in previous chapters that what we think is truth is often just a validation of our own belief systems. What we seek then is the post truth, which is a bit like the after-party, once verified facts have left the party. It is where the real fun begins. Post truth is defined as a situation where people accept arguments based on emotion rather than objective standards for truth. It is usually found in abundance on a very credible broadcast medium — WhatsApp. But even conventional media rightly plays to the demand to show truths that have an emotive appeal. It is what the consumer wants. And if you don’t give it to them, they will find it on tailored newsfeeds on Facebook and you will be redundant.

Now, if you are a journalist or an aspiring journalist, you will thank me for how adroitly I have eased your conscience by putting the onus for credible news on the consumer. Though, it is slightly silly to have had a conscience in the first place, but I won’t get judgemental. A rather quaint description of the media is that of it being ‘the fourth estate’ (the other three estates being the legislature, the executive and the judiciary). As a media practitioner, you were traditionally then expected to ask counter-questions on matters of polity, governance and commerce. Which is why your superfluous conscience might be a tad burdened by this lofty job description — but you really need to do no such thing. Your consumer doesn’t want you to, your media owner doesn’t want you to and your news editor definitely doesn’t want you to. In fact, most news editors, especially in television, hardly know you exist. You are just a pair of hands that can construct sentences with barely adequate grammar. If you are slightly brighter and ambitious, that could extend to writing click-bait headlines. But don’t stretch yourself beyond that. I repeat — you really don’t need to.

If you still, however, feel this romantic desire to ask counter-questions, here is how you can squash it. Stay away from multiple or conflicting facts. Accept things at face value. Let’s do this step-by-step. How will you possess yourself of multiple facts? Well, you could start with reading up — that is secondary fact aggregation. You could do that, but always be selective in the facts you pick to retrofit to your preordained narrative. Preordained by your editor who thinks he is God. And it is very likely He is. But even selective aggregation is actually a lot of work, so I suggest you go with your gut and instinct. Completely infallible and something you have full control over. Now, you could have a temporary bout of insanity and go a step further in this noble mission of fact accumulation. You could actually step out into the world and report from the ground. But never do that — especially if you eventually want to be a news editor. A news editor brings multiple opinions, not facts, together and if he or she is in television, shouts over all of them. Facts and ground reportage should ideally not enter the picture at all. They will sober things down and spoil the party. Enjoy the cacophony of democracy. Facts are like the stuffy, authoritarian librarian who wants you to read in a corner and keep silent. Strike them off your list.

So now you have only one set of facts to go with — that makes your life easier. That is the only version you will bandy on television, print or the Internet. As a journalist, it is your business to keep tabs on the popular pulse and make sure the set of facts you have picked are in sync with that. News must give the viewer or the reader an emotional high. News must entertain and engage, and if it manages to inform, then that we must treat as unfortunate collateral damage. We really don’t want to inform anyone of anything at all. We want to keep journalism as minimal mind work. But you will have to camouflage your mental inactivity with frenetic physical activity. That, unfortunately, is non-negotiable. You have to look charged up and bursting with zeal when you are anything but that.

For the purpose of conceptual clarity, I would like to give you customized slacker guides for different kinds of journalism. We will start with the most high-profile and glamorous kind — television journalism. Here is how you can be a star on television news without ever doing a single half-decent investigative report or unearthing any kind of scam.

1. Be loud, be excitable, be a superhero. Television news is not for the feeble-hearted or the feeblevoiced. Be loud. Remember, we are part of a culture where noise is synonymous with productivity. We do things loudly in this country — we work loudly, we talk loudly, we fight loudly, we grieve loudly and we celebrate louder than all of these put together. Therefore, when we see a news anchor being loud and decisive on TV, we are conditioned to believe that he or she knows what they are talking about... Practise in front of a mirror every day. Glower. Bellow. Shake your fists. Peer. Flare your nostrils. Role play. Be a superhero.

2. Your superpower is anger. You have to figure out a way of staying angry all the time. Give up on yoga, meditation and chanting classes — you don’t need inner peace. The world needs you to stay angry. You also don’t want the world to have peace — you will lose your job. Work yourself up into a vigilante anger, ask furious questions. However, note that your furious questions are never to be directed at figures of authority. Line up some inconsequential spokespeople, throw in a few out-of-work army generals from Pakistan and bellow. Be righteous and emotional in your anger — your prime-time meltdown is cathartic for your viewers...

3. Be nationalistic. An important requisite for a television news editor is patriotism. These brave souls place the country above everything — especially independent investigation and verification of news. What these gallant men actually want to do is stand at the borders and lead marauding troops into enemy territory, but unfortunately, much against their will, they instead have to lead things from the hostile terrains of cushy, air-conditioned studios. These intrepid men refuse, though, to be cowed down by their comfort. They constantly call for and threaten war. Sometimes they dress for the occasion too; only too often, you will find news anchors dressed in combat fatigues, especially when things are a bit tense with our pesky neighbours. Such heroic, swashbuckling men — let’s not tell them the only people wearing combat fatigues when not in the army are teenage girls...

4. Be a spectacle. As a culture, we like spectacles. We like things to be larger than life. We are not that interested in the story if the spectacle can hold our attention. Confuse and visually distract your viewer — twenty people speaking in twenty little windows on your TV screen. All at once. Animated thumbnails jousting for attention. Add screaming graphics and hashtags... Place your viewer on a relentless roller coaster of breathless nonsense. The credulous will lap it up, the discerning will lay it on thick with snark on Twitter. But you have had the last laugh — you have managed to keep both watching and totally distracted.

440,2020/01/11,Till hate do us part: Poetry has brought together people across the border,"Every poem is political, even the ghazal, which is supposed to be about love and relationships. As the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizenship (NRC) spread in India, more and more protesters, especially students, are using poetry to express their anger against the high-handedness of the authorities.

War cry?

Decades-old poems by Pakistani poets Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Habib Jalib, both known for their revolutionary ideas, have resurfaced. Faiz’s poem commonly known as ‘Hum Dekhenge’ (We will see) has run into controversy while Jalib’s poem, ‘Dastoor’ (Constitution), has been made famous by the JNU student and councillor of the university students’ union, Shashi Bhushan Pandey: the video where he sings it in Jalib’s style has gone viral.

Faiz’s poem was recited by the students of IIT Kanpur during a protest on December 17 to express solidarity with their peers at Jamia Millia Islamia. The poem was termed anti-Hindu and a ‘war cry’ by Muslims because of its contents and metaphors drawn from Islamic history. An inquiry committee was set up by the institute to investigate whether the poem was inflammatory.

The actual title of Faiz’s poem is not ‘Hum Dekhenge’: it is rather the Arabic, ‘Wa yubqa wajho rabboka’. Urdu scholar Ashfaq Hussain writes in a recent article that Faiz had written this poem in 1979 in celebration of the Iranian revolution during his stay in the U.S. When it was first published in his book, Meray Dil, Meray Musafir (1981), people learnt it by heart and singer Iqbal Bano made it even more famous by singing it in a live programme.

Dark dawn

Later, it became a voice against General Zia-ul-Haq. The poem was deemed so dangerous that the government removed it from the collected poems of Faiz (Nuskha Hai Wafa) published in 1984 during Zia’s regime. The missing poem could only be republished in the 2006 pocketbook edition of Faiz’s collected works 22 years later when General Pervez Musharraf was in power. It’s interesting to see how a poem banned in Pakistan is inciting similar sentiments in India.

Habib Jalib’s poem ‘Dastoor’ is also making the rounds these days. The poem starts with, Deep jiska mahallat he mein jallay/ Chand logon ki khushyon ko lay kar challay/ Aisay dastoor ko/ Subh-e-benoor ko/ Mein nahi manta, mein nahi manta (The constitution whose light only enlightens the rich/ That which gives happiness to the select few/ Such a constitution/ Such a dark dawn/ I refuse to accept). In this poem, Jalib rejects not just law but the whole constitution if it gives “happiness to the select few”. No wonder it resonated with Indians in the context of the CAA. The poem is a clear call for rebellion, which always speaks to the youth.

Jalib had written this poem to protest against the constitution of 1962 enforced by the military dictator, General Ayub Khan, to serve his own interests. It touched the right cords in people’s hearts when Jalib read it. He faced persecution and imprisonment because of his activism. Incidentally, Jalib was born and spent his youth in India: he migrated to Pakistan after Partition. It’s fitting that his poem should speak for the right to coexist in India, years after his death in 1993.

Stand united

One of Urdu poet Rahat Indori’s ghazals is also being heard everywhere, from the social media to Parliament. People have taken to two couplets of this ghazal that sound like a warning to the government: Jo aaj sahib-i-masnad hain, kal nahi hongay/ Kiraey daar hein, zaati makaan thodi hay (Those holding the reins today won’t be in the chair tomorrow/ They are just tenants, not owners) and Sabhi ka khoon hain shamil yahan ki mitti mein/ Kisi kay baap ka Hindustan thodi hai (Everybody’s blood is in this soil/ Hindustan isn’t anyone’s personal property).

Indori has not only inspired the protesters but also another young poet, Varun Grover, who has written his own Hindi poem, ‘Hum kaghaz nahi dekhaen gey’ (The NRC papers, we won’t show), which voices the sentiments of many today.

While one cannot predict what will come of the protests, one thing is certain: poetry has brought Indians together. It’s thrilling to see Indian writers, intellectuals, poets and students standing up for what they consider right. Indori has been quoted as saying, “If I don’t write on what’s happening around us, what will be the difference between me and Nero? There is a fire raging through my city, my country and if at this time I write about my mehboob’s zulf (beloved’s tresses), I must be either blind or deaf”.

Strangely, this cross-pollination of poets and poetry has also brought together the people of India and Pakistan even as their governments fight. Culture, art, language and poetry have always connected people regardless of the borders that separate them, and this connection cannot be broken by arbitrary government diktats.

441,2020/01/11,"‘What Ails the IAS and Why It Fails to Deliver’ review: Handing out Band-aid, not permanent solutions","In June 2018, retired civil servant N.C. Saxena wrote a reflection in the Economic and Political Weekly titled ‘Has the IAS Failed the Nation? An Insider View’, in which he argued that the IAS must share the blame for the country’s less than adequate performance on hunger, inequality, and social protection. In this book, he provides a more detailed argument.

“Raj Krishna once described the Fifth Five Year Plan as the fifth edition of the First Five Year Plan,” remarks Saxena in a footnote that says much about missed targets and unread reports. Unfortunately, but perhaps not surprisingly, at the turn of the century, despite a plethora of plans, schemes and reviews, India also missed critical Millennium Development Goals in hunger, health, malnutrition, sanitation and gender. What went wrong?

Saxena begins with a historical perspective. The Indian Civil Service was formed by the British in 1858. By the 1930s, a 1000-strong ICS led a colonial administration of one million in governing a population of 350 million in the British Raj.

At first, the ICS was almost entirely British; by 1947, Indians were half the service. In 1949, addressing the Constituent Assembly, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel remarked on the need for a neutral cadre of civil servants to help build the new nation.

Issues of power

Saxena argues that over the decades, with the expansion of state functions, growth of coalition politics, and blurring of the separation between executive and legislature, issues of power and patronage have inevitably taken centrestage. Today, IAS officers deal with urgent rather than important matters. They look for quick solutions or band-aids, rather than ways to strengthen systems in the long term. As for the poor, Saxena observes, “Programmes for the poor are poorly run.”

To be fair, he adds, a major reason for the malaise is unstable and all-too-brief tenure. Subjected to frequent transfers, officers find it difficult to deliver on important outcomes. Saxena points out the multiple constraints, not least the lack of adequate staff to deliver public goods and services. The total number of government staff in India is only 1.2% of the population, which is less than half the average for Asia. However, an inordinately high proportion of these are support staff (drivers, orderlies, clerks), and not enough are at the frontlines (teachers, early childhood educators, nurses).

What needs to be done

Saxena’s pessimism about the IAS is not without basis, but it is surely overstated. Despite considerable challenges, a large section of the IAS continues to be professional, transparent, accessible and open to dialogue. Many officers continue to work quietly in difficult conditions, improving things in the time they get.

What will it take to strengthen the capacity of the IAS to deliver results? Stability of tenure, says Saxena; he even recommends a ‘stability index’. Coupled with this, lateral movement into and out of the civil service, with mid-career officers doing stints in non-governmental organisations, research institutes and academic institutions to develop perspectives beyond the government system.

One gap in Saxena’s analysis is that it largely speaks of policymaking at the Centre, not the States. IAS officers spend the first half of their careers implementing programmes; the second half, in designing policy. Increasingly, States are designing policies that address their specific needs.

Finally, the theme that is absent in Saxena’s analysis is that of decentralisation. This is an area where the IAS could and should have done much more. Instead of meaningful democratic decentralisation in terms of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, there has been tokenism, in the form of deconcentration (e.g. the district collector as the representative of the State government in the district) or delegation (with the final powers still remaining with the State government). Meaningful decentralisation, with effective building of capacities in local governments and transfer of funds, functions and functionaries, would have almost certainly resulted in better implementation of basic programmes like PDS, greater transparency and accountability, and effective inclusion of the poor.

442,2020/01/11,‘Lal Bahadur Shastri: Politics and Beyond’ review: Living by the values of agreement,"It isn’t just the October 2 birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri that gets overshadowed by Gandhi Jayanti celebrations, his contribution to nation-building has not got the prominence it deserved because of the Congress party’s ‘exclusive’ focus on the Gandhi-Nehru family. “This has clearly resulted in Shastri not being accorded the stature and the position he rightly and richly deserves,” notes Sandeep Shastri, a well-known political commentator.

His book Lal Bahadur Shastri: Politics and Beyond is an attempt to correct a gap in our understanding of contemporary history. It’s not as if Shastri’s contribution has not been recorded. After all, his resignation as Railway Minister following a train accident in 1956 set a new benchmark of probity in public life, his call to soldiers and farmers with his Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan slogan to emphasise a robust defence structure and strive for self-sufficiency in food production are all part of political legend.

These examples, however, seem to stand in isolation as Shastri’s own ministerial colleague, T.T. Krishnamachari, is quoted in the book as describing his 19-month premiership from 1964-1966 “a parenthesis in history.” In a well-researched book, the author tries to counter why it’s not — evident from his description of Lal Bahadur Shastri as the ‘original architect’ of surgical strikes who asked the Armed Forces to enter Pakistani territory. As also from Shastri’s departure from Nehruvian policy of approaching the United Nations over India’s conflict with Pakistan on Kashmir or the firmness with which the Prime Minister dealt with the Chinese who had treated India as the aggressor during the 1965 Indo-Pak conflicts.

Focus on agriculture

“The Army would never forget this tallest decision by the shortest man,” the writer quotes Harbaksh Singh, the then Commander of the Western Command of the Indian Army. In an interview to Kuldip Nayar, the commander hailed the then Prime Minister’s decision to ask Indian troops to go into Pakistan.

Apart from Shastri’s politics of consensus and consultation (that prevented quick decision-making at times), the book also sheds light on the Prime Minister’s other key contribution like bringing back the focus on agriculture (as opposed to the focus on heavy industries) and how it laid the foundation for the Green Revolution subsequently and the war on corruption.

In the context of his personal integrity, it is worth mentioning that the former Prime Minister’s loan to purchase a Fiat car had to be settled by his widow, Lalita Shastri, after his death.

Some anecdotes

By his own admission, the author is an admirer of Shastri’s politics and he has filled the book with anecdotes that may appear as fiction to contemporary netas: like Shastri refusing to get out of a Kolkata traffic jam on his way to the airport, pulling up officials for issuing an out-of-turn licence to his son, Anil, and so on.

But in his own subtle way, the author points out Shastri’s vulnerabilities as a politician, especially with regard to Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira. “When files approved by him were vetted by Indira Gandhi, he preferred to remain silent. When senior officers went straight to Nehru and reversed decisions he had suggested, he preferred to keep quiet,” notes the author.

In the context of contemporary interest in Shastri’s sudden and untimely death, especially after the release of a film, the book doesn’t go beyond the different theories that are already in the public domain.

Written in an easy language, the book will serve as a primer to any student of Indian politics who is keen on examining India’s transition phase between the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.

443,2020/01/11,‘A Life in the World: U.R. Ananthamurthy in conversation with Chandan Gowda’ review: Ideas and a public intellectual,"In the introduction to a book of interviews with noted Kannada writer U.R. Ananthamurthy, the interviewer, Chandan Gowda, calls him a ‘public intellectual’. If this means a person constantly engaging with the problems of her/ his society, Ananthamurthy was indeed a public intellectual. He was also one of the few Indian writers who vaulted over the barriers of his language and was known throughout India. A Life in the World is an ambitious attempt to record the ideas of a major writer of our times for posterity. These interviews were done between 2012 and 2013, when Ananthamurthy was undergoing dialysis. But nowhere does one get any hint of a flagging spirit. In fact the interviewer is almost invisible throughout, leaving the stage entirely to the writer, who is, as always, fluent and easy with words.

Break with orthodoxy

This slim book covers an astonishing number of subjects — politics, religion, caste, tradition, globalisation, the environment, farmers and Dalit movements and so on. And, of course, language and literature, which obviously take up more space than all other subjects. His early years show the conflict which was the making of Ananthamurthy as a writer. Born in a very orthodox Brahmin family in a village, Ananthamurthy, an intelligent boy, was exposed to new influences when he went to college in Mysore where he discovered a new world. Gopal Gowda, a Lohia-socialist, inducted him into socialism; a classmate, K.V. Subbanna, (later a Magsaysay award winner) introduced him to the riches of classical Kannada literature. He made a sharp break with orthodox Brahminism by marrying a Christian girl.

It was when he was in England doing his doctorate, preparing to earn a living by teaching English, that, ironically, he decided to write in Kannada; he calls it a ‘political and a cultural choice’. Samskara, the novel which brought him fame, was written in England. His love for Kannada made his much-admired teacher, Prof. C.D. Narasimhaiah, reluctant to let him into the university post-graduate English department, when Ananthamurthy returned to Mysore. The professor was afraid he would become ‘a language chauvinist’.

Passion for Kannada

Ananthamurthy’s passion for the Kannada language and literature is at the heart of this book. He often speaks of being ‘proud’ of the language and literature; to him, Kannada is a civilised language with a continuous literary tradition.

When Ananthamurthy speaks of Kannada writers and trends in literature, he is sure-footed, knowing the terrain well. Unfortunately, the other face of this passion is his hostility towards Indians writing in English. His opinion that these writers are cut off from their own childhood, their own relations, is hard to understand. He admired British English writers and makes interesting connections between them and Kannada literature. “If I had not read Kuvempu’s novels, I would not have understood the meaning of quotidian life in Joyce’s Ulysses,” he says. His ire was reserved for Indians writing in English. It drives him into making statements like “writers must write in Kannada and readers should accept them.”

Surely a writer knows that there can be no ‘musts’ and ‘shoulds’ in any art! One wishes Chandan Gowda had probed a little more into these views. Perhaps he did not raise any contentious issues because of Ananthamurthy’s fragile health, or because of his reverence for the man.

Haunting the backyard

One very interesting comment Ananthamurthy makes is that he became a novelist because he haunted the backyard. The backyard, according to him, was the place where women met and gossiped, the front yard being a male domain. Surprising, then, that women’s issues have been completely bypassed. Without understanding the position of women, how does one understand the world we live in? The Hindutva movement being dismissed with a “it will be forgotten” is equally unexpected. More so, because Ananthamurthy had been badly trolled for his remarks against the extreme right.

Whatever the shortcomings, this is an important book. The writer’s voice is scarcely heard in India today, drowned as it is by voices of celebrities, politicians, etc. In this book we hear the concerns and opinions of a major writer of our times. Ananthamurthy was fortunate in getting fame and acclaim in his lifetime. Fortunate, too, in having a remarkable circle of friends, which enabled him to live a rich intellectual life. In the end, however, everything falls away and he says a simple and poignant remark that he would like to be remembered as a teacher and a writer who made a contribution to Kannada. There can be no better epitaph for a writer.

444,2020/01/11,"‘Sheru, A Story of a Loving Dog’ review: The healing touch of Sheru","For anyone who has ever had a pet in their life, the story of Sheru, his wags, whines and ‘woen’ will not just resonate, but move you to tears even, at some point.

The journey of this frisky, doe-eyed pup is captured through the adoring gaze of his family, narrated by Sudhansu Mohanty and co-author Sheru, a detail the author makes a point to mention. And this brings in a dual narration of events into Sheru, A Story of a Loving Dog, as seen through human eyes and through that of the canine protagonist, respectively.

Charm offensive

So the early part involves Shukla, Mohanty’s animal-loving wife who feeds Sheru fresh rotis and choice pieces of non-vegetarian food. Quite naturally, the daughter and son also take to Sheru who refers to them as his ‘bhai and didi’ (brother and sister). And it’s not long before Mohanty, who has not been oblivious to the pup, also falls for Sheru’s charms.

The simple almost self-indulgent narrative captures Sheru’s playfulness and readers could find themselves smiling as they link to memories of their own. But it’s in instances like the narration of being treated with a ‘doggy’s glove’ that Mohanty captures the intelligence and sensitivity of Sheru.

Mohanty narrates how a couple of surgeries had kept him away from home and that Sheru obviously missed him. But as one would with a family member, Mohanty speaks to Sheru over a speakerphone, a gesture that will strike a chord with many pet-parents. On returning home, Mohanty recounts, Sheru though ecstatic was wise to not jump on his ‘dad’, given his fragile state of health.

Labour of love

Recalling Sheru’s almost healing presence, he says, it helped him take on any adversity that came his way. “That is what a dog can do for you. And unlike men, they never take credit for it,” says Mohanty.

A former bureaucrat, Mohanty has written several books. But this one clearly is an emotional outpouring where the narrative takes us across cities, through fun and spooky turns, finally settling with thoughts that go beyond pets and their families to relationships and how people in general view animals.

There may be times in the early narrative where the treatment is light and the story-telling could have benefitted from a tighter edit. But there are moments of intensity too that could leave you misty-eyed.

A labour of love for a pet family-member, the book raises the insensitive view some people have of animals as no more than an acquisition, like a piece of architecture that can be replaced. Mohanty takes it further with his observation that animals have feelings and tears as sentient beings.

“We place too much importance on our intelligence and emotion, and too little on other animates’ intelligence, feelings and emotions. For all our claims on animal research, we refuse to admit that animals’ tears are connected to their emotion and pain,” he writes. Thoughts that reflect an understanding of animals that is gaining acceptance across the world. And a sensitivity that people not involved with animals too could do well to dwell on.

445,2020/01/11,NCBS Archives tells stories of how science blossomed here,"December 4, 1987. In just about legible cursive handwriting, Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick writes a letter to Obaid Siddiqi, professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, apologising for failing to come and meet him in Mumbai. Now the letter lies carefully placed in a paper file, inside a small cardboard box, in a steel locker at the Archives of the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru.

A glass case with colourful conch shells sits in the reading room of the Archives. Another fragment of the same story is a map of Tamil Nadu with handwritten phone numbers, names, dates and places to visit. These are part of the collections of the late scientist K.S. Krishnan, who studied conotoxins, venoms and published papers on the therapeutic value of certain peptide toxins from Indian cone snails.

Over 50,000 such objects at the NCBS Archives — letters, photographs, old instruments, notebooks — tell stories of people at this institution and how science blossomed here.

The basement that houses the Archives was once the laboratory of geneticist, neurobiologist and founder of NCBS, the late Prof. Siddiqi, whose birth anniversary was on January 7. The oldest document in the Archives is his school leaving certificate from 1946.

The Archives also houses an exhibition room curated by Meera Baindur, philosophy faculty and coordinator at Bengaluru Central University, and Srajana Kaikini, an independent writer, and architect Naveen Mahantesh.

Backstage biology

A black wall is the first thing that catches my eye. And it bears the definition of a wall: “An architectural element intending to segregate, separate and fortify a space by forming a boundary.” The wall is filled with hashtags: #peopleofbiology, #geekspeak, #labfly. “Stories are made and remade and they depend on an individual perspective... The whole idea was challenging as the space we used went from a lab to an empty room to a gallery,” says Kaikini.

“We wanted it to be more than an exhibition to the public by giving it more layers of meaning by adding a critical commentary. I would call it a curatorial complex and not an exhibition if I were to stay true to the story. Exhibitions usually end up being very straightforward with accompanying captions. We wanted to make the observer take part and be able to tell the story in their own way too,” she says .

The exhibition includes everyday objects used in a lab, the backstage of biology — microscopic slides, Petri dishes, mugs, cameras, and broken eyepieces from microscopes. The centre of the room has a light box, and the wall next to it bears projections of old photographs.

Put together by over 45 people, each object in the Archives helps reknit a historical narrative of the discipline of biology in India in a coherent fashion seldom seen in the field of science in India.

By making itself accessible to the public — people can walk in to read or work or nap — the Archive helps shape not just curricula in schools and colleges but creates an understanding of science history among lay people. “As we build the physical and digital archive at NCBS, we hope it situates itself at the intersection of four silos in society: the scientific community that generates archival material, the historians of science that interpret this archival material, the communicators and interrogators of science for a non-academic audience, and the public itself,” writes Venkat Srinivasan, archivist, in the vision statement.

Hidden emotion

“Everything here is donated, including the furniture. You can be an engineer or scientist and can donate all your scientific papers or lab materials. If you have material from a field biologist or scientist that you think tells a science story, you can donate it too,” says Srinivasan.

Neha Panwar, one of the staff at the Archives, sits in the middle of a pile of old books, papers and bills, and is immersed in sorting them out, deciding what makes it and what doesn’t. Hidden amid the reams of faded, handwritten letters and ancient notebooks are stories of science waiting to be told and heard. Panwar picks up a paper and reads aloud: “Smelling is injurious to health. I wish I couldn’t smell,” it says. She tells me it has no name or date, making it impossible to know who wrote it or why. “Prof. Siddiqi’s lab was working on the olfactory system. I wonder what deep emotion these words hide,” she says with a smile.",sci-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/8fec96/article30534490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12SMNCBS8,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/ncbs-archives-tell-stories-of-how-science-blossomed-here/article30534492.ece
446,2020/01/11,Burnt out and nowhere to go,"Sriram Bhupathiraju quit his well-paying corporate job in 2012, after having worked as a business analyst for 11 years, first in the United States and then in India. He would clock in around 18 hours for 15 to 20 days without an off, working according to time zones of global clients. His health suffered, he was disillusioned and began questioning the purpose of his work.

In the last eight years, his health has improved and he talks as though the weight is off his shoulders. Sriram runs half marathons, has backpacked to 11 countries, has visited every UNESCO World Heritage Site in India and now learns Kuchipudi from Bala Tripura Sundari.

He recently started working as a researcher with the Centre for Research in Infrastructure Development and Policy.

After quitting his IT job, he pursued masters in anthropology from the University of Hyderabad and an M.Phil from the IIT-Hyderabad. For his M Phil research topic, he didn’t have to look far. “What better than to look into your own backyard?” he says, referring to his research on ‘Burnout: An ethnographic study of occupational stress among mid career IT professionals in Hyderabad’.

Though we do come across engineers who quit their jobs for creative pursuits — writing, music, filmmaking, art, theatre… — Sriram says it’s only a small percentage that veers away. His research is about the majority that faces burnout and sees no escape route.

Personal stories

For his ethnographic study he spoke to mid-level IT professionals who’ve worked for more than five years. He conducted 34 interviews in all. The sample size might be small, but academic research of an ethnographic kind, he explains, is not about giving out a questionnaire. “I didn’t impose my ideas on them. I outlined the objective of my research and listened to their stories, in detail. Then I analysed the data,” he says.

A joke among Telugus goes that one studies engineering and then thinks of what to do with life. Those who grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s can recall the craze to study engineering and land a job in the United States. Never mind if the students didn’t have their hearts set on engineering. It was seen as a passport to a socio-economic transition. Sriram says things haven’t improved.

He also spoke to students at a leading engineering institute and observed that many of them had taken up engineering because they saw it as a “natural choice” or because “everyone else is doing it”. Sriram calls them reluctant engineers.

Always logged in

As for mid-level IT professionals, his research looks into several aspects of their life. Flexible timings, initially considered a boon to break away from the old school 9am to 5pm/10am to 6pm work schedule, morphed into a trap and employees worked overtime, to cater to clients in different time zones. The digital scenario made it impossible to switch off work after a time. Sriram terms this as ‘collapse of time and space’.

As the ‘working from home’ concept grew, employees were expected to log in from anywhere. “So work engages an employee 24/7. We straddle three clocks — the [body’s] circadian rhythm, the local time and global time zones,” he says.

To make things worse, Sriram points out that the IT sector doesn’t look at itself as labour to address these issues. He mentions how corporate and labour lawyers scoff at the idea of addressing IT employee issues as labour issues since there’s lucrative pay.

Socio economic reasons

This pay package prevents employees from breaking free. “You transcend a social class when you land a job,” says Sriram. Socio-economic factors follow. The place of residence, type of residence (gated community? villa?), type of car, the school your child goes to (is it an international school?) are just a few factors that add to the stress.

Sriram’s research doesn’t outline the solution: “My research puts things out. There is no one single solution to the problems; if I had to look at them, it would involve a Ph.D,” he laughs.

He has approached Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary IT, Telangana, with his research and requested if Nasscom and HYSEA (Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association) can look into it. “Burnout has received scant attention. My research aims to address this gap,” he sums up.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/uq5xrq/article30543365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sriram-Bhupathiraju,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/sriram-bhupathiraju-analyses-burnout-among-mid-career-it-professionals-in-hyderabad-to-find-out-why-they-hang-on-to-punishing-schedules/article30543366.ece
447,2020/01/11,"Investigation into papers with problematic images complete, report submitted: CSIR director-general","An independent committee that was formed in early June 2019 to investigate the issue of image duplication and/or manipulation in papers published by researchers from the Lucknow-based Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR) has submitted the report to Dr. Shekhar C. Mande, Director-General of CSIR. The committee was formed in response to an article written in The Hindu about 130 scientific papers that had problems with images.

According to Dr. Mande, the scope of the committee was expanded to cover four-five CSIR labs that had similar problems with images in published papers.

“It was a massive exercise as the committee looked into each case of alleged image duplication and/or manipulation in published papers. Every paper of the scientists mentioned on PubPeer website was looked into,” says Dr. Mande.

The committee had given all the scientists an opportunity to defend their case and to tell the committee what action — issuing a correction or retraction — they had taken. The report has classified the problematic papers into specific categories based on the nature and degree of image alteration or duplication.

The committee had been specifically instructed to be objective, fair, and fiercely impartial in their investigations. “Though it was a massive exercise, the committee has done a fantastic job,” says Dr. Mande.

“The committee has submitted the report to me. I will be sending the report to the respective directors in a week’s time for them to take necessary action,” says Dr. Mande. “The directors of each CSIR lab will follow the CSIR administrative procedures and give the scientists an opportunity to defend their case. The directors will take action where necessary.”

In the case of CSIR-IITR, former director of the institution Dr. Kailash Gupta and the current director Dr. Alok Dhawan have papers with problematic images. “In the case of CSIR-IITR, I will look into the case myself,” says Dr. Mande.

In June last year immediately after the committee was formed, Dr. Mande told The Hindu: “CSIR has a zero tolerance policy on the issue of scientific integrity. In the past, such matters have been dealt with very firmly. If anyone is found to be guilty of manipulations thereby leading to deliberate scientific fraud, the person will face suitable disciplinary action.”

According to Dr. Mande, CSIR guidelines on research ethics have been framed with inputs from several experts. The guidelines will be applicable to every CSIR scientist and even to those who carry out research based on any grant from CSIR. “The guidelines were placed before the CSIR governing body. It has approved the guidelines. It will next be placed before the CSIR Society. The approval is expected within a month. The guidelines will be sent to all CSIR labs,” he says.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/kiq547/article30544414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHEKHARCMANDE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/investigation-into-papers-with-problematic-images-complete-report-submitted-csir-director-general/article30544415.ece
448,2020/01/11,New method better estimates melting of debris-covered Himalayan glaciers,"A study of the Satopanth glacier in order to model the melting of debris-covered glaciers has been carried out by a group of Indian researchers. Their new method gives a better estimate of the glacier’s melting than existing ones. Studying debris-laden Himalayan glaciers is important from the point of view of how climate change affects them. About 20% of Himalayan glaciers are debris-laden, and their dynamics are very different from the ones without debris cover. The study was published in Journal of Glaciology.

Effect of debris

In glaciers without a debris cover, the rate of melting increases as the elevation decreases. However, in glaciers covered with debris, the thick cover partially insulates the glacier from the warm exterior and thereby slows down the melting. The thickness of the debris cover, by and large, increases as the glacier flows down. This works against the general trend that the lower the elevation, the higher the rate of melting. Matters are further complicated because the thickness of the debris cover is not uniform but fluctuates randomly.

This line of research was initiated by H.C. Nainwal of the Geology Department, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, in 2004. Initially it constituted studies of paleoglaciation and monitoring the fronts of Satopanth and Bhagirath Kharak glaciers. “Full scale glaciological observations began in 2013,” says R Shankar of The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, and an author of the paper.

Prof. Shankar and Argha Banerjee, now with IISER Pune, are interested in developing a model to describe the dynamics of debris-laden glaciers like the Satopanth. The collaboration happened almost by chance: “I was planning a motorcycling trip in Garhwal, including a visit to Gangotri in 2007. I came across a paper by [Harish Chandra] Nainwal in Current Science on the geomorphology of Gangotri valley and took a copy along to see what it was like on the field,” says Prof. Shankar. This brought them, and Dr Banerjee, together to discuss Satopanth. Along the way, they realised that it was an important problem to model the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers.

Studying Satopanth

Satopanth glacier is located in Garhwal in Central Himalaya, in Uttarakhand. It is the origin of the river Alaknanda, one of the two main tributaries of the Ganga. The other tributary is Bhagirathi, which originates from the Gangotri glacier. These two rivers join at Devprayag, around 70 km upstream of Rishikesh. Downstream of Devprayag, the river is called Ganga.

To study the melting, the team planted nearly 60 bamboo stakes in the Satopanth glacier, most of which were placed in ten transverse lines below 4,600 metres elevation. The initial depth of the bamboo stakes was noted down, and periodic measurements were made over the course of three years to assess how much ice had melted. Nearly 1,000 measurements were made, mainly by Sunil Singh Shah, the first author of the paper.

Better estimate

They computed the sub-debris melting of the glacier by interpolating the collected data as a function of thickness of the debris and averaging over debris thickness distribution over different parts of the glacier. This is to be contrasted with the conventional method where the collected data is interpolated as a function of elevation. The new method introduced by the group worked better at estimating the dynamics of the glacier than the conventional method.

They also repeated the estimation after leaving out several of the data points and restricting the data to about 25 stakes. They could still get better results than the conventional method. “This established a clear advantage of the new method. The estimates were seen to be more robust when a reduction in the number of stakes was applied,” says Prof. Shankar. Using a more detailed measurement of the debris thickness variation would make the estimate more accurate, the authors write in the paper.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/h6pw92/article30544380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-SCISTAKEJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-method-better-estimates-melting-of-debris-covered-himalayan-glaciers/article30544381.ece
449,2020/01/11,IIT-M designs room temperature sodium sulphur battery,"While conventional sodium sulphur batteries require very high temperature (300 degree C) for operation, researchers at the Indian Institute of technology (IIT) Madras have designed a new sodium sulphur battery that can be operated at room temperature. By operating the battery at room temperature, the team was able to achieve higher charge storage capacity (technically called the specific capacity) and nearly zero self-discharge when the battery is not being used.

Storage and retention

While high temperature sodium sulphur batteries have charge storage capacity of about 558 mAh per gram, the battery designed by the IIT Madras team was able to achieve as much as 1,034 mAh per gram at a current density of 50 mA per gram.

The battery also showed 83% retention of capacity even at the end of 500 cycles of charging and discharging. To assess the capacity retention, the researchers used higher current density of 500 mA per gram. “The charge storage capacity was 650 mAh per gram to start with and after 100 cycles it reduced to 570 mAh per gram, at the end of 500 cycles, the charge storage capacity was 499 mAh per gram,” says Ajay Piriya from IIT Madras and first author of a paper published in the journal Advanced Materials Interfaces.

The first step that the team led by Ramaprabhu Sundara from the Department of Physics at IIT Madras took to operate the battery at room temperature was by changing the electrolyte used.

Novel electrolyte

Conventionally, sodium sulphur batteries use a solid electrolyte (sodium beta alumina), which by default reduces the diffusion of sodium ions from the anode to the cathode at room temperature. It is to increase the diffusion of sodium ions that the temperature is raised to about 300 degree C.

So in place of a solid electrolyte the researchers used a glass fibre separator soaked in ether-based electrolyte that allows the battery to be operated at room temperature.

“Changing the electrolyte alone is not sufficient to improve battery performance as there are other problems with sodium sulphur batteries,” says Prof. Sundara. Sodium is supposed to react with sulphur and produce stable sodium sulphide through intermediate steps. Each of the intermediate step produces different sodium polysuphides. “The intermediate sodium polysuphides are unstable and get dissolved into the electrolyte. The dissolved polysuphides cause twin problems that reduce the capacity and durability of the battery,” he explains.

The first problem is that with increasing amount of polysuphides getting dissolved into the electrolyte, there is a net loss in the cathode sulphur. In addition, the dissolved polysuphides move towards the anode and form a coating over it. This reduces the performance of the battery.

Shielding layer

To address the twin problem, the team added a shielding layer very close to the cathode. The shielding layer is made of white graphite mixed in a polymer matrix.

“The polymer allows the sodium ions to pass through while the white graphite added to the polymer matrix prevents the migration of polysuphides to the anode,” says Kamaraj Muthusamy from the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at IIT Madras and a co-author of the paper. The boron and nitrogen present in the layered structure of the white graphite act as binding sites for the polysuphides. The polysuphides that are chemically bound by the polymer composite react with sodium and produce sodium sulphide.

“Nearly all of the sulphur gets converted into sodium suphide when we used the shielding layer between the cathode and the separator,” Ms. Piriya says. “Since the migration of the polysuphides to the sodium anode is prevented by the shielding layer, self-discharge of the battery is significantly reduced.”

The battery was tested for self-discharge by measuring the open circuit potential of a fully charged battery for 16 continuous days. They found the potential remaining constant at 2.35 volt when the shielding layer was used; the voltage dropped without the shielding layer.

While conductive carbons are added to the sulphur to make it electrically conductive in conventional sulphur batteries, the researchers used partially exfoliated multiwalled carbon nanotubes.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mxzi28/article30544365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-SCIPRASjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-m-designs-room-temperature-sodium-sulphur-battery/article30544366.ece
450,2020/01/11,Species-rich forests offer stable carbon capture,"Spending over six months conducting surveys inside Anamalai Tiger Reserve and using satellite data from multiple locations in the Western Ghats, an international team of researchers has shown that carbon storage was highest in species-rich evergreen forest. The paper published in Environmental Research Letters adds that the rate of carbon capture was more stable across years in forests than in plantations, and carbon capture by forests was more resilient to drought.

Varied terrain

The study was done in natural evergreen and deciduous forests, and in teak and eucalyptus plantations. The studied eucalyptus plantations had comparatively lower carbon storage, while teak plantations stored nearly as much carbon as deciduous forests.

The team identified the trees, measured their girth and height in 250 square plots inside the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, and used the measurements to estimate carbon storage in different forests and plantation types. They then used satellite data from Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhadra Tiger Reserve, along with Anamalai to assess the rate of carbon capture and how they varied across years (2000-2018). All the study areas used to be exploited for timber and for raising plantations of commercially important trees in the past, but are now strictly protected as wildlife reserves. Annual rainfall and stressors like drought were all taken into consideration for the study.

The results showed that the species-rich evergreen forests stored carbon at approximately 300 tons per hectare. The storage in teak and eucalyptus plantations was 43% and 55% less, respectively. The researchers also found that the rates of carbon capture remained nearly the same year after year in natural forests compared with plantations.

“This study can help transform reforestation policies. Currently, according to government data, over half of compensatory afforestation plantations use five species or less, which is way lower than in natural forests and totally inadequate. We know that this is not good for biodiversity, and now this study has shown that it is not great for the stability of carbon capture too,” explains one of the authors, T.R. Shankar Raman from the Nature Conservation Foundation in Mysuru.

He adds that we also need to think about where the afforestation measures are being carried out. Grasslands help in carbon capture themselves and planting trees there can cause more harm than good.

Long-term effects

The first author of the paper Dr. Anand Osuri says: “Our findings suggest that protecting and regenerating natural forests comprising a diverse mix of native tree species is more reliable in the long term than raising monoculture or species-poor plantations as a strategy for mitigating climate change.” He was a postdoctoral scientist at Columbia University during the study and is presently a scientist with Nature Conservation Foundation.

Ruth DeFries, one of the authors from Columbia University, US adds: “Species-rich forests are beneficial for biodiversity as they also provide habitat to many other components — insects, birds, etc. Previous studies have shown that species-rich forests are also resistant to diseases.”

Keeping the Australian fires in mind, when asked if species-rich forests have better resistance to fire, she said that different trees have varying degrees of fire resistance depending on the thickness of the bark. Also, the ability to regenerate the seeds differ across species and so a multi-species forest would likely show greater resilience in case of a fire.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fbyvlr/article30544308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-SCIAGUMBE-Trop-Rainforestjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/species-rich-forests-offer-stable-carbon-capture/article30544309.ece
451,2020/01/11,India should lead in the fight against multidrug-resistant pathogens,"A recent headline in The New York Times (December 28) was titled: “Lifelines at risk as bankruptcies stall antibiotics – a health crisis looms: scant profits in fighting drug-resistant bugs sours investors.” This refers to the growing menace of disease-causing germs such as bacteria and fungi, for example, pseudomonas, E.coli, klebsiella, salmonella and TB, which no longer respond to the conventionally used antibiotic drugs. These emerging Multi-Drug- Resistant ( MDR) germs sicken almost 3 million people across the world every year, and the UNO states that if we do not find drugs to fight and kill these MDR-germs quickly enough, the global death toll could soar to 10 million people by 2050.

How did these MDR-bugs come about? Since penicillin and similar antibiotics (erythromycin, floxins) were introduced about 60-70 years ago, we have been using them with success, because each such conventional drug effectively kills millions of germs. Yet a tiny population of them had survived, thanks to some escape routes such as slight change in their genes, leading to pathways that stop the drug from entering their cells or pathways that pump out the entered drug molecules. Such escapees started growing and multiplying into millions over months and years, and became resistant to all the common antibiotics- these are the MDR-germs.

What is needed in this scenario is for scientists and drug firms to do basic, fundamental research into the biology of MDR germs and develop effective drugs to fight and win over them. This often takes a decade or more to bring out the product and make them available in the market. Indeed, it was precisely such an R&D effort that has brought about the discovery and marketing of many drugs against chronic diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, blood disorders and cancer. And the amount of investment for R &D in each one of them has been billions of dollars, and the company expects to gain billions of dollars each year. It is here that the problem lies in the case of investing in drugs against MDR bugs. As Andrew Jacob points out in the above article, major drug firms have shied away from work on MDR-germs, since unlike chronic diseases which are prescribed for long terms (months and years), antibiotic drugs are prescribed for days and at best for weeks, and so no long term profit is made!

Public spirited players

To do research and development and come out with drugs against MDR-germs, too, is no different, and this also requires long-term effort and involves billions of dollars input. And it is here that some private firms have pitched in. Happily enough, they have been getting R&D funds as grants from private foundations and governmental sources. The article describes how the biotech company Achaogen succeeded in obtaining a billion-dollar grant from the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), spent 15 years of research and development work and came out with the drug called Zemdri, effective against hard-to-treat urinary tract infections. Zemdri was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the WHO. Sadly, Achaogen could not make any sustained profit, the investors were unhappy and the firm went bankrupt. Similarly, the firm called Tetraphase, which obtained a major grant from a nonprofit group and produced the drug Xerava, which is effective against some MDR-bugs, had to cut down its staff and its plans to conduct further R & D efforts since its stock price was plummeting. And so was a third firm, Melinta Therapeutics, which has successfully produced Baxdela, an FDA-approved drug for drug-resistant pneumonia.

It is of interest to note that the firm Achaogen was bought over by CIPLA-USA, which is the US arm of the Indian public-spirited drug company CIPLA. This involved buying all the equipment and the rights to acquire the technology and to make and sell the drug Zemdri across the world.

CIPLA’s move in this area holds out an example for other Indians and firms to enter the field. They may likewise interact with other such firms in the US, acquiring them, or as partners or owners (even set up labs in India), gain the hard-earned technology of making drugs active against MRD-germs, and make these available for use by the needy not only in India but across the world. Note that a recent paper on the mortality burden of MDR-pathogens in India (S. Gandra et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases 2019; 69(4):563-70) which studied 10 hospitals across the country for MDR pathogens and the patient mortality outcomes shows that 13% is the overall rate of death. If this be for hospital-based deaths, we can imagine the millions affected and dying across the towns and villages of India. And surely such a situation would be true in parts of Africa, southeast Asia and other low-income, high-population countries. R&D efforts by Indian scientists will thus be of public health and economic value.

Fortunately, Indian government and its funding agencies are keen in offering grants in this Focal Theme area to researchers in government-operated R&D institutions and universities, as well as to private non-governmental research institutions, and drug companies. Private non-profit foundations in India should also open up their purses (not just the Wellcome Trust of the UK or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of the US).

Many of us in our own country do not realise that India has become the major vaccine provider for children across the world. Just a handful of vaccine-makers across India now provide about 35% of childhood vaccines globally, through their R&D efforts. There is thus no reason why India cannot be a major player in offering good health to the 7 billion people across the world through our efforts in the area of fighting infection by traditional, MDR-type and other emerging disease-causing germs.

452,2020/01/11,"Indian-American among NASA’s new astronauts; all set to conquer Moon, Mars","Raja Jon Vurputoor Chari, an Indian-American US Air Force colonel, is among 11 new NASA graduates who have successfully completed their over two years’ of basic astronaut training and are all set to be a part of the space agency’s ambitious future missions to the International Space Station, Moon and Mars.

The successful astronauts were selected among 18,000 applicants in 2017 after NASA announced its Artemis programme.

Mr. Chari, 41, was selected by NASA to join the 2017 Astronaut Candidate Class. He reported for duty in August 2017 and having completed the initial astronaut candidate training is now eligible for a mission assignment.

At a ceremony here on Friday, each new astronaut received a silver pin, a tradition dating back to the Mercury 7 astronauts, who were selected in 1959.

“2020 will mark the return of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, and will be an important year of progress for our Artemis program and missions to the Moon and beyond,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“These individuals represent the best of America, and what an incredible time for them to join our astronaut corps,” he said.

The astronauts will receive a gold pin once they complete their first spaceflights.

Astronaut candidate training for the new graduates included instruction, practice, and testing in spacewalking, robotics, International Space Station systems, T-38 jet proficiency, and Russian language.

As astronauts, they will help develop spacecraft, support the teams currently in space and ultimately join the ranks of only about 500 people who have been into space.

Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas were among the speakers at the first-ever public graduation ceremony NASA has held for its astronauts.

“For generations, the United States has been the world leader in space exploration, and Johnson Space Center will always be both the heart and home of human spaceflight activity. I have no doubt the newly minted astronauts will add to that history and accomplish incredible things,” said Mr. Cornyn.

“I congratulate these exceptional men and women on being the first graduating class of the Artemis program. They are the pioneers of the final frontier whose work will help fortify America’s leadership in space for generations to come. I am excited for the opportunities ahead of them, including landing the first woman ever on the surface of the Moon, and having the first boots to step on Mars,” Mr. Cruz said.

The new graduates may be assigned to missions destined for the International Space Station, the Moon, and ultimately to Mars.

With a goal of sustainable lunar exploration later this decade, NASA will send the first woman and next man to the surface on the Moon by 2024.

Additional lunar missions are planned once a year thereafter and human exploration of Mars is targeted for the mid-2030s.

NASA continues its work aboard the space station, which, in November, will celebrate 20 consecutive years of human occupation.

The agency also is on the verge of launching astronauts again from American soil aboard American commercial spacecraft, and is preparing to send humans to the Moon as part of the Artemis program.

Mr. Chari, a US Air Force colonel from Cedar Falls Iowa, graduated from the US Air Force Academy with bachelor’s degrees in astronautical engineering and engineering science.

He earned a master’s degree in aeronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated from the US Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland.

Mr. Chari served as the commander of the 461st Flight Test Squadron and the director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

Inspired by his father Srinivas Chari, who came to US at a young age from Hyderabad, for engineering degree, with the goal of getting higher education and making a successful career. He met his wife and spent entire career at John Deere in Waterloo.

“My father came to the country with the goal of getting an education and realising the importance of that and that directly translated to how I was brought up,” Mr. Chari told PTI in a recent interview.

“There was a focus throughout my childhood on education and that being the thing, you really needed to do well to succeed,” he said.

Mr. Chari’s wife, Holly, is a Cedar Falls native and they have three children.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lhzshe/article30542891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPACE-ASTRONAUTSPENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/indian-american-among-nasas-new-astronauts-all-set-to-conquer-moon-mars/article30542892.ece
