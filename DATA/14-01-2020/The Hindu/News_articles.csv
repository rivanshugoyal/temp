3,2020/01/14,"World Archery appoints observer for AAI polls, suspension set to be lifted conditionally","The World Archery has set the ball rolling for a conditional lifting of the suspension of the Indian federation by appointing its observer for the much-anticipated elections in New Delhi on Saturday.

Following a discussion with the Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra, the WA decided to send its vice-president (Asia region), Kazi Rajib Uddin Ahmed Chapol as an observer, on whose report a call on lifting of the suspension would be taken.

“Following his report, the WA executive committee will consider the next steps which if things go well could include a conditional lifting of the suspension,” WA secretary general Tom Dielen wrote in a letter to the chairperson of the Transitory Committee Justice (Retd.) Badar Durrez Ahmed.

Terming the elections a start of a new era in Indian archery, Mr. Dielen said: “We are pleased to see this progress and hope that this is really the start of a new era for Indian Archery.

“We see this election as the essential first part of the roadmap to resolve matters in India to go forward and the suspension to be lifted,” said in the letter which was accessed by PTI.

Mr. Chapol, from Bangladesh, had earlier acted as a “mediator” to bring the two factions of Archery Association of India together but both groups went ahead with separate elections simultaneously in New Delhi and Chandigarh on June 9 last year to elect two presidents — Union Minister Arjun Munda and retired IAS officer BVP Rao.

That led to the suspension of the AAI.

The suspension meant that the Indian archers failed to compete at the South Asian Games in Nepal in December last year and were allowed at the Asian Championships in Bangkok as ‘neutral athletes’ only because the event was a continental Olympic qualifier.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/z4181b/article30564948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARCHERY1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/world-archery-appoints-observer-for-aai-polls-suspension-set-to-be-lifted-conditionally/article30564949.ece

8,2020/01/14,Australian Open practice suspended due to poor air quality,"Australian Open practice was temporarily suspended on Tuesday due to poor air quality as bushfires continued to rage across the country.

Tournament organisers said practice at Melbourne Park had been suspended briefly but qualifying matches were scheduled to go ahead at 11:00 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).

“Conditions onsite are improving and are being constantly monitored,” a Tennis Australia spokeswoman said.

“Further decisions will be made using onsite data and in close consultation with our medical team, the Bureau of Meteorology and scientists from EPA Victoria.”

Twenty-eight people have been killed and thousands made homeless in recent months as huge fires across the country have scorched through 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), nearly half the area of the United Kingdom.

The bushfires have affected a number of elite sporting competitions involving soccer, rugby league and cricket, and poor air conditions have raised fears for players' health at tennis's first Grand Slam.

Australian Open men's champion Novak Djokovic expressed concern earlier this month that bushfire smoke might cause some health problems for players.

Tournament organisers said last week that play would be confined to Melbourne Park's three roofed stadiums and eight indoor courts in the “unlikely case of extreme smoke conditions”.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/q2i4sa/article30565159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14REUAUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-practice-suspended-due-to-poor-air-quality/article30565160.ece
9,2020/01/14,ASUS ROG Phone II review: this beast of a gaming phone will remain popular in 2020,"The first glance at the ASUS ROG Phone II had me worrying it would slip right out of my hands during a really crucial part of a gaming session. It is a robust smartphone, slightly heavier than the ROG Phone, with shallow ridges slashed across the rear for that Quicksilver-esque look, accompanied by the flashing ROG logo. The near-black glossy back was initially worrisome in the case of fingerprints but ASUS has made it so that there are no such marks to mar the appearance. The sturdiness of the phone is remarkable too. Should you not go for a case, do not fret about scratches.

The minimalist in me would have grimaced at the physical design of the device, but the performance pretty much cancels it out.

Specifications Dimensions & weight : 6.73 inches x 3.06 inches x 0.37 inches ; 240 grams

Display : 6.59-inch ; 2340x1080 pixels ; 120Hz/1ms AMOLED 10-bit HDR display ; 600nits outdoor readable brightness ; 500,000:1 contrast ratio AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla 6 Glass

CPU & GPU : 2.96GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus Mobile Platform with 7nm, 64-bit Octa-core Processor ; Qualcomm Adren 640

Main rear camera: Sony flagship IMX586 48MP image sensor - 1/2.0” large sensor size, 0.8 µm pixel size , Quad Bayer technology - 12MP, 1.6 µm large effective pixel size

Second rear camera : 13MP, 125° ultrawide camera

Front camera : 24MP with Quad Bayer technology

Sensors : In-display fingerprint, Face recognition, Accelerator, E-Compass, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Hall sensor, Ambient light sensor, Ultrasonic sensors for AirTrigger II and grip press, Dual vibrators.

Battery : 6000mAh high capacity battery, supports Quick Charge 4.0 and PD 3.0 Charging

Operating system : Android Pie with new ROG UI

Whether you are out in the sun or in a darkened room, the display of the ROG Phone II sure is dazzling. The lines are crisper and the contrast is not overwhelming. One of my pet peeves with many recent smartphones is the annoying adjustment from ambient lighting. The sensors on this device, though, make the shift barely noticeable which does not hamper whatever you are doing.

With all the competitive cameras out there, the ones on the ROG Phone II offer nothing new. Some would argue the camera is not a big deal but given smartphones are considered to be the new all-in-one packages offering perfection, this was not exactly forgiveable for me.

All-out performance

The ROG Phone II is silly fast. While playing Asphalt 9: Legends (a racing game exclusive to the device), I barely experienced lags during gameplay which I have too many times with the older phones. Then I wondered about device bias with the game, then I switched to feature-rich Injustice 2 — and had the same seamless fun. The device makes the most of the Snapdragon 855 thankfully, and the well-powered ROG UI makes switching between apps glitch-free. In the few weeks I had the phone, there were zero crashes — a first for me.

The immersion is enhanced by the cleverly-curated hardware for the ROG Phone II. Audio performance is impressive thanks to the dual front-facing speakers equipped with DTS:X Ultra virtual surrounding sound support, as well as the stereo speaker with smart amplifiers for louder, deeper and clearer sound effects. This menas that whatever sounds come with the games or streaming, there is no distortion, whatever the volume. I tested this during peak traffic in a noisy part of the city and I still could clearly hear the motivational monologues of Baahubali on Netflix.

Another enhancement comes in the form of the Ultrasonic Air Triggers II. Hardcore games will have you nod to these for their resemblance to a console.

Charging is done via an USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C; fast charging is welcome during those short breathers between gaming sessions. The battery, significantly more powerful than that of its predecessor, is already a powerful one at 6000mAh. For some perspective: after two hours of playing Injustice 2, the battery went from 100% to just 64%. Thank goodness, there is a 3.5mm audio jack. However, to elevate the gaming experience, I connected my true wireless ear buds to the device.

It is no wonder this phone has won so many smartphone awards over the past couple of months; plus, every third person working in technology seems to either have this device or the desire to own it. Currently the ROG Phone II is priced at ₹37,999 (8GB + 128GB) and ₹59,999 (12GB + 512GB), the latter being more favourable by the heavy duty gamers who engage in long sessions of Fortnite, PUBG and Call Of Duty’s mobile editions.

Given its ongoing popularity, it is safe to say the ASUS ROG Phone II will remain a landmark in the brand’s launch timeline and a favourite across gamers and users.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/gitqvf/article30565823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14-asus-rog2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/asus-rog-phone-2-review-the-beast-of-gaming-phones/article30565825.ece

12,2020/01/14,Iran nuclear deal: EU launches dispute mechanism,"Britain, France and Germany ratcheted up pressure on Iran on Tuesday to cease its violations of a landmark nuclear deal, stressing that they want to resolve differences through talks while starting the clock on a process that could result in a so-called “snapback” of United Nations sanctions.

The three countries, which signed the international agreement in 2015 along with the U.S., Russia and China, said in a letter to the European Union’s foreign policy chief that they had no choice but to trigger the deal’s “dispute mechanism,” given Iran’s ongoing transgressions.

Limited options

The three said they rejected Tehran’s argument that Iran was justified in violating the deal because the U.S. broke the agreement by pulling out unilaterally in 2018.

“We have therefore been left with no choice, given Iran’s actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments,” the countries said in a joint statement.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who coordinates the agreement, said the pressure on Iran from Europe does not mean sanctions will automatically be slapped on the Islamic Republic.

‘Maximum pressure’

The Europeans stressed that they want to “resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue” and made no threat of sanctions in their statement. They also specifically distanced themselves from sanctions imposed by the U.S., which Washington has said is part of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.

“Our three countries are not joining a campaign to implement maximum pressure against Iran,” they said. “Our hope is to bring Iran back into full compliance with its commitments.”

The 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, seeks to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon — something Iran insists it does not want to do — by putting curbs on its atomic programme in exchange for economic incentives.

Under its dispute resolution mechanism, countries have 30 days to resolve their problem, though that can be extended. If it cannot be solved, the matter could be brought before the U.N. Security Council and could then result in the snapback of sanctions that had been lifted under the deal.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the “completely passive action” of the three countries and said Iran would support any act of “goodwill and constructive effort” to save the deal.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jvka7q/article30569437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iran,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-nuclear-deal-eu-launches-dispute-mechanism/article30569438.ece
13,2020/01/14,China stands by Sri Lanka: Wang Yi,"Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has pledged not to allow “any outside influences” to interfere with Sri Lanka’s internal matters, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office said on Tuesday.

“As Sri Lanka’s strategic partner China will continue to standby Sri Lanka’s interests. China stands for the country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We will not allow any outside influences to interfere with matters that are essentially internal concerns of Sri Lanka,” Mr. Wang pledged, according to a press statement issued by Mr. Rajapaksa’s media division. The meeting marks Beijing’s first high-level engagement with the new government in Sri Lanka.

Debt concerns

The visit bears significance in the wake of prevalent concern over Colombo’s outstanding debt to China over several largescale infrastructure projects, including the port in the southern town of Hambantota, for which China holds a 99-year lease.

Commenting on the apparent concern, including from India, on Chinese involvement in the region, Mr. Rajapaksa told foreign media last month that countries such as India, Singapore, Japan, Australia, and ASEAN countries could invest in Sri Lanka. “That is how you can counter, just complaining won’t do,” Mr. Rajapaksa had said.

President Rajapaksa is scheduled to visit Beijing next month, following his first state visit abroad to India late November.

In his meeting with the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister, the President said Sri Lanka is a small country that is strategically located. “As a result, the country has to face many political challenges. The only way to overcome them is to be economically strong. The economic independence will ensure political independence,” his office quoted him as telling the top Chinese official.

Mr. Wang, according to President Rajapaksa’s office, assured him saying: “Sri Lanka may have less landmass, but will soon be strong economically. China will be with Sri Lanka in its striving to reach this goal”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3spyuh/article30569346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-China-Lanka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-stands-by-sri-lanka-wang-yi/article30569347.ece
14,2020/01/14,Malaysia drops sex assault probe of PM-in-waiting Anwar,"Malaysia’s leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim will not face charges over claims he sexually assaulted a male former aide, prosecutors said Tuesday, the latest such scandal to tarnish the veteran politician’s career.

Muhammed Yusoff Rawther, last month, accused Mr. Ibrahim of trying to force him to have sex and filed a police complaint, but officials said there was not enough evidence to make a criminal case.

Mr. Ibrahim, seen as the likely successor to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, spent almost a decade in jail after being convicted of sodomising a young male aide, allegations that supporters say were aimed at ruining his political career.

Sex between men remains illegal under colonial-era laws in the Muslim-majority country.

Mr. Ibrahim was released from prison and pardoned in 2018 after his alliance stormed to a shock victory against a corruption-plagued coalition that had ruled the country since independence from Britain in 1957.

But political tensions have escalated sharply, with Mr. Ibrahim’s nemesis-turned-ally Mahathir refusing to say when he will hand over power, and vicious infighting erupting in his People’s Justice Party (PKR).

After completing investigations, the attorney-general’s office said “insufficient evidence” and “contradictions of material facts” meant they would not proceed with a prosecution.

“We agree with the recommendation of (the police) that the case be closed,” said solicitor-general Engku Nor Faizah Engku Atek in a statement.

Neither Mr. Ibrahim — who denied the allegations — nor Mr. Rawther were named in the statement but it was widely reported to refer to the case.

Mr. Ibrahim was first thrown in jail in the 1990s after being sacked from his position in government by Mahathir, who was in his first stint as premier at the time, and their stormy relationship has loomed over Malaysian politics ever since.

In 2015, he was jailed for a second time on sodomy charges and released only after last year’s elections.

Mahathir and Mr. Ibrahim reconciled ahead of the polls in a bid to oust the scandal-mired Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition of then premier Najib Razak.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vqq273/article30567581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALAYSIA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysia-drops-sex-assault-probe-of-pm-in-waiting-anwar/article30567582.ece
15,2020/01/14,JuD chief Hafiz Saeed pleads not guilty in terror financing cases: court official,"Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed on Tuesday pleaded “not guilty” in two terror financing cases against him as the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief finally recorded his statement in a Pakistani anti-terrorism court here.

The Counter Terrorism Department had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of Punjab province and arrested him on July 17. He is held at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.

Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

At a hearing on January 10, a questionnaire was handed over to Saeed by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court.

“In response to a questionnaire handed over to him by the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore regarding terrror financing charges against him, Saeed on Tuesday submitted his reply in which he dismissed all charges against him. He pleaded not guilty,” a court official told PTI after the in-camera hearing.

The official said the ATC adjourned the hearing till Wednesday for final arguments.

16,2020/01/14,U.S. Senate to begin impeachment trial against President Donald Trump on January 21,"The U.S. Senate is likely to begin the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump on January 21 after the House of Representatives last month impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, a top Republican Senator has said.

The 435-member House of Representatives, where Democrats enjoy a majority, last month charged Mr. Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanours” and impeached in vote that was based on bitter political divide.

Now, the 100-member Senate, where the Republicans are in majority, needs to put Mr. Trump on trial before he can be removed from the White House.

After holding it on for weeks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to send its impeachment to the Senate sometime this week and that could be as early as Tuesday. The impeachment in the Senate is unlikely to pass through given that GOP has majority in the 100-member Senate.

Top Republican Senator John Cornyn, who is also Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, on January 13 told reporters that the Senate is likely to start the impeachment trial on January 21.

Tuesday (January 21) is what it’s feeling like, he said.

“We’d actually be glued to our chair starting Tuesday, I think,” he said in response to a question.

According to Mr. Cornyn, after House sends its articles of impeachment, the Senate will likely take a few days to deal with logistics of the trial.

Prominent among these include Chief Justice John Roberts and all Senators and sending summons to Mr. Trump’s team. The Senate will also pass a resolution establishing the trial rules.

The New York Times reported that in the coming days, Ms. Pelosi is expected to choose half-a-dozen or so managers to argue on the Senate floor for Mr. Trump’s removal from office.

Those managers, who will be selected at least partly from the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, form just one element of a trial full of complicated procedures, the report said.

Mr. Cornyn on the Senate floor alleged that Ms. Pelosi delaying the impeachment is hurting the Democratic presidential candidates.

The only people who seem to gain anything from this are the Democrats who are running for President but who are not United States Senators, and thus aren’t going to be tied up during the impeachment trial, he said.

Meanwhile Republican Senators Corny, Mike Lee, and Jerry Moran announced to cosponsor Senator Josh Hawley’s resolution to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump for failure to prosecute.

It’s been three weeks and counting since the House passed articles of impeachment, and Speaker Pelosi is still playing games after insisting the President’s removal from office was urgent. This critical change will reinforce the Constitution and help prevent the House from using impeachment for personal political gain like the Speaker is sadly doing now, Mr. Cornyn said.

Our Constitution guarantees a fair and speedy trial to defendants, and Congress must provide these same guarantees to public officials facing impeachment. Speaker Pelosi has had three weeks to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but instead she is choosing to use the impeachment articles for political gain, Mr. Moran said.

Mr. Moran said the resolution requires the Senate to move forward with impeachment trials in a timely manner and helps prevent the Congress from playing political games with the impeachment procedure.

According to Senator Lee, the authors of the Constitution created the impeachment power to be a rarely used constitutional safeguard of the public trust.

It was never meant to be a partisan tool used to harass a sitting President. This rule change will limit the House’s ability to play partisan political games with impeachment. If a President is a true threat to the republic, articles to impeach him should be delivered to the Senate with haste, Mr. Lee said.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz in an interview to NBC-Dallas-Fort Worth’s ‘Lone Star Politics’ said the trial in the Senate is going to be fair and would respect due process.

It means that it is going to be very very different from the one-sided partisan show trial that we saw in the House for the last several months. The last several months House Democrats did an entirely one-sided hearing, presentation, he alleged.

They did not follow the precedent from the Clinton impeachment. They didn’t follow the precedent from the Nixon impeachment. They didn’t allow the minority to call witnesses. They didn’t allow the White House to cross examine those witnesses, Mr. Cruz said.

Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who is of Indian origin, feared that the trial in the Senate might not be fair.

The American people should expect their representatives in the Senate to seek the truth, not cover up the facts, she said in her remarks on the Senate floor.

“We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? This moment in our history will have consequences,” she said.

The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions — or whether we will finally live up to the principle: ‘Equal Justice Under Law’, she said.

There is no question that President Trump’s misconduct has left a vacuum of leadership in our country, and the American people are looking to the United States Senate to demonstrate that their leaders are worthy of the public’s trust, Ms. Harris said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ra6w3e/article27165624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senate-to-begin-impeachment-trial-against-president-donald-trump-on-january-21/article30567145.ece
17,2020/01/14,Iran says it has made arrests over plane disaster as protests rage on,"Iran said on Tuesday it had arrested an undisclosed number of suspects accused of a role in shooting down a Ukrainian airliner, as anti-government demonstrations triggered by the disaster entered a fourth day.

Wednesday's shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, killing all 176 people on board, has led to one of the greatest public challenges to Iran's clerical rulers since they came to power in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

After days of denying blame, Iran acknowledged on Saturday it had shot the plane down during a state of high alert, hours after it had fired missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq to retaliate for the killing of Iran's most powerful military commander.

Protesters, with students at the forefront, have held demonstrations against the establishment since Saturday, some met by a violent police crackdown.

Video from inside Iran has shown wounded people being carried, pools of blood on the streets and the sound of gunfire. The overall level of unrest is difficult to assess because of restrictions on independent reporting.

President Hassan Rouhani promised a thorough investigation into the “unforgiveable error” of shooting down the plane, giving a television address on Tuesday, the latest in a series of apologies from a leadership that rarely admits mistakes.

Iran's judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said some of those accused of having a role in the plane disaster had already been arrested. He did not identify the suspects or say how many had been held.

Most of those on board the flight were Iranians or dual nationals. Canada, Ukraine, Britain and other nations who had citizens on the plane have scheduled a meeting on Thursday in London to consider legal action against Tehran.

'Clerics get lost!'

The disaster and subsequent unrest comes amid one of the biggest escalations between Tehran and Washington since the revolution four decades ago that made them into foes.

Tit-for-tat military strikes began with missiles launched at a U.S. base that killed an American contractor in December, and reached their climax when Washington killed the architect of Iran's regional network of proxy militia, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3.

Iran's government was already in a precarious position, with sanctions imposed by the United States having hammered its economy, causing public anger.

The authorities killed hundreds of demonstrators in a crackdown two months ago, in what was probably the worst anti-government unrest since the revolution. Across the region, governments that include armed Iran-allied factions have also faced months of hostile mass demonstrations in Iraq and Lebanon.

In recent days, demonstrators have chanted “Clerics get lost!” and other slogans against Iran's system of theocratic rule. “Death to Khamenei,” others shouted, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, supreme leader for more than 30 years.

Riot police have beaten some demonstrators with batons, social media posts show. Gunfire has also been heard, although police have denied shooting at protesters.

The most recent video posted on social media showed protesters gathered into the night in Tehran and other cities, and burning images of Soleimani.

Rouhani’s address

“Iranian armed forces admitting their mistake is a good first step,” Mr. Rouhani said in Tuesday's address. He said those responsible would be punished and the government would be accountable to Iranians and those nations who lost citizens.

Ukraine's foreign minister said “grieving nations”, five of the countries whose citizens were killed when an airliner was shot down, would meet on Thursday.

“We will meet in person in London to discuss the ways, including legal, (for) how we are following this up,” Vadym Prystaiko said on Monday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hblj6h/article30566308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRANKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-says-it-has-made-arrests-over-plane-disaster-as-protests-rage-on/article30566309.ece
18,2020/01/14,"Philippine volcano trembles more, spews lava half-mile high","A volcano near the Philippine capital spewed lava into the sky and trembled constantly Tuesday, possibly portending a bigger and more dangerous eruption, as tens of thousands of people fled villages darkened and blanketed by heavy ash.

The continuous restiveness of the Taal volcano and several new fissures cracking the ground nearby likely means magma is rising as well and may lead to further eruptive activity, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. The volcano was spurting fountains of red-hot lava 800 meters (half a mile) into the sky, and the massive column of ash and volcanic debris at times flashed with streaks of lightning.

The alert level since the eruption began Sunday has been 4, indicating a hazardous eruption is possible in hours to days. Level 5, the highest, means such an eruption is underway.

About 50 volcanic earthquakes were detected over eight hours Tuesday, indicating rising magma, the institute said. It also warned heavy and prolonged ashfall was possible in nearby villages.

""The speed in the rise of magma is important [in determining] when the volcano will have a strong eruption and if it will slow down and freeze,” said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute. “As of now, we don’t see activities slowing down and the earthquakes still continue.”

The picturesque volcano in the middle of a lake in Batangas province south of Manila rumbled to life Sunday in a powerful explosion that blasted a 15-km column of ash, steam and pebbles into the sky. Clouds of volcanic ash blowing over Manila, 65 km to the north, closed the country’s main airport Sunday and part of Monday until the ashfall eased.

The government’s disaster-response agency counted more than 30,400 evacuees in Batangas and nearby Cavite provinces. Officials expected the number to swell.

Government work was suspended and schools closed in a wide swath of towns and cities, including Manila, because of the health risks from the ash. The eruption has not directly caused deaths or major damage. The death of a driver in a crash on an ash-covered road was linked to slippery conditions.

The small island where the 1,020-foot (311-meter) volcano lies has long been designated a “permanent danger zone,” though fishing villages have long existed there. Those villages were all evacuated, though volcanology officials have called for a total evacuation of endangered communities within a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) radius of Taal.

Taal’s last disastrous eruption, in 1965, killed hundreds of people. It is the second-most restive of about two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines, which lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where most of the world’s seismic activity occurs.

19,2020/01/14,Afghan official: bombs kill 2 children in northern province,"Two bombs went off near-simultaneously on a road in northern Afghanistan on Tuesday, killing two children and wounding nine people, a local official said.

The explosions took place in the city of Mazr-i Sharif, the provincial capital of Balkh province, said Adil Shah Adil, the provincial police chief’s spokesman. He said of the nine wounded, eight are civilians and one is a member of the Afghan security forces.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the Taliban have stepped up attacks in Balkh in recent weeks and elsewhere in northern Afghanistan. Earlier this month, the insurgents claimed an attack on a police checkpoint in Balkh that killed nine officers.

20,2020/01/14,Malaysia’s PM defends criticism of India despite palm oil backlash,"Malaysia is concerned about India's new curbs on imports of palm oil after a diplomatic row, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday, but indicated he would continue to speak out against “wrong things” even if it costs his country financially.

India, the world's biggest buyer of edible oils, last week changed rules that traders say effectively ban imports of refined palm oil from Malaysia, the world's second-biggest producer and exporter of palm oil after Indonesia.

The move came after New Delhi objected to Mr. Mahathir's criticism of India's new religion-based citizenship law. The 94-year-old premier, whose outspoken nature has soured ties with both India and Saudi Arabia in recent months, earlier accused India of invading the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.

As Malaysian palm refiners stare at a massive loss of business, Mr. Mahathir said his government would find a solution.

“We are concerned of course because we sell a lot of palm oil to India, but on the other hand we need to be frank and see that if something goes wrong, we will have to say it,” he told reporters. “If we allow things to go wrong and think only about the money involved, then I think a lot of wrong things will be done, by us and by other people.”

The benchmark palm oil contract for March delivery was down 0.9% in afternoon trade.

Reuters reported on Monday the Indian government had informally instructed traders to stay away from Malaysian palm oil. Indian traders are instead buying Indonesian crude palm oil at a premium of $10 tonne over Malaysian prices.

India's foreign ministry said on Thursday the palm curbs were not country specific but that “for any commercial trading, the status of relationship between any two countries” is something a business would consider.

India was Malaysia's biggest buyer of palm oil in 2019, with 4.4 million tonnes of purchases. In 2020, purchases could fall below 1 million tonnes if relations don't improve, Indian traders say.

To make up for the potential loss, Malaysian officials say they are trying to sell more to Pakistan, the Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and Jordan.

But replacing the top buyer won't be easy, and that's why the Malaysian Trades Union Congress, whose members include palm workers, has urged the two countries to talk things out.

“We wish to implore upon both governments to use all possible diplomatic channels to resolve this issue putting aside any personal or diplomatic ego,” it said in a statement.

Malaysia's Primary Industries Ministry, supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is engaging with its Indian counterparts to try and sort out the issue, according to a Malaysian government source aware of the discussions. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

21,2020/01/14,U.S. warns vessels transiting Gulf amid tensions with Iran,"The United States on Tuesday warned of threats to commercial vessels in and around the Persian Gulf in the wake of its confrontation with Iran.

Tensions have soared since the U.S. airstrike earlier this month that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and the architect of its regional military activities. Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles at U.S. troops in Iraq, without wounding anyone, and accidentally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner near Tehran, killing all 176 on board.

Heightened military activity and increased political tensions in this region continue to pose serious threats to commercial vessels, the U.S. said in a maritime warning. Associated with these threats is a potential for miscalculation or misidentification that could lead to aggressive actions. It said vessels transiting the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz — through which one-third of all oil traded by sea passes — could encounter GPS interference or communications jamming.

It said some vessels have reported communications from unknown entities falsely claiming to be U.S. or coalition warships. It said ships contacted by Iranian forces should identify themselves and say that they are proceeding in accordance with international law.

It advised ships to refuse to allow Iranian forces to board but not to forcibly resist them, and to immediately contact the U.S. Fifth Fleet.

Iran was accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the Persian Gulf last year. It denied those allegations, but acknowledged seizing a British-flagged oil tanker in response to the impounding of an Iranian oil tanker by authorities in Gibraltar.

22,2020/01/14,South Korea could pursue projects with North Korea despite sanctions: Moon,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that it was too early to be pessimistic about stalled denuclearisation dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and that inter-Korean cooperation could help ease the way for sanctions to be lifted.

Despite hostile rhetoric from Pyongyang, North Korea has not shut the door to more talks, Mr. Moon told reporters at an annual New Year's news conference on Tuesday.

“North Korea made clear that the door to dialogue is not closed by saying they will come back to talks only when their demands are accepted,” he said.

South Korea has been increasingly sidelined as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled, with sanctions imposed over North Korea's weapons programmes dampening Mr. Moon's bid to restart inter-Korean economic and cooperation efforts.

When asked by Reuters whether South Korea will seek to reopen exchanges with the North independently from the United States, Mr. Moon said there is a need to explore a “new idea” to foster a breakthrough in the stalemate.

“If we expand inter-Korean cooperation as much as possible, it will be able to not only expedite North Korea-U.S. dialogue, but also fetch international support for partial lifting or exemptions of sanctions if necessary,” he said.

Mr. Moon said there are steps that the two Koreas could take that aren't blocked by the restrictions.

“First of all, we can cooperate on the border areas and we can resume individual tourism,” he said. “This can be carried out despite the ongoing international sanctions.”

The two Koreas could also organise a joint team for this year's Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and seek to co-host the 2032 Olympics, Mr. Moon added.

In his New Year's speech on Jan. 7, Mr. Moon said there was a ”desperate need” for ways to improve ties with North Korea.

But North Korea has spent much of the last year criticising Seoul as being beholden to the United States, and has said it plans to bulldoze the tourism complex that was once a rare example of cooperation between the Koreas.

White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the United States had reached out to North Korea seeking to resume talks, according to an interview published on Sunday by Axios.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kw3280/article27770313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHKOREA-MEMORIALDAY-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/skorea-could-pursue-projects-with-nkorea-despite-sanctions-moon/article30564761.ece
23,2020/01/14,"Huge sinkhole swallows bus, kills six in China","An enormous sinkhole swallowed a bus and pedestrians in China, sparking an explosion, killing six people and leaving 10 more missing, state media said Tuesday.

Footage showed people at a bus stop running from the collapsing road, as the bus -- jutting into the air -- sank halfway into the ground.

Several people disappeared into the sinkhole as it spread, including what appeared to be a child.

The incident, outside a hospital, also triggered an explosion inside the hole, video showed.

Search and rescue work was underway and the cause of the accident was under investigation, the state-run CCTV broadcaster said.

The incident occurred at around 5:30 pm (0930 GMT) on Monday in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, CCTV said, adding 16 people had been taken to hospital.

Sinkholes are not unknown in China, where they are often blamed on construction works and the country's rapid pace of development.

In 2016, at least three people fell into a huge sinkhole in central Henan province, which swallowed a section of road and passersby.

An initial investigation showed the collapse might have been caused by water pipes buried under the road breaking up due to the rain.

In 2013, five people died when a 10-metre (33-foot) wide sinkhole opened up at the gates of an industrial estate in Shenzhen.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1jh0h4/article30564443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bus-sink,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/huge-sinkhole-swallows-bus-kills-six-in-china/article30564410.ece
24,2020/01/14,Situation in Kashmir violates human rights: U.S. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell,"The situation in Kashmir violates human rights, a US Congresswoman has said, as she joined as cosponsors to a resolution urging India to end restrictions on communications and mass detentions in the newly-created Union Territory.

The resolution No 745 that was introduced in the House of Representatives last year by Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal now has 36 cosponsors, of whom two are Republicans and 34 from the opposition Democratic Party.

“The situation in Kashmir violates human rights. Thousands have been detained unjustly & millions are without access to the internet & telephones,” Congresswoman Debbie Dingell said in a tweet Monday night.

“That’s why I signed onto House Resolution 745 so the US can let the world know we will not stand by while these violations happen,” she said.

Ms. Dingell represents 12th Congressional District of Michigan.

The Congressional resolution is currently before the House Foreign Affairs Committee for necessary action.

Congressman Brad Sherman said he looks forward to getting US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster’s report on his recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

“I expect the report to indicate what restrictions the Ambassador faced, in particularly, whether or not the Ambassador was able to visit detainees. The visit and report are valuable only to the extent of the access given,” Mr. Sherman wrote on Twitter.

A group of 15 envoys, including Mr. Juster, visited Jammu and Kashmir last week where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as the military top brass.

Internet services, landline and mobile phones were snapped across Jammu and Kashmir on August 4, a day before the Centre’s announcement to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide it into two union territories.

Though most services, except mobile internet, were restored in Jammu within a week, Kashmir saw landlines and post-paid services being restored in phases.

However, internet continues to remain barred in the entire Valley except for some government offices, hospitals and business establishments. Pre-paid mobile services too are yet to be restored in Kashmir.

Mobile internet services were restored in Kargil district of Ladakh after remaining suspended for 145 days.

The visit by the envoys of 15 nations was the second one of a foreign delegation to Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 provisions on August 5 last year.

Earlier, Delhi-based think tank International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies took 23 EU MPs on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the Union Territory.

Meanwhile, the Hindu American Foundation has launched a nationwide campaign urging Indian Americans to reach out to their representatives — Congressmen and Senators — to appraise them about the improving situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the atrocities against Kashmiri Hindus in the past.

In the past several weeks, more than half a dozen US lawmakers have come out in support of India’s position on Kashmir. Almost all of them have spoken on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Congressman Scott Perry from Pennsylvania last week said that he stands with India in its aspiration to provide equal economic, social, and political opportunities to all citizens.

“As part of this pursuit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted last year to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of India to address the stagnant economy and high youth unemployment plaguing the region by providing economic opportunity and sound governance,” he said.

“The residents of Jammu and Kashmir have battled economic depression and forces of extremism and radicalisation for too long. The regional stability now provided by government will give residents of Jammu and Kashmir a better way forward and hope for the future,” Mr. Perry added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8tm78e/article30564375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-TRUMPDINGELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/situation-in-kashmir-violates-human-rights-us-congresswoman-debbie-dingell/article30564319.ece
25,2020/01/14,"Australia’s massive fires could become routine, climate scientists warn","Bushfires ravaging Australia have provided a foretaste of the kinds of conditions that could become normal unless the world moves rapidly to curb emissions of the greenhouse gases driving global warming, scientists have warned.

Although Australia's government and parts of its media have attempted to downplay the role of man-made climate change in making the country more vulnerable to wildfires, a review of 57 scientific papers published since 2013 suggested clear links.

“We're not going to reverse climate change on any conceivable timescale. So the conditions that are happening now, they won't go away,” Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts Research at Britain's Met Office Hadley Centre, who co-authored the review, told a news conference in London on Monday.

The review found that climate change had led to an increase in the frequency and severity of what scientists call “fire weather” - periods with a high fire risk due to some combination of hotter temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and strong winds.

The effects had not only been observed in Australia, but from the western United States and Canada, to southern Europe, Scandinavia, the Amazon and Siberia, the review found.

Globally, fire weather seasons have lengthened across about 25% of the Earth's vegetated surface, resulting in about a 20% increase in the mean length of the fire weather season, according to observational data.

Mr. Betts said Australia was particularly vulnerable to fires since its land area had warmed by more than the rise in average global temperature of about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times.

The World Meteorological Organization says the global temperature increase could hit 3-5 C this century - more than three times limits agreed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement - if nothing is done to stop rising emissions.

“Temperature conditions in Australia are extreme at the moment but they are what we expect to happen on average in a world of three degrees of global warming,” Mr. Betts said. “It brings it home to you what climate change means.”

The review was carried out using ScienceBrief.org, a new online research platform set up by Britain's University of East Anglia and Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.

At least 28 people have been killed in the Australian fires that have destroyed 2,000 homes and razed 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), nearly half the area of the United Kingdom.

After weeks of criticism over his handling of the crisis, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday he would propose a high-powered inquiry into the disaster, including the impact of climate change.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e10l0e/article30468148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australias-massive-fires-could-become-routine-climate-scientists-warn/article30564263.ece
26,2020/01/14,China-bound scorpions seized in Sri Lankan airport sting,"Sri Lanka's customs on Monday arrested and fined a Chinese man accused of trying to take 200 venomous scorpions out of the country in his checked-in luggage.

The man was suspected of trying to get the scorpions back to China to extract the venom, officials said.

The live arachnids were discovered by security officials at Colombo international airport in plastic containers packed in the man's luggage that was to be checked in.

""We detained the passenger and launched an investigation,"" customs spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said. ""We have not placed a value on the 200 scorpions, but trafficking in live wildlife has become a lucrative trade.""

The suspect was fined 100,000 rupees ($550) and the scorpions confiscated before the man was allowed to return home, Mr. Jayaratne said.

Sri Lanka has about 18 species of venomous scorpions, but only one is fatal to humans. It was not known if the confiscated arachnids were deadly.

The island nation has strict laws on wildlife and fauna, but smuggling attempts are increasingly frequent.

27,2020/01/14,US drops designation of China as currency manipulator,"The Trump administration is dropping its designation of China as a currency manipulator in advance of the January 15 signing of a Phase 1 U.S.-China trade agreement.

The preliminary pact that the two sides are set to sign includes a section that’s intended to prevent China from manipulating its currency to gain trade advantages.

The action announced on January 13 comes five months after the Trump administration had branded China a currency manipulator - the first time that any country had been so named since 1994 during the Clinton administration.

Even while removing China from its currency black list, the Treasury Department does name China as one of 10 countries it says require placement on a watch list that will mean their currency practices will be closely monitored. In addition to China, the countries on that monitoring list are Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and Vietnam.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration had dropped China’s designation as a currency manipulator because of commitments in the Phase 1 trade agreement that President Donald Trump is to sign with China on Wednesday at the White House.

“China has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the current report.

The Treasury Department is required to report to Congress twice a year in April and October on whether any countries are manipulating their currencies to gain unfair trade advantages against U.S. businesses and workers.

The new report is technically three months late, apparently because the Trump administration had delayed its release until it had achieved the currency Phase 1 commitments from China.

The initial decision to brand China as a manipulator had come in a surprise announcement in August which reversed a Treasury finding in May that no country was manipulating its currency. The United States had not put any country on the manipulation blacklist since the Clinton administration branded China a manipulator 26 years ago.

The designation is largely symbolic. It requires the United States to enter into negotiations to resolve the currency problem and could ultimately lead to the imposition of economic sanctions such as higher tariffs on Chinese goods, something the Trump administration was already doing in its tit-for-tat trade war with China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8wfdzz/article30447837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-CHINA-TRADE-ECONOMY-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-drops-designation-of-china-as-currency-manipulator/article30563150.ece
28,2020/01/14,US troops in Iraq got warning hours before Iranian attack,"American troops were informed of an impending missile barrage hours before their air base in Iraq was struck by Iran, U.S. military officials said on January 13, days after the attack that marked a major escalation between the longtime foes.

At 11 p.m. on January 7, U.S. Lt. Col. Antoinette Chase gave the order for American troops at Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq, to go on lockdown. Military movements froze as her team, responsible for emergency response at the base, sent out alerts about the threat. At 11.30 p.m., she gave the order to take cover in bunkers.

The first strike landed sometime after 1.35 a.m. on January 8 and the barrage continued for nearly two hours. Half way through the attack, Mr. Chase learned the missiles were being launched from Iran.

No American soldiers were killed or wounded, the U.S. has said, although several troops were treated for concussions from the blast and are being assessed, said Col. Myles Caggins, a spokesman at the base for the U.S. coalition fighting the Islamic State group.

“The reason why we pushed it at 2330 is because at that point in time all indications pointed to something coming,” Ms. Chase told reporters touring the base. “Worst case scenario - we were told was it’s probably going to be a missile attack. So we were informed of that.”

The Iranian attack was in retaliation for the U.S. drone strike near Baghdad airport that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3.

An Associated Press crew touring the Ain al-Asad base saw large craters and damaged military trailers. Forklifts lifted rubble and loaded it onto trucks from an area the size of a football stadium. U.S. soldiers inspected portable housing units destroyed in the attack.

The sprawling complex in western Anbar province is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) west of Baghdad and is shared with the Iraqi military. It houses about 1,500 members of the U.S. military and the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State militant group.

The Iranian attack - the most direct assault on America since the 1979 seizing of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran - raised fears of a wider conflict although both sides have since indicated that they won’t seek further retaliation, at least in the short term.

“There were more than 10 large missiles fired and the impact hit several areas along the airfield,” Mr. Caggins said. At least 15-30 minutes passed between successive strikes, Ms. Chase said.

The attack destroyed facilities that house dozens of soldiers and one missile hit near an airstrip where six drones were parked but caused no damage, he said.

The base received a notification that the missiles were on their way, thanks to early warning systems, Mr. Caggins said, and troops were moved out of harm’s way. He described soldiers who lived through the attack as “warriors.”

Because of the long intervals between barrages, a few curious soldiers peered out to inspect the damage.

“After the first boom, I was confused and so I stuck my head out to see what it was,” said Capt. Jeffrey Hansen, 30, from North Carolina. “The second boom blew a bunch of debris on my face.”

The Ain al-Asad air base was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Facilities at the base were split with Iraqi forces when U.S. troops returned in 2014 leading a multi-national coalition to defeat IS militants.

President Donald Trump went to the air base in December 2018, making his first presidential visit to troops in the region. Vice President Mike Pence has also visited.

On January 13, most soldiers walked around the base without any body armor, amid large tents and street signs written mostly in English. The base was ringed by large concrete barriers blackened by the bombardment.

Ms. Chase said troops had conducted a drill the week before the attack and that they had received some warnings earlier in the day that had prompted them to move troops around the base.

“I had zero casualties and everybody is alive to tell the tale. So as far as I’m concerned, I couldn’t be happier and I couldn’t be prouder of the actions that the soldiers and the coalition forces took that night,” she added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ad96nn/article30509702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/air-basejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-troops-in-iraq-got-warning-hours-before-iranian-attack/article30562886.ece

36,2020/01/14,ICRA places APSEZ debt under ratings watch,"Ratings agency ICRA has placed the long-term rating of [ICRA]AA+ on outstanding bank facilities and non-convertible debentures of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZL) under rating watch with negative implications.

This was after APSEZL announced the acquisition of a controlling stake of 75% in Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd. (KPCL) from the existing shareholders at a total enterprise value of ₹13,572 crore.

The indicative timeline for completion of the transaction is by April 2020.

“The significant scale of the transaction, which, if successfully completed, will result in a gross debt addition of ₹6,200 crore and a cash outflow of ₹5,500 crore for APSEZL at a consolidated level. Effectively, KPCL’s acquisition, along with other acquisitions and capex done in the recent past, could result in an increase in the company’s net leverage (net debt/OPBDITA) in FY2021 and will push back the anticipated trajectory of improvement in the leveraging levels,” said ICRA in a statement.

KPCL operates the Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh and registered volumes of 54.9 million tonnes in FY2019 and EBITDA of ₹1,332 crore.

The company had a high leverage of 4.6-4.7 times as on March 31, 2019. It has a track record of improving the cargo volumes and efficiency levels of its acquired ports at Dhamra and Kattupalli and has plans to achieve similar improvements at Krishnapatnam.

While ICRA notes that the acquisition could result in diversification of the target hinterland and cargo profile, consolidation of market share and operational synergies for APSEZL over the long term, however, the company’s ability to scale up cargo volumes and improve the performance of the port to more optimal levels, thereby leading to improvement in leveraging levels, would be a key monitorable.

As on September 30, 2019, at the consolidated level, APSEZL’s liquidity position remained strong with cash and liquid investments of ₹8,779 crore and significant unutilised working capital facilities.

“We plan to introduce smart TVs which will be based on our own Harmony OS, as well as laptops. These should be available by the end of the first quarter or the beginning of next quarter [of 2020],” Honor India president Charles Peng said.

Honor, which on Tuesday launched its 9X smartphone along with wearables — MagicWatch 2 and Band 5i in India — sees the country as a key market for the company.

41,2020/01/14,Janak Raj may be RBI’s third internal member in MPC,"The Reserve Bank of India’s principal adviser in the monetary policy department, Janak Raj, is likely to be the third internal member of the central bank in the monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates.

This is because the government has elevated Michael Patra, the executive director of the monetary policy department, as deputy governor. Mr. Patra was one of the RBI’s internal members of MPC, apart from Governor Shaktikanta Das and B.P. Kanungo, the Deputy Governor in charge of the monetary policy. The next meeting of the monetary policy committee is scheduled for early February.

According to the law, by default, the Governor and the Deputy Governor in-charge of monetary policy are the two RBI internal members of MPC. The law says that the third member could be any RBI officer. Mr. Patra, an economist, is likely to get the monetary policy department and would hence continue as an MPC member.

Mr. Kanungo was given the charge of the department after Viral Acharya, the deputy governor in charge of the monetary policy department, quit in at the end of July last.

The MPC consists of six members, of which three are RBI’s internal members and three are external experts.

Among the four deputy governors of RBI, two are promoted from within the ranks of RBI. Of the remaining two, one is a commercial banker and another, an economist.

Sources said Mr. Raj could be elevated to the executive director’s post, the interviews for which are due in February. At present, the Reserve Bank has 12 executive directors , some of whom will retire during the year.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/janak-raj-may-be-rbis-third-internal-member-in-mpc/article30569524.ece
42,2020/01/14,"Hawkish about inflation, but not dogmatic","The markets were taken by surprise when Michael Debabrata Patra, the executive director of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) voted in favour of an interest rate cut in the monetary policy review last February. Mr Patra, who has been a member of the six-member monetary policy committee — which sets interest rates — since its inception, was seen as an inflation hawk by central bank watchers. Hence, his stance in the February policy came as a surprise to many.

It also showed that Mr. Patra, a career central banker who joined the RBI in 1985, was not dogmatic about any issue, but would retain flexibility and act as the situation demanded. Probably, MPC members saw growth coming down sharply, which Mr. Patra had also realised and therefore voted in favour of a rate cut in the next four policies as well.

Mr. Patra (59) has been appointed as the Deputy Governor for three years and is likely to get the key monetary policy department. The post of economist Deputy Governor fell vacant after Viral Acharya quit in July last year. The central bank is expected to reshuffle the Deputy Governor’s portfolios once Mr. Patra takes charge.

Mr. Patra, an economist and one of the architects of the inflation-targeting framework, will be the first Deputy Governor from the RBI’s research cadre after a gap of 25 years — the last one being S.S. Tarapore.

One of the biggest strengths of Mr. Patra is that he has been long enough in the monetary policy department to see different interest cycles. He became the principal adviser of the monetary policy department in July 2012. Within RBI, he is seen as a link between academic research and policy-making.

He has worked in the International Monetary Fund as senior adviser to Executive Director (India) during December 2008 to June 30, 2012, when he actively engaged in the work of the IMF’s Executive Board through the period of the global financial crisis and the Euro area sovereign debt crisis.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ks0oxz/article30569519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUPATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hawkish-about-inflation-but-not-dogmatic/article30569520.ece
43,2020/01/14,Wipro sees slowdown in financial services,"Tech major Wipro on Tuesday said the market has been witnessing some level of uncertainty due to various geo-political risks while the overall demand environment has neither improved nor deteriorated.

It also said it witnessed a growth slowdown in financial services due to continued market stiffness driven by macro-economic environment.

Wipro posted a 2.17% year-on-year drop in its consolidated profit for the third quarter ended December 31.

It reported a profit of ₹2,455.8 crore in Q3 against ₹2,510.3 crore a year ago. Total revenue stood at ₹15,470.50 crore or a 2.73% increase over the ₹15,059.50 crore clocked in the year-earlier period.

Addressing the media, Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, CEO and MD, Wipro, said the firm delivered a ‘good’ quarter in terms of revenue and margin. Revenue grew 1.8% in constant currency terms, at the mid-point of the guidance range.

“We have delivered a good quarter with secular growth across all business units, geographies and practices.”

In his detailed commentary on Q3 performance, Mr. Neemuchwala said, “We are pleased with our performance in consumer business which grew 12.1% yoy (cc) this quarter and we have also experienced a sustained rhythm in deals wins.’’

The energy and utility space continued to grow moderately. Health saw a seasonal uptick, while the technology business was impacted by furlough and a slowdown in spending by customers in the semi-conductor sector.

Wipro saw a slowdown in financial services.

Encouraging order book

“However, we expect recovery in manufacturing and are encouraged by the order book and deal pipeline,’’ he said.

For the quarter ending March, Wipro expects revenue from the IT business to be in the range of $2,095 million to $2,137 million, a sequential growth of 0-2%, a modest forecast.

Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal said, “We expanded operating margins by 0.3%, aided by a favourable movement in the currency. Further, we generated strong operating cash flows led by disciplined execution at 124% of our net income,” he added.

The technology major’s digital revenue grew 22.8% year-on-year (constant currency terms). It currently accounts for 40% of the total revenue.

On its cloud initiative, Wipro said its investment in cloud studio continued to pay off. “We have accelerated cloud journey for our customers by migrating more than 39,000 workloads and 2900 plus apps,”' said the company.

Sanjeev Hota, head of research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said Wipro reported in-line revenue growth in CC terms, while EBIT margin of IT services remained marginally below our estimates. CC revenue growth during the quarter was aided by 0.3% of ITI acquisition. Q3 revenue growth guidance is on the expected lines. BFSI revenue growth remained tepid, while consumer and manufacturing business continued to perform well during the quarter. Wipro has provided a revenue growth guidance of 0-2% q-o-q CC revenue growth for Q4FY20E. “We continue to believe that Wipro would lag in revenue growth among its large peers and remain our least preferred stock,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mxkcvw/article30569516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Wiprobw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wipro-sees-slowdown-in-financial-services/article30569518.ece
44,2020/01/14,No respite for India Inc. as Q3 revenues may drop,"Lower commodity prices and languishing demand across consumption segments likely pared India Inc.’s revenue for the second quarter on the trot in the three months ended December 31, 2019, according to a Crisil Research estimate.

The estimate was based on an analysis of 300 companies that account for about 60% of the market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange, excluding banking, financial services, insurance, and oil players. The revenue of surveyed firms declined 2-3% year-on-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 mainly due to muted private consumption and decline in revenue of industrial and construction-linked sectors.

At 2-3%, the decline exacerbates the pain from a 3-4% fall seen in the previous quarter. Between the second quarter of FY19 and the first quarter of FY20, aggregate revenue had grown 11-12% on average.

Prasad Koparkar, senior director, Crisil Research, said, “Aggregate revenue of listed auto players is estimated to have fallen 9-10% in the third quarter. Revenue growth of FMCG firms, too, is expected to have moderated 4-6%, owing to weakening rural consumption.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-respite-for-india-inc-as-q3-revenues-may-drop/article30569501.ece

“The bidders have agreed to pay around ₹7,500 crore, or 30% of the total proceeds, within three months. The Committee of Creditors (CoC) met on Monday. It was decided that the lenders will claw-back priority payments of ₹4,300 crore made to Chinese and Indian lenders,” a source in the know of the development told The Hindu.

RCom’s mobile tower and fibre assets are housed under its subsidiary Reliance Infratel Ltd. (RITL), while spectrum, real estate assets as well as the enterprise and data centre businesses are held in RCom and Reliance Telecom Ltd. (RTL). A Reliance Jio spokesperson declined to offer any comment.

The lenders will start recovering the monetisation proceeds from March 2020. The CoC members will obtain their respective board approvals so that they can put a final vote on the resolution plans on January 31, 2020, ahead of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) filing on February 3, 2020.

With this, 38 lenders of RCom are expected to recover ₹25,000 crore of the total outstanding dues of ₹49,000 crore, making it the highest-ever recovery of dues by financial creditors in the telecom sector, that has seen the exit or shutdown of nine out of 12 telecom companies since 2012.

The company’s secured debt is estimated to be around ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claims of around ₹49,000 crore in August, 2019.

RCom chairman Anil Ambani had tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of ₹30,142 crore for the July-September quarter due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.

This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian corporate till date. However, the CoC rejected Mr. Ambani’s resignation and asked him to cooperate in the insolvency proceedings.

Meanwhile, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors bought equities worth ₹ 68.24 crore, and domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth ₹ 47.17 crore on Monday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

According to traders, market mood turned bearish after government data on Monday showed that retail inflation rose to about five-and-half year high of 7.35 % in December 2019, surpassing the RBI’s comfort level, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables as onions were selling costlier.

Spike in headline inflation is an “unwanted complication” in a slowing economy and will prevent the Reserve Bank from cutting rates, analysts said, warning of the “spectre of stagflation” that India risks getting into.

48,2020/01/14,"You don’t need CAA to grant citizenship, says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that opponents of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) are against offering refuge to victims of persecution in neighbouring counties is a “willful misrepresentation of facts and plot to polarise the country,” says Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

The Prime Minister has said opponents of the CAA are misinformed as it only grants, does not take away citizenship.

Nobody is opposed to citizenship to persecuted people. Far from giving any relief to the these poor and harassed people, the intent of the CAA is to aggravate communal tension in India. Thousands of them are in Rajasthan. If they are so concerned about these refugees, why didn’t Amit Shah grant citizenship for them when he came to Jodhpur recently? To give them citizenship you did not even need the CAA. They are only interested in building a fake narrative that they are the custodians Hindu rights. The PM’s statement is aimed at communal polarisation. This is dangerous for the country.

A letter than you had written in 2009 to the then Home Minister about HIndu and Sikh refugees in Rajasthan is being cited to justify CAA.

How can you have it both ways? Are we then opposed to citizenship to refugees? The letter itself is proof that Mr. Modi’s statement is incorrect. I stand by my letter in 2009. Let me reiterate that I am all for giving them citizenship. The question is not that. The question is why this divisive propaganda, why this polarising diatribe? Why are they misrepresenting my position? Between 2016 and 19, 1,750 refugees from Pakistan have been given citizenship in Rajasthan. Of this, 1,180-odd were granted citizenship in the last one year, after our government came to power. As of today there are 17,574 refugees from Pakistan residing in Rajasthan. Of them, 331 are Muslims.

Doesn’t that letter undermine your position on CAA?

Not at all. On the contrary, it undermines the BJP position that we are opposed to citizenship to victims of persecution. That letter was raising an administrative issue with the Centre. The opposition to the CAA is about a discriminatory law. What about persecuted people in other countries and other sects, religions and non-believers? What about Tamils from Sri Lanka? What about Amhadiyas? Rohingya? Tibetan Buddhists?

The BJP says it has the mandate.

I have spoken to 10 Chief Ministers on this issue. Not only parties opposed to the BJP, but also its allies such as the JD(U) and its leader, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar are calling for a rethink. The JD(U) had supported the bill in Parliament. The BJP had got 37% votes and 63% of voters were against them. Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar, Pinarayi Vijayan, Uddhav Thackeray and all CMs opposed to the CAA have won elections. This arrogance that they had the mandate to implement such a divisive law is bad for the country.

49,2020/01/14,NIA questions J&K Police DSP Davinder Singh in Srinagar,"Arrested Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Davinder Singh, who was questioned by a National Investigation Agency (NIA) team in Srinagar on Tuesday, has revealed that he had been providing logistics support to militants of the Hizbul Mujahideen for the past three years.

He dropped hints at the involvement of other officials of the J&K police.

With the Union Home Ministry likely to hand over the case to the NIA and shift him to Delhi for further interrogation, the J&K police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) is relentlessly acting on the inputs provided by the police officer and carrying out multiple searches in several pockets of south Kashmir to arrest more militants and bust the support network.

“Preliminary investigation suggests that the DSP had been providing logistics support, including safe passage to militants from one district to another, for the past three years. So far, the police officer seemed to be connected with the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit only,” a police official told The Hindu.

Sources in the SIT said the DSP hinted at more officials of the police department “being involved in dubious activities”, and the police dragnet being widened.

‘Probe under way’

“A fair and impartial probe is under way to unearth all links of the officer,” a Srinagar-based police spokesman said.

SIT officials, sources said, were poring over the files of the Parliament attack, which was believed to have been masterminded by a non-local Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) “commander”, Gazi Baba, who was able to set up links with local people in Kashmir and lived in the congested and secured locality of Qamarwari for many years.

DSP Singh was part of the special anti-militancy squad Special Operations Group in 2002 and was named by Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, in a letter to his lawyer, and suggested that another Parliament attacker Mohammad was taken to Delhi on the directions of the police officer.

House scanned

The officer’s three-storey under-construction house at Indira Nagar, sharing a boundary wall with the 15 Corps headquarters in Srinagar, has been scanned multiple times in the past three days “for more clues and information.” Adviser to Lt. Governor C.P. Murmu, Farooq Khan, also in-charge of the J&K Home department, warned against questioning the role of the J&K police.

“The police are doing a great job to establish peace in J&K. All organisations have black sheep and the DSP was one. The credit goes to the police officers who identified him and arrested him and unearthed the whole conspiracy. One should bear in mind that hundreds of policemen have laid down their lives in the fight against terrorism,” said Mr. Khan.

The police on Tuesday denied that the officer was conferred the President’s Police Medal for Gallantry.

However, the Union Home Ministry did award him the ‘Police Medal for Meritorious Service’ on August 15, 2019.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m92gjg/article30569927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15FAROOQKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-questions-jk-police-dsp-davinder-singh-in-srinagar/article30569682.ece

The Taliban has been conducting talks with the U.S.-appointed peace negotiator while a direct dialogue between Kabul and Taliban is yet to begin.

“I hope the day comes and the Afghan government and the Taliban talk with each other about reaching a peace deal,” said Mr. Karzai. Mr. Karzai, who served as the first post-Taliban government of Afghanistan till 2014, is one of the leading Afghan figures participating in the Raisina Dialogue. The other participant is Dr. Hamdullah Mohib, National Security Advisor of the government in Kabul. India has maintained that a dialogue for peace will have to follow the model of “Afghan owned and Afghan led and Afghan controlled”.

The U.S.-Taliban peace negotiation is at a critical juncture as the Taliban has not moved ahead on responding to the American proposals and the comments from Mr. Karzai could work in favour of creating an environment for including the government in Kabul.

The Raisina Dialogue’s inaugural session was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar who sat among the audience while Mr. Karzai spoke about the possibilities of peace. The inaugural session also included former Prime Ministers Stephen Harper (Canada), Anders Vogh Rasmussen (Denmark), Carl Boldt (Sweden), Helen Clark (New Zealand), Tshering Tobgay (Bhutan) and Han Seung-soo (South Korea).

During the inaugural session, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Danish PM and ex-NATO Secretary General Anders Rasmussen said he would like to see a global alliance of democracies to stand up to oppressive rulers and regimes and India could play an important role in such a coalition.

“India can play an important role in this... I am an admirer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India’s participation in this alliance is important,” he said.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who was scheduled to deliver the inaugural address at the Raisina Dialogue but had to call off his four-day visit due to devastating bushfires in several parts of his country, sent a video message for the dialogue.

In his message, Mr. Morrison said India is and will remain the “strategic lynchpin” in the Indo-Pacific.

“The term Indo-Pacific reflects the recognition that India’s power and purpose will be vitally important to the region and to resolving and supporting shared security challenges. India has taken on an increasingly active role in the Indian Ocean,” he said.

Speaking at the event, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Indian foreign policy seeks to achieve a broad engagement with many parties and “managing if not leveraging global contradictions, advancing our interests in a multi polar world and contributing to global good”.

During the inaugural session in New Delhi, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Rasmussen, former Bhutanese premier Tshering Tobgay and former South Korean Prime Minister Han Seung-soo, discussed global challenges.

Important challenges facing the world related to globalisation, 2030 agenda, role of technology in modern world, climate change, were part of the discussion. During the inaugural session, the spiralling US-Iran tensions following the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in an American drone strike, were also discussed.

Without a change in the government of Iran, peace in the Middle East is not possible, former Canadian PM Harper said.

“Climate change cannot be tackled through targets. We need zero emission technology and development,” Harper said.

Former Afghan president Karzai said Americans must realise they can’t force others to follow their line.

“They couldn’t do it with Afghans, how can they do it with Iran?” he said, adding that wisdom must prevail and that wisdom must come from US.

Discussing the challenge of climate change, former New Zealand premier Clark said achieving zero carbon is important to combat climate change, but it is important to get national consensus on achieving this target.

Mr. Tobgay said he was a believer in multilateralism, but the UN Security Council has failed on climate change.

“Till now the UNSC has adopted only one resolution on climate. This has to change. Climate remains the biggest concern,” he said.

Talking about prospects of peace in Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai hoped for intra-Afghan dialogue between the government and the Taliban.

“We’re optimistic about peace, we are Afghans,” he asserted.

Mr. Harper said one of the great challenges that liberal democracies are facing is coping with political protests in their own countries which have arisen primarily as a combination of new technology, the uneven distribution of organisation and rise of nationalism.

“I think these are things creative leaders will learn to accommodate. I think the great strength of liberal democracies is that they are often wrong but over time correct their errors,” he said on being asked about whether the trans-atlantic liberal order he had envisioned was fraying.

Talking about India, Harper hailed Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, saying India will be a country that is self-defined.

“India is not going to be a bastion of Western liberals. Under the current Government identity is coming back in a big way,” he said.

Mr. Rasmussen said NATO is stronger than ever before, much more stronger since the end of the Cold War.

“NATO’s cover must expand, for instance in Middle East. What NATO could do is train forces in the Middle East... lead the anti-ISIS coalition,” he said.

The fifth edition of the prestigious Raisina Dialogue, jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Observer Research Foundation, will bring together 700 international participants from over a 100 countries, in one of the largest gatherings of its kind.

The three-day conference will see participation of 12 foreign ministers, including from Russia, Iran, Australia, Maldives, South Africa, Estonia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Uzbekistan and the EU.

Iran Foreign Minister Javed Zarif’s participation assumes significance as it comes following the killing of Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani.

“The appointment of CDS is required by a country that aspires to be a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25. Keeping India’s geo-political role in mind it was a much-needed reform,” Mr. Singh told ex-Servicemen in Jaipur on the occasion of the Armed Forces Veterans’ Day.

53,2020/01/14,U.P. CM Adityanath faces black balloons in Bihar’s Gaya,"Black balloons greeted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday in Bihar’s Gaya district, where he addressed a public meeting on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The U.P. CM lashed out at Opposition parties for ‘misinforming’ people about the CAA and creating chaos in the country.

Asserting that the CAA was not for ‘snatching citizenship but was instead aimed at ‘giving citizenship’ to people, Mr. Adityanath contended that while India’s Muslims enjoyed equal citizenship rights, the Hindu minorities in Pakistan had been ill-treated. “The population of Indian Muslims multiplied several times in India but the Hindu population in Pakistan came down from about 20% to less than 4% and this new law, CAA, will provide justice to such Hindus who are compelled to leave Pakistan for religious persecution and oppression,” he asserted.

Midway through his speech at the Gandhi Maidan, a bunch of black balloons rose up above the northern side of the ground and dotted the skyline, catching everyone’s attention. Mr. Adityanath, however, ignored the balloons and continued his address.

The meeting, which was a part of the BJP’s effort to explain the new law to the people, was attended by all the senior party leaders of Bihar including Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, State party chief Sanjay Jaiswal and minister Prem Kumar. The event was interspersed with full-throated shouts of “Jai Shri Ram” by a band of youth dressed in saffron and seated in the front row of the audience.

A short distance from the venue of this meeting, hundreds of protesters organised under the banner of the Samvidhan Bachao Morcha (Save Constitution Forum) continued their sit-in dharna for the 17th day against the CAA and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Gaya’s Shanti Bagh.

“Ours is a peaceful 24x7 protest and a day before U.P. CM’s visit here, we’d requested the district administration to ensure our security apprehending trouble by those coming to attend the meeting,” convener of the forum, Omair Khan told The Hindu. “A huge amount of resentment is building... against this discriminatory law CAA and proposed exercises like NRC and NPR” in Gaya, he asserted.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah too is likely to visit Vaishali in Bihar on January 16, as part of the party’s outreach to dispel ‘misgivings’ about the CAA.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mjvbtd/article30567952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ADITYANATH-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-cm-adityanath-faces-black-balloons-in-bihars-gaya/article30567953.ece
54,2020/01/14,Nirbhaya case: Mukesh Singh files mercy plea before President,"Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, filed a mercy plea before the President on Tuesday, Tihar Prison authorities said.

Mukesh Singh filed the mercy plea with President Ram Nath Kovind on a day his curative petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

Moves HC against death warrant

One of the four Nirbhaya gang rape convicts, who are scheduled to be hanged on January 22, moved the Delhi High Court on Tuesday for setting aside the death warrant issued by a trial court.

The plea of convict Mukesh Singh is listed for hearing on Wednesday before a bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal.

The petition, filed through advocate Vrinda Grover, seeks setting aside of the January 7 order issuing warrant of his execution.

The plea also states that on Tuesday he also moved mercy petitions before the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the President of India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ez9wsc/article30567949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUKESHSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mukesh-singh-files-mercy-plea-before-president/article30567950.ece
55,2020/01/14,Judge in Azad case asks prosecutor: Have you read the Constitution?,"Tis Hazari Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau on Tuesday, while hearing the bail plea of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad in connection with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in Daryaganj last month, observed that the prosecution was behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan.

When the prosecutor, representing the Delhi Police, read out some social media posts of Mr. Azad to allege that he had incited violence, Dr. Lau said: “Where is the violence? What is wrong with any of these posts? Who says you cannot protest? Have you read the Constitution?”

The Judge said: “You are behaving as if Jama Masjid is Pakistan. Even if it was Pakistan, you can go there and protest. Pakistan was a part of undivided India.”

‘What permission?’

The police pointed out that no prior permission had been taken for the protests, at which the court said: “What permission? SC [Supreme Court] has said repeated use of [Section] 144 is abuse [referring to the recent decision in a case related to Kashmir].”

When the prosecution said it had only drone images of the gathering in which Mr. Azad allegedly gave inflammatory speeches, the court said: “Do you think our Delhi Police is so backward that they have no recorded evidence? In small matters Delhi Police have recorded evidence, why not in this incident?”.

Mr. Azad’s lawyer, Mehmood Pracha, said he [Mr. Azad] had only been reading the Constitution and speaking against the CAA-National Register of Citizens (NRC) during the protest.

During the proceedings, the Judge said that many people who had protested outside the Parliament had later become leaders and Ministers, observing that Mr. Azad was a budding politician and he had the right to protest.

‘Inside Parliament’

Dr. Lau said: “In the colonial era, the protests were out on the roads. But your protest can be legal, inside the courts. Inside the Parliament, things which should have been said, were not said, and that is why people are out on the streets. We have full right to express our views, but we cannot destroy our country.”

The court observed: “Azad is probably an Ambedkarite. Ambedkar was more closer to the Muslims, Sikhs and basically the repressed class of society... He was a rebel of his own kind. Probably Azad has a vague idea of what he wants to say but probably not able to put it across. If you take up an issue, you do your research. And that is missing.”

The Judge adjourned the hearing till 2 p.m. on Wednesday, after the prosecution requested time to furnish the other First Information Reports registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police against the accused.

Last week, the court had pulled up the Tihar Jail administration for not providing medical treatment to the accused at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Mr. Azad was arrested a day after the protests on December 20, 2019.

56,2020/01/14,"Analysis | JNU violence: Rahul, Kejriwal may be wary of their political image","If politics is about making the right moves at the right time, then what would be its converse? Resorting to the disappearing trick when a particular situation demands the presence of a leader? Well, these questions are being asked of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi’s absence in the aftermath of the January 5 violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

‘Once again’

From social media to TV channels to online portals, Mr. Gandhi’s absence was once again reported as a sign of his being a “non-serious” politician. The term “once again” is being used because the former Congress chief’s absence was also pointed out during the Delhi Police’s crackdown on students of the Jamia Millia Islamia University (JMIU) during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. It was then pointed out that Mr. Gandhi was on pre-scheduled visit to South Korea at the invitation of the government there.

True, during the violence at JNU, Mr. Gandhi did put out a strong tweet and called the attackers “masked thugs”, asserting that the “fascists in control of the nation are afraid of the voices of our brave students”.

Kejriwal, too

But Mr. Gandhi did not go to the JNU campus on his return, which continued to be a matter of discussion for commentators. However, there is near total silence by commentators on why Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was missing from both JMIU as well JNU.

For a man who built his political career on agitations or dharnas or sit-in protests (one of the FM stations in Delhi labelled him ‘Dharna Kumar’), Mr. Kejriwal’s absence was eloquent.

He did tweet on speaking to Delhi’s Lieutenant-Governor about “restoring order”, but there was no ‘signature-style Kejriwal’ attacking the Delhi Police and the Union Government, or visiting JNU to express solidarity with students.

Though there is no official explanation as to why Mr. Kejriwal did not visit one of the most prestigious campuses in the city he is in charge of, reports suggest it could be on the advice of his election strategist Prashant Kishor.

To escape label

The move was being viewed as an attempt to escape from being labelled as an “urban Naxal” and being part of the tukde tukde (‘split up India’) gang.

After all, JNU added to the nation’s and media’s political jargon with word tukde tukde during a protest, when Kanhaiya Kumar was the president of the JNU Students Union (JNUSU) in 2016.

The controversy revolved around a protest over the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, when slogans such as “Bharat tumhare tukde honge hazaar” (‘India will be disintegrated into a thousand pieces’) and “Azaadi” (freedom) were heard.

JNUSU explained that their protest had nothing to do with Afzal Guru and the slogans were about “aazadi” from social problems like poverty and illiteracy. Kanhaiya Kumar also claimed that the protests were carried out by “outsiders” and the slogans heard in the video clips were doctored.

‘Anti-national’

But that didn’t cut much ice as not only did Mr. Kumar have to serve a jail term and get bashed up by lawyers for “leading the tukde tukde gang”, anyone who expressed solidarity with the JNU students were called anti-national.

Mr. Gandhi, reportedly on the advice of an aide who was a former Left activist in JNU, went on to express solidarity and became an honorary member of the “tukde tukde gang”, as the Bharatiya Janata Party put it.

With this background, Mr. Kejriwal perhaps did not wish to risk his political image ahead of the elections. And perhaps that also explains why Mr. Gandhi did not make a visit to the campus even on his return.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/doocou/article26848081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-THGRP-TAHUL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-rahul-kejriwal-may-be-wary-of-their-political-image/article30567655.ece
57,2020/01/14,Judgment in Muzaffarpur shelter home case on January 20,"Judgment in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case is now expected on January 20, as the accused persons on Tuesday claimed that statements of the witnesses were not reliable. The court has sought a response from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the issue within two days.

During the proceedings on Tuesday, lawyers of the main accused, Brajesh Thakur, and the others, questioned the veracity of the testimony of prosecution witnesses.

The submission was made in view of the CBI’s statement in the Supreme Court that 35 girl inmates earlier believed to have been murdered had been found to be alive. The murder allegations were made by some of the girls rescued from the shelter home.

Deferred pronouncement

This is the third time that the pronouncement of verdict has been deferred after it was reserved in October for mid-November last year. The first time it was postponed as the 20 accused could not be brought to the court premises due to a lawyers’ strike. It was then rescheduled as the judge was on leave.

The case pertains to the allegation that at least 34 girl inmates of a shelter home in Muzaffarpur were sexually assaulted. The CBI took over the probe in 2018, following a Supreme Court directive.

The agency recorded statements of the victims and also made several arrests, including that of the main accused. It is alleged that Mr. Thakur would bring in people for sexually assaulting the girl inmates. Some of them were also taken to hotels where they were raped.

In November 2018, the CBI had arrested Shaista Parveen, an alleged close accomplice of Mr. Thakur, on charges of facilitating sexual abuse.

The shelter home was being run by a non-government organisation named ‘Sewa Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti’. The instances of sexual assault were first made public through a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences report.

Legal proceedings in the case were transferred from a Muzaffarpur court to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in the Saket court complex in Delhi on the Supreme Court’s order.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/34rkby/article29559403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/muzaffarpur-shelter-home,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/judgment-in-muzaffarpur-shelter-home-case-on-january-20/article30567572.ece
58,2020/01/14,Congress wants PM Modi to hold Opposition meet on inflation,"Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday that runaway inflation has created a situation of ‘financial emergency,’ while the former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram cautioned the government that the youth and students could explode in anger if unemployment rises and incomes decline.

The Congress also demanded that Mr. Modi convene a meeting of all Opposition parties and share his government’s roadmap to tackle inflation in the next 30 days.

“The circle of incompetent management is complete. Mr. Narendra Modi’s government started in July 2014 with CPI inflation at 7.39 per cent. In December 2019, it was 7.35 per cent. Food inflation stands at 14.12 per cent. Vegetable prices are up 60 per cent. Onion prices are over ₹100 per kg. This is the ‘achhe din’ promised by the BJP,” Mr. Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.

“The nation is engrossed with the anti-CAA, anti-NPR protests. Both present a clear and present danger. The sliding economy is an even greater threat to the country. If unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is the danger of youth and students exploding in anger,” he added.

Mr Gandhi accused the Prime Minister of ‘snatching’ away the poor’s bread and breaking their budget into pieces.

“Back-breaking inflation, life-threatening unemployment and falling GDP have created a state of ‘financial emergency.’ Rise in prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oil and LPG gas has snatched away the poor’s bread and butter. Modi ji has broken the domestic budgets of countrymen into pieces,” he said.

Addressing a press conference on inflation, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Mr. Modi of indulging in politics of hatred and division and asked him to focus on the development of the country. “We demand that the PM should come forward and convene a meeting of all parties and present a roadmap for tackling prices of essential commodities in the next 30 days,” he said.

Data showed that retail inflation rose to about a five-and-half-year high of 7.35 per cent in December 2019, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables, as onions were selling at rates way above normal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/3uc19i/article27012702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RAHUL-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-should-convene-meeting-of-all-parties-on-rising-prices-of-essential-commodities-congress/article30567080.ece

Delhi Police was behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan, Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau said, adding that even if it was, one can protest there peacefully.

Pakistan was once part of undivided India, she said.

The court’s observations came while hearing bail plea of Mr. Azad, who was arrested in a case related to anti-CAA ptotests in old Delhi’s Daryaganj area.

“Inside the Parliament, things which should have been said, were not said and that is why people are out on the streets. We have full right to express our views but we cannot destroy our country.

“You are behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan and even if it was Pakistan, you can go there and protest. Pakistan was a part of undivided India,” the judge said.

The court asked the investigating officer of the police to put on record all the evidence which showed that Mr. Azad was allegedly giving incriminatory speeches at the gathering at Jama Masjid and any law which showed that the gathering there was unconstitutional.

It has put up the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.

During the hearing, police told the court they have only drone images of the gathering as evidence and no other recording.

To this, the judge said, “Do you think Delhi police is so backward that it has no tools to record anything?

“Show me anything or any law that prohibits such gathering... Where is the violence? Who says you cannot protest...have you read the Constitution. It is one’s Constitutional right to protest.”

The court further observed that Mr. Azad, having a law degree, can also protest inside the courts.

It noted that Mr. Azad’s Ambedkarite philosophy probably required more research.

“Azad is probably an Ambedkarite. Ambedkar was more closer to the Muslims, Sikhs and basically the repressed class of the society... He was a rebel of his own kind. Probably Azad has a vague idea of what he wants to say but probably not able to put it across. If you take up an issue, you do your research. And that is missing, ” the court said.

The plea, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, claimed that there was no evidence against the allegations made against Mr. Azad in the FIR and his arrest was illegal.

Mr. Azad’s outfit had called for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the amended Citizenship Act on December 20, without police permission.

The traffic on the highway was closed due to shooting of stones from hillocks overlooking the arterial road at several places in Ramban district, traffic police officials said.

Heavy rains triggered the shooting of stones in Moumpassi, Digdole and Panthiyal areas on Monday afternoon, forcing suspension of the traffic, the official said.

63,2020/01/14,Nirbhaya case: SC throws out curative pleas of 2 death row convicts,"The curative petitions of Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, who were sentenced to death in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, were rejected by a five-judge Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, on Tuesday.

In a three-page order, the Bench concluded, after an in-chamber consideration that began about 1.45 p.m., that there was no merit in their pleas to spare them from the gallows.

“We have gone through the curative petitions and relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra versus Ashok Hurra. Hence, the curative petitions are dismissed,” the Bench held.

Curative is a rare remedy devised by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Rupa Ashok Hurra case in 2002.

A party can take only two limited grounds in a curative petition — one, he was not heard by the court before the adverse judgment was passed, and two, the judge was biased.

A curative plea, which follows the dismissal of review petition, is the last legal avenue open for convicts in the Supreme Court. Sharma was the first among the four convicts to file a curative.

The Bench also rejected their pleas to stay the execution of their death sentence and for oral hearing in open court.

Besides Justice Ramana, the Bench comprised Arun Mishra, Rohinton Nariman, R. Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan.

Mercy plea

Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Mukesh filed a mercy plea before the President, Tihar jail authorities said.

Mukesh, Sharma, Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, and Pawan Gupta, 25, are scheduled to be hanged at 7 a.m. on January 22 in Tihar jail. A Delhi court issued their death warrants on January 7.

According to jail sources, Pawan Jallad from Meerut, who will carry out the hanging, will reach the jail on January 20. He will be given ₹15,000 per execution.

The family of all the four convicts are allowed to meet them twice a week.

On Tuesday, Vinay’s father came to meet him, while Mukesh’s mother keeps visiting him. His mother last met him two days ago, the sources said.

Pawan’s family members too visit him. They last visited him on January 7, they said.

Akshay’s wife last came to meet him in November and since the pronouncement of the execution date, no one from his family has come to meet him.

65,2020/01/14,Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: Supreme Court unhappy with CBI probe report on ‘larger conspiracy’,"The Supreme Court expressed its unhappiness with the status report of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the probe into the larger conspiracy behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in 1991.

Instead of revealing the progress made to unearth the truth, the report filed in the Supreme Court by the investigating agency merely parrots its past reports over the years.

“We are not happy with the report,” a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta said on Tuesday.

The court called for the presence of a senior law officer, an Additional Solicitor General to appear and kept the case on hold to be taken up later.

After half-an-hour, the case came up again. This time, Justice Rao expressed the court’s dissatisfaction without mincing words.

“There is no difference between this report and the ones filed before. Everything said is quite the same as before... going to Bangkok or something... What we want to know is what progress has been made (in the investigation) in the past two years at least,” Justice Rao observed.

Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict A.G. Perarivalan, submitted that the CBI Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA), probing the larger conspiracy behind the killing, was yet to conclude its investigation pertaining to the origin and make of the bomb.

The Bench allowed Perarivalan’s lawyers to peruse the CBI report in the courtroom. The report was filed in a sealed cover. The court finally ordered the CBI to file a fresh report detailing the work done. The case is listed on January 28.

Perarivalan, who is in mid-forties, has spent about a quarter of a century inside jail serving his life imprisonment. He was 19 at the time of his arrest. Perarivalan has sought an order from the court to stay his life sentence till the MDMA probe into the larger conspiracy is completed. He has argued that CBI has still not been able to question Nixon alias Suren, one among the 21 suspects the MDMA is waiting to investigate, who allegedly knows about the making of the bomb.

He contended his role in the alleged crime taken to the maximum would be that of supplying two nine-volt batteries without the knowledge of what it was going to be used for. He said his confession under the lapsed TADA to a police officer was not valid evidence. The Tamil Nadu government had in 2014 already taken the stand to release him forthwith.

“Further it is essential to state that D.R. Karthikeyan, who was the head of the Special Investigating Team (SIT) CBI, has made statements that the IED was locally made in Sri Lanka. The internal evidence shows that the nine-volt battery was soldered with the IED. If that being the case then in all chance that it could be said that the alleged nine-volt batteries given by the petitioner was not at all used in the IED,” Perarivalan has argued.

He also banked on a coded wireless message from Sivarasan, the mastermind, to Pottu Amman in Sri Lanka, that only he (Sivarasan), Subha and the suicide bomber, Dhanu, knew of the conspiracy to kill Rajiv Gandhi.

‘Grave prejudice’

Alleging that “a grave prejudice” has been caused on him, Perarivalan said he was a “19-year-old boy when his mother handed over to the CBI and now he is 45 years old, lost all his prime youth in prison that too in death row under solitary confinement for more than 16 years”. He said his “aged mother and father are waiting for their only son to join at least in the last years of their life”.

Describing his case as “unique” and relating the harsh circumstances under which he pursued an education in prison, he said his health has taken a severe beating from the effects of “death row syndrome”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/8clz2n/article14285993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rajiv-minutes-before,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-supreme-court-unhappy-with-cbi-probe-report-on-larger-conspiracy/article30565248.ece

68,2020/01/14,"Trump likely to visit India at the end of February, say sources","Security and logistics teams from Washington are expected in Delhi this week to prepare for a possible visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, multiple sources have confirmed to The Hindu. The visit, which has not yet been announced, would bring the U.S. President to India a year after he declined an invitation to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations, and will go ahead at the end of February as long as dates don’t need to be changed to accommodate the impeachment process in the U.S. Senate.

Sources said the decision to visit India, at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation, was discussed during a telephone call between the leaders on January 7. According to the sources, Mr. Trump is “keen” to visit early in the year, ahead of elections in November, and both sides are working towards a visit in the last week of February. India’s Ambassador to Washington, who is now the Foreign Secretary-designate Harsh Shringla, met Mr. Trump before returning to Delhi, and will begin preparations from the Indian side for the visit.

With just weeks to go to the proposed visit, New Delhi is understood to have intimated its choice of Mr. Shringla's replacement, and Washington is expected to expedite the 'agreement' for his appointment.

Trade deal

Among the agreements they hope to wrap up is a trade deal, that has been pending since November 2018, when talks went into a standstill. In June 2019, the U.S. cancelled India’s preferential export ‘GSP’ status, and the government hopes Mr. Trump will announce a revocation of that decision during the visit. India is also expected to announce further investments in the U.S., and a substantial increase in American oil imports.

In particular, a major deal on civil aviation is being discussed, the officials said, adding that other loose ends, like issues with the data localisation bill, e-commerce regulations, granting U.S. airport ground handling access, all of which were part of U.S. demands have already been resolved.

A slew of senior officials, including U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells and Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, are in Delhi to attend the Raisina Dialogue, while others are expected to begin talks on preparations.

Diplomatic boost

Mr. Trump’s visit will be a diplomatic boost for both leaders and will likely coincide with the U.S. Congress’s impeachment process, and the date of the visit, currently scheduled around February 24 may have to be shifted to accommodate the Senate vote on his impeachment motion. On Wednesday, the U.S. House is expected to vote to send its articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump to the Senate, which will be only the third such impeachment trial for a U.S. President in history.

The visit will also come as Mr. Modi faces some of the largest protests his government has encountered over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as well as international criticism over the government’s continuing restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir. U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster’s decision to travel to Kashmir as part of a delegation of envoys last week was seen as a move to reach out to the government on the issue, even as a U.S. House resolution criticising India on Kashmir, that has now received 36 co-sponsors, could be taken up in the U.S. House.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/va2w8h/article29487090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trump-likely-to-visit-delhi-in-the-end-of-february-say-sources/article30564430.ece
69,2020/01/14,Youth may explode in anger: Chidambaram on unemployment,"Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Tuesday attacked the Modi government over the state of the economy, saying if unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is a danger of youth and students “exploding in anger”.

“The nation is engrossed with the anti-CAA, anti-NPR protests. Both present a clear and present danger,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

The sliding economy is an even greater threat to the country, the former finance minister said in a series of tweets.

“If unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is the danger of youth and students exploding in anger,” he said.

Mr. Chidambaram also attacked the government over the rising consumer price index (CPI) inflation.

Retail inflation jumped sharply to 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI’s comfort level, mainly due to high food prices, government data showed on Monday.

The retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 2.11 per cent in December 2018 and 5.54 per cent in November 2019.

“The circle of incompetent management is complete. Mr Narendra Modi’s government started in July 2014 with CPI inflation at 7.39 per cent. In December 2019, it was 7.35 per cent,” Chidambaram said.

“Food inflation stands at 14.12 per cent. Vegetable prices are up 60 per cent. Onion prices are over Rs 100 per kg.

Azmi was born Athar Husain Rizvi on January 14, 1919, in a Zamindar family in what is today the Azmargh district of Uttar Pradesh, India.

He wrote his first ghazal ‘Itna to zindagi mein kisi ki khalal pade’ at the age of eleven, and his first lyric for a film was for 'Buzdil' directed by Shahid Lateef in 1952. He wrote his last song for an unreleased 1997 film, 'Chand Grahan'.

At the age of 19 he joined the Communist Party and was invited by Communist leader Sajjad Zaheer to Bombay to write for the paper 'Qaumi Jung'.

Azmi won numerous awards for his contributions, including the National Award and Filmfare Award for the screenplay and dialogue of M.S. Sathyu’s 1974 film ‘Garm Hava’. He also received the Padma Shri Award for Literature and Education and the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

Azmi wrote about farmer suicides and their rights, about women’s rights and communal harmony. One of Azmi's famous poems, “Aurat,” advocated for women’s equality. This was one of the causes he championed throughout his lifetime.

He spent the last twenty years of his life in Mijwan, a small village in Uttar Pradesh where he was born. There he set up an NGO Mijwan Welfare Society that runs the Kaifi Azmi Higher Secondary School for girls, the Kaifi Azmi Inter-College for girls, the Kaifi Azmi Computer Training Centre and the Kaifi Azmi Embroidery and Sewing Centre for Women.

71,2020/01/14,Opposition unity important for protests: Amartya Sen,"Days after demanding that the amended Citizenship Act be scrapped, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen on January 13 stressed the importance of opposition unity to carry out any protest for a cause.

However, he said even in the absence of opposition unity, protests can continue.

The economist was answering journalists here over the countrywide CAA-NPR-NRC protests.

“For any kind of protest, opposition unity is important. Then protests become easier. Unity is important if the protest is for a proper cause,” Sen told journalists here on Monday (January 13) night.

“But even if unity is not there, then that doesn’t mean we will stop protesting. As I said, unity makes protest easier but if unity is not there still we have to move on and do whatever is necessary,” Mr. Sen said.

Earlier, speaking at Nabanita Deb Sen Memorial Lecture, the economist said viewing oppositional reasoning as quarrelsome would be a big mistake.

“It is necessary to emphasise the subtleties of the innovative forces of the opposition... We need to know more about what I am protesting about. The head must also join with the heart in protest,” Mr. Sen said in his speech.

“When there seems to be a big mistake in the Constitution or human rights, there will surely be reasons to protest,” Mr. Sen said.

Deb Sen, who passed away at her Kolkata residence last November, was the economist’s first wife.

A few days ago, Mr. Sen, who has been critical of the Narendra Modi-led Union government, said the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act should be scrapped.

“I think the CAA must be scrapped because it cannot be an Act ... That’s the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution,” the Nobel laureate had said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-unity-important-for-protests-amartya-sen/article30562806.ece
72,2020/01/14,Economist Amit Bhaduri gives up JNU position in protest,"As a sign of protest against the “throttling of dissent” at Jawaharlal Nehru University, economist Amit Bhaduri has given up his status as professor emeritus there. His move comes in the wake of attacks on students and teachers at the university.

In an open letter on Monday, Dr. Bhaduri said he had learnt with “increasing disgust” how Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar’s handling of situations at JNU had “led to its steady deterioration paving the way for its intellectual disintegration”.

“It would be immoral on my part without registering my protest to remain a silent observer in this larger, sinister scheme of throttling dissent which is unfolding now at the University.”

Dr. Bhaduri, who joined the university as a young professor in 1973 and left in 2001, noted that he had witnessed many instances of student unrest and even a temporary shutdown of teaching during his tenure.

“What is different now is not only incompetence of handling of situations by the authorities, but a deliberate attempt to throttle the free, and lively atmosphere of debate and discussion for which JNU was known all over the country,” he wrote. “You seem determined on imprinting your administration’s narrow-minded world view, and shut all other windows of ideas to the students.”

Dr. Bhaduri noted that returning the honour bestowed on him was largely a symbolic act of protest as the administration had already evicted him from his room at the University.

“Along with some other emeritus professors, I have already been locked out several months ago from the room allotted to me in JNU (with books and some personal effects still in it),” he wrote.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xp0byk/article30562802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMIT-BHADURI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/economist-amit-bhaduri-gives-up-jnu-position-in-protest/article30562803.ece

“In my lifetime, I have always respected and honoured tribals and Bhils. For this condemnable act, those responsible should surely be punished, so that it is not repeated in the future,” Mr. Nath wrote on Twitter on Monday.

In the preliminary examination, one of the questions, based on a passage on the tribe, read: “The primary reason for the criminal nature of Bhils is”, with the four options as “inability to pay liabilities”, “working with honesty”, “carrying out immoral work” and “migrating from villages”.

“I have done several works for the betterment and uplift of this category,” wrote Mr. Nath. “I have been connected to this category since the beginning. Even my government is committed to their uplift and has been continuously working for it.”

Terming such reference to the tribe in the question paper unfortunate, State Minister for Forests Umang Singhar said, “The community from which brave people like Tantia Bhil come, such comments are questionable. For including questions like this, a case under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act should be registered against the officials who set the question paper.”

This not just indicated a lack of discipline among officials, said Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Gopal Bhargava, but was a grave affront to B.R.

76,2020/01/14,JNU faculty members putting out feelers to other institutions,"JNU’s loss may become IIT’s gain. Senior faculty members at Jawaharlal Nehru University, faced with a “deteriorating situation”, have expressed interest in moving across the road to the Indian Institute of Technology, according to an email sent by IIT-Delhi Director V. Ramgopal Rao.

In the December 19 email to his department heads, Dr. Rao encouraged them to facilitate such lateral hires in the case of senior JNU faculty members with distinguished records.

“I am receiving many feelers from senior JNU faculty [members] showing a willingness to move to IIT Delhi, considering the deteriorating situation in JNU,” said the email. “I am told that some of them are also applying to other institutions given the impression that IIT Delhi doesn’t encourage lateral movement into higher positions. It will be a pity if we lose out on such good people because of any of these reasons/perception.”

In his email, Dr. Rao added that he would leave it to the judgement of the department heads how they wished to deal with the situation, emphasising that the “Institute will be very open to recruitment of senior faculty [members] who have a distinguished track record.”

The Hindu has confirmed the authenticity of the email.

Ramakrishna Ramaswamy made the move across the road in the last year, taking the post of a visiting professor at IIT-Delhi after retiring from a 32-year stint at JNU. Dr. Ramaswamy, who had been on the short-list for JNU Vice-Chancellor in 2016, says the current crisis has affected students and teachers and hampered research activities.

“For good research, you need a stable environment. With the kind of upheavals going on now, research in the life sciences would be severely affected,” he said. The shutting down of buildings would especially harm experiments using live tissue, he said. While the JNU is known for its humanities and social science research, it owes much of its high ranking to excellence in the sciences.

Dr. Ramaswamy added that he still supervised Ph.D students at the JNU, who come from poor socio-economic backgrounds, meaning they have been hit hard by the hostel fee increase that caused the current crisis.

A senior professor at IIT-Delhi says that when senior academics wish to change jobs, they do not apply for positions. Instead, they put out feelers. Although IIT-Delhi, like many other institutions, often focusses on young people for new appointments, the experience and expertise of senior JNU faculty members in the sciences will make them valuable hires, he says.

Ironically enough, JNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar, accused of precipitating the crisis, made the move in the opposite direction. He was an electrical engineering professor at IIT-Delhi before being appointed to the top job at JNU, and still continues to teach there.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/arepn5/article30562423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNUTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-faculty-members-putting-out-feelers-to-other-institutions/article30562381.ece

Among the cancelled visits was that of Deputy Foreign Minister Shahriar Alam, who was expected to take part at the ‘Raisina Dialogue’, organised by the Ministry of External Affairs.

Dwaraka Tirumala Rao seeking lifting of the orders and action against the officials who mistreated protesters recently.

Mr. Srinivas posted the letter on his official twitter account on Tuesday. “Proclaiming orders of Section 144 are unwarranted, abuse of law and irrational and I strongly condemn such unlawful, illegal and void orders and they are liable to be withdrawn immediately,” he said.

“The people have a right to speak their views and express their feelings but freedom of speech and expression of rights are infringed due to the said orders.

You may kindly inform the reasons and also furnish the substantial material for proclaiming the orders and also take stringent action against the police who mistreated women at the mahila rally,” Mr. Srinivas said.

He also alleged that women protests were confined in police stations up to 7 pm and were forced to reveal their caste before they were released.

81,2020/01/14,Police extends Sec. 144 in Vijayawada up to Feb. 29,"At a time when there is a huge public outcry against imposition of Section 144 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) and Section 30 of the Police Act by the police in the event of any agitation against relocation of the capital, the city police on Tuesday extended Section 144 (2) up to February 29, that is, for 45 days in the city commissionerate limits.

In a press release by the Office of Commissioner of Police, it was stated that the rules would be enforced as a precautionary measure to ensure public safety, avoid law and order issues and untoward incidents.

“When Section 144 (2) is in force gathering of five or more persons, roaming about with sticks and stones in the commissionerate limits are prohibited and action will be taken against those who violate the rules,” the release stated.

The action comes days after petitions have been filed in the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the Supreme Court contending that Section 144 could not be used as a tool to suppress legitimate expressions, opinions and grievances in a democracy.

On the other hand, Section 30 of the Police Act is currently in force in the city. It has been imposed for three months from January 1.

As per Section 30, public meetings, rallies and other such programmes without the permission of the police are prohibited.

Earlier, Section 144 (2) was imposed for 46 days from December 1 to January 15.

83,2020/01/14,Pawan announces ‘crucial’ meet with BJP,"Strengthening speculations of an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jana Sena Party (JSP) chief Pawan Kalyan has announced “an important meeting” between the two parties in the city scheduled for Thursday (January 16) after which, he said, the course of action would be revealed.

After meeting BJP leaders in New Delhi, Mr. Pawan Kalyan returned to the State and visited party activists who were injured in an attack allegedly carried out by activists of ruling YSR Congress Party in Kakinada recently.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said: “Yesterday, I met the national-level leaders and apprised them of the problems being faced by Andhra Pradesh. We asked the Centre in a strong voice that it focus on the situation in the State. Soon a crucial meeting will be held in Vijayawada after which details will be revealed.”

“The main agenda of the Delhi tour was State issues, including withdrawal of investments and agitations by farmers in the capital. We have been in touch with the Central government in the past few days and as soon as we got a call, we went to Delhi and apprised the leaders of the situation here. They also felt that the developments are not good for the State,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan said.

‘Centre’s help sought’

“We also discussed the future strategy in line with the Prime Minister’s objectives and asked the Centre to extend help to the State,” he added.

84,2020/01/14,"Give up capital shifting idea, Sujana tells Jagan","Sujana Chowdary, Rajya Sabha member from the BJP, on Tuesday urged Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to retain Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh, failing which, he warned, it would have very strong and drastic financial effect even on future generations.

In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister, Mr. Chowdary said the YSR Congress Party government should take note of the fact that the advisory committee constituted to suggest the location of the new capital chose Amaravati because of its central location and accessibility to all the 13 districts of the State, good road and rail connectivity, its proximity with the Gannavaram airport, availability of drinking water and its ancient historical ‘Satavahana dynasty’ link.

He reminded that all parties, TDP, YSRCP and the BJP, had unanimously approved the ‘Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014’, which came into force on December 30 of 2014. This was followed by the government drawing up a ‘master plan’ for development of Amaravati consisting of the Government City, Justice City, Finance City, Knowledge City, Electronic City, Health City, Sports City, Media City, and Tourism City.

Subsequently, said the BJP leader, Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the new capital city. He reminded that when Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy assumed the office, 62 projects at an estimated cost of ₹52,837 crore were under progress. Of them tenders were finalised for projects worth ₹42,170 crore.

Projects

But the YSRCP government brought all projects to a grinding halt without specifying any reason. Mr. Chowdary said the idea of shifting the capital from Amaravati at this stage defies all logic and can have far-reaching consequences, both legally and financially. Thus, the Chief Minister should reconsider his stand in the larger interests of the people in the State.

He said if the YSRCP government believed that insider trading took place to “corner 4,075 acres of land in Amaravati”, it was free to order an investigation and punish the guilty.

Pointing to the fact that a capital is the principal seat of administration and thus should include the Legislature, the Secretariat, the Raj Bhavan, the Judiciary and residential and other infrastructure facilities, he said Amaravati had functional buildings for all of them.

He said the TDP government had entered into agreements with the farmers, entrepreneurs and contractors and it would be legally binding on the successive governments.

Compensation burden

The BJP leader cautioned that stakeholders like who had purchased Amaravati bonds, contractors engaged in execution of projects, entrepreneurs and institutes who purchased lands in Amaravati could claim compensation which was likely to work out to a whopping ₹2 lakh crore. Thus, in the event of shifting the capital, the government may have to pay around ₹4 lakh crore towards compensation to various stakeholders, resulting in serious financial crisis in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/give-up-capital-shifting-idea-sujana-tells-jagan/article30568973.ece
85,2020/01/14,Capital: Naidu sticks to demand for referendum,"Telugu Desam Party national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has challenged the Jagan Mohan Reddy government to face elections afresh if it is confident that the three capitals proposal is correct. He has reiterated that he will quit politics if the people voted YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) back to power.

Connecting the Sankranti, harvest festival, with the ongoing agitation against shifting of the capital to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati, Mr. Naidu chose to burn the copies of the reports of G.N. Rao committee and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the ‘bhogi’ mantalu (bonfire) in the city on Tuesday.

Farmers and Save Amavarati activists celebrated what they called Amaravati Sankranti and burnt the copies of the two reports.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Naidu said that shifting of capital was an event as devastating as a tsunami. Any political party supporting the proposal would be washed away in the tsunami wave. Amaravati was equidistant from all places in the State. Except for YSR Congress Party, everyone felt that Amaravati should be the sole capital of the State. Let the State government conduct a referendum on three capitals concept, he said, adding, “the State government should face the election if it were confident that its decision is correct. I will quit politics if the people supported the YSR Congress.”

Shifting a few offices would not lead to the development of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. Nowhere in the world, a concept of three capitals existed. Andhra Pradesh has become a laughing stock with the government’s decision, he said.

Amaravati Sankranti

At various places in Krishna and Guntur districts, the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC organised ‘Amaravati Sankranti’ on Tuesday. The TDP leaders joined them in the protest on the first day of the three-day festivities.

Mr. Naidu, who used to celebrate Sankranti festival in his native village Naravaripalle in Chittoor district every year, reached here in early hours to participate in the protest.

The JAC members, holding placards, raised slogans against the government’s plans. Recalling that he used to celebrate Sankranti at his native place every year, Mr. Naidu called upon the people to contribute their might to protect the historic importance of Amaravati.

Mr. Aejaz Ahmed, who pursues Ph.D. in JNU, said the the JNUSU was fighting tooth and nail against proposed steep increase in the college fee from ₹10 to ₹2,500 and was trying to talk to Vice-Chancellor Mamidala Jagdish Kumar on the issue, but he was shying away from meeting democratically elected student leaders on fee hike issue.

Referring to the JNUSU fight against fee hike, he said at a time when its leaders were participating in the peace rally at Sabarmati Tea Point on January 5 evening, 40 persons of ABVP from outside JNU campus entered the premises right under the nose of the Delhi police and unleashed the violence in girls hostel and other places.

Despite getting proofs from the sting operations of media outlets and the video records of the victims, the Deli police refused to investigate properly and did not register an FIR against the ABVP ‘goons’, he alleged. The former JNUSU office-bearer said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh was beaten up and an FIR was lodged against her ‘alleged violence on the campus’, but no action was taken against the perpetrators.

96,2020/01/14,"9.7% of human trafficking cases in country are from A.P., says report","As many as 353 women had been trapped in the clutches of prostitution and trafficking from the State in 2018.

The Crime in India-2018 report released by the National Crime Records Bureau on January 9 shows that 353 women were trafficked with the purpose of ‘sexual exploitation for prostitution in Andhra Pradesh in 2018’, and except two, the age of all the victims was above 18.

Twenty-one women were trafficked for forced labour. Eight women were trafficked for the purpose of ‘domestic service’.

In Andhra Pradesh, 240 cases of human trafficking were registered in 2018, which was 9.7% of the total cases in the country. In Telangana, 335 women were trafficked for prostitution in 2018.

The police had filed charge-sheets against 487 for their role in human trafficking but the conviction rate is 11.7.

Challenges

“Those rescued from prostitution are facing a web of challenges in leading a normal life. Finding someone who will forgive their past becomes difficult. In many cases, own families do not provide the support the victims need,” said B. Keerthi, president of the Vijayawada-based NGO Vasavya Mahila Mandali.

Referring to many case studies which she attended in the State, Ms. Keerthi observed, “The majority of the victims were not aware that they would be landing in prostitution for their survival as the traffickers trap them with lucrative options. Bringing the rescued victims to normalcy from the mental trauma they were subjected to is a challenge.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/97-of-human-trafficking-cases-in-country-are-from-ap-says-report/article30562429.ece
97,2020/01/14,"Biometric attendance likely in colleges, varsities from June","Bunking classes in degree colleges may be ‘a thing of past’. Very soon, students have to ‘put their thumb impressions’ during the college hours. The faculty and staff will also mark their attendance with the biometric system. The State government is contemplating introducing biometric attendance in degree colleges and universities as part of its endeavour to launch reforms and ‘streamline higher education’ in the State.

According to information, the inspection teams were visiting the degree colleges and universities to assess and examine the educational standards, including attendance, infrastructural facilities etc. As per the preliminary reports, it was found that the attendance ‘is very poor’ in the higher education institutions. The admissions to various courses are not matching the sanctioned strength and were as low as possible. In some cases, the admissions were mere 5% of the sanctioned strength in 151 government degree colleges. “Most pathetic situation is that even those students were not attending the classes regularly.”

The problem of lecturers and professors not taking classes for days together is a matter of concern. In universities, there have been instances where the faculty was also found to be abstaining from taking classes. It was found that a few professors have been deputing their research scholars to take the classes. “Keeping in view the ground realities, it has been decided to introduce biometric attendance,” said a senior official, who did not want to be quoted.

Model State

The reforms in higher educational institutions will start with the biometric attendance system, which will come into force from the next academic year – June 2020. The system will ensure that students do not skip classes and arrive and leave college/university on time, the official says.

From full fee reimbursement to Jagananna Vasati Deevena (₹20,000 per head), the government has been spending ‘huge amount’ on education with the objective of making Andhra Pradesh a model State in the education sector. The endeavour would be to revamp the system in the State and bring it on a par with developed countries. The students should be employable and have to come out of colleges with flying colours, the official feels.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/biometric-attendance-likely-in-colleges-varsities-from-june/article30562391.ece

101,2020/01/14,Flat owner accuses CB of tweaking statement,"As the drumbeat of protests over the ‘non-prosecution’ of elected municipal officials responsible for the Maradu fiasco continued to intensify, at least one evicted flat owner has accused the Crime Branch (CB) of having misreported her statement purportedly to shield the prime political movers ‘liable’ for the illegal building scheme from criminal charges.

The accuser, a 73-year-old woman, had invested the bulk of life savings in an apartment in the now-demolished Alfa Serene Apartment Complex in Maradu. The CB had recorded her statement subsequently.

“They (CB) were over-eager to have us blame the builder. But my mother refused. She said she had inspected the building permit before the purchase and stated that she had a complaint only against those who had issued it.

Permit

“They wrote that down and she signed it. But, when they (CB) send us the typed draft, there was no mention of who issued the permit. Only accusations against the builder, which she never made,” her son told The Hindu.

Subsequently, the senior citizen shot off a letter of protest to the investigating officer Jossy Cherian.

She said she was not in ‘full agreement’ with several statements the CB had attributed to her.

She said the investigators had ‘omitted’ pertinent parts of her deposition.

She warned the CB against using the draft statement.

She demanded the agency send her a new draft that reflected her account accurately.

More complaints

Several more disposed apartment owners have reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing CB inquiry and were likely to seek legal recourse.

Their fear that the CB might shift the blame for the mammoth fraud from municipal officials and solely to builders was reflected in senior advocate Dushyant Dave’s statement in the Supreme Court on Monday.

Mr. Dave, appearing for some evicted residents, pointed out that though the “majesty of the law had prevailed” in the demolition of flats that violated coastal regulation norms in Maradu, there was no sign of any legal action against the officials liable for clearing the illegal building projects.

104,2020/01/14,Sit for long at your peril,"When you spend hours sitting in front of the computer reading or working and then relax later at home in front of television bingewatching Netflix, do you realise the amount of time your body remains immobile?

In fact, till you shut down your computer and get up, you would not have realised how hungry you are, how your muscles ache or that you badly needed a bathroom break.

Even if you are someone who eats healthy most of the time and hits the gym regularly, prolonged periods of sitting and inactivity affects your body in many ways, even down to the molecular level, raising the risk of chronic diseases, according to experts.

A study of 1.2 million people from 54 countries showed that the sitting-related all-cause mortality rate was 3.8%. The latest issue of the American Journal of Public Health suggests that prolonged sitting increases the risk of premature death and some chronic diseases by 10-20%. Excessive sitting is a lethal activity and so get up and move, before your chair kills you.

James Levine, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Mayo Clinic-Arizona State University Obesity Solutions Initiative, had been doing a series of experiments since early 2000 to understand why some people put on more weight than some others even when they all ate the very same food in the same amount.

Dr. Levine later said that he had hoped to discover some magic metabolic factor which made some people put on weight.

But what he discovered was that the people who did not gain weight were the ones who were moving frequently and unconsciously. They were either taking the stairs or running to catch a bus or busy doing household chores and generally, moving around more.

The NEAT factor

In fact, they benefited from the non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). NEAT is the energy expended for everything one does when one is not sleeping or exercising – even bending down to pick up a paper or getting up to get a cup of coffee. Every little movement counts and the more your NEAT, fitter you are.

Low NEAT is linked to diabetes, heart diseases and cancer.

New smoking

Dr. Levine coined the tag line, “Sitting is the new smoking”, in his acclaimed book, Get Up! Why Your Chair is Killing You and What You Can Do About It, published in 2014.

People should understand that while exercise benefits one, it cannot counteract the effects of what happens when the body is inactive for long hours.

When you sit for long hours without moving your muscles, “the electrical activity in the muscles drops, leading to a cascade of harmful metabolic effects. Your calorie-burning rate immediately plunges to about one per minute, insulin effectiveness drops, the enzymes responsible for breaking down lipids and triglycerides and clearing it out of the blood stream plunges, leading to a drop in the levels of the good cholesterol, HDL... all of which raises the risk of diabetes and heart diseases” according to a researcher in NewYork Times.

Long, uninterrupted hours in front of a computer could also stress the neck and shoulders and cause stiffness in the hip flexors.

That said, the desk-bound can take heart in the latest research studies, which say that while sitting is not good for your heart, not all sitting are equal!

A new study from the University of Central Florida, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which studied the lifestyle and health patterns of 3,600 individuals over eight years, says that it is slouching in front of television without moving at all and not sitting desk-bound which is risky. Possibly because TV-watching is linked with other bad habits like snacking and alcohol consumption, apart from disruptions in sleep patterns, which is directly linked to heart diseases.

Walk to coffee machine

Not all of us can be lucky to have an ‘active” workplace, so the best thing to do would be to redesign the way one works so that more movement is encouraged. You could get up and walk to the water dispenser or coffee machine or walk while talking on phone.

Get up and walk over to your colleague in the next booth rather than call him/her on the intercom. Set a reminder every half hour when you can get up and do a stretch.

Take stairs instead of the lift and park your vehicle farthest from the office entrance.

Even if your job calls for more sitting, make sure you move more and often.

105,2020/01/14,Land acquisition back on track,"After much delay, the process of land acquisition for the construction of a bridge across the Pampa river connecting Kavalam and Thattassery in Kuttanad seems to be finally back on track.

According to sources, a private agency that conducted a socio-environmental impact assessment for the project will submit its report to the Revenue Department on Wednesday. As much as 185 cents of land in possession of 46 landowners in 68 survey numbers will have to be acquired for the project.

Officials say that once the report is received, they would start the process of finalising compensation to the landowners.

Consent letters

G. Harikrishnan, convener, Kavalam Palam Sampadaka Samiti, says that almost all landowners have handed over their consent letters. The authorities should now expedite the process and acquire the land, Mr. Harikrishnan says.

In 2016, the State government allocated ₹30 crore for the construction of the bridge and approach road. The estimate was later revised to ₹52.5 crore following changes made in the design.

The original plan was to acquire the land through direct negotiated purchase. However, some landowners demanded a change in the alignment.

As the alignment was fixed by the Inland Waterways Authority, officials said it could not be changed and it effectively ended the move to acquire land through negotiated purchase.

Following this, in November 2018 the Revenue Department announced that the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act would be invoked to acquire land for the construction of the bridge.

No follow-up

The landowners were given time till December 1, 2018 to hand over the consent letters. However, the authorities failed to take follow-up action. It was after local residents petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan the process gained some momentum.

Once constructed, the bridge and approach road will be 396.21 metres long. The bridge and walkway together will have a width of 11 metres.

The opening of the bridge will help reduce the distance between Alappuzha and Kottayam by around 9 km along with opening the doors of development to the remote areas of Kuttanad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-acquisition-back-on-track/article30569848.ece

112,2020/01/14,Time to stand united against CAA: CM,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has reiterated his call for a united protest against the implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizen (NRC).

Addressing a constitution protection rally and public meeting here on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said the people in Kerala need not get panicked as the government would not implement the CAA and NRC. The State would not participate in the NPR (National Population Register) too as it was a first step towards preparation of the NRC.

Expressing his disappointment over the division in the Opposition in cooperating with the LDF in the anti-CAA protest, Mr. Vijayan said it was time for a united struggle against efforts to divide people on the basis of religion.

“Some people asked whether the State government has the authority to protest against the CAA. The Assembly has all the authority to oppose any policy which are anti-constitutional,” he said.

The united stand taken by the State and the resolution passed unanimously by the Assembly had become a role model for other States. Leaders, even from outside the country, were congratulating the State for taking such a phenomenal step, he said.

‘‘Prime Minister Narendra Modi is lying on the NPR and NRC. When Mr. Modi says there is no connection between the NPR and NRC, Home Minster Amit Shah makes it clear that after the NPR they will go for NRC. It reveals the hidden agenda of the RSS to eliminate a certain group of people. The people have realised it.’’ Mr. Vijayan said.

“The country has been witnessing unprecedented protests. These protests are spontaneous. People from all communities and institutions are willingly coming out to join the protest. This kind of protest had happened during the Independence struggle. The CAA and NRC affect the basic secular principle of the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the RSS would not tolerate any differences of opinion. Whoever protested would be eliminated. The attack on institutions, including the Jawaharlal Nehru University JNU and Jamila Millia, was an example, the Chief Minister said.

Addressing the meeting, Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musaliyar said the CAA and the NRC were part of RSS agenda of making not a Hindu Rashtra alone, but a country for a certain section of Hindus.

“Muslims are not part of any anti-national activities. The community has hugely contributed to the Independence struggle,” he said.

113,2020/01/14,Hectic days ahead for higher secondary students,"Higher secondary teachers and parents are peeved over the day-long schedule fixed for the model examinations for Plus Two and Plus One students next month.

They claimed that the students would be put to hardship as they would have to spend five hours a day writing the examination for five days between February 14 and 20.

Joshi Antony, president, Kerala Aided Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association (KAHSTA), said on Tuesday that as the model examinations would be preceded by practical examinations for science and commerce students from February 5, it would turn out to be a hectic schedule.

Long haul

The students would have to write the examination in one subject for two hours and 15 minutes in the morning and two hours and 45 minutes in the afternoon.

“It is unfortunate that it is happening a time when the attempt is to reduce the burden of examinations on students,” he pointed out. Mr. Antony said that though the model examinations were supposed to replicate the pattern of board examinations, it was not happening so this time.

Earlier, it used to take at least a week or more to complete the examination process, he said. The rationale given by the authorities is that the higher secondary and Class 10 examinations are being held together from this year and the model examinations would have to be completed before that.

Functionaries of the KAHSTA have conveyed their apprehensions to K. Jeevan Babu, Director of General Education.

It is also learnt that the parents and students are planning to seek legal recourse and approach the Kerala State Human Rights Commission and the Kerala State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hectic-days-ahead-for-higher-secondary-students/article30568746.ece

116,2020/01/14,KSRTC terminal work begins at Palakkad,"The construction work of a new KSRTC terminal building began here on Tuesday, after several disputes and delays that lasted nearly five years.

Passengers reaching the KSRTC depot here had a tough time, as there were hardly any facilities for them since the existing buildings were demolished for construction of a new terminal.

KSRTC officials said the first phase of the construction would have bus bays, waiting rooms for passengers and KSRTC workers, a toilet complex, and a canteen. The construction is being done at a cost of ₹7.2 crore. The first phase will be completed with ₹5 crore from the asset development fund of Shafi Parambil, MLA.

Assistant Transport Officer T.A. Ubaid, controlling inspector P.S. Mahesh, and representatives of KSRTC management and unions were present at the work inauguration on Tuesday.

The bus waiting shed on the eastern side of the depot, which was demolished for the terminal construction, will be erected near the inter-State bus terminal. Buses to Coimbatore and Guruvayur will be shifted to this side.

KSRTC officials said that they had sought the permission of the Municipal authorities for parking the buses at Municipal Town Bus stand at night. They said the diesel bunk at the depot would be shifted in accordance with the progress of the work.

The front side of the depot will be covered with sheets. The half of the bypass road by the side of the KSRTC stand and the inter-State terminal will be used for conducting daily services. A meeting to be convened by the MLA will chalk out final plans of traffic diversions to ease the terminal work. Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) has been awarded the contract for construction of the terminal building. ULCCS officials said the work would be completed in 15 months.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksrtc-terminal-work-begins-at-palakkad/article30568536.ece
117,2020/01/14,Poorly faring engineering colleges to be kept on a tight leash,"Falling standards and deficiencies in several engineering colleges in the State has prompted the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) to mull stringent measures including withdrawing affiliation and imposing restrictions on sanctioning new courses.

A recent academic audit that was undertaken by the university had thrown up a measure of the lack of facilities in many colleges. The colleges were classified on a scale of 1-5 (1 referring to below average and 5 excellent) based on various parameters. As many as 37 engineering colleges figured in the ‘average’ category (two points), while 10 institutions fell in the lowest band.

While most of these were self-financing colleges, two institutions run by the Cooperative Academy of Professional Education (CAPE) and the Centre for Continuing Education Kerala (CCEK) also fell in the former grouping.

While none of the 142 affiliated colleges were rated as ‘excellent’, most government and aided colleges figured in the ‘very good’ category, having secured four points. All others were graded as ‘good’ with three points.

The colleges that fared poorly in the audit were found to flout various guidelines laid down by the AICTE including the teacher-student ratio of 1:20. Besides, only a few among the teaching faculty were found to satisfy the mandatory qualification of M.Tech that is required for the job. These institutions were also found to lack in infrastructural facilities, including laboratory equipment.

The Academic Council of the varsity decided to seek explanation from the institutions that performed poorly in the audit. Colleges that did not possess the prescribed faculty qualification index will be directed to address shortcomings immediately.

A delegation of university officials led by the Vice Chancellor will soon inspect the 10 ‘below average’ colleges. The council also decided that colleges that continued to fare poorly and failed to rectify the deficiencies need not be recommended for extension of affiliation.

The council has also decided to impose strict norms while sanctioning new courses for colleges in the State. Application of colleges that have obtained accreditation by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for at least one of their courses will only be considered for the purpose. Currently, only 30 engineering colleges possessed NBA accreditation in the State.

Besides, new courses will be sanctioned only for those colleges that witnessed admissions to at least 50% of their total seats during the last three years. For new M.Tech courses, the corresponding B.Tech course will have to be accredited.

Only those courses that are deemed job-oriented and ‘industry relevant’ will be sanctioned henceforth. A four-member academic committee, convened by the Pro-Vice Chancellor, has been constituted to evolve courses based on the demands of the job market. Curriculum committees that comprise teachers and industry experts will also be formed.

The Academic Council has also proposed to introduce a review mechanism in the revaluation process of answer scripts. While the existing norms prescribe only one revaluation in the undergraduate programme, students will be provided with a chance to review the outcome, subject to certain conditions. The panel also decided to consider DVoc vocational diploma holders for lateral entry to engineering courses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/poorly-faring-engineering-colleges-to-be-kept-on-a-tight-leash/article30568471.ece
118,2020/01/14,Voters’ list: Congress trains gun on CPI(M),"The Congress on Tuesday accused the State government of deliberately using the State Election Commission (SEC) for political gains in the local body elections due later this year.

The party said the decision of the SEC to use data base of 2015 voters’ list for the 2020 local body elections was nothing but anti-democratic and a conscious attempt to sabotage the election process.

KPCC working president Kodikunnil Suresh, responding on behalf of the party, said here on Tuesday that it was well known to the State government and the SEC that the local body elections would have to be held in the months of September-October this year and steps should have been taken quite early to prepare the voters’ list. He suspected that the CPI(M) was behind the SEC’s late decision.

Mr. Suresh said the LDF was victorious in the 2015 local body elections. Apparently, the ruling coalition believed that it would be able to repeat its performance only on the basis of the 2015 voters’ list. This was nothing but an undemocratic method of creating a conducive atmosphere to win the elections.

He wanted the SEC to take affirmative action to ensure that all those who attained 18 years of age since 2015 and persons who have since returned home from aboard and settled down were included in the voters’ list. Any move that denied this privilege should be construed as an act carried out with the knowledge of the State government, he said.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), in the meantime, took the legal route to challenge the SEC’s decision. The party’s State committee in a statement here said that it had moved the Kerala High Court against the SEC decision. The court had issued notice to the SEC, it said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/voters-list-congress-trains-gun-on-cpim/article30568356.ece
119,2020/01/14,"Chennithala, Chandy signal end to bonhomie with CPI(M)","Congress Working Committee member Oommen Chandy and Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday signalled an end to the bonhomie with the LDF Government led by Pinarayi Vijayan on the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The two leaders, who addressed a press conference in Delhi, along with KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, came out strongly against the CPI(M), for trying to drive a wedge in the Congress over its stand on the issue by singling out Mr. Ramachandran for his opposition to the joint UDF and LDF campaign.

The two leaders defended Mr. Ramachandran’s independent stand on the issue and criticised the CPI(M) leadership for casting aspersion on the secular credentials of Mr. Ramachandran.

Talks with Sonia

According to party sources, the controversy over the joint campaign figured in the discussions that the State leaders had with party president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi.

Even though the meeting took place to formalise the proposed reconstitution of the KPCC and some of the DCCs, the joint campaign of the UDF and the LDF came up during the course of the discussions.

It may be recalled that Mr. Chennithala and Mr. Chandy had come out in favour of the joint campaign for the message it sought send across the country, but Mr. Ramachandran took a hard stand and refused to accept such a move.

Hard stand

Besides refusing to associate himself with such campaigns, Mr. Ramachandran made it clear that the KPCC under him would continue to take a hard stand against the CPI(M) and the unpopular rule of the LDF.

Mr. Chennithala had come out with a clarification soon after, stating that the joint campaign had only one single purpose to express the strong reactions of the State to the CAA.

The UDF, soon after, announced that it would resume its agitations against the LDF government. It is to be presumed that the joint statement of the Kerala leaders in Delhi brings down the curtains on the differences on the CAA campaign.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chennithala-chandy-signal-end-to-bonhomie-with-cpim/article30568092.ece
120,2020/01/14,Sabarimala set for Makaravilakku,"Thousands of Ayyappa devotees from different parts of the country began to camp at the holy hillock to worship the `Makarajyoti’ on Makaravilakku day on Wednesday.

The Sannidhanam and surrounding forest areas have almost been occupied by pilgrims eagerly awaiting the sighting of the celestial star that appears on the eastern horizon at Ponnambalamedu facing the Ayyappa temple.

Almost all vantage points at the Sannidhanam have been occupied by pilgrims. Disregarding the restrictions, many have occupied even rooftops of high rise buildings and started cooking food on the hillside. This is besides the scores of pilgrims camping in makeshift tents on the hillsides in the forest areas of Paandithavalom, Malikappuram, Urakkuzhy, Pulmedu, Uppupara, Nilackal and Attathode.

Pilgrims camping in the forests were not at all bothered about the lack of basic facilities there. They were in a divine frenzy, singing bhajans all through.

Makarasankrama puja

Tantri Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu, assisted by Melsanthi A.K. Sudheer Namboodiri performed the purification rituals as a prelude to the Makasankrama puja.

The Makarasankrama puja will be performed at 2.09 a.m. on Wednesday. The Neyyahhishekom, `Sankramabhishekom’ as is called, to the presiding deity will be performed with the ghee brought from Kowdiar Palace in Thiruvananthapuram.

The sanctum sanctorum which was opened on Tuesday afternoon will be closed only at 2.30 a.m. on Wednesday. It will be reopened for the daily rituals at 4 a.m.

Thiruvabharanam

The procession carrying the sacred jewellery, Thiruvabharanam, from Pandalam Palace will reach the Sannidhanam by 6.20 p.m. on Wednesday. The presiding deity will be adorned with the Thiruvabharanam prior to the deeparadhana.

The Makaravilakku deeparadhana at Ponnambalamedu will be performed in the next few minutes after the deeparadhana at around 6.30 p.m.

According to Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) sources, a senior priest attached to the board will be performing the deeparadhana at Ponnambalamedu. A team of security personnel, that include TDB officials, would escort the priest to Ponnambalamedu, TDB sources said.

The Ayyappa temple will be closed after facilitating the customary holy darshan exclusively by royal representative R.

121,2020/01/14,Sabarimala all set for Makaravilakku,"The famous Lord Ayyappa temple here and its premises have been brought under a heavy security blank as arrangements are in full swing at the hill shrine for the auspicious Makaravilakku on Wednesday, the finale of the over two-month-long annual pilgrim season.

In view of the continuing heavy rush, more personnel of police, NDRF and Rapid Response Force have been deployed in and around the shrine for crowd management and to ensure the safety of devotees, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which manages the hill temple, said.

“The rush of devotees has increased considerably since Sunday. So, 200 more police personnel of various ranks have been deployed in and around the shrine exclusively for crowd management,” a TDB statement said.

Over 1,400 police personnel including 15 DySPs and 36 Circle Inspectors are on duty at Sannidhanam, the temple complex, alone.

A 70-member bomb squad and a 20-member telecommunication wing were also on alert at the shrine complex, the release said.

Police, NDRF, Rapid Response Team and the Fire Force personnel would jointly monitor and manage the devotees who climb down the holy hills in heavy numbers after the Makaravilakku darshan, it added.

Meanwhile, the shrine authorities here said a team, led by temple executive officer, would receive the procession carrying ‘thiruvabharanam”, the sacred ornaments to be adored by Lord Ayyappa, on Wednesday evening at Saramkuthi, a pilgrim spot on the way to the shrine.

The jewels are being brought from the Pandalam palace, where, according to legend, Lord Ayyappa had spent his childhood.

Later, the sacred jewel box would be handed over to the team comprising state Devaswom Minister, TDB president and special commissioner, they said.

The holy jewels would be adorned on Lord Ayyappa and the customary ‘maaha deeparadhana’ would be held at the shrine in the evening, they added.

Thousands of devotees are expected to throng the hill shrine and its premises to witness the auspicious ’makaravilakku’, the ritualistic ‘deeparadhana’ (aarthi) held at Ponnambalamedu, the hill facing the shrine, as part of the annual festivities.

The lighting of the flame by the Kerala government, with the support of the Travancore Devaswom Board and the forest department, at Ponnamabalamedu, is a continuation of the practice followed by tribal families who live near the hilltop.

Devotees would occupy different points in and around Sabarimala, hours before the ceremony, to have a glance of the ’makaravilakku’

The hill shrine, which draws devotees from various parts of the country, had witnessed unprecedented protests by right wing outfits and BJP workers last year after the CPI(M) led LDF government decided to implement the September 28, 2018 Supreme Court order lifting the traditional bar on women and girls in menstrual age from offering prayers.

However, this year in the backdrop of the top court’s decision to refer a batch of review petitions against its earlier verdict to a larger bench, the state government had said those women desirous of visiting the hill temple should get a “court order” and it would not encourage activism.

The shrine will close on January 21, bringing to end the pilgrim season.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fufv2h/article30565763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14SABARIMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-all-set-for-makaravilakku/article30565764.ece

123,2020/01/14,No change in govt. stance on Sabarimala: Devaswom Minister,"Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said that the Kerala government has always maintained that the Sabarimala issue would be best decided in consultation with religious scholars.

He said the government had been consistent in its prayer before the Supreme Court that the issue of rituals at Sabarimala be decided in consultation with Hindu religious scholars and experts.

“This was our prayer in the affidavit submitted before the court. It had clearly said that since it [entry of women of all groups to Sabarimala] was an issue related to the temple rituals, it would be good to consult religious scholars and subject experts before taking a decision,” he said, dispelling reports about a change of stance on his part and a difference of opinion over this with Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Issac.

“The government stance has always been this,” he said, accusing the media of focusing on certain select portions of the affidavit and missing its thrust. While this was the government’s appeal, the court did not pay attention to it and chose to appoint an amicus curiae and went by his report.

The government was Constitutionally-bound to implement the Supreme Court order, be it on Sabarimala or in the case of the illegal flats at Maradu. Asked if the government was going back on its stance on Sabarimala, he answered in the negative, and said the same affidavit would be filed again if such a situation arose.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kzx5vc/article30564960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08ptkrk07-kadakGU830QKHJ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-change-in-govt-stance-on-sabarimala-devaswom-minister/article30564950.ece
124,2020/01/14,Kerala files suit against CAA,"Kerala became the first State to join citizens across the country's spectrum to challenge in the Supreme Court the constitutionality of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which fast-tracks grant of citizenship on the basis of religion.

The State has approached the Supreme Court nearly 15 days after its Legislative Assembly unanimously requested the Centre to abrogate the CAA on December 31, 2019. And it comes just three days after the CAA came into effect on January 10.

The original suit has been filed under Article 131 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has “original” jurisdiction in disputes between States or the Centre and State(s). The Article allows it to directly take cognisance of such a dispute.

Kerala said in its suit thatit would be compelled under Article 256 to comply with the CAA, which was “manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational and violative of fundamental rights”.

The suit, represented by senior advocate Jaideep Gupta and G. Prakash, submitted, “Thus, there exists a dispute, involving questions of law and fact, between the State of Kerala and the Union of India, regarding the enforcement of legal rights as a State and as well for the enforcement of the fundamental, statutory constitutional and other legal rights of the inhabitants of the State of Kerala.”

Conflicting judgments

However, there has been two conflicting judgments from the Supreme Court by coordinate Benches on whether a State can file an original suit under Article 131 to challenge the constitutionality of a central law. The first judgment reported in 2012 - State of Madhya Pradesh vs Union of India - held that States cannot challenge a central law under Article 131. The second judgment - State of Jharkhand Vs State of Bihar - took the opposite view in 2015 and referred the question of law to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court for final determination.

The Centre may object to the maintainability of the Kerala suit when it comes up for hearing.

Besides the CAA, the suit also challenges other laws that affect citizenships, including Passport Rules and Foreign Order Amendments as “class legislations which harp on the religious identity of an individual, thereby contravening the principles of secularism”.

It said the CAA, by making concessions for grant of citizenship to illegal migrants who flee persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, was discriminatory and irrational.

Linking Indian citizenship with the country of origin and religion of an illegal migrants was manifestly discriminatory and unequal. “It is trite and settled law that a legislation discriminating on the basis of an intrinsic and core trait of an individual cannot form a reasonable classification based on an intelligible differentia,” the suit argued.

The State of Kerala expressed its wonder at how word “persecution”, which appears in the text of 'statement of objects and reasons' of the CAA, fails to make it to the main body of the Act itself. This would suppose that illegal migrants from these countries and from select religions would get priority in grant of Indian citizenship.

“Such grouping is not founded on any rationale principle justifying a separate special treatment for the irrationally chosen class of religious minorities facing persecution. There is no rationale in not extending the rights conferred to a class of minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to religious minorities belonging to the said countries of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan,” the suit said.

The petitioners, from all walks of life across the country, have argued that the law welcomes “illegal migrants” into India selectively on the basis of their religion and pointedly exclude Muslims. They have contended that the CAA shares an “unholy nexus” with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and is against principles of secularism, right to equality and dignity of life enshrined in the Basic Structure of the Constitution.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/muvacu/article30324284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVPAGE41,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-govt-moves-sc-challenging-caa/article30564866.ece

128,2020/01/14,"Steps in place to reduce road accidents by half, says CM","Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Monday that steps had been taken to reduce road accidents in Kerala by half this year and the goal should be to eliminate road accidents altogether.

He was speaking after inaugurating the National Road Safety Week and flagging off 17 interceptor vehicles.

The authorities concerned should create awareness, carry out stringent checks and adopt suitable measures to achieve the goal.

The issue of road accidents was discussed at a meeting of District Collectors and District Police Chiefs. The necessary steps had been taken in this regard. “Districts must work to reduce road accidents by half,” he said.

A lot of lives were lost on the road each year, and on an average, more than 4,000 people died in road accidents in Kerala every year, the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Vijayan said that accidents happened owing to various factors.

But when studying the nature of accidents, it was observed that most such incidents were avoidable. This was where the authorities needed to intervene to avert such tragedies.

He attributed drunk driving, overspeeding, especially by youngsters, and prolonged travel in a sleep-deprived state, as the reason for the increasing number of accidents. Similarly, there were many roads that posed a risk to motorists. Precise raods marking had been done and vigilance stepped up in many places. It should be done in a more scientific and transparent way, he said.

The Chief Minister appealed to the people to extend their cooperation in this task. It was when the people failed to cooperate that drastic measures had to be taken.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran presided over the function. Port and Archaeology Minister Ramachandran Kadannappally delivered the keynote address.

Mayor Suma Balakrishnan; District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh; District Collector T.V. Subhash; District Police Chief Yatish Chandra; and Road Safety Commissioner N. Shankar Reddy were present.

“Change through the youth”, is the theme of the observance this year. The District Collector called upon the youth to use their capabilities to prevent road accidents.

The duo though, have just one song this time as the rest of Tanhaji’s soundtrack is composed by several others. The duo themselves do not appear to have shed the memories of that last project, as ‘Maay Bhavani’ carries a bit of a hangover from ‘Mere Mann Mein Shiva’.

The album’s other devotional song, with a heavier folk bent, is a more entertaining listen. Mehul Vyas’s ‘Shankara Re Shankara’ is sung by the composer and Adarsh Shinde. And thanks to the choice of instruments in the backdrop, this is the only song in the soundtrack that, at seems to belong closest to the time the movie is set in although the lyrics, do dilute that effect.

The composing duo who had a fairly busy 2019 – Sachet Tandon and Parampara Thakur – get the other half of the soundtrack. And after the token devotional song entries, Sachet-Parampara’s first offering is the token battle anthem. While this song too follows a pretty formulaic approach, the core refrain – delivered in multiple forms throughout the piece – lends it a rousing, haunting quality, particularly in the way it’s rendered by the chorus. That tune though, seems to be reminiscent of an older melody.

The composers’ other song is a romantic melody titled ‘Tinak Tinak’ – a pleasant piece that is very well arranged. The plucked strings and shehnai, in particular are well employed throughout the song, and Harshdeep Kaur is in top form behind the mic. The problem with the number though, is that it doesn’t sound like it belongs to the period, or even the region in this case. In fact, the song sounds so contemporary filmi most of the time, the lyrics could well be the standard Punjabi-Hindi mix and it would fit right in. A special mention to Pritesh Mehta who did the music production here – possibly one of the last projects he did before his untimely and unfortunate death last year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6r5823/article30568224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bm-pg2-tanhaji-film,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tanhaji-the-unsung-warrior-music-review-strike-three-for-melodies/article30568226.ece
131,2020/01/14,Kalyan Ram in ‘Entha Manchivadavura’: Here comes Santa,"When Kalyan Ram’s film to be directed by Satish Vegesna was announced, many people were surprised. The reason: Satish Vegesna is known to make family dramas and such films target only a limited audience and not the youth. There is also a tendency to think his films are preachy and give lessons on relationships. On the eve of the release of Entha Manchivadavura, Kalyan Ram agrees it is a family story but disagrees it targets a certain segment. The movie, a remake of Gujarati film Oxygen has been changed keeping the core point intact. He shares, “After 118, I listened to many scripts and remake stories. One day I watched the Gujarati movie and liked one element in it.Satish changed the script and there are no lectures on how one should be and not be. It is a character’s journey; by picking a relation, he fulfils someone else’s emotion.”

Kalyan Ram stresses the importance of having people around you and being good to them. He says all people are good, but certain actions of theirs offend us and we label them bad. The concept tells people to spread positivity. The hero takes an episode from his childhood to help others. Given a choice he could have turned bitter but he chooses a better path. It is all about giving. He recalls, “Even the title which is taken from a song from Nammina Buntu reflects ninduthanam and Teluguthanam just like Satamanam Bhavati and Srinivasa Kalyanam. The title is apt like the character. When my relatives leave, I feel bad. I wish they could stay home for a few more days. With nuclear families we miss on many things. I spend time with my family before stepping out to work. Being amongst loved ones is a good feeling.”

The movie isn’t about one story but there are multiple stories and the hero enters their lives to change it for the better. Kalyan recalls being bombarded by thriller stories post the release of 118. He wanted to do something different and picked this one. “ I wanted to work in a family oriented subject. After watching seeing Satamanam Bhavati, my wife asked why I don’t do such subjects. I told her that the director should trust and feel that he suits the character.” he says.

Satish Vegesna’s instructions to Kalyan Ram were simple; he wanted him to be natural, the way he is at home. He didn’t want Kalyan Ram to look serious and preferred a smiling and a warm look. The story is about a guy who does short films and Mehreen supports him in his journey. The film has commercial elements and is not like a television serial. The film wrapped up in the stipulated time.

As there was no mobile network in Munnar where they shot, they spent the entire day without phones and the team bonded and had a great time. Ask him this Sankranti is the right time to release, because there are two other big films already, and Kalyan Ram sounds confident . “Sankranti is a farmer’s and film industry’s festival . We have at least five films a mix of big and medium-budget projects that release during this time. After January, students prepare for examinations. So we decided on this date . For the budget we shot, we are confident of recovering the cost.”

Finally, he says his nature like the character in the film is simple. He likes to stay in his space and will move out if he knows he doesn’t fit there. , is a song in the movie that sums up the entire story. “Satish wanted a change in cast and crew and didn’t want to repeat them. Since he had worked with Mickey J Meyer, we went for Gopi Sunder, after seeing his background score in Ninnu Kori. With seasoned actors like Vijay Kumar, Tanikella Bharani, Naresh, Suhasini, Shubalekha Sudhakar, Rajiv Kanakala and Vennela KishoreI am positive the film will be received well.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7r5y29/article30567109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym15entha9,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kalyan-ram-looks-forward-to-the-release-of-entha-manchivadavura/article30567111.ece
132,2020/01/14,Finally he breaks even,"Rakshit Shetty’s Avane Sriman Narayana (ASN) is declared a hit. As the film scores well at the box office with each passing day, so do the film’s character artistes. Though the cast is almost the same as Rakshit’s Kirik Party, there were a few other actors who have joined the Rakshit band with ASN. One such is actor Ashwin Hassan who plays the role of Narsi — the right hand man of the bad guy Jayarama.

Though the role is not long, Ashwin makes his presence felt amidst all the drama and other powerful actors that he shares the screen with. “I have never bothered about my character’s screen time. As long as the character is good and gives me scope to perform, I am game for it,” shares Ashwin, who has acted in 31 films and a few serials till date.

The actor has in the past shared the screen with stars such as Darshan, Sudeep and Puneeth Rajkumar and has acted in films like Jaggu Dada, Hebbuli, Rajkumara, Chakravyuha, Yuvarathna and Ananthu vs Nusrat to name a few.

“Despite these achievements, I always felt left out when it came to work in the industry. Then I forayed into the small screen and also went back to working.” Ashwin worked for one of the largest MNCs in Bengaluru and took home a huge pay packet besides travelling extensively abroad for work.

“Yet when things would go wrong with my profession, I would once again be drawn to acting. This interest in me was doubled when my college professor told me I make a better actor than an engineer,” laughs the actor, who then quit his job and decided to give acting his full time attention.

He credits the theatre group Kalagangotri for teaching him the nuances of acting. “The passion took off from my experience on stage. Kalagangotri, spearheaded by BV Rajaram also is the place where I got the suffix ‘Hassan’ added to my name. We were three people with the same name in the troupe. And everyone decided to add ‘Hassan’ to my name as I hail from that place,” laughs the actor who started off as a leading man in Operation Ankhusha and Mandakini.

“Sadly, both the films bombed at the box office,” laughs the 36-year-old Ashwin, who adds that now ASN is opening doors for his career like never before.

“I was always a huge fan of Rakshit. We would meet at film launches and he has always been cordial to me. It was my tiny role in Kavaludaari that made director Hemanth refer me to Rakshit for ASN.”

In Kavaludaari Ashwin has a tiny role. He is the man who comes in at the end to shoot the protagonist but gets killed instead. “Working in Kavaludaari was not just about the role. The tiny role took seven days of shooting. And while on the set, the team observes you intensely — the way you interact with others, the manner in which you cooperate with the team to better the film and so on. All these work in your favour in the end. The biggest challenge for me here was to shine despite the short screen presence,” smiles Ashwin, who then adds that “working with Rakshit was a dream come true. The speciality of his unit is that the everyone works as a team.”

Now with the success of ASN, he is not only getting to choose from a wide range of film, but also is looking forward to two other releases — Yellow Board and Aa Vondu Note.

Ashwin says, “It is not fame that I seek. I want to establish myself as a versatile actor. If fame also comes with it, it is a bonus. To survive in the film industry, you have to be very good at the waiting game. For no matter how talented or good you are at your work, you need that one film to pave the way for you here.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/eqwbbc/article30566256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGMCINEMA2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-ashwin-hassan-finally-breaks-even/article30566260.ece

134,2020/01/14,DMK wins Pudupalayam PU chairman post,"The election officer in-charge of the Pudupalayam Panchayat Union has declared DMK candidate C. Sundarapandian as the winner for the chairman’s post.

He has polled 10 votes while his opponent from the BJP, Ramesh, garnered only five votes in the 15-member council.

The election for the posts of chairman and deputy chairman was held on Saturday after a commotion forced the election officer to defer the results to a later date.

In the 15-member council, DMK has six members while the AIADMK allies have five, including BJP member Ramesh, who contested for Chairman’s post. But the independent candidates favoured DMK, which thwarted the BJP members’ chances of becoming a chairman.

Meanwhile, the 10 members who voted for Mr. Sundarapandian, did so because he represented their vision to the District Collector, K.S. Kandasamy, said a memorandum by DMK members to the State Election Commissioner.

After the election officer announced the result the Certificate of Election was given to Mr. Sundarapandian, sources said.

135,2020/01/14,"Tamil Nadu’s SHRC has no chairperson yet, not even acting chief","The hearing of cases alleging violation of human rights by government officials and policemen and administrative functions, have been hit in the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) in Tamil Nadu, as the Commission is functioning without a chairperson.

Following the stepping down of retired high court judge T. Meenakumari after completing her tenure in November last year, the post has been lying vacant for about two months now. Even an acting chairperson has not been named as yet, as laid down by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 read along with the State Human Rights Commission Tamil Nadu (Procedure) Regulations, 1997.

According to Section 25 of the Act, “In the event of the occurrence of any vacancy in the office of the chairperson by reason of his death, resignation or otherwise, the Governor may, by notification, authorise one of the members to act as the chairperson until the appointment of a new chairperson to fill such vacancy.”

Without a chairperson, the number of courts in the Commission hearing cases is down by one third, as only two members are hearing the cases presently. “Since the chairperson is the administrative head of the Commission, all administrative functions are slow,” informed sources said. They also pointed out that an acting chairperson has not been named, like in the past. “If an acting chairperson is appointed, at least the function of the Commission would not be affected, until the selection process to appoint the new chairperson,” they contended.

Section 21 of the Act states that a person, who has been a Chief Justice of a High Court is to be appointed as the SHRC chairperson. Once a person is appointed chairperson, he/she shall hold the post for five years or until he/she attains 70 years of age, as per Section 24 of the Act.

The names for appointment as members of the Commission are to be recommended by a Committee comprising the Chief Minister, Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly, Minister in-charge of the Home Department and the Leader of the Opposition, as per Section 22 of the Act. The appointments are then made by the Governor.

In December, a video where the four second-year undergraduate students from the college were consuming alcohol went viral on social media. The students, three of them female and one male, were dismissed from the college after a meeting of the institution’s disciplinary committee.

Following this, R. M. Karthik, founder of the All India Private Colleges Employees Union (AIPCEU) submitted a complaint to the NCW stating that the students had been dismissed without any prior warning or any corrective measures taken. He further alleged in his complaint that the college had circulated the dismissal circular on social media to publicly shame the students.

“I had approached Bharathidasan University which the college is affiliated to, with my concerns before approaching the Commission but no action was taken,” Mr. Karthik alleged. In his complaint to the NCW, Mr. Karthik had requested the future and the education of the girls to be protected and action to be taken against the college.

In the notice to the college, Shyamala S. Kundar member, NCW, has said that the complaint raised by Mr. Karthik pertains to the alleged cruelty, harassment and indecent representation of women and has asked the principal to look into the issue.

“The alliance between the two parties is like a family problem. In a family, there will be problems and reconciliation. But there is no anger or disappointment,” he said.

147,2020/01/14,Police station in Panruti out of bounds for residents,"A police station located in a sensitive pocket in Muthandikuppam in Panruti block remained out of bounds for outsiders with a lone policewoman on duty locking the main gate from inside, citing security concerns on Monday. Sources said the station, which has jurisdiction over Muthandikuppam, Vallam and other sensitive areas, had been without a head for several months. The police inspector of Kadampuliyur station is in charge of Muthandikuppam station.

A number of complainants who visited the station on Monday were surprised to find the main gate locked from inside and returned disappointed. A policeman attached to the station said, on condition of anonymity, that the station had been locked for security concerns.

Anantharaman, 35, of Sorathankuzhi near Panruti, had set himself ablaze in front of the police station on January 9, accusing the police of being partisan while investigating a case.

The victim was rushed to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital and later referred to Chennai, where he died on Monday. Irate relatives of the victim resorted to a road roko at the neighbouring Vallam village protesting against his death. The policemen attached to the station had left to Vallam to maintain law and order. The sub-inspector attached to the station had left the station on an assignment to monitor the written examinations for recruitment of police sub-inspectors.

The police personnel were apprehensive that disgruntled relatives would attack the police station and they decided to keep it locked, according to an officer. The lone woman constable was not able to respond to any of the complainants waiting outside.

Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said that the policewoman was posted on sentry duty on Monday. The constable could have thought that it would be wise to lock the main gate as a precautionary measure in the wake of road roko protest but she was attending to everybody. All the personnel had left to maintain law and order.

They wanted maximum strength at the venue till reinforcements arrived, he added.

148,2020/01/14,Employ architecture college graduates as stapathis: HC,"The Madras High Court on Monday directed the State government to implement within three months the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Engineering and Subordinate Service Rules. and to give priority to graduates from institutions such as the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture (GCAS) at Mamallapuram while making appointments to the posts of engineers, draftsman and stapathi.

Justice R. Mahadevan issued the direction after finding that the government continued to engage traditional stapathis despite the GCAS having been established in 1957 to create trained hands in designing, building, repairing and resurrecting temple structures as well as idols.

He said with pain that only a handful of graduates from the college had managed to set up studios while others had switched professions.

After recording the submission that a Government Order was issued on August 9, 2019 for setting up a renovation and conservation wing with 175 posts, including 90 posts of Engineer, Draftsman and Stapathy, the judge said that there should be at least one stapathi in each of the 28 blocks of HR&CE department.

All these posts should be filled strictly in accordance with the required qualification, knowledge and experience, he added.

Although Section 7 of the Hindu Religious and Charitable EndowmentsAct of 1959 read with the rules framed thereunder require the constitution of an Advisory Committee, chaired by the Chief Minister, and expect it to meet at least once in six months to take stock of maintenance of temples across the State, “no such meetings are being conducted and as a result, many temples have been left in a lurch,” the judge lamented in his verdict.

He directed the government to constitute the Advisory Committee and in absentia, permit another committee headed by the principal of the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture to give countersign and give opinions on renovation of temples and resurrection of idols, images, paintings, pillars, scriptures or any other matter of ancient or historical importance.

Such committee should invite suggestions from various experts before carrying out the renovation exercise, he said.

‘Reduce services’

Wondering how engineers from the Public Works Department and other allied departments could be used for temple restoration activities, which require deep knowledge of the agama sastra, the judge ordered:

“The services of staff from other departments is to be periodically reduced keeping in mind the period of deputation. In case of any need, their services should be used only for the limited purpose of estimation and civil works.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/employ-architecture-college-graduates-as-stapathis-hc/article30563894.ece
149,2020/01/14,Alamparai Fort set to rise from the ruins after more than 350 years,"After lying derelict for over 350 years, the Alamparai Fort, which was once a thriving port and mint of the Muslim and French rulers, is set to regain its majesty, as the Department of Archaeology has begun restoration work.

The funding for the conservation and restoration project has come from the Asian Development Bank, which has allotted ₹8.02 crore for the initiative.

The work is on in full swing and is expected to be completed in seven months.

“The restoration will not only resurrect the ancient fort, but also attract tourists,” a senior official of the Archaeology Department said.

Situated along the Chennai-Puducherry East Coast Road in Madurantakam taluk of Kancheepuram district, the 15-acre brick and lime square structure was built by the Muslim rulers in the 17th century AD.

It was under the control of Nawab Dost Ali Khan in 1735, and was gifted to French Governor Joseph François Dupleix in 1750.

“Coins were minted after the French received the fort, and the Alamparai varahan is equal to ₹3,” the official said. Important commodities like salt, cloth and ghee were exported from Alamparai, which is situated close to the Marakkanam port.

Alamparai, a flourishing place of trade and commerce, fell into oblivion when the British, led by Sir Thomas Eyre Coote, captured the fort in 1760 and inflicted damage on it.

Neglect and sea erosion took a further toll on the structure.

“It has survived thus far because of the quality construction material that was used at that time. The walls, with a 1.2-metre width, weathered the ravages of the time,” said a senior official, explaining that the restoration work will involve mending, reconstruction, grouting and underpinning.

Special bricks procured from Karnataka are being used for brick stitching in the worn out portions of the fortress wall. Mortar made of unslaked lime from Kazhugumalai, mixed with sand, gallnut and jaggery, is used for construction and pasting. A special mortar and pestle has been installed to make the paste.

Traditional restoration

“We will reconstruct wherever restoration is impossible, following the traditional method. Existing cracks will be sealed with grout. Foundations will be strengthened where necessary by pouring concrete through the gunning method,” the official said.

Two retired officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are monitoring the restoration work to ensure that it strictly adheres to established standards.

“We are also creating facilities like toilets, parking lots and drinking water dispensaries on-site for the benefit of tourists,” the Archaeology Department official said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/56nk6d/article30563892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14FORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/alamparai-fort-set-to-rise-from-the-ruins-after-more-than-350-years/article30563893.ece
150,2020/01/14,T.N. to showcase folk deity and dances in R-Day parade,"Tamil folk deity Ayyanar and a selection of rural folk dances, reflecting the rich cultural tradition of Tamil Nadu, are set to be showcased by the State at the forthcoming Republic Day parade in New Delhi.

Tamil Nadu’s tableau is among those that have been selected for the parade at Rajpath in the national capital on January 26. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will be the chief guest for the event.

The front portion of the float will feature an idol of Ayyanar’s horse, while the folk deity’s idol will form part of the back portion. The central raised platform of the float will have dummies of artists engaged in thappattam and oyilattam, among other folk art forms. Artists will perform select folk dances as part of the procession down the Rajpath. “There is no theme this year. We have chosen folk deity and folk dances, since they reflect the cultural tradition of Tamil Nadu,” a senior official said. While some dance forms will be represented through dummies on the float, others will be performed by trained artists, who will accompany the float, he said.

Ayyanar is among the guardian deities (kaaval deivam) in rural Tamil Nadu. The idols of such deities are often seen with those of dogs and horses (believed to be their companions) in the peripheries of several villages in the State.

Palaniswami at the Secretariat on Monday, granted necessary clearances to a total of 15 projects that were at various stages of investment and commencement of business.

A senior official said the projects, entailing investments to the tune of ₹6,608 crore, needed various clearances. They are expected to generate employment for around 6,700 people, according to an official press release.

The projects will come up in Coimbatore, Kancheepuram, Krishnagiri, Perambalur, Thoothukudi, Tiruchi, Tiruvallur and Vellore districts. “During the meeting, every project was looked into and necessary clearances granted,” an official said. While some projects had been waiting for building clearance, others had been awaiting the consent to operate.

Following his visit to the U.S., the U.K. and Dubai, the Chief Minister constituted a high-level committee for investment facilitation and single-window clearances to expedite clearances for proposed investments by various companies in T.N.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran heard the petitions on the incidents that marred the polls. Deputy Superintendent of Police Venkatesan of Aruppukottai sub-division suffered a cut injury on his right hand following violence during the election in the Narikudi Union of Virudhunagar district. The violence took place following a tie between the AIADMK and the DMK.

The election to the Kovilpatti Union was postponed as the returning officer fell ill on the day of the polls. Instead of postponing the polls, the Assistant Returning Officer should have been directed to take charge, the DMK members said.

153,2020/01/14,"I favour return of Tamil refugees to Sri Lanka, says former CM of Sri Lanka's Northern Province","The former Chief Minister of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, C.V. Wigneswaran, on Monday asserted that he was for the return of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India to home soil.

When asked whether his recent call for the granting of dual citizenship to the refugees marked any nuanced shift in position from the one he took about five years ago, when he had urged the refugees to return to Sri Lanka, Mr. Wigneswaran told The Hindu, “I still hold the same view — that they (the refugees) must return to their country because we are running short of Tamils [in Sri Lanka] and the areas where they had been living earlier are being handed over by the government to the Sinhalese.”

As for his suggestion on the question of dual citizenship, the former Chief Minister, who had also served as a judge in Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court, clarified that he was not “voting for dual citizenship as itself”. But having lived in another country for 30 years, the refugees had developed “various commitments”. In the process of coming back [to Sri Lanka], “if they have problems in India, it is for the purpose that I am suggesting that the dual citizenship be given to them”. He added that the refugees wouldn’t be having “voting rights” in India. “We must keep in mind that these are the people who are citizens of Sri Lanka, and the Sri Lankan government is responsible for them,” he said.

‘Long-term visas’

Reiterating that dual citizenship could be offered to the refugees as an option, and that it should be subject to their fulfilling “certain conditions”, Mr Wigneswaran said alternatively, they could be given “long-term visas”. He called for discussions between the governments of the two countries, including senior Tamil officials in the Sri Lankan government, “to find a way to be helpful to those people who are returning”. He wanted New Delhi to help Colombo in creating “infrastructural facilities” that would be beneficial to prospective refugee-returnees.

On his Sunday meeting with film star Rajinikanth, the former CM said the meeting was organised at short notice. “Both of us mutually wanted to meet each other. For much of our 30-minute-long meeting, we discussed matters of spirituality,” he said, adding that there was no “political agenda” behind his visit to Tamil Nadu. Accusing SL politicians of seeking to make Sri Lanka “ultimately a Sinhala Buddhist country”, he said, “The security of India and the security of Tamils in Sri Lanka are inter-related. You have the third party, China, coming into the scene. It helps India to make sure that Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East are given sufficient rights, preferably federal rights, with the merger of the two Provinces.”

Regarding the debate on prioritising the economic development of the region over a political settlement and devolution, Mr. Wigneswaran said, “Economic development must be after granting us political rights. If you do not do that, we will ultimately get integrated with the major community and we will lose individuality.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w8aln5/article30562431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14WIGNESWARANSRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i-favour-return-of-tamil-refugees-to-sri-lanka/article30562432.ece
154,2020/01/14,CJ to consider plea for early hearing of cases filed by Karti,"Chief Justice of the Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi on Monday said he would consider on the administrative side a request made on behalf of Member of Parliament Karti P. Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Chidambaram for early hearing of cases filed by them against prosecution initiated by the Income Tax Department.

When Senior Counsel Nalini Chidambaram made a mention before him and stated that a special court for hearing cases against MPs and MLAs was scheduled to frame charges against the couple on Tuesday despite being “incompetent” to do so, the Chief Justice asked her to give a representation to the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court. The mention was made after two judges of the High Court on Monday refused to hear cases filed by the duo. Since the week-long Pongal vacation for the High Court begins on Tuesday, Ms. Chidambaram urged the Chief Justice to order the listing of the cases before some other judge of the court on the reopening day on January 20.

Wondering how such request could be entertained at the eleventh hour, the CJ asked her to submit a representation to the Registrar. The I-T proceedings had been initiated for alleged non-disclosure of sale consideration of ₹1.36 crore, reportedly received by the duo after selling their 1.16-acre property at Muttukadu in 2015. Earlier, Justice Anita Sumanth recused herself from hearing two petitions filed by the couple last year challenging the transfer of the I-T case from an economic offences court to the special court. The judge directed the Registry to list the petitions before the CJ. The decision was taken after Special Public Prosecutor for I-T cases M. Baskaran brought to the notice of the judge that the I-T proceedings were initiated on the basis of material seized from Advantage Strategic Consulting, a firm for which she had appeared as counsel while practising law.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cj-to-consider-plea-for-early-hearing-of-cases-filed-by-karti/article30562428.ece

The MTI Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Institute of Maritime Shipping and Engineering, Cuddalore, is run by the Kamalam Sambandan Educational and Charitable Trust. The trustees of the institute are Mr. Alagiri, some of his family members and acquaintances. In its order, the DG Shipping said several complaints were received from students. The institute was given an opportunity to respond to the complaints. The DG found many discrepancies in the replies. It found that the institute did not have a principal and was operating with only one faculty member and two instructors. It also found that “MTI had no faculty members to conduct basic safety courses, clearly showing that the MTI had not conducted any classes and yet issued certificates for completion of course to the candidates.

156,2020/01/14,HC to hear Puducherry CM’s petition from January 24,"The Madras High Court on Monday decided to commence hearing arguments from January 24, both on the maintainability as well as the merits of a writ petition filed by Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, challenging an advisory issued by the Centre last month for continuing the practice of transferring cash instead of free distribution of rice to ration cardholders.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan took the decision when the writ petition was listed for admission before him.

Opposing the plea, Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan questioned the very maintainability of the case and claimed that the Chief Minister of a Union Territory was not entitled to file a case against the Centre, since both of them were not distinct entities.

Further, referring to Section 50 of the Government of Union Territories Act of 1963, he said all decisions taken by the Centre were binding upon the Administrator (called as Lieutenant Governor in Puducherry) as well as the Council of Ministers in a Union Territory. Therefore, no Minister, much less the Chief Minister, could challenge such decisions before a court of law. After directing him to put his submissions by way of a counter affidavit, the judge allocated the entire afternoon session on January 24 to hear the petitioner, the L-G as well as the Centre.

In his petition, Mr. Narayanasamy accused L-G Kiran Bedi of having having made a recommendation for direct benefit transfer (cash deposit) without taking ground realities into account.

‘Good results’

He said the prime objective of distribution of rice and other essentials through public distribution system was to address maladies such as hunger and malnutrition. Hence, after being elected in 2016, his government had increased the distribution of free rice to all ration cardholders from 10kg to 20kg a month. The scheme yielded good results, he claimed.

In the meantime, the Centre brought in the Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy Rules of 2015. However, a study conducted by a non-governmental organisation in Puducherry found that 85% of people were in favour of receiving free supply of food grains through ration shops every month and that only 2% preferred deposit of cash in their bank accounts, he said.The Chief Minister feared that cash transfer would lead to male members in poor families snatching away the money from women and spend it for consuming liquor. Dubbing cash transfer as a “lazy short cut,” he said, it could lead to pilferage at various levels and would not help in achieving the objective of fighting hunger and malnutrition.

Hence, his council of ministers on June 7 last year passed a resolution for continuing free distribution of rice and not to opt for cash transfer. However, Ms. Bedi differed with that decision and referred the issue to the Centre on September 5. Not stopping with that, she ordered implementation of cash transfer till the Centre took a final call on the issue.

“Accordingly, cash is being credited to the beneficiaries account,” the CM said and urged the court to declare as illegal the reference made by the L-G as well as the consequent decision taken by the Centre last month that the DBT scheme shall continue in the union territory in lieu of distribution of free rice.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vdghz8/article30562384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14PONDYHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-to-hear-puducherry-cms-petition-from-january-24/article30562385.ece
157,2020/01/14,"Upset with Alagiri, DMK skips Congress meeting on anti-CAA","Upset with the Congress State leadership for criticising it over sharing of seats for the recently held rural local body polls, the DMK on Monday boycotted the meeting called by the Congress in New Delhi to evolve a strategy against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“How can we participate in the meeting after TNCC leader K.S. Alagiri accused our party leader M.K. Stalin of not abiding by coalition dharma? What has happened to him to issue an open statement? If he had any grievances, he could have met our leader and explained them to him. They have ridiculed us,” DMK parliamentary party leader T.R.Baalu told The Hindu.

Alagiri’s regret

Mr. Baalu said immediately after Mr. Alagiri’s statement, he informed Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad about the DMK’s decision to stay away from the meeting.

“I also sent him the statement issued by Mr. Alagiri. Later, Ahmed Patel also spoke to me to convey that Mr. Alagiri had expressed regret. But nothing was done to undo the damage caused by Mr. Alagiri’s statement,” Mr. Baalu maintained.

Asked why the DMK should take the statement seriously when the Congress high command in Delhi was maintaining a cordial relationship, he said, “We are worried about Tamil Nadu because it is very important for our party. Delhi is not our cup of tea.”

He added: “The rank and file of our party has taken note of Mr. Alagiri’s statement and they are upset. In fact, we have treated the Congress with respect in all districts.”

Mr. Baalu said whatever be the situation, the DMK would stand by the minorities and safeguard their interests.

158,2020/01/14,Hindu family in Mayiladuthurai grieves demise of Oman Sultan,"The announcement by the Home Ministry about the Central government’s declaration of one-day State mourning on Monday in view of the demise of the Sultan of Oman has evoked condolences from a Hindu family in Mayiladuthurai town in Nagapattinam district in the form of a banner with a touching obituary.

The late Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has been described, in the bilingual hoarding, as a beacon of peace by Ashokan, his wife Malathi, and their children Swetha and Perunselvan.

A retired school teacher, Mr. Ashokan had worked in Oman for 11 years, before returning to his hometown in 2008 after securing a government job. Mr. Ashokan had put up a large framed photograph of the ruler at the entrance of his house constructed during 2012. The condolence message says: “His Majesty is an eminent ruler, good human, able administrator, world peace lover. We pray for his soul to rest in peace. Let his dream come true though millions of his lovers, citizens, family, friends, peace keepers.”

Mr. Ashokan who retired from service six months ago said that he placed the order for the banner on January 10, the very day the Sultan died. “My friends in Muscat informed me of the Sultan’s death, and I placed the order immediately. The banner was erected on January 11,” Ashokan said.

159,2020/01/14,How much of ‘us’ can be lost?,"With the short story The Fun They Had, Isaac Asimov rightly predicted where technology was headed. Never mind that the sci-fi writer zoomed too far into the future. The point is: he still managed to get the focus right.

The story, published in 1951, summons up a scenario from over 200 years later in which technology has written the requiem of schools and human-teachers. We don’t have to live until the 2150s to be able to relate to this story.

In 2020, it is already relatable.

The story ends on a wistful note with Margie, the young protagonist, trying to picture herself heading to a concrete built-school with other children, and studying under the supervision of human-teachers, with all its attendant excitement and fun. She marvels at the human element that has been lost.

We are like Margie. However, the longing here has a different timbre to it. With eyes glued on the future, we are left wondering how much of “us” we would be losing to technology.

All these questions relating to man-machine conflict are particularly loud in the context of the workplace, with the most-asked question being: “Would we be losing something that is worth keeping forever?”

Two situations

The loss of the human element can affect one or two situations or both.

Situation one: The wisdom of doing nothing or just the most necessary thing, when the systems at one’s disposal are by default geared to get into an overdrive.

Situation two: The wisdom of intervening and effecting a positive outcome, when such intervention is not mandated by the rule-book. Let us look at the second situation, viewing it in the light of an example from the shipping industry.

Manoj Joy, a former sea-farer and founder-editor of Waves, a privately-circulated monthly magazine for the sea-faring community, has this to say about the impact of automation on sea-farers.

“In the shipping industry, work in the area of autonomous cargo ships is proceeding at a fast clip, and large-scale operations by such ships are likely to happen in this generation, or certainly the next. There are certain obvious advantages of going autonomous: the element of human error can be eliminated. Loss of lives due to natural calamities in the seas can be prevented. Piracy can be checked, as the design of these automated cargo ships are expected to be entirely cargo-focussed with no provisions for people to board them. They would likely be just “packed systems”, meant to give room only for the cargo that has to be transported. Moreover, pirates will not have any hostages to take.”

The human intervention

There are also arguments against autonomous cargo ships, and some of these are technological in nature.

Focussing on the human-related disadvantages, Manoj says, “There is the obvious question of how sea-farers would fare in this scenario. There are conflicting studies about loss of jobs, with some suggesting that the loss would not be significant, and others pointing in the opposite direction. However, as a former sea-farer, I know that certain human dynamics of sea-faring would be lost. Across the world, there are frequent cases of cargo ships rescuing those in distress while travelling in boats and any watercraft. The most well-known example is from 2015 when Captain Radhika Menon of the Indian Merchant Navy led a swift operation along with her crew aboard an oil tanker to save seven fishermen stuck in a boat with engine failure in the Bay of Bengal. Can you imagine an autonomous cargo ship taking the decision to rescue stranded fishermen and executing the operation? So, in my view, the prudent approach would be to automate cargo ships considerably, but not entirely divorce them from the human element.”

The second situation is that of knowing when not to do anything, and avoid unnecessary processes.

Again, there are examples to be drawn from many fields, and we will look at this question in the light of an example from the medical field.

The right process

Here is what Dr. A. Shaik Sulaiman Meeran, professor of internal medicine, Government Royapettah Hospital and Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai, has to say about achieving that human-technology balance.

“It is indeed commendable that AI-systems such as robotic surgery are bringing greater precision to medical treatment. However, amidst the technological advances, the need for that personal touch is still as important as ever before. There is no substitute for a thorough-going clinical examination, which should be carried out first, and followed by necessary investigations, as part of the right process. Let me put this in perspective for you. Many decades ago, clinical examination would be done thoroughly, as there weren’t many diagnostic tools at a doctor’s disposal and clinical examination was the key to diagnosis. Now, with the advance of technology, there are many tools to carry out investigations. The flip side of it is that doctors are becoming more investigation-dependent. It may be the result of a fear that something may be missed and the patient would turn a litigant. It may also be due to the fact that patients themselves expect investigations to be done early on. In the process, the skill of clinical examination is getting lost; and there is also the problem of patients going through needless investigations as a result of it. Despite the availability of investigative tools, doctors have to continue to hone the science-art of clinical examination — with AI-assisted systems already transforming the medical field, it is important to remind themselves of this cardinal truth.”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/how-much-of-us-can-be-lost/article30569672.ece
160,2020/01/14,The AI rush: Non-techies also take up machine-related courses,"In her mid-forties, C.S. Jyothirmayee enrolled for an 11-month programme in business analytics and data science, and the newly-acquired skill has brought a new dimension to her work.

“I use a lot of R and Python to carry out programming,” says 46-year-old Jyothirmayee.

In case you thought this was just another case of a tech professional taking things a notch higher in her profession, you could not be more wrong.

Jyothirmayee is a biotech professional focussing on patenting processes. “I now use data science in patent analytics and genomic research,” says Jyothirmayee. This may be counter-intuitive, but artificial intelligence, data science and many other tech-related specialisations are today as much for non-tech professionals as they are for techies.

There are figures to buttress this argument.

In the last one year, Simplilearn has witnessed a 30% growth in the number of non-techies taking up technical programmes including Machine Learning, Data Science, Cloud, DevOps engineer, cybersecurity and full-stack programming.

At Great Learning, close to 45% of enrolled students come from B.Sc, BBA, MBA, B.A, B.Com backgrounds, and this signifies increased interest in these specialisations.

At Masai School, an institute offering coding-centric learning, almost 70% of the candidates are from non-technological software backgrounds.

Irrespective of the educational background, one needs to have good aptitude — that is, logical reasoning and grounding in basic mathematics, says a spokesperson from Masai School. Similarly, Coursera’s ‘AI for everyone’ is also a non-technical course where beginners get to learn how to build AI projects.

“AI is not so much about coding as it is about coming up with creative models to solve your business problem and it is possible to build AI tools without typing a line of code,” says Usha Rengaraju, a data scientist who is also an AI consultant for start-ups. In certain fields that are essentially not technology-heavy, AI is making its presence felt.

A medical project

Sankara Eye Hospital in Bengaluru is working on projects to use AI in screening diabetic retinopathy, age-related Macular Degeneration and Glaucoma. The doctors working on the project have not taken up any formal training in AI, but understand how its works.

“We use AI to help analyse the data (images) to make certain decisions, in this case it presents normal vs abnormal images and we help it identify the level of abnormality and urgency of referral,” says Dr. Divyansh Mishra, consultant Vitreo-Retina and Ocular Oncology, Sankara Eye Hospital. “We are running the algorithm at screening camps where a trained optometrist captures a retinal image using a low-cost solution and feeds data into the AI platform to help it diagnose, counsel and refer the patients to the base hospital for further treatment.”

Vikram Raju, working in the “non-development” side of IT industry, has currently enrolled for a couple of courses relating to AI and machine learning.

Raju did not wait for the nudge from his company to upskill, and he is doing these courses just to be prepared for the future.

“I am also leading a team and it’s important for me to show them what they have to do,” says Raju. As he comes from a non-development background, how easy has it been for him to learn these new technologies?

“If I were to compare myself with those with a tech background who are also studying at the institute, initially what took them 30 minutes to learn, would take me 90 minutes. Now, I have improved a lot and I can complete in 45 minutes, what would take them 30 minutes to do,” he says.

Finding jobs

How employable are these non-tech graduates?

Hiring mangers say it is not easy to hire someone on the basis of a certificate they provide.

“The way to be employable is to show how they are able to implement what they have learnt, practically,” says Vinay Trivedi, HR Head, ToneTag. “Don’t just look at adding these new-age technologies to your CV without knowing how to incorporate them in your work,” says Trivedi.

Certification should be followed up with a few efforts, say HR professionals, and these include building one’s resume by going for coding challenges and hackathons where they get to work on real-life business situations; working on independent projects or trying to get an experience to build something based on algorithms; or, working on pro-bono projects.",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/jazsnl/article30569626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15OPAIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/the-ai-rush-non-techies-also-take-up-machine-related-courses/article30569627.ece
161,2020/01/14,Kento Momota faces two months out after a fatal car crash,"Badminton world No.1 Kento Momota could be out for two months after being injured in a car crash that killed his driver just hours after he won the Malaysia Masters on Sunday.

The 25-year-old Japanese shuttler, suffered cuts and bruising in the accident near Kuala Lumpur, but is aiming to return at the All England Championships on March 11, said Kinji Zeniya, secretary general of Japan’s Badminton Association on Tuesday.

Zeniya told reporters that Momota, who had won a record of 11 titles last year had extraordinary enthusiasm towards the Olympics this year in Tokyo, but urged Japan’s home gold medal hope to take time to recuperate fully.

“I hope he will do his best without pushing and rushing himself too hard and without being impatient,” said Zeniya.

Momota has been in hospital since Monday following the crash with a slow-moving lorry while driving to the airport.

The driver was killed at the scene while Momota received cuts to his face and bruising all over his body, Zeniya said, denying previous reports that he had broken his nose and chin.

An assistant coach, physiotherapist, and badminton official were also injured. Momota will return to Japan on Wednesday and would receive further medical checks.

“Cuts will be healed, but what will happen to the bruising later? I know injuries from car accidents can emerge after some time,” said Zeniya.

The accident came after the dominant Japanese star began his 2020 season in style with victory over Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen in Kuala Lumpur.

Momota enjoyed unrivalled success in 2019, winning a record of 11 titles including the World Championships, Asia Championships and All England Championships, a dramatic turnaround for a player who had been banned for gambling in 2016.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/g6c2c4/article30566408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THKENTOMOMOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/kento-momota-faces-two-months-out-after-a-fatal-car-crash/article30566409.ece
162,2020/01/14,Playing under pressure tougher than BCCI president’s job: Ganguly,"Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly says managing administration is a lot easier than being a player, as batting is mostly a one-chance game.

The former India captain was speaking during the Sportstar Aces Awards here on Monday.

Ganguly had no hesitation while responding to the question on what was tougher between being a player and BCCI president. “It was tougher playing under pressure, because it was one chance while batting, that was lot difficult. Here (as BCCI President) if I make a mistake, I come back next and get it rectified, there if you nicked (Glenn) McGrath outside the off stump,” said Ganguly.

From his time to now, Ganguly feels the pace of the game has changed. Sunil Gavsakar, who successfully stood up to some of the best fast bowlers of all time, also felt administration was easier.

“Yes, I did (hold the office of BCCI president) for a couple of months in 2014, when the Supreme Court appointed me president of the BCCI, IPL, I did it. It was easy,” Gavaskar said.

Gavaskar pointed to fitness when asked about the change in cricket over the years. “I think it’s the fitness. They (players) are much fitter than we were playing and much more stronger and they can hit the ball a fair distance. They are physically fit and agile,” Gavaskar said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/bp7g2e/article30565704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THSAURAVGANGULY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/playing-under-pressure-tougher-than-bcci-presidents-job-ganguly/article30565705.ece
163,2020/01/14,Solely Saina Nehwal’s decision to shift to Bangalore: Prakash Padukone Academy,"The Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) on Tuesday made it clear that it played no role in Saina Nehwal shifting from Gopichand Academy in Hyderabad to Bengaluru to train under Vimal Kumar ahead of the Rio Olympics, calling the move ‘sole decision’ of the ace shuttler.

Pullella Gopichand, in a chapter titled ‘Bitter Rivalry’ of an upcoming book ‘Dreams of a Billion: India and the Olympic Games’, revealed how miserable he felt when Nehwal decided to join Padukone’s academy to train under Vimal Kumar in Bengaluru after the 2014 World Championship.

Gopichand also said he felt hurt that Padukone, Vimal Kumar and Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) official Viren Rasquinha encouraged her to leave Hyderabad.

“PPBA did not have any role to play in Saina Nehwal’s decision to move to Bangalore and train at PPBA,” Padukone academy said in a statement. “However, Vimal Kumar did help Saina in her slump period that saw her attain World No.1 ranking, besides getting silver medal at the All England Championships and World Championships,” the statement added.

In the book, Gopichand also wondered why the legendary Padukone, India’s first badminton superstar never had anything positive to say about him.

In response to this, PPBA said, “PPBA has utmost regard for Gopichand’s contributions to Indian badminton as a player and a coach. We have also acknowledged Gopichand’s contribution to his wards’ successful performance at the world level and has always maintained good relations with him.”

Gopichand himself had trained under Padukone before deciding to work under coach Ganguly Prasad ahead of his All England victory in 2001.

“PPBA has been grooming players over the last 25 years and has always stood for supporting their interest in whatever way we can. We have too many players moving on from our Academy at various stages in their career. We have never believed in restricting their growth, and that will continue to be the academy’s policy. The sporting careers of international athletes competing at the highest levels is relatively short, therefore it is up to each player to decide whatever is in his/her interests and make the most of the opportunities available to achieve their respective goals during their peak period,” the Padukone academy said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/4p33h6/article30565199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THSAINANEHWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/solely-saina-nehwals-decision-to-shift-to-bangalore-prakash-padukone-academy/article30565200.ece
164,2020/01/14,Sania Mirza enters women’s doubles quarterfinals of Hobart International,"Sania Mirza made a winning return to the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) circuit by advancing to the women’s doubles quarterfinals of the Hobart International Tournament with Ukrainian partner Nadia Kichenok, here on Tuesday.

Returning to the court after two years, Mirza and Kichenok prevailed 2-6 7-6 (3) 10-3 over Oksana Kalashnikova of Georgia and Japan’s Miyu Kato in a contest lasting one hour and 41 minutes.

The Indo-Ukrainian pair will next be up against Americans Vania King and Christina McHale.

The US combination upstaged fourth-seeded Spainish duo of Georgina Garcia Perez and Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-2 7-5 in a round of 16 clash.

In an engaging showdown, Mirza and Kichenok weren’t off to a particularly good start as they double-faulted twice, failed to convert any of the seven break points that came their way and lost their serve two times to go down 2-6 in the opening set.

However, they pulled things back in the second set, helped by their rivals’ inconsistent game. Both the teams converted three break points, each as the set went into a tie-breaker in which Sania and Kichenok nosed ahead of their opponents to draw even. Mirza and Kichenok raised the bar in the final set and displayed superior returns to emerge triumphant.

During her two years away from the game, the 33-year-old Mirza battled injury breakdowns before taking a formal break in April 2018 to give birth to her son Izhaan.

Mirza last played at China Open in October 2017. A trailblazer in Indian tennis, Sania is a former world No.1 in doubles and has six Grand Slam titles to her credit. She retired from the singles competition in 2013 after becoming the most successful Indian woman tennis player. In 2007, she attained a career-high 27th position in the WTA singles chart.

165,2020/01/14,Panther rescued from trap in Nalgonda,"A leopard that fell into a trap laid by unidentified persons against wild boar menace in Nalgonda was rescued by officials of Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, on Tuesday.

According to locals of Ajillapuram Tanda in Marriguda mandal in the district, the wild cat was seen struggling after getting caught in a wire trap at around 7 a.m., and soon they informed the police and Forest officials.

The agriculture fields belonged to one Dharma Naik, who grows vegetables and other crops, and it was not clear as to who laid the trap, reportedly for wild boars. The trapped wild cat attracted a large number of visitors from in and around Ajillapuram, as videos of the scene went viral on social media.

Forest officials had ensured preliminary measures till rescue operations were launched, as they waited for a team of veterinarians from Hyderabad to carry out rescue operations.

According to a press release by the Curator, Nehru Zoological Park, the Hyderabad team led by Dr. Asadullah reached the site soon and tranquillised the animal.

The panther, aged about five years, had suffered injuries in the trap, and was shifted into a cage and transported to the veterinary hospital at the zoo. It was under medical care and supervision, and is stable .

167,2020/01/14,"Address traffic problems first, then focus on helmet rule, say citizens","Residents have been vehemently opposing the strict implementation of helmet rule in Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar limits as more accidents were caused due to non-availability of footpaths for pedestrians to walk, lack of traffic signals and no regulation of traffic at the islands.

In the wake of ensuing elections to MCK, the Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district unit had convened ‘People’s manifesto and voters awareness programme’ at Film Bhavan in the town on Tuesday. Participating in the discussion, a retired headmaster P Nagamohan said that wearing of helmets has become a bane to the motorists due to the congested roads and autorickshaw menace.

Referring to Gujarat State where the helmet rule was lifted in the towns, he asked: “Where is the need for strict enforcement of helmet rule in a small town like Karimnagar where the vehicle speed does not cross 10 kmph to 20 kmph.” If the police want to really enforce the helmet rule, first they should remove encroachments on footpaths including the district police headquarters shopping complex, ZP complex, Municipal complex and its guest house area and allow walking space for pedestrians so that the vehicles can move easily on the roads. Secondly, the police should also regulate the traffic at islands where the autorickshaws have become a big nuisance with haphazard parking causing traffic snarls, he suggested.

Yesu Reddy, a senior citizen, found fault with the traffic police for penalising the motorists not wearing helmets without providing basic facilities such as traffic signals, traffic signboards, zebra crossings etc on the roads. He also informed the traffic police to focus on overloading of autorickshaws, where at least three to five persons sit on the driver’s seat in autos. He also alleged that the police were according priority only to clicking pictures of motorists not wearing helmets and neglecting the traffic violators who were causing accidents in the town.

On this occasion, Lok Satta Udyama Samstha State coordinator Bandaru Rammohan Rao along with district president N Srinivas, secretary Prakash Holla, district leaders R Chandraprabhakar, K.S. Narayana, M Ganga Rao, Gangadhar,and others released People’s Manifesto.

The People’s Manifesto demands daily water supply in Karimnagar, maintenance and protection of parks, allocation of parking lots, shifting of roadside vendors to the model rythu bazaar to ease traffic congestion, setting up of libraries in every municipal park, daily collection of garbage from the houses free of cost without any charges, check on illegal constructions in the town, implementation of citizens charter, construction of public toilets and its maintenance etc.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/d1m7dp/article30569397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15PEOPLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/address-traffic-problems-first-then-focus-on-helmet-rule-say-citizens/article30569398.ece
168,2020/01/14,Shabbir demands action against Owaisi for seeking money for votes,"Former minister and senior Congress leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir has demanded the State Election Commission to take action against All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi for his statement asking people to seek money from the Congress party for their votes in municipal elections.

In a statement here, he alleged that Asaduddin Owaisi was provoking the voters to demand money for their votes and this is nothing but violation of election norms. He said everyone in Telangana knows it is the TRS and the AIMIM who pay money to buy votes.

“People know your price is more than ₹ 2,000. That’s why your assets have increased from ₹ 39.02 lakh in 2004 to ₹ 13 crore in 2019 (as per ECI Affidavit),” he said.

He advised Mr. Owaisi that before accusing others of accumulating wealth, he must clarify how his wealth multiplied manifold while voters of Hyderabad remained poor and backward. “Asaduddin Owaisi has turned into a multi-millionaire in 15 years. Can he explain how he accumulated so much of wealth?” he asked adding that people should visit the website of Election Commission of India to check the assets disclosed by MIM president in his election affidavits.

The former minister said Congress was fighting municipal elections on the issue of failure of TRS government in fulfilling the electoral promises and lack of development in urban local bodies in Telangana.

Mr. Shabbir Ali alleged that TRS and MIM have no respect for voters and they fix a price for each vote. They openly misuse the official machinery and there were allegations of cash transported by TRS leaders in police vehicles in Huzurnagar by-elections. Congress never indulged in such practices as it believes in free and fair elections, he said.

The Congress leader said Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has repeatedly insulted the Constitution and violated democratic norms by engineering defections of more than 50 MLAs, MLCs, MPs and other elected representatives but Mr. Owaisi was always silent on this.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/shabbir-demands-action-against-owaisi-for-seeking-money-for-votes/article30569175.ece

176,2020/01/14,KCR silent on Pothireddypadu for votes of YSR followers: Ponnala,"Former PCC president and senior Congress leader Ponnala Lakshmaiah has alleged that the Andhra Pradesh government has drawn additional water from Pothireddypadu head regulator for the last three years hurting the interests of Telangana but Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was silent on this.

In a statement here, he alleged that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was deliberately silent to secure votes of supporters of late Chief Minister, Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy in Telangana during the Assembly elections and now his meeting with Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was also to secure those votes in the municipal elections.

Mr Chandrasekhar Rao abused Mr. Rajashekara Reddy when he was alive and even after his death and his followers and YSR party activists have not forgotten those words, he said.

Congress faulted

Mr. Ponnala said when the previous Congress government allowed the withdrawal of 40,000 cusecs from 11,000 cusecs from Pothireddypady after Telangana needs were completed, KCR made a big issue and accused the Congress party of being servile to AP’s interests.

Similarly, he made a big issue when the Congress government prepared proposals and started work on the Dummugudem tailpond. But the same person is now talking of diverting Godavari waters to Krishna basin.

177,2020/01/14,Call to promote brotherhood to bring lasting peace to Bhainsa,"How can Bhainsa town, a communally sensitive place now in Nirmal district, have lasting peace? This question has started worrying all concerned after the current phase of violence which occurred after a lapse of about 11 years.

The town was earlier known as Mhaisa, derived from Mahishasur, the buffalo demon killed by goddess Durga. It was part of Nanded district in Maharashtra until 1956 when it was merged with the then Andhra Pradesh after reorganisation of States on linguistic basis.

The town is not more than a kilometre and half in radius with its old congested quarter and the newly developing housing area its east and west. The spread of any violence in the town is generally restricted to its old parts while there is less of disturbance in the new and comparatively expansive areas.

Job opportunities

“Despite the growth, unemployment is rampant,” affirms senior advocate in town C. Shankar. “The government can actually solve the riddle of communal violence by creating employment opportunities for youth,” he opined.

“Establish factories so that people from both communities can be employed. Togetherness in the place of employment will promote mutual empathy which in turn will foster friendliness,” he explained, as he delved into ways and means of ushering in lasting peace.

“We had promoted the ‘dostana’ concept among the youth of the two communities starting 2009 which gradually decreased policing and increased involvement of youth in local activities,” recalled Inspector General of Police (CID) P. Promod Kumar, who was then the Superintendent of Police of undivided Adilabad district and had the task of maintaining peace in the place. “We promoted sporting activities and created a mixed volunteer force which actually helped organise religious festivals here,” he added of the initiative of a decade ago.

Promoting friendship

The effort of Mr. Promod Kumar, who is among the officers overseeing return of peace in the trouble-torn areas currently, conceptually matches the proposal of the advocate. In fact, the former is planning to hold a meeting with officials to revive the dostana or friendship activity.

Former Municipal chairman and leader of the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen Jabir Ahmed wanted positioning of more number of policemen in town to ensure peace is lasting. Recalling the phase where the two communities had shunned the phase of mutual distrust about a decade ago, the MIM leader said officers with good intentions can make the difference.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ejhio6/article30568073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15BHAINSA9,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/call-to-promote-brotherhood-to-bring-lasting-peace-to-bhainsa/article30568075.ece
178,2020/01/14,"Chief secretaries of TS, AP to meet tomorrow in Vijayawada","The stage is being set for the meeting of the chief secretaries of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to resolve the pending issues relating to the AP Reorganisation Act 2014.

The first of the series of meetings is likely to be held in Vijayawada on January 16. The development follows an elaborate meeting Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had with his A.P. counterpart Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday where they announced their intent to amicably resolve the pending issues.

The proposed full-fledged meeting of the senior officials comes more than six months after the meeting of the chief advisers, chief secretaries and senior officials of the two States held on June 28. The chief secretaries of the two States met on October 9 in New Delhi and on November 4 in Hyderabad, but these meetings were aimed at resolving specific issues rather than addressing all the pending issues.

Division of assets

According to senior officials, there are more than 15 issues, including the division of assets and liabilities of the Schedule IX and Schedule X institutions pending resolution, and these issues are likely to be included in the agenda of the meeting. The other major reorganization issues included division of AP Bhavan in New Delhi, the apportionment of cash credit between the civil supplies corporations of the two States, power dues payable by Telangana power utilities to their counterparts in the neighbouring State and taxation anomalies.

The two States reached an agreement in respect of apportionment of cash credit and the Telangana government had decided to support AP in seeking adequate compensation from the Centre as assured in the Reorganisation Act.

Inter-State transfer

The Telangana government had also given its concurrence for the amendments to existing inter-State transfer policy of the employees while it is yet to give its consent for the transfer of over 700 Class III and Class IV employees working in AP Secretariat in Velagapudi and offices of the heads of departments there.

While the allocation of DSP and additional SP cadre officials and excise superintendents between the two States is almost completed, the stalemate over the division of employees of the power sector is still continuing.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5d4d5a/article30572200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15APCS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/chief-secretaries-of-ts-ap-to-meet-soon/article30567702.ece

180,2020/01/14,"Clash-hit Bhainsa peaceful, but not completely normal","Bhainsa in Nirmal district, which had witnessed communal clashes on Sunday night and Monday morning remained peaceful on Tuesday though normalcy did not seem to have returned completely. The local market was closed for the second consecutive day, but supply of fresh vegetables was hit only partially.

Peace descended upon the narrow lanes and bylanes after police made their presence felt by arresting over 40 persons accused of participating in arson and rioting. “More arrests will be made based on video footage identification of the culprits,” asserted Nirmal Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju even as he led a contingent of policemen marching into the interiors of the old town.

Fragile peace?

Peace, nevertheless, seemed to be fragile, more so given the history of violence in this semi-urban town. The fact that people from both communities continue to harbour mutual distrust makes peace tenuous, according to locals.

A three-company strong Rapid Action Force (RAF) staged a flag march in the violence hit areas of town in the morning driving home the message that the government means business when it comes to restoring peace. Senior police officers including Inspectors General of Police, North Zone Y. Nagi Reddy and CID P. Promod Kumar, Ramagundam Commissioner of Police V. Satyanarayana, Siddipet Commissioner of Police Joel Davis, Adilabad Superintendent of Police Vishnu S. Warrier, Kamareddy SP Shwetha Reddy and Rajanna Sircilla SP Rahul Hegde continued to man police operations in town.

People shop for essentials

Meanwhile, people moved around town freely making purchases of essentials like vegetables. The area around the office of local DSP was abuzz with activity since morning as it lies on a crucial junction between two important sections of town inhabited by the two communities at loggerheads.

181,2020/01/14,J&K Internet links partially restored,"The Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) administration issued orders late on Tuesday to partially restore broadband Internet facilities in Kashmir Valley and 2G mobile connectivity in five districts in Jammu region.

The order said there will be complete restriction on social media applications that may facilitate “peer to peer communication.”

On January 10, the Supreme Court had ordered the restoration of Internet for all essential services in J&K.

Internet connectivity has remained suspended in J&K since August 5 when Union Home Minister Amit Shah moved two Bills in the Rajya Sabha to revoke the special status of J&K under Article 370 and downgrade and bifurcate the State into Union Territories.

While in Jammu division, broadband Internet was restored last year, the Kashmir Valley remained without Internet. 844 e-terminals were set up in the Valley for general public.

The order said that The orders said the Kashmir administration would establish 400 additional Internet kiosks and directed service providers to provide “broadband facility” to all the institutions dealing with essential services, hospitals, banks, government offices, hotels, tour and travel establishments.

“Prior to giving such facility, the lnternet Service Providers shall install necessary firewalls and carry out ‘white-listing‘ of sites that would enable access to Government websites,websites dealing with essential services, e-banking, etc. excluding, however, all the social media sites. To amplify, there shall be complete restriction on social media applications allowing peer to peer communication and virtual private network applications for the time being,” the order issued by Shaleen Kabra, Principal Secretary, Home Department, J&K said.

Earlier this month, the J&K administration had announced that it was restoring broadband Internet facilities in hospitals, schools and other facilities.

“2G mobile connectivity on post paid mobiles for accessing white-listed sites, including for e banking, shall be allowed, to begin with, in the districts of Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Reasi. However, in the other districts, the mobile Internet connectivity should remain suspended,” the order said.

The order said that the Institutions and Government offices that will be provided Internet access shall be “responsible to prevent any misuse, for which they shall take all the necessary precautions, including appointment of nodal officers, keeping a record of persons/devices, managing and monitoring day to day usage, changing accessibility credentials on a daily basis and ensure internet availability to only authorized users, etc.”

Complying with the Supreme Court directions on January 10, the order stated the reasons for suspending the Internet.

It said that terror modules, separatists, anti national elements operating in the UT of J&K are attempting to aid and incite people by transmission of fake news and targeted messages through use of Internet to propagate terrorism and cause disaffection and discontent.

The order said that based on the intelligence inputs, “the law enforcement agencies while detailing the present situation, have inter alia reported about the sustained efforts being made by the terrorists to infiltrate from across the border, re-activate their cadres and scale up anti-national activities in Kashmir Division as well as terrorism affected areas of the Jammu Division, by communicating effectively with their operatives through Voice on Internet Protocol (VOIP) and encrypted mobile communication through various social media applications to co ordinate and plan terror acts.”

It said that the misuse of data services by anti-national elements has the potential to cause large scale violence and disturb public order which has till now been maintained due to various pre-emptive measures, including restrictions on access to Internet with relaxations in a calibrated and gradual manner, after due consideration of the ground situation.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/h61g2s/article30570030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JampKINTERNET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/broadband-2g-internet-partially-restored-in-jammu-and-kashmir/article30570031.ece
182,2020/01/14,Congress giving clean chit to Pakistan: Ram Madhav,"BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav alleged on Tuesday that the Congress had tried to give a clean chit to Pakistan in the Pulwama terror attack by casting doubts on the integrity of the security forces.

“Congress leaders are trying to put question marks on the integrity of brave security forces, which is protecting the country by putting their lives at risk in Kashmir, when one police personnel is found involved in a crime,” said Mr. Madhav, commenting on the controversy around Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davidner Singh escorting militants to New Delhi.

“The Pulwama attack in which large numbers of security personnel were killed was perpetrated by Pakistan sponsored terrorists. From the tweets of Congress leaders it appears that attempts are being made by the opposition leaders to defend Pakistan,” he contended.

The BJP leader said the Opposition had gone ‘too far’ this time in its attempts to tarnish the image of country in world.

“In the last five years, Opposition has sought proofs in terrorist attacks in Kashmir even though Modiji had given sufficient evidence about Pakistan’s role. Opposition parties have become desperate whenever anyone raises finger of suspicion towards Pakistan. The opposition of Congress to CAA is part of its pro-Pakistan mindset,” he asserted.

“It is not for the first time the Opposition resorted to such an act. When Pakistan sponsored terrorists attacked Mumbai in which citizens of six countries were killed, Congress leaders had said RSS had a hand in the attack,” claimed Mr. Madhav.

On the controversy surrounding the CAA, the senior BJP leader contended that opposition political parties and some intellectual groups were busy making the Citizenship (Amendment) Act look controversial although the amendment was ‘non-controversial and non-discriminatory.’

“In reality, those who are opposing CAA do not know why they are opposing. The CAA is not an Act, but an amended edition of Citizenship Act 1955. Due to some historical reasons, it is just an attempt to fast-track the accordance of citizenship to minority population including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians living in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” he asserted.

He accused the opposition parties of acting against the very nature and character of the country, which has always given shelter and support to refugees. Ever since BJP launched a programme to explain CAA to people, thousands of people have come in support of the party, he said.

When asked about pending cases pertaining to the CAA in court, Mr. Madhav said, “Supreme Court is going to take up all cases related to CAA on January 22. We are confident that whatever we have done is perfectly legal and fully as per our Constitution. If anyone wants to go to court against CAA, they are free to do, but we are confident court would certainly see constitutional validity of our action.

“All these are happening because the Opposition is frustrated. They do not have guts to confront political and development programmes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi politically,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yogxq5/article30568912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RamMadhav-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congress-giving-clean-chit-to-pakistan-ram-madhav/article30568907.ece
183,2020/01/14,Consensus emerges for Tripura BJP chief post,"The Tripura BJP will have a new president with the nomination process ending on Tuesday. Manik Saha, a dental surgeon, emerged as the consensus candidate for the top job.

A formal announcement would be made on Wednesday.

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb is continuing as State party chief since his appointment in January 2016. Under his command, the BJP and its ally IPFT won the Assembly elections held in February 2018 ending 25 years of uninterrupted rule of the CPI(M)-led Left Front.

It was expected that West Tripura MP Pratima Bhowmik and State vice-president Rajib Bhattacharjee would contest but they backed out.

Party insiders said Dr. Manik Saha’s nomination was the fallout of a consensus arrangement reached in consultation with the central leadership. The Chief Minister also endorsed his candidature.

Dr. Saha began his political innings only after joining the BJP ahead of the 2018 Assembly elections. The coalition government had appointed him Secretary of the Tripura Sports Council, but shifted him to the Tripura Cricket Association as its president.

184,2020/01/14,"Shivaji book row: Descendant, BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale, ticks of Sena, NCP","Remarking that no political leader was tall enough to merit comparison with Chhatrapati Shivaji, direct descendant, former MP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Udayanraje Bhosale on Tuesday attacked the ruling Shiv Sena by asking why the Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s photo was placed above that of the Maratha king at the Sena Bhavan in Mumbai.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Bhosale, who had conspicuously remained silent over the row triggered by the publication of the BJP booklet Aaj ke Shivaji Narendra Modi, targeted his own party members for coming out with an outrageous book that dared to compare Shivaji with the Prime Minister.

“Shivaji Maharaj is a universal inspiration… no one is tall enough to be compared with him,” asserted Mr. Bhosale, the 13th direct descendant of the Maratha king. “Have some people taken leave of their senses by comparing him with the Prime Minister,” he wondered aloud

He, however, reserved his most withering criticism for the Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) who, along with the Congress, have formed the ‘Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’ (MVA) government in the State.

“Just take a look at the Shiv Sena Bhavan (the party’s headquarters in Mumbai)... look whose image (Bal Thackeray’s) is placed above, whose photo is placed below (Shivaji’s),” said Mr. Bhosale, brandishing photos of the ruling coalition partner’s office in Dadar.

The Sena, which claims to be a party built on Shivaji’s ideals, should change its name to ‘Thackeray Sena’, he caustically remarked.

“Remove ‘Shiv’ (Shivaji) from ‘Shiv Sena’ and then let me see how many youths flock to your standards… this is the party which had orchestrated riots in King Shivaji’s name,” said Mr. Bhosale, a former three-term MP, who had quit the NCP to join the BJP ahead of the State Assembly polls last year.

Mr. Bhosale’s remarks were a riposte to Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s recent jibes directed at the former.

Questioning their ‘silence’, Mr. Raut had demanded that the descendants of Shivaji including BJP MLA Shivendraraje Bhosale, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Bhosale and Mr. Udayanraje, speak up against their party on the booklet row.

The book, penned by BJP leader Jai Bhagwan Goyal, triggered a storm of condemnation across Maharashtra, with a number of protests and effigy-burning demonstrations being held by the Sena, the NCP and the Congress whose activists filed multiple police complaints against Mr. Goyal in different districts of the State.

Mr. Bhosale, who was one of only four elected NCP MPs in Maharashtra in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, had resigned his post to join the BJP. However, in the Satara Lok Sabha bye-election, he lost to senior NCP leader and former Sikkim Governor, Shriniwas Patil.

A maverick politician known for his hell-raising antics throughout the district, Mr. Bhosale’s defection to the BJP is expected to bolster the saffron party’s standing with the Maratha community.

“When you’ll [the Sena leadership] christened your party as ‘Shiv Sena’, did you people then bother to ask Shivaji’s descendants,” Mr. Bhosale shot back at Mr. Raut.

Lashing out at the opportunistic nature of the MVA government and Mr. Raut’s role in forging an alliance with the NCP-Congress, Mr. Bhosale remarked that the BJP did not “run after power like dogs”.

In a veiled jibe at NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he said referring to someone using the epithet ‘Jaanta Raja’ (the wise king) was tantamount to belittling the Maratha king and that only the 17th century ruler had claim to the title of ‘Jaanta Raja.’

Mr. Pawar has often been attracted the epithet in political circles — a point which some BJP leaders including former Maharashtra minister Sudhir Mungantiwar seized on while defending Mr. Goyal’s booklet and criticising the Sena for its double-standards on the booklet equating Shivaji with Mr. Modi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mtbata/article30567773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UDAYANRAJEBHOSALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shivaji-book-row-descendant-bjp-leader-udayanraje-bhosale-ticks-of-sena-ncp/article30567774.ece

189,2020/01/14,Former associate’s brother killed by Naxals in Chhattisgarh,"Naxals killed the younger brother of a former associate, who is now working with the police in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district, police said on Tuesday.

Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava mentioned that Laxman Mandavi (26), a resident of Duvalikarka village, was stabbed to death with sharp weapons at his native place late Monday night.

He also said that, Mr. Mandavi’s brother quit the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI) last year and joined the police force, which apparently angered the rebels.

As per preliminary information, over a dozen Naxals reached the village and then sent some lower rung cadres to bring Mr. Mandavi out of his house before killing him in a nearby forest.

Some villagers spotted the body on Tuesday morning and alerted the police who rushed to the forest. The body was sent for postmortem and later handed over to relatives.

A manhunt was launched to nab the assailants. The deceased’s elder brother Baman Mandavi, who was associated with Maoists since 2008, surrendered before police in October last year.

He was active as the deputy commander of a military platoon of Maoists at that time and was carrying a reward of ₹3,00,000 on his head, the official said, adding that he later joined the police force in Dantewada.

“Naxals are losing their foothold and the trust of tribal people. Therefore, they are committing such crimes out of desperation and targeting relatives of their associates who have surrendered,” Mr. Pallava said.

Some Maoist pamphlets were also recovered from the spot in which ultras warned to avenge the killing of their senior cadres - Varghese and Linga, in encounters by security forces, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chhattisgarh-naxals-kill-former-associates-brother/article30567097.ece
190,2020/01/14,Arunachal students’ union asks government to conduct survey to ascertain number of refugees in State,"The All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU) has asked the Pema Khandu government to conduct a comprehensive survey to ascertain the number of refugees in the State.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), made such a survey necessary though the government had claimed that the State was exempted from the purview of the amended law, the union said.

Arunachal Pradesh has three sets of refugees — the Bangladesh-origin Buddhist Chakmas and Hindu Hajongs who stay together and the Buddhist Tibetans.

“We welcome Chief Minister Pema Khandu’s statement in the Assembly that the government would fight a legal battle against the granting of citizenship to the Chakma-Hajong refugees. We have also taken note of his assertion that neither the refugees can apply for citizenship nor the government can process their applications as Arunachal Pradesh is exempted from the CAA,” AAPSU president Hawa Bagang said.

But the union underlined the ‘discrepancy’ about the number of refugees that the authorities had been providing. “A comprehensive survey is thus required to clear the confusion,” one of its spokespersons said.

On January 8, Mr. Khandu told the 60-member Assembly that the State government had challenged the Supreme Court’s judgement on September 17, 2015, granting citizenship to the Chakma-Hajongs. But the apex court dismissed the government’s review petition on October 26 that year.

“The Supreme Court admitted a special leave petition that the State government had filed on September 14, 2016. The hearing is awaited,” he had said.

The Chief Minister had also reminded the House that the deputy commissioners of three districts had conducted a special survey of the Chakmas and the Hajongs in 2015-16.

191,2020/01/14,CAA will fix unresolved issues of Assam Accord: Himanta Biswa Sarma,"Assam Health and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019 has been implemented to address the unresolved issues of the Assam Accord of 1985.

The government had no intention to go against the spirit of the accord, he insisted while speaking at a special session of the 126-member State Assembly on Monday evening to discuss issues arising out of the ongoing anti-CAA protests in Assam.

“The Citizenship Act was amended not to dilute the spirit of the Assam Accord but to address some of its unresolved issues,” he said.

Pointing out certain “gaps” left while amending the Citizenship Act in 1983, 1997 and 2003, he said the cut-off date for the detection and deportation of illegal migrants was 1966 and not 1971 according to the “only four-page” accord.

“The accord did not incorporate many issues that evolved gradually... The cut-off date of 1971 was just a provision for those who came to Assam after 1967 and declared before foreigners’ registration officers that they were from Bangladesh,” he stated.

The accord was violated when a provision was added that the names of the 1967-1971 stream of foreigners would be kept out of the electoral rolls for 10 years after which they would be regularised. The fear among the people that the CAA would bring in millions of people needed to be dispelled, he said. He called for patience till the rules for the CAA are framed.

“We can adopt a resolution in the Assembly to make the CAA more stringent once the rules are framed. We can also resolve that the date of December 31, 2014 (cut-off for CAA beneficiaries belonging to six non-Muslim communities) can never be extended,” he said. The CAA would not benefit more than 5 lakh people in Assam. ""I will quit politics if the figure is more than that,” he added.

AASU's chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharyya said, “No matter how much the government justifies the CAA, Assam cannot be burdened with even one illegal migrant from 1971 to 2014. Clause 6 of the Accord was thought of for providing constitutional safeguards to the indigenous people because Assam had to take the burden of illegal migrants up to March 24, 1971.”

Facebook live streaming row

The Opposition parties lodged complaints with Assembly Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami for the Facebook live from the House during the Monday special session and Mr. Goswami has ordered a probe into the issue.

All India United Democratic Front MLA Aminul Islam told the Speaker in a note, “The speech of the Minister is going on Facebook Live for which you once suspended me from the august House.”

On February 6, 2017, Mr. Goswami suspended Mr. Islam for three days for using Facebook Live to telecast his speech from inside the House. “Aminul Islam is suspended till February 8. I request Islam to leave the House immediately,” he had said.

Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia and fellow party MLA Rakibul Hussain also raised the issue in the House on Monday.

Paddy for legal fight

Farmers in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh district have deposited 45,000 kg of rice at a local office of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) to be sold for funding the legal battle against the CAA in the Supreme Court.

The court is scheduled to hear on January 22 a set of cases filed by the AASU and other organisations and individuals against the CAA.

Local leaders said each household in 85 revenue villages in the Sasoni area pledged 4 kg of paddy for challenging the CAA in court. A few villages remain to be covered for collecting a targeted 60,000 kg of rice.

Anjan Neog, a leader of the Dibrugarh district unit of the AASU, said the paddy would be sold to local traders during a mass protest on January 18.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-will-fix-unresolved-issues-of-assam-accord-minister/article30566037.ece

193,2020/01/14,11 killed as multiple avalanches hit Kashmir,"Five soldiers and six civilians were killed as multiple snow avalanches descended on several posts of the Army and the Border Security Force along the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir and residential areas in Central Kashmir in the past 24 hours.

An official said a post, manned by five soldiers, was hit by an avalanche in Kupwara’s Macchil sector on Monday night. “Three soldiers were brought dead. The body of the fourth missing soldier was spotted late on Tuesday afternoon. However, one jawan was rescued alive,” said an official.

In another avalanche, snow buried four jawans in a BSF post at Jabri area along the LoC in Kupwara’s Nowgam sector. The Army was able to rescue all of them. However, one BSF jawan died. The cause of death is suspected to be cardiac arrest, an official said.

An Army patrol was also hit by an avalanche in Gurez’s Kanzalwan area in Bandipora district. However, there were no reports of any casualty. In central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, two major avalanches buried around 17 people alive.

“Two houses were buried under snow on Monday evening in Ganderbal’s Kulan area. An immediate rescue operation was initiated and around 12 people were saved. However, around 5.30 p.m. another avalanche buried pedestrians on a walkway. Five bodies were retrieved,” said Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Ganderbal, Khalil Poswal.

194,2020/01/14,"‘You are a Hindu, why are you friends with Muslims’, police asked me while in custody, says activist","“You are a Hindu, why are you friends with Muslims.” This is what the Uttar Pradesh police allegedly told Robin Verma, an activist and teacher, who was arrested in connection with the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Lucknow on December 20, 2019.

Released from the Lucknow district jail on Tuesday after being granted bail last week, Mr. Verma narrated his ordeal to The Hindu and alleged that police physically tortured and insulted him and even threatened to degrade his wife and infant daughter.

Mr. Verma said police scanned his phone, which is still in their custody along with his driver’s licence, and insulted him for having Muslims on his contact list and WhatsApp chats.

“A [Muslim] student of mine had wished me on my birthday. They saw the message and asked me why do you know him. Why do you have Muslim names on your phone list? Why are you friends with them? Why do you go with them,” Mr. Verma said.

He alleged the police made degrading remarks about his wife and two-year-old daughter. “Bitha denge kahin, dhande mein laga denge, they said about my wife (We will make your wife a prostitute, we will place her somewhere),” the police allegedly told Mr. Verma. “They would do the same with my two-year-old daughter. The said they would ruin me and my family.”

Mr. Verma was picked up by plainclothes policemen along with this reporter from a restaurant in Hazratganj in the State capital on December 20 around 6.45 p.m., a day after violence during protests against the CAA here.

Kicked and punched

Mr. Verma alleged he was first taken to the Hazratganj police station and beaten up, before being thrashed twice at the Sultanganj police outpost and once again at the Hazratganj police station.

“They kicked me, punched me, hit me with lathis, slapped me, beat me with a thick leather belt and also plucked out my hair,” said Mr. Verma. His finger was injured during the torture. “All those who beat me were in plainclothes,” he said.

Mr. Verma was not named in the FIR lodged at Hazratganj police station but later booked under the same charges, including rioting, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and damage to public property.

He rejected the police charge.

“I did nothing wrong. If opposing a law is wrong, and if that law is unconstitutional and oppresses the poor people of the country, I was only opposing that,” he said.

Mr. Verma said the police denied him a blanket, food and water during his detention at the Hazratganj police station and abused him when he asked them to inform his family about his whereabouts.

He, however, was relieved to get bail. “I have faith in the judiciary and the constitution,” Mr. Verma said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/11dres/article30565298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Robin-Verma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-protest-you-are-a-hindu-why-are-you-friends-with-muslims-police-asked-activist-in-police-custody/article30565299.ece
195,2020/01/14,BJP booklet comparing Modi to Shivaji triggers protests in Maharashtra,"The depiction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “latter-day King Shivaji” in a booklet of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sparked protests across the State and demands that the party immediately withdraw it and halt further publication.

Aaj ke Shivaji, Narendra Modi, written by Jai Prakash Goyal, BJP leader and president of the United Hindu Front (an umbrella body of fringe right-wing outfits), provoked the ire of pro-Maratha outfits such as the Sambhaji Brigade. Shivendraraje Bhosale, BJP legislator from Satara and direct descendant of the Maratha warrior king, urged his party superiors to rein in “overzealous” activists like Mr. Goyal.

“No one can be mentioned in the same breath as Chhatrapati Shivaji… I’m sure Prime Minister Modi understands the feelings of the people of Maharashtra. While I don’t think that he has urged anyone to compare himself with Chhatrapati Shivaji, the publication of this booklet has given political ammunition to the opposition,” said Mr. Bhosale, speaking in Satara.

He urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to look into the affair and halt the printing of further copies of the booklet. “Unfortunately, there are overzealous activists [within the BJP] as a result of which the party leadership has to face opprobrium. I urge party seniors to rein in such activists and stop publication and distribution of the booklet,” said Mr. Bhosale, who had quit the NCP to join the BJP before the Assembly polls in October last year.

The Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) staged protests in Nashik, Kolhapur and Osmanabad, while members of the Sambhaji Brigade held a demonstration against the BJP near Lal Mahal, the legendary palace in Pune where king Shivaji lived as a child along with his mother, Rajmata Jijabai.

“If the BJP does not withdraw this booklet within a week, then the brigade will ensure that not a single BJP office is left standing in Maharashtra,” warned its leader Santosh Shinde. The outfit also demanded that Shivaji’s 13th descendant, ex-Satara MP and BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale, spell out his stance on the issue.

Members of the brigade also burnt effigies of Mr. Goyal in Solapur, while a police complaint against the BJP leader was lodged by a Sena activist in Solapur’s Faujdar Chavadi police station.

Complaint against author

“By comparing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Prime Minister Modi, the author has insulted the great Maratha king and hurt sentiments of all Shiv premis and Shiv bhakts across the country,” said Dinkar Jagdale, the Sena activist who lodged a complaint with the police.

Meanwhile, irate corporators and municipal councillors from the Sena staged a demonstration in Nashik by blackening posters showing Mr. Goyal releasing the booklet and then burning them.

“This booklet should not have been published in the first place…when Mr. Modi was called lord Vishnu’s “eleventh avatar”, we kept quiet. Then came yet another hyperbole likening him to Peshwa Bajirao I and the outrageous epithet of ‘Father of the Nation’. But now, likening him with king Shivaji has taken matters too far,” said a Sena leader from Nashik. The Sena further warned that they would burn copies of the booklet if found in any store across the State.

Protests were also staged by students ofFergusson College, who condemned the mindset of the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and right-wing parties.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8tmpja/article30564867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMCHHATRAPATISHIVAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-booklet-comparing-modi-to-shivaji-triggers-protests-in-state/article30564871.ece

The accused, not yet identified, also hit the cars parked outside in their attempt to escape.

One of the injured, Vinay Vats, sustained two bullet injuries in the right hand, while Pawan and Vineet were hit in their legs. Mr. Pawan is a resident of Sector 47 and Mr. Vineet stays in Sector 7.

The accused, in a white Sports Utility Vehicle, gatecrashed the function hosted by Ajay Vats for his friends and relatives around 11 p.m. The accused asked the photographer to click their pictures and one of them picked a bottle from the drinks table. At this, Mr. Ajay Vats accosted the young man and asked him about his identity. The young man, however, pushed him off and tried to escape. But Mr. Ajay Vats’s brother Mr. Vinay Vats, caught him. One of the accomplices of the young man took out a pistol and allegedly fired two shots, hitting Mr. Vinay Vats in his right shoulder. Surrounded by the guests, the five, in a bid to escape, then opened indiscriminate fire hitting Mr. Pawan and Mr. Vineet.

The accused then drove off towards House No. 85, but were forced to take a U-turn with the road blocked due to another Lohri function.

197,2020/01/14,"Had Assam govt been given full responsibility of NRC updation, it would’ve been error-free: Sonowal","Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the Supreme Court-monitored National Register of Citizens in Assam would have been a “correct NRC” had the full responsibility of its updation been given to the State government.

Replying to the debate on Governor’s Speech during the one-day special session of the Assam Assembly on Monday, Mr. Sonowal also said people need not fear the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as the government will not do anything against their interests.

“The BJP wants a correct NRC. If the Assam government had got full responsibility of the NRC upgrade work, then I can tell it with confidence that it would have been a correct NRC,” he told the House.

As the mammoth NRC exercise was carried out under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court, the State had no role to play in its upgrade process, Mr. Sonowal said in his over an hour long speech that ended post midnight.

“The Assam government only provided the service of 55,000 of its employees and the police force for the security purpose,” he added.

The final NRC was published on August 31 last year by excluding 19,06,657 persons. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.

Talking about the CAA, the chief minister said the people were protesting because misinformation regarding the Act was being fed to them.

“The number floating is just imaginary about how many people will apply for citizenship. The CAA is a national Act and entire India will implement it. Please do not get apprehensive about the Act. The rules are not framed yet and we have given our suggestions,” he said.

He stressed that after people apply for the citizenship, all applications will be examined and all of the applicants may not get citizenship.

“I respect AASU as I am a product of that organisation. But no one should spread misinformation. Indigenous people will be given land rights and the definition of indigenous will also be decided. All the people are safe in our government.”

“I cannot think of betraying mother Assam. How can people think about it?... We have studied the Act. Those people living here for decades will apply and talk about their mind... Please don’t doubt the government unnecessarily,” Mr. Sonowal said.

“I appeal to the opposition parties to leave aside petty politics and lead with correct information. I also assure the people that we will not make you weak. We will make you the strongest community in India,” he said, reiterating his position of safeguarding the culture, identity and language of Assam.

198,2020/01/14,Will leave politics if a single person over five lakh is given citizenship in Assam: Hemanta Biswa Sarma,"Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on January 13 said he will leave politics if a single person over five lakh is given citizenship in the state.

Referring to the “rising” Muslim population, he said, “Ajmal or his son or his grandson will be the Assam chief minister after 30 years and no one can stop it.”

Speaking in support of granting citizenship to Hindus, Mr. Sarma, who is also the chief of NEDA, BJP’s version of the NDA in the northeast, said a Hindu “cannot be a Jinnah as he never attacks anyone” and is secular.

The minister was speaking during the debate on the governor’s address in the one-day special session of Assam Assembly.

He said the amended citizenship law will not violate the Assam Accord.

“I’ll leave politics if one person more than five lakh is given citizenship. If a single person is added beyond five lakh, the Assam government will take responsibility,” the finance minister said.

He also supported granting of citizenship to Hindu Bengalis, which is being vehemently protested against by various outfits.

“A Hindu cannot be a Jinnah. Not a single Hindu king has destroyed a mosque or a temple. A Hindu is always secular and does not attack anyone,” Mr. Sarma said.

“In Assam Accord, many things were left unresolved... We haven’t violated the Assam Accord, but are addressing unresolved issues,” he added.

The historic Accord, which was signed after the six-year long Assam Agitation, was a four-page document that did not include many things, Mr. Sarma claimed.

The minister advocated formation of an assembly committee to study the Assam Accord in detail to find out its deficiencies and unresolved issues.

“Even the NRC was not part of Assam Accord. It was evolved in a meeting between the AASU, Assam government and the Centre in 2005. The Assam Accord didn’t speak about children of those coming before 1971, so it’s inconclusive,” he added.

The Citizenship Act was amended in 1987, 1993 and 2003; and the spirit of the Accord was touched many times earlier than the CAA this time, the minister said.

“The Assam Accord is not that bad. If we had read it properly, 1966 would have been the cut off year and 1967 voter list would have been the NRC. I regret that,” he claimed, citing the Clause 5 of the pact.

He alleged that the ongoing agitation against the CAA is driven by misinformation that over one crore Hindu Bangladeshis will enter Assam.

“Who is this Pramanik in Bangladesh saying 2.5 crore people will come to Assam? Is there a conspiracy to destabilise Assam? There are many Islamic fundamentals working to destabilise Assam,” Mr. Sarma claimed.

He stressed that Hindu Bengalis will not affect the culture of Assam as there are many examples of Assamese marrying Bengalis.

“Assamese nationalism cannot be based on language. It’ll be on the love for the land. For example, we don’t speak Mising language but they are part of Assamese nationalism. The theory that Hindu Bengalis will destroy Assamese culture is wrong,” the minister added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vpkhgs/article22339517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THHEMANTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-leave-politics-if-a-single-person-over-five-lakh-is-given-citizenship-in-assam-hemanta-biswa-sarma/article30562807.ece

Mr. Rahman had announced his resignation in December 2019, when the the Citizenship Amendment Bill was on its way to being approved in Parliament.

202,2020/01/14,Inscriptions confirm presence of two medieval monasteries at Moghalmari,"A study of inscriptions on clay tablets recovered from recent excavations at Moghalmari, a Buddhist monastic site of the early medieval period in West Bengal’s Paschim Medinipur district, have confirmed the presence of two monasteries — Mugalayikaviharika and Yajñapindikamahavihara.

Details of the study of these inscriptions were published earlier this month in PratnaSamiskha, a leading peer-reviewed journal from Bengal on Indian Archaeology.

“The presence of two monasteries dating to the same period within a single compound is unique in eastern India. Earlier excavations had indicated the presence of two monasteries on the basis of the structural plan,” Rajat Sanyal, who deciphered these inscriptions, and is the author of the paper, told The Hindu.

Prof. Sanyal, who is associated with the Department of Archaeology, University of Calcutta, was a member of all the six seasons of excavations carried out at the site by the university. The monasteries at Moghalmari date from 6th century CE and were functional till the 12th century CE.

Tiny fragments

During one of the later seasons of excavations by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, Government of West Bengal, six tiny fragments of inscribed seals were found. “Each of them contained a set of letters accompanied by the deer-dharmachakra symbols. We had to arrange them through different permutations to read and make sense of names inscribed on these tablets,” Prof. Sanyal said.

The inscriptions are in Sanskrit and the script is a transitional phase between later north Indian Brahmi and early Siddhamatrika.

The first name Yajñapindikamahavihara, implying etymologically ‘a place of sacrificial offering’ is of special significance. The second name on the seals, Mugalayikaviharika, bears a phonetic resemblance to the modern name of the site, Moghalmari.

In Xuanzang’s travels

Archaeologists and historians point out that famous Chinese traveller Xuanzang (more widely identified as Huen Tsang), who visited India in the 7th century CE, referred to the existence of ‘ten monasteries’ within the limits of Tamralipta (modern day Tamluk in adjoining Purba Medinipur district). However, he did not refer to any specific name or location.

With the discovery of the site and the deciphering of the inscriptions, at least two of these monasteries are now identified, Prof. Sanyal said. He added that it was known from Buddhist texts that Buddhist monasteries have a definite hierarchy — Mahavihara, Vihara and Viharika — which is reflected in the inscriptions found.

“The study provides the only contextual epigraphical proof for the existence of a viharika (Mugalayikaviharika in this case) as early as the 6th century in this part of the subcontinent,” Prof. Sanyal said. The study of the inscribed seals suggests that the monastery was called Mugalayikaviharika. Its continuation in the modern name of the area “still remains a riddle which needs more careful inspection and study,” he said. “Apparently, the name Mugalayika suggests a fair connection to the modern place-name Moghalmari,” he added.

In his paper, Prof. Sanyal refers to L.S.S. O’Malley’s gazetteer of 1911, where the name Moghalmari is said to trace its name to a medieval battle between the Mughals and Pathans, sometime in the 16th or early 17th century. “It is difficult to ascertain if the name written on the seals indeed represents an early toponym of the modern village of Moghalmari.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uzf8f8/article30562579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14SITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/inscriptions-confirm-presence-of-two-medieval-monasteries-at-moghalmari/article30562580.ece
203,2020/01/14,State forms committee to look into claims of irregularities at SARTHI,"The State government has appointed a committee under Relief and Rehabilitation secretary Kishor Raje-Nimbalkar to inquire into the alleged irregularities in the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI), Pune.

This is the first official probe launched by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government into the functioning of the previous government.

SARTHI is registered under the Companies Act, 2013, as a non-profit government company for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and education development of Maratha, Maratha-Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha, Kunbi communities and the families dependent on agriculture.

It was formed by the previous government on the lines of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute aimed at providing opportunities to the youth from the Scheduled Caste community.

Rajya Sabha MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje went on a one-day hunger strike in Pune last week, alleging attempts to cancel the autonomous status of SARTHI, and various other irregularities. Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had visited him, promising the removal of department secretary J.P. Gupta and swift action in the matter.

CM, Pawar take review

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar met to review SARTHI. “Prima facie, the review has found several irregularities which have not been addressed in an official manner. It was found necessary to conduct a thorough probe into the functioning of SARTHI,” said an official privy to the developments.

Mr. Raje-Nimbalkar has been tasked with conducting the inquiry and submitting a report to the government within 10 days.

204,2020/01/14,Organic turmeric to weed out marijuana in Malkangiri,"Organic turmeric is all set to weed out illegal marijuana cultivation in remote areas of Swabhiman Anchal in Odisha’s Malkangiri district.

The Malkangiri district administration has initiated a project to dissuade the region’s tribals from illegal ganja cultivation by promoting organic turmeric as a profitable cash crop.

Lack of communication and poverty were the reasons behind illegal ganja cultivation. Drug mafias from outside are alleged to be financing ganja plantations in the area. Ganja also provides some easy money.

A survey in 2019 by the Malkangiri district administration revealed that almost all tribal families grow turmeric for their consumption. But it was not cultivated commercially despite suitable climate and geographical conditions. “So we thought organic turmeric can be the tool of economic development for poor tribals as well as cash crop alternative of ganja,” said Malkangiri Collector Manish Agarwal. According to him, each acre of organic turmeric can provide ₹70,000 to 80,000 income.

Horticulture and Agriculture departments are implementing the project. Interested farmers have already registered themselves for scientific training.

205,2020/01/14,Call to burn CAA copies in Bihu bonfires in Assam,"Assam’s mid-January festival of feasting is expected to be a fiery political statement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Various organisations and individuals have appealed to revellers to burn copies of the Act at the Bhogali Bihu bonfires of bhelaghar, a temporary hay-and-bamboo structure.

“We cannot ignore our age-old festivals but at the same time we cannot let a piece of legislation that threatens our Assamese identity and our festivals. We appeal to the people to burn copies of CAA to register their protest,” All Assam Students’ Union general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said.

Organisations such as Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad and Cotton University Students’ Union have given similar calls.

Traditionally, pithas (rice cakes) and betel nuts are thrown into a meji, meaning bonfire, while wishing for a bountiful harvest for the farm season ahead. Copies of CAA would be a “political addition”, community Bihu organisers said.

Anti-CAA sentiments have been all-pervading at Bhogali fairs and stalls that sell festival-related delicacies such as jaggery, curd, til pitha (sticky rice cake with black sesame filling), sunga pitha (rice cake baked inside whole bamboo pieces), ghila pitha (fried rice cakes), narikolor laaru (sweet coconut balls) and kol pitha (banana pancakes). Most of these stalls have been displaying placards reading “No CAA”, “Scrap CAA”, and “CAA is anti-Assam”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/s59jrx/article30562567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14PITTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/call-to-burn-caa-copies-in-bihu-bonfires-in-assam/article30562568.ece

Students of Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Unani Medicine and Faculty of Management Sciences boycotted their classes. They demanded that the Vice-Chancellor and Registrar, taking responsibility for the police violence in AMU on December 15, 2019, should resign.

Classes in the engineering college remained officially suspended. End semester examinations are scheduled from January 16.

“Around 300 students gathered on the lawns of Kennedy Auditorium to decide the future course of action. It was resolved that all academic activities, including examinations, will be boycotted till the resignation of Vice-Chancellor and Registrar,” said Qudratullah Faraz, a student of Electrical Engineering.

Official sources said only 30-40 % students have returned to the hostels after the vacation.

Four student activists — Snehashish, Sabah Maharaj, Shayma S. and Sadat Hussain from JNU — visited AMU and addressed the students at Bab-e-Syed.

Targeting those who are labelling the protests as communal, Maharaj said, “Any marginalised community fighting for its rights is labelled as communal.”

207,2020/01/14,CM hits back at BJP’s ‘autorickshaw’ jibe,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday responded to jibes from the Bharatiya Janata Party, saying that more than the number of wheels on a vehicle, what mattered was the person driving it. The BJP had likened the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government to an unstable autorickshaw.

“More than whether a vehicle is a three-wheeler or four-wheeler, what is important is the person driving it. He is the one in control, as it is the steering wheel that controls all the wheels of the vehicle,” Mr. Thackeray said at the inauguration of the 31st Road Safety Week.

He said it was fine if his government was called a three-wheeler, as it was balanced and running well.

Speaking on road safety, Mr. Thackeray expressed concern over the number of fatalities in road accidents and said the country had regressed on that front compared to China. He said in 2005, there had been 94,000 and 98,000 accidents in China and India respectively. Today, however, China has brought the number down to 45,000, while in India it has soared to nearly 1.5 lakh.

State Transport Minister Anil Parab said 12,556 people died in road accidents in Maharashtra in 2019, which was still a large number though it was 5.2% lower than the 2018 figure. In all, the number of road accidents fell by 8% from 2018 to 2019. “We will undertake programmes to ensure we reduce the number by 10% this year. We will work to achieve the target of zero accidents,” he said.

Satej Patil, Minister of State for Transport and Home, suggested the government provide a dedicated fund to civic bodies for traffic signals. He said the Transport Department should be taken into confidence while drafting the development control rules.

208,2020/01/14,Rajasthan lawyer alleges torture by U.P. police,"A 25-year-old Muslim lawyer from Rajasthan’s Kota district has accused the Uttar Pradesh police of falsely implicating him in a case of an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest and torturing him in their custody. The lawyer, Mohammed Faisal, spent 14 days in jail at Kairana in U.P. before he was released on bail on January 7.

Mr. Faisal, an advocate in Kota district courts, had gone to Kairana in Shamli district last month as a member of the National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations to offer legal aid to the protesters arrested during the agitation against the CAA. The police arrested him from the court premises when he was completing formalities for bail applications of some accused persons.

Mr. Faisal said at a press conference here on Monday that a team of U.P. Police’s Special Operations Group forcibly took him, along with three others, to Kotwali police station in Kairana on December 23. “I was outside the SDM court with a local lawyer doing the paper work for bail applications for some persons who were picked up from their houses five days ago,” he said.

When Mr. Faisal told the policemen that he was a lawyer and showed them his identity card, they dismissed it as fake and claimed that he had come to Kairana to “incite violence”. “They said I was speaking with a Bengali accent and alleged that I had come from West Bengal to provoke the people and help the rioters.”

The lawyer alleged that the policemen abused him, thrashed him, beat him with sticks and tortured him by giving electric current on his back inside the police station.

During a workshop to educate youngsters about the dangers of dope, actor Shetty, who is a brand ambassador of the National Anti-Doping Agency, shared his own success story to underline the importance of sports in a child’s life.

“You may make many mistakes in your life but make sure that you don’t eat anything which is wrong. Whatever I have achieved in my life, it is purely because of sport,” said the actor.

“I used to practice martial arts and I used to train really, really hard. I became an actor in my life only because I was an athlete. I still believe that I am a part of sports.”

211,2020/01/14,Jonathan Hollander speaks on the positive transformation through dance,"In the times of #MeToo movement where more women are stepping forward and getting their voices heard, Shakti - A Return to the Source staged at Shilpakala Vedika (presented by Monsoon Raga Foundation in association with the U.S. embassy) was apt and relevant. This thought-provoking piece in Raag Durga bows to the female essence, the power of women and is part of a three-piece repertoire staged by western dancers of New York-based Battery Dance company and Indian dancers Unnath Haasan Rathnaraju and Swathi Gundapuneedi Atluri. This India tour has taken the team to Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Hassan (Karnataka) before Hyderabad.

Jonathan Hollander, president and artistic director of the company shares an interesting dichotomy the piece Shakti has with Indian women. “In Hassan I saw a woman in her 60s carrying a huge weight on her head. Her posture was erect and she didn’t seem to be bothered by it. It is a metaphor in a way because women are carrying so much weight,” he says, adding his dancers are phenomenal and down to earth people but become eclectic on stage.

What the dancers say











Battery Dance has travelled far and wide across 70 countries using dance as a tool for building social cohesion and resolving conflict throughout the world. The dancers transform into nurturing teachers in conflict-zones to heal with dance. He observes, “The children are alike everywhere. Certain cultures are more fluent with dance, like Africa, where everybody dances. Since Indians are exposed to different dance styles, dance is important here. But in Europe, it is difficult to get kids to come out of themselves and be free and liberated that is what we try to do. We believe in the kids and try to get them to believe in themselves.”

A big team of professional dancers make the company and they do not have a ‘guru shishya’ hierarchy. Jonathan calls himself the artistic director of the piece and the raw material has been created by these dancers. “I can’t claim choreography credit for a piece that was made up of all these voices coming into harmony. There is a good spirit where we don’t feel awkward about correcting somebody. They laugh at me because when I am watching the rehearsals I do something with my eyes so that I can see the whole and it looks like I am scowling.”

Having been to India before, Jonathan calls the country his second home. In fact, Haasan-based Unnath Jain brought an element of India into their studio in New York. The team figured out a way to navigate and pick elements from him so that there is a collaboration and no undercurrent of domination. The dance vocabulary was created in the first four weeks and was developed in the time between Unnath’s back and forth India-New York visits.

Commenting on the present situation, Jonathan observes world is being seen in parts and ‘destructive’ is the order of the day. The team was in Lucknow when the news of Iranian missiles hitting bases in Iraq came by. “We seem to be on the brink of disaster politically. I have a dancer (living in my house) from Iraq, the base attacked by Iranian missiles. We cannot separate ourselves from what’s going on. It doesn’t mean that we stop and panic but continue with the things that we have been doing with even more earnestness. There is nothing we have done in the day that is destructive. Maybe, a lot of people might not be able to say that.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/hvr2ac/article30564774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym14battery3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/battery-dance-has-uses-dance-as-a-tool-for-social-empowerement/article30564780.ece

218,2020/01/14,Concern over spurt in roadkill in Nilgiris,"Conservationists are worried about the increase in the number of roadkill in the Nilgiris over the last couple of years.

Better roads leading to villages outside town limits are considered one of the prime reasons for the increase in the number of wildlife deaths, especially the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), the records of which show that the animal most often gets killed by speeding vehicles.

According to the statistics available with The Hindu, at least one leopard cat has, on an average, been run over along the district’s roads over the last 15 months.

Reports show that four leopard cats were killed over a three-month period in 2018, while five were killed in 2019, with two deaths already reported in Kotagiri and Coonoor in 2020. Officials said that the number could be higher as these were the ones that were reported to the Forest Department.

“Apart from leopard cats, civet cats are also most prone to being killed in the Nilgiris,” said a forest official. In the past, spotted deer, Sambar deer and even the Common grey langur had been run over by vehicles. But more leopard cats were killed due to them being nocturnal animals.

Analysis of the statistics also reveals that almost all the recorded deaths of the leopard cat occurred not along busy roads, but near villages.

Conservationists said that one of the reasons for the increasing number of roadkill could be due to better roads being laid into villages and settlements away from the major towns. With work going on to expand more roads, including the Gudalur to Udhagamandalam highway, Athikkal village road, Kotagiri - Elada Road and the TR Bazaar - Pandiar Road, the number could go up, they said.

N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist, said that it was important that roads were not expanded beyond a certain width, as that would encourage motorists to speed, resulting in more chances of animals being run over. “That is the reason why roadkill are less common in Mudumalai as the roads are quite narrow, limiting the speed of the vehicles,” said Mr. Mohanraj. As the expected growth in the number of electric (silent) vehicles in the coming years might lead to more wildlife deaths, checks and balances would need to be implemented to limit the speed of vehicles along the district’s roads.

Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association, said it was imperative that roads with less traffic were not upgraded and expanded, while the roads which already had been expanded needed to have speed breakers. “The highways and public works departments should work together with the Forest Department to identify stretches of road where most number of roadkill occur, and install speed breakers and warning boards,” said Mr. Janardhanan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/i0n706/article30562141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14ROADKILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/concern-over-spurt-in-roadkill-in-nilgiris/article30562142.ece
219,2020/01/14,SIMA appeals to CCI to release cotton at market price,"The Southern India Mills’ Association has appealed to the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to sell the cotton stocks with it at market price.

In a press release, SIMA chairman Ashwin Chandran said the CCI was covering almost 50 % of the stocks that were coming into the market as the government had increased Minimum Support Price for cotton by 26 % t0 28 % this season.

Stocks

The CCI was said to have more than 35 lakh cotton stock with it. Though it started purchasing cotton in the market in November, it was releasing the stocks only now. The government this year allocated ₹ 2,017 crore in the Union Budget for the CCI to carry out MSP operations.

The CCI should release the stocks with it regularly at market price so that prices did not escalate, he said.

According to reports available, India has already exported 20 lakh bales cotton this season and is expected to export nearly 60 lakh bales as against the initial estimate of 50 lakh bales.

China is expected to import a lot of cotton from the US and India. If the exports increase, there may be panic in the market as the season advances.

Instructions

The Association appealed to the Union Textile Minister to issue instructions to CCI to sell cotton at market prices as against the high prices it was quoting now.

The domestic textile industry should get cotton at competitive prices, Mr. Chandran said.

Only if cotton was made available at competitive prices would the domestic textile units be able to tap the opportunities in the international market, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sima-appeals-to-cci-to-release-cotton-at-market-price/article30562122.ece

221,2020/01/14,TMMK holds signature campaign against Citizenship Amendment Act,"Members of the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi on Monday marched from Anna Statue Junction on Avinashi Road to the Coimbatore Collectorate to register their protest against the Central Government for enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Holding placards, party flags and also the national flag, the protesters raised slogans against the Central Government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, saying the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was against minorities.

Before meeting the District Collector, the TMMK’s state treasurer E. Umar told journalists that the organisation had collected around a lakh signature from people opposed to the Act.

The Kerala Assembly had passed a resolution against the implementation of the Act in the State. The AIADMK government, with the help of whose Rajya Sabha MPs the Central Government passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, should also take a similar step.

The Chief Minister should convene an urgent meeting of the Cabinet and pass a resolution against the implementation of the Act and follow it with a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, he said.

Mr. Umar demanded that the Central Government repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act as it was against Muslims. The Government had said that it would grant citizenship to minorities except Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, which was violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.

The Government should, therefore, repeal the Act, he reiterated.

The deceased has been identified as P. Suresh.

Forest Department officials said that Suresh was part of a group that was making arrangements for Pongal at a temple in Thonimudi late on Sunday. Around 9 p.m., Suresh went home alone through an estate route, informing others that he would return after dinner.

On information, Forest Department staff reached the spot and chased the wild elephant using fire crackers.

Following the incident, estate workers staged a protest demanding Forest Department to ensure their safety from wild animals, especially elephants. The police and officials from the Forest Department pacified them and shifted the body to Government Hospital, Valparai.

223,2020/01/14,"TNPCB, IMA appeal for pollution-free Bhogi","The Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) have appealed to the public to celebrate pollution-free Bhogi, which falls on January 14 (Tuesday), by not burning discarded items that release noxious gases.

Pulmonary problems

IMA office-bearers and TNPCB officials claimed that the air quality in Coimbatore during last year’s Bhogi was within the safe levels and there was 50 % decline in the number of people who sought treatment for pulmonary problems due to air pollution compared to 2018.

P. Ramesh, assistant engineer of TNPCB for Coimbatore north, said that the level of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 and PM 10 in air, which determines air quality, was normal in 2019.

As per pollution control board standards, PM 2.5 (atmospheric PM of less than 2.5 micrometre in diameter) should be 60 micrograms per cubic metre and PM 10 (atmospheric PM of less than 10 micrometre in diameter) should be 100 micrograms per cubic metre in normal level.

V. Nandagopal, consultant pulmonologist with Hindusthan Hospital, Coimbatore, said that PM 2.5 and PM 10 beyond the normal limits in the air could trigger a range of pulmonary problems, especially in children.

M. Doraikannan, secretary of IMA Coimbatore branch, appealed to the public to abstain from burning discarded plastic and rubber products that release harmful gases. .

According to S. Karthik Prabhu, secretary of Nursing Home Board of IMA Tamil Nadu, the medical body was associating with TNPCB across the State to create awareness among public on the impacts of air pollution.

The association, led by president S. Palanisamy, in its petition said that in the farmers’ markets in R.S. Puram and Singanallur, the Agriculture Marketing Department officials had allotted shops to farmers from the Nilgiris district.

The local farmers from Thondamuthur, Sulur and a few other places who cultivated fruits and vegetables had no place. The administration should therefore take steps to allot shops for local farmers.

And before doing so it should constitute a team to find out how many farmers from outside the district had shops allotted at those markets and the team should include farmers as well.

If the Department continued to ignore local farmers, the association would be forced to stage a demonstration, the association added.

‘Probe irregularity in water supply project’

The water supply augmentation project undertaken in Narasipuram panchayat in Thondamuthur Panchayat Union had not benefited the residents and there appeared to be irregularity, Narasipuram resident N.R. Aruchamy complained to the district administration.

He said that the work taken up at ₹ 4.73 lakh in 2017-18 was completed a few months ago. The objective of the work was to take water from a borewell in Athur to an overhead tank in the village. Even after the completion of work, the residents did not get water.

Though the residents had complained to the panchayat administration officials, they were not getting a satisfactory reply.

226,2020/01/14,"Stench from Corporation dump yard unbearable, say Podanur residents","Sriram Nagar resident R.K. Mani has stopped his morning walks. He prefers to remain indoors. Not just in the morning but as long as he can. “It is better to stay indoor as the stench outside is unbearable.”

He lives very close to the Vellalore yard, where the Coimbatore Corporation dumps at least 500 kg unprocessed, unsegregated waste a day.

At the nearby Thiruvalluvar Street, the Corporation has opened a park. School-going Prithvee Ganesh wants to go out to play but he does not. “I have been thinking of going to the park to play in the evenings. But I have decided against it as its stinks outside” he says.

A few weeks ago, Auditor Street resident A. Devi Priyadarshini’s friends, who wanted to rent two houses in the area decided not to. “My friends liked the area but the unpleasant smell from the dump yard made them drop Podanur from their list of probable localities.”

The reach of the stench, it appears, is not restricted to Podanur. Sundarapuram resident B. Jayamani says she has been having breathing difficulty for the past couple of months. Her house is at least three km away from the dump yard.

Though the residents have been having problems because of the dump yard, the stench has worsened in the last two months, rues G. Nandakumar, also a resident of Sriram Nagar. “The complaint from residents of Sriram Nagar, Eswar Nagar, P&T Colony, around White Street, Mettur, Ganesapuram has been the same since November – that the stench is unbearable.”

Citizen activist J. Daniel says the residents of the above localities, who live west of the dump yard, face trouble three to four months of a year when the breeze blows west. For the rest of the year, those in the east and north bear the brunt.

The Corporation claims it is taking steps but the residents are not seeing the results, he adds.

The Corporation must find a solution at the earliest to control the foul odour as the residents have trouble breathing, says Mr. Mani.

The past few months has been very difficult for her and particularly the last 10 days as she is suffering from fever and runny nose, complains resident M. Kannipriya.

Corporation says it has compartmentalised the accumulated (legacy) waste and is now segregating the waste that it dumps every day. The stench that the residents complain about may be from the segregation. It will address the issue by spraying neem solution.

It also says that it is in the process of finding a permanent solution by biomining the accumulated waste.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2vmt26/article30561976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14VELLALOREDUMPYARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/stench-from-corporation-dump-yard-unbearable-say-podanur-residents/article30561977.ece
227,2020/01/14,Rahul’s dismissal the turning point: Shikhar Dhawan,"It may not have been the start India wanted, but Shikhar Dhawan termed the 10-wicket loss against Australia in the first ODI a “bad day in office”.

“We played well against the West Indies where all the batsmen performed. As players, we don’t focus too much on things that are not happening. As a team, we need to back each other and don’t focus too much on a loss,” Dhawan said.

He felt that Rahul’s dismissal was the turning point.

“At the time KL got out, we had planned to accelerate. Those four wickets we lost, that’s where we lost the momentum. We were targeting 300 and with the loss of wickets, we ended up scoring less runs than what we need on that wicket. In bowling too, we could not take early wickets. They outplayed us,” said the India opener, heaping praise on pace ace Pat Cummins.

“He bowled a really good length to me. We [Rahul and I] handled the first 10-15 overs very well but when we lost four wickets quickly, that changed the game.”

Making a mark

Warner, playing an ODI after nearly six months, was happy to strike form. “For us, it was about coming over here and trying to make our mark from where we left off in the World Cup,” said Warner.

“It’s our first ODI this summer and it’s away. For us, it’s about trying to put on clinical performances each time we go out there. We have a great bunch of guys.

229,2020/01/14,"Ranji Trophy | Ashwin, the batsman, comes to TN’s rescue","R. Ashwin produced a fighting effort with the bat for Tamil Nadu (79, 206b, 5x4, 2x6) to deny Mumbai a shot at forcing an outright win but could not prevent the visitors from taking the first-innings lead on the final day of play of their Ranji Trophy match here at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.

Ashwin added 105 runs for the eighth wicket with R. Sai Kishore (42) in a partnership that lasted 355 balls to help TN bat time and keep Mumbai at bay during the first session.

Though TN was eventually bowled out for 324 and was forced to follow-on after conceding a 164-run lead, the time taken ensured Mumbai couldn’t press for victory and both teams agreed to call off the game at tea time.

Easy going

Ashwin and Sai Kishore, who batted for more than a session on the third day, continued to play with ease in the morning, tackling the spinners with aplomb, even though there was some turn with the odd-ball keeping low.

The Mumbai attack did everything at its disposal with some disciplined bowling and innovative field-set, but the slow nature of the wicket made the task of removing the tail difficult.

Reprieved thrice

To make things worse, Mumbai was sloppy on the field dropping Ashwin thrice before he got to his half-century. Ashwin could have been dismissed for zero had Vinayak Bhoir held on to a catch at short-cover on the third day.

And on Tuesday, Tushar Deshpande attacked with short-pitched stuff from around the wicket and Ashwin hit one straight to the well-placed leg-gully fielder only for Jay Bista to drop it when the batsman was on 32.

Shashank Attarde then dropped Ashwin on 42 at short-cover before he hit the next delivery for a six down long-on.

Despite an inexperienced side, Mumbai did well to pocket three points from the match after two consecutive defeats. TN, on the other hand, once again let the game slip away from its hands and, in all probability, is unlikely to qualify, with just five points from as many games.

230,2020/01/14,Innings win for Andhra over Hyderabad,"Andhra scored an innings and 96-run win over Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy Elite group match at the C.S.R. Sarma College ground here on Tuesday.

It was Hyderabad’s fourth defeat in five games and it has just six points now, thanks to the solitary win over Kerala.

Resuming at 45 for three after conceding a first innings lead of 264, Hyderabad needed atleast a couple of batsmen to stay put at the crease. But that was not to be.

Though captain and opener Tanmay Agarwal played a defiant knock (41, 114b, 6x4) and all-rounder T. Ravi Teja scored a belligerent unbeaten 72 (144b, 8x4, 3x6), the other batsmen failed to rise to the occasion in the face of accurate, if not hostile, bowling.

Significantly for Andhra, pacers P. Vijay Kumar, who completed a thoroughly deserving five-wicket haul (his first this season), left-armer Prithvi Raj and K.V. Sasikanth shared the spoils on a pitch where the Hyderabad bowling attack struggled.

Jaweed Ali was the first to be dismissed when Prithvi Raj forced a snick to wicketkeeper K. Srikar Bharat in the eighth over of the day.

In the same over, in-form wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth, who scored a brilliant century at home against Kerala last week, was dismissed to push Hyderabad into serious trouble.

Then, Vijay struck the big blow, sending back Tanmay to reduce Hyderabad to 85 for six in 37th over.

The writing was clear on the wall but Ravi Teja showed tenacity and aggression with the bat to delay the inevitable.

To the delight of Andhra, the pace duo of Vijay and Sasikanth ensured there were no more twists and turns as they cleaned up the tail without any fuss and left the home team a deserving winner.

This was Andhra’s third win from five matches and it now has 21 points, second behind table-topper Vidarbha (23).

231,2020/01/14,IND vs AUS first ODI | Warner and Finch hammer India into submission,"The three-match ODI series between India and Australia was billed as a contest between the heavyweights.

On Tuesday, however, it seemed as if only one team turned up as a near-perfect performance saw Australia steamroller India at the Wankhede Stadium.

If Aaron Finch’s bowling unit put up a clinical performance to bowl out India for 255, the skipper joined forces with David Warner to tear apart the Indian attack.

Such was the dominance of the two, Virat Kohli’s men couldn’t take a single wicket. Warner and Finch smashed unbeaten hundreds and also were involved in the highest opening partnership against India — 258 — as the visitors won with 74 deliveries remaining and took a 1-0 lead.

India needed early breakthroughs if they had to be competitive.

Erring in length

However, the pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Shardul Thakur erred in their length, allowing the Australian pair to break free.

Finch, in particular, hit boundaries at will against anything that was full-pitched.

Warner soon joined the party. After being cautious initially, the left-hander changed gears in the eighth over as Shardul faced the fury of Warner’s bat. A lofted cover-drive and a flick were both mistimed, but still crossed the boundary. A swat over midwicket then sailed into the stands. Warner continued in the same vein in the Mumbai seamer’s next over, a rasping cover-drive and a cut taking Australia to 84 in the PowerPlay overs.

With dew starting to play a role, the Australian openers proved unstoppable.

While the hosts were unlucky with a review, the visitors were saved thrice by DRS. Warner (128 not out, 112b, 17x4, 3x6) and Finch (110 not out, 114b, 13x4, 2x6) completed the formalities in the 38th over.

The only phase during which India was in control was during the 121-run partnership for the second wicket between Shikhar Dhawan and K.L. Rahul.

After being asked to bat, Rohit Sharma, who stroked two majestic boundaries off Mitchell Starc’s opening over, fell to the left-arm speedster in the fifth over, mistiming a drive that went straight to Warner at mid-off.

Dhawan and Rahul then saw off a threatening spell by Pat Cummins and Starc.

Though the two couldn’t really go after spinners Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar later on, they managed to keep the scoreboard ticking.

The slide begins

Just when Dhawan and Rahul were looking to accelerate, the latter chipped the first ball of left-armer Agar’s new spell straight to Steve Smith at cover.

Rahul’s dismissal triggered a mini-collapse as the hosts lost four wickets for 29 runs off 35 balls.

Dhawan was caught by Agar sprinting to his right at mid-off after top-edging Cummins while Kohli’s full-blooded straight drive was well caught by leg-spinner Zampa off his own bowling.

After Shreyas Iyer edged Starc to wicketkeeper Alex Carey, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja put the innings back on the rails with a 49-run stand for the sixth wicket.

However, once Jadeja nicked Kane Richardson to Carey and Pant was dismissed by Cummins, it took a late-order flourish from Shami and Kuldeep Yadav to push the hosts past 250.

That total was never going to be enough, as Warner and Finch showed.

232,2020/01/14,Spectator who racially abused Jofra Archer banned for two years,"New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has banned a spectator from attending international and domestic games in the country for two years after he admitted racially abusing England fast bowler Jofra Archer.

NZC filed a complaint with the police after failing to “conclusively identify” a spectator who, as Archer explained on social media, had racially abused him during play on the final day of the first Test at the Bay Oval in November.

“As a result of their inquiries, police have spoken to a 28-year-old Auckland man who subsequently admitted responsibility for the abuse,” said NZC in a statement on Monday.

“He was issued with a verbal warning for using insulting language.

“NZC have since contacted the man and have also written to him, advising of his ban from all international and domestic fixtures in New Zealand until 2022.”

If the man attends a fixture and breaches his ban, he will be removed from the venue and may face further legal action.

“We'd again like to extend our apologies to Jofra and the England team management for such an unsavoury incident and reiterate once more that this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable,” said NZC spokesperson Anthony Crummy.

“We want to thank the NZ Police for their efforts in identifying the person responsible, and for making it clear that this type of behaviour will not be minimised.”

He added that NZC would continue to treat offensive language and behaviour seriously, with anti-racist messages to be posted on signs around the grounds, on the big screen, as well as being delivered by annoucers at matches.

Also, spectators at all New Zealand venues will be encouraged to use NZC's text alert system to notify ground security of any anti-social behaviour, including racist taunts and abuse.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4zhpmc/article30079623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26JOF-01,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/spectator-who-racially-abused-jofra-archer-banned-for-two-years/article30565015.ece
233,2020/01/14,Sitting MLA N.D. Sharma resigns from AAP,"Ahead of assembly polls, N. D. Sharma, sitting AAP MLA from Badarpur, on Tuesday said he has resigned from the party and accused it of selling tickets to candidates.

His resignation comes a day after AAP inducted two-time MLA Ram Singh Netaji to the party. On Monday, Mr. Sharma had sat on a protest at Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s residence over Netaji’s induction.

“I have resigned from the party. We joined the AAP for clean politics but what is the difference between you (AAP) and other political parties now. I won with 94,000 votes and he (Netaji) with 17,000 votes but he was inducted into the party just like that. The hard work of volunteers was ignored,” Mr. Sharma said.

He further said he would contest the upcoming polls but did not disclose if he would join another party or fight independently.

He also claimed that after the polls, the AAP-led Delhi government plans to stop free pilgrimage and increase the rate of electricity, water and bus fare.

“You are using people to win election. You didn’t raise the level of politics, you have dropped it further,” Mr. Sharma said, while referring to the AAP.

“If they wanted someone else, they could have chosen some volunteer from the party,” he said.

No immediate reaction was available from AAP.

The sitting MLA’s resignation comes ahead of the Delhi assembly polls which will be held on February 8 and the counting on February 11.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fhv198/article30567918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NDSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sitting-mla-nd-sharma-resigns-from-aap/article30567919.ece
234,2020/01/14,JNU violence: court orders seizure of 2 WhatsApp group members’ phones,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the police to summon and seize the phones of members of two WhatsApp groups — ‘United Against Left’ and ‘Friends of RSS’ — in connection with the January 5 violence on the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus.

Justice Brijesh Sethi asked Google and WhatsApp to preserve and provide data related to the incident as per their respective policies to the police.

The court asked JNU’s Chief Security Officer, its Registrar and Branch Manager of SBI-JNU campus to extend all possible assistance to the police with regard to providing CCTV footage related to January 5 incident.

Delhi police senior standing counsel Rahul Mehra told the court that they had identified 37 persons who were part of the two WhatsApp chat groups, and notices have been sent to them to appear before the police.

Mr. Mehra said they had, on January 10 and 11, sought the preservation and provision of data related to the incident from WhatsApp. “We have asked them to respond to our request in terms of their emergency provision.”

WhatsApp responded that once a chat is delivered to a person, it is no longer stored on its servers due to its ‘end-to-end encryption’. It claimed that chats would be available only on the recipient’s and sender’s phones.

Google said it could preserve available data on Google Drive on receipt on basic subscriber details such as email account.

The court order came while hearing a petition filed by JNU professors Ameet Parameswaran, Atul Sood, Shukla Vinayak Sawant seeking the preservation of data pertaining to the violence.

The petition claimed that particulars of the incident “seem to indicate that the entire attack was premeditated and coordinated”. The professors said they had been personally injured in the violence. “Unless the same had been the result of a pre-planned conspiracy, it would not have been possible for a mob in such large numbers, many of whom appear to be outsiders, to enter the JNU campus,” they said.

“The existence of a premeditated and well-organised attack is further clear from the fact that these persons were covering their faces wearing marks, without any proper identification, carrying weapons and so on,” the plea stated.

It submitted that several persons appeared to have used WhatsApp to create different groups with the purpose of inciting hate and violence against the JNU teachers, staff, and students.

The petition has categorically asked for preservation of data of ‘Unity Against Left’ and ‘Friends of RSS’ groups, including messages, pictures and videos as well as phone numbers of members related to the incident.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9sbhwr/article30565506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-violence-delhi-hc-directs-police-to-seize-phones-of-members-of-two-whatsapp-groups/article30565507.ece

Justice Suresh Kait rejected the ED’s plea, noting four other accused in the case are already out on bail and Mr. Puri had been in custody for over 100 days.

236,2020/01/14,Will levy a mere token charge of ₹1 for bill waivers if elected to power: BJP MP,"Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma on Monday said that his party will levy a token charge of ₹1 for water and power bill waivers from the poor residents of the Capital if it wins the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections.

Accusing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s free water and power supply schemes, Mr. Verma said the token charge would be to honour the “self respect” of the economically-challenged citizens of the city. The West Delhi MP further said he had conveyed this as a suggestion to the party’s manifesto committee and the initiative could be one of the poll promises of the BJP.

“People feel they have given back to the government if some token charge is taken.

The accused were identified as Sachin Dangi, Pankaj Pooniya, Kunal, Keshav, Priyanshu Goutam and Kapil. They are members of Ashu Bawana gang, police said.

The robbery came to light on January 6 after a 62-year-old man, a resident of Janakpuri, reported to the police that two men carrying firearms robbed his laptop at gunpoint while he was boarding his car parked at Tilak Nagar, police said.

Acting on a tip-off on January 11, all the accused were arrested from near a house in Narela, a police official said. The stolen laptop and five pen drives and car keys were among the materials recovered from them.

Two of the accused were in contact with Ashish alias Ashu Bawana, the main handler of affairs of gangster Neeraj Bawana, who is in jail. They, on the directions of Ashu, used to extort money on behalf of Neeraj Bawana.

239,2020/01/14,BJP finalises 45-50 namesfor Delhi Assembly elections,"After three marathon meetings over the weekend, the BJP has finalised the names of 45 to 50 candidates it intends to field in the Assembly constituencies in the Capital, party sources aware of the proceedings said here on Monday.

At least three meetings revolving around the exercise had taken place, including one that began at 8 p.m. on Sunday evening and concluded around 2 a.m. on Sunday at BJP national president Amit Shah’s residence. The first list of the party’s candidates is expected latest by January 17.

Besides Mr. Shah, working national president J.P. Nadda and Delhi election in-charge Prakash Javadekar were also present in these meetings, according to party sources.

“There were two to three potential candidates whose names were finalised by the party’s Delhi Assembly Elections Committee for around 45 seats. The candidature of these individuals was discussed and one name per seat was arrived upon,” said a party source.

“Over the weekend, the thrust of the exercise was mainly to assess the winnability of potential candidates based on grassroots surveys related to their popularity. The finalised names will be assessed by the Central Election Committee, headed by Mr. Shah, which will then take a final call on the allotment of tickets,” the source said.

According to party insiders, the party was likely to announce the names of candidates to be fielded on 45 to 50 seats either by the evening of January 16 or early on January 17. This was given Mr. Shah's unavailability in the Capital for two consecutive days. The names of candidates to be fielded on the remaining seats, the insider said, were most likely to be released on January 18.

Sources claimed as many as “four to five” candidates had thrown their respective hats in the ring to contest from the New Delhi Assembly constituency – Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s home turf – and were being assessed.

Meanwhile, according to a senior party leader, the party was also examining the number of seats to be shared with its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which had contested three seats in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections and four in the 2015 elections.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-finalises-45-50-namesfor-delhi-assembly-elections/article30562735.ece
240,2020/01/14,"Two-time MLA Ram Singh Netaji, son of Mahabal Mishra join AAP","Congress leader and former MLA Ram Singh Netaji and Vinay Kumar Mishra, son of former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra and a few other Congress leaders have joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday, said senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia.

Addressing a press conference, AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “We are welcoming them to the party with open hearts. And I am sure that a day will come when two crore people of Delhi will become members of AAP. That day is not too far.”

Mr. Netaji was twice an MLA — once as a BSP candidate and the second time as an Independent after which he joined the Congress. “I have joined AAP as a worker and not for a ticket. I have resigned from the Congress along with my followers,” he told the media.

Mr. Mishra fought the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections from Palam on a Congress ticket. “I have resigned from the Congress. AAP will decide whether I will fight the upcoming elections or not,” he told The Hindu.

Also, Congress leader Deepu Chaudhary and many others formally joined AAP and were inducted into the party.

‘No other choice’

“There used to be only two major political parties in Delhi — the BJP and Congress. People were fed up of the politics of both these parties because they did not deliver on promises made and having no other choice, voted them alternately. But then five years ago, the people of Delhi initiated a new phase of self-determination in politics and set an example for the rest of India — when a fledgling party, comprising common people, offered hope and managed to win 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly, almost reducing existing political powers to a naught,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He said whether supporters of the BJP or the Congress or any other party, AAP has gained a place for itself in every heart because of its sincerity.

“AAP has managed to touch and transform their lives with the work it has done and this time they will vote for AAP, irrespective of personal party affiliation,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/two-time-mla-ram-singh-netaji-son-of-mahabal-mishra-join-aap/article30562700.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar disposed of the petition following the direction. The petition, filed by Hans Raj Jain, a Delhi resident, sought inspection of VVPAT slips of the EVMs, alleging “a great discrepancy” in the number of votes polled and that of counted in 373 constituencies.

242,2020/01/14,"After LS poll fillip, Cong. goes past forward in Delhi","The third player in the triangular contest for power in Delhi, the Indian National Congress, is looking forward to launching a campaign focused on a range of national and local issues and is promising to continue the development it brought to Delhi during its 15-year rule with Sheila Dikshit as Chief Minister.

Enthused by its results in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when it managed to increase its vote share considerably and was placed second in five out of the seven seats, the party leadership is confident of turning around its performance in the Assembly polls. In 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, the Congress had won eight out of 70 seats and in the 2015 polls, it failed to win even a single seat.

After a leadership crisis arose in the Delhi Congress following the death of Dikshit in July last year, the party relied on old warhorse Shubhash Chopra to become the State unit chief and put up a united front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

Mr. Chopra said that the party through its campaign will not only remind Delhiites of how the Congress party in its 15-year rule brought a positive transformation to the Capital, but also debunk the lies and misinformation that both BJP and AAP have been spreading on regularisation of unauthorised colonies and the development they claim they have brought.

“Both parties are making promises ahead of the elections but are yet to deliver and we will show voters that it is only the Congress party that has work to show,” he said. The Congress is looking to field young candidates in the upcoming polls, Mr. Chopra added.

‘No CAA, NPR, NRC’

One of the first announcements that the Delhi Congress made regarding its preparations for the elections was to come out with a clear stand on the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The chairman of the Manifesto Committee, Ajay Maken, said that the party if elected to power in Delhi, will not implement the CAA, NPR and NRC.

“While the manifesto committee is still working on it, one of the main points included in the document would be the party’s stand that there is a vast difference in the NPR of 2010 and the NPR of 2020 as the Modi government has added six new illegal clauses in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution,” Mr. Maken said. The party has also asked AAP to clear its stand on the issue and not stay on the fences.

Congress leaders have been reaching out to those protesting against the CAA-NPR-NRC and have even shown solidarity with students’ movement against the exercise.

Launching an initiative to listen to the people of Delhi on what should be included in the manifesto, the Congress has started a conversation with Delhiites. Kicking off the initiative, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “The stifling of dissent and attacks on university campuses in the Capital has given us the sense that the government is trying to silence the voice of the people of Delhi and therefore, we are going to welcome the voices and consult them on what they think should be the key issues in this election,” Mr. Tharoor said.

He said that in every election the BJP fights, its intent is to polarise voters and hoped that in Delhi any such attempt, like the attack on students of JNU, will be resisted by voters who are aware and educated. “The Congress will ensure that any attempt to take the public’s attention away from the failures of the government with regard to economy, unemployment, pollution and every single aspect of improving the life of the people will not be tolerated,” Mr. Tharoor said.

Campaign slogan

The chairman of the Campaign Committee of the Delhi Congress, Kirti Azad, said that the campaign slogans which have been finalised are — ‘Congress wali Dilli Khushal Dilli’ and ‘Congress ke 15 saal vikas hue bemisaal”, which is a throwback to the 15-year rule of the Congress in Delhi when it completely changed the face of the city.

“We are fighting a war and we will have an aggressive strategy. We will have posters reminding people that it was the Congress that built the metro, new hospitals, flyovers and schools and these development works will be compared to the work that AAP has done in terms of numbers to show how it has not done any development,” Mr. Azad said. To counter the BJP, he said the strategy would be simple, “we will get them to talk about issues facing Delhi and not about Pakistan”.

Regularisation ‘truth’

Mr. Azad said that one of the main strategies to target the BJP and AAP would be unauthorised colonies as both parties have “fooled” the people of Delhi. “There was a notification by the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi on October 2, 2013 saying that the mapping of the unauthorised colonies should start. Unfortunately after that we lost the elections and the Kejriwal government did not start the process. Two agencies were appointed to map them and both tenders were cancelled and for four-and-a-half years, Kejriwal was in deep slumber. Only before the elections did he wake up to it. We will go to unauthorised colonies and tell them the truth about this,” Mr. Azad said.

With respect to the BJP’s “regularisation” of unauthorised colonies, he said that the Congress will hold rallies in unauthorised colonies and show how a majority of them would not be regularised as they fall in zones like the Yamuna riverbed, near ASI monuments, forest areas and near high-tension cables, because of which, according to the government’s rules, they cannot be regularised.

Power ‘relief’

Other promises that the Congress has made ahead of the election is to give relief package up to 600 units of power to the consumers besides increasing the pension amount to ₹5,000 per month under the ‘Sheila Dikshit Pension Scheme’.

The party has also set up a social media unit to “debunk falsehood and lies” that they said the BJP and AAP have been spreading.

Several Delhi Congress workers said that unlike in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, where there was a lot of ambiguity until the last day of filing nominations as to whether the party would tie-up with AAP to counter the BJP, this time the preparations are much more organised.

“Last year, there was a division within the party on a tie-up and therefore, we started our campaign very late. Even then, we managed to improve our performance. The ground-level workers are positive and are looking to rebuild the party and win back our vote base. Successful campaigns in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have also brought a new vigour,” a party worker said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/after-ls-poll-fillip-cong-goes-past-forward-in-delhi/article30562685.ece

The convicts — Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, and Akshay Kumar Singh — who are currently under the close watch of doctors and physiatrists in isolation wards, will be executed together at 7 a.m. in Tihar jail, said another officer.

All the preparations related to the hanging are over, he added. “We asked the convicts about the day and time when they would want to meet their families but they did not reply.

He added that after the court issued death warrants on January 7, family members of Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay had come to meet them. “Akshay’s family members came to meet him in November last. At present, family members can meet prisoners two times in a week. Mukesh’s mother visited him on Friday,” the officer said.

In an open letter on Monday, Mr. Bhaduri said he had learnt with “increasing disgust” how V-C M. Jagadesh Kumar’s handling of situations at JNU had “led to its steady deterioration paving the way to its intellectual disintegration”.

“It would be immoral on my part without registering my protest to remain a silent observer in this larger, sinister scheme of throttling dissent which is unfolding now at the University,” he said.

Mr. Bhaduri, who joined JNU as a young professor in 1973 and left in 2001, noted that he had witnessed many instances of student unrest and even a temporary shut-down of teaching during his tenure.

“What is different now is not only incompetence of handling of situations by the authorities, but also a deliberate attempt to throttle the free and lively atmosphere of debate and discussion for which JNU was known all over the country,” he said. “You seem determined on imprinting your administration’s narrow-minded world view and shut all other windows of ideas to the students,” he added.

Dr. Bhaduri noted that returning the honour bestowed on him was largely a symbolic act of protest as the administration had already evicted him from his room in JNU.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/economist-gives-up-jnu-emeritus-prof-position/article30562651.ece

He said Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri was “lying” about it.

“Yesterday, I highlighted the large scale scam done by the DDA with respect to the construction and sale of flats for people under the EWS category. After my statement, Puri commented on this matter and the DDA also issued a statement from their Twitter handle, which is a big lie in itself. This statement just adds to the severity of this corruption that has been going on and there is a dire need of a proper investigation,” said Mr. Singh.

He said Mr. Puri had said he has no information about the 772 EWS category flats and had dismissed the AAP’s accusations as baseless. “A legal notice was sent to that the allottees of DDA’s EWS category and was sent to a number of other people also. The notice was sent out on July 13, 2019, and this legal notice has been also been sent to Puri too as clearly indicated in the list,” Mr. Singh said.

He also posed three questions related to the alleged scam. He asked: “Why is Puri lying? If he received the legal notice then how can he say he had no information about this matter? If you [DDA] had set the price at ₹6.9 lakh for the flat under EWS category as mentioned in the brochure, after construction, then why did you send a demand note three times higher at ₹19 lakh?”

Terming the allegations as “misinformation”, the DDA said that DLF had constructed 772 houses which have all been allotted. “The DDA meeting on December 21, 2017 on this subject was attended by representatives of the Govt. of NCT of Delhi. They had no problem with the cost. Raising the issue at this time is not clear,” DDA said in a statement.

“The people had to pay registry charges twice. First to DLF and then to DDA. DDA sent a letter to Delhi government on February 9, 2018 and subsequently on May 25, 2018 requesting the Delhi government to waive off one side of this registration fee. However, no call was taken by Delhi government on his,” it added.

Responding to the allegation, Mr. Puri in a tweet said, “If they had a problem with the costing why did they not raise it then? Were you waiting for the elections? And now you begin with this misinformation campaign, without doing your bit in it.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/minister-lying-on-scam-in-ews-house-pricing-aap/article30562648.ece
248,2020/01/14,JNU protests no longer justified: HRD Minister,"The students’ agitation at JNU “is no longer justified” as their key demand related to the hostel fee hike has been dealt with, Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Monday, calling for an end to the protests which began almost three months ago.

“After rounds of discussions, the JNU has issued a statement that the students are not being asked to bear the cost of service and utility charges proposed for the winter session which was their basic demand,” said an official statement from the HRD Ministry. “Therefore, the JNU fee hike issue stands resolved since this was the main demand of the students,” he said.

Mr. Nishank also appealed that institutions of higher education “should not be converted into a political arena”, adding that over 5,000 students have already registered for the winter session.

Students and faculty members have pointed out that other demands, including those which were mutually agreed upon during negotiations helmed by the Ministry last month, have still not been met.

Responding to the statement by the Minister, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said that the incident that took place on January 5 had shocked not only the campus but the conscience of the nation as to how “goons imported from outside with the collusion of the V-C” can wreck havoc and carnage and not be punished. “The HRD Ministry, instead of removing a violence promoter who allowed rod-wielding goons to create carnage, is asking why the students are agitated. Students are agitated as they were beaten, assaulted, nearly killed and forced to hide and continue to live in fear in their own university.”

Ms. Ghosh said that the JNUSU, on January 11, had given a call for registration at old rates but the administration was not allowing students to register until they paid the revised fee. “The administration has released a circular which says utility and service charge will not be imposed in current registration which is a clear insinuation that they might do so at the very next opportunity. The record of discussion with the HRD Ministry says that any fee hike will be first brought back to a new IHA, but the fee hike was imposed beforehand,” she said.

She added that the record of discussion stated that a lenient view will be taken regarding the agitation, but that the administration had blocked the registration of a lot of students on the ground of proctorial enquiries.

The JNUSU president also said that the record of discussion was a framework for agreement, which no party had signed but was a framework with certain changes that the JNUSU was willing to consider. “However, a discussion involves two sides and both sides have to fulfil their side of the bargain. It is clear that the admin is not fulfilling its side of the bargain,” Ms. Ghosh said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-protests-no-longer-justified-hrd-minister/article30562646.ece
249,2020/01/14,ABVP releases eight videos of January 5 campus violence,"The ABVP on Monday released eight videos taken on January 5 at JNU’s Periyar Hostel that allegedly show members of Left organisations “carrying sticks and hitting students”. The ABVP said that they had submitted the footage to the police for investigation along with the names of students that they had identified.

The outfit demanded that the police should not only probe the violence on the campus between January 3 and 5 but also all incidents that have taken place since October 28 last year, which was when the agitation against the hostel fee hike had begun.

“The JNU campus was already simmering with tension and acrimony since October 28, 2019, the day the new hostel manual was released. The Left parties abused the sentiments of the students and disrupted all the academic activities in the university. For two-and-a-half months now, classes are not being held and exams are not being allowed to be held by the Left. It is most unfortunate that the students were attacked when they tried to register themselves from the next semester,” the ABVP said.

It added that it had submitted all the raw video evidence to the police and demanded a fair and detailed inquiry. It also alleged that students who wanted to register for the next semester were being targeted by the JNUSU. Nidhi Tripathi, ABVP national general secretary, said: “The members of Left organisations are torturing students and teachers who have wanted to partake in academic activities on JNU campus. They are asking for social boycott through their Kangaroo courts. This clearly shows the ideological untouchability being practised by such organisations.”

The ABVP, however, did not release any video shot on the campus after sundown on January 5, when the JNUTA peace gathering was allegedly attacked by masked miscreants causing severe injuries to students and teachers including, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh.

The JNUTA and JNUSU has accused the ABVP for the attacking the peace rally and entering hostels to attack students.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/abvp-releases-eight-videos-of-january-5-campus-violence/article30562628.ece

251,2020/01/14,"Violence on campus: SIT sleuths question Aishe Ghosh, two others","A special investigation team of the Delhi police visited JNU on Monday and questioned three students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, in connection with the January 5 violence on the university campus, officials said.

Pankaj Mishra, Vasker Vijay Mech and Ms. Ghosh were questioned by the Crime Branch officers. Ms. Ghosh was questioned for around an hour while other two were questioned for around 40 minutes. Ms. Ghosh was questioned in Teflas, which houses the students’ union office.

The police asked them where they were on January 3, 4 and 5 when the violence unfolded.

The trio is among the nine suspects whose pictures were recently released by the police following the January 5 violence in which 35 students, including Ms. Ghosh, sustained injuries.

Sucheta Talukdar will be questioned on Tuesday while Chunchun Kumar and Dolan Samanta will be questioned on Wednesday, the police said.

Last week, the Delhi police claimed that the violence at JNU was a fallout of tensions brimming on the campus since January 1 over the registration process.

Ms. Ghosh is among the seven out of the total nine suspects, who are from Left-leaning students’ organisations and the other two suspects are from the the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

Besides Ms. Ghosh, Mr. Mishra and Mr. Mech, Ms. Samanta, Priya Ranjan, Ms. Talukdar and mr. Kumar, an alumni, had been named as suspects by the police. Vikas Patel and Yogendra Bharadwaj, both from ABVP, are among the nine suspects in the case.

Notices served

The police said that Akshat Awasthi and Rohit Shah, who featured in a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel, have also been served notices to join the investigation, but were absconding.

The police have also identified the masked woman, seen in the purported videos of the violence, shared on social media, as Komal Sharma, who was wearing a check shirt, light blue scarf and was carrying a stick. Ms. Sharma, who is a student of Daulat Ram College, has also been sent a notice to join the probe, the police said, adding that her phone was found to be switched off since Saturday night.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/violence-on-campus-sit-sleuths-question-aishe-ghosh-two-others/article30562622.ece
252,2020/01/14,Academic blocks deserted on first day of winter semester at JNU,"The academic blocks at JNU wore a deserted look on Monday, the first day of the winter semester, as students boycotted classes responding to a call given by the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) and the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA).

The students and teachers have continued their stand that normalcy could be brought back on the campus only if Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar was made to resign or was sacked. They blamed him and his administration for failing to provide security on campus as well as imposing a fee hike and other measures without following due procedure.

JNUTA president D.K. Lobiyal, who led a five-member delegation to meet senior HRD Ministry officials, said: “There can be no security, no normalcy on the campus with the V-C present. If the government wants to restore normalcy, they must remove him.”

He said neither students nor teachers feel safe anymore, and that students who left after the violence are still afraid to return. “We have told the Ministry that this is not the right environment for us to resume academic activities. We stand with the students,” he said.

“Students are living in fear. The person who is partly responsible for the violence still there and not being held accountable,” said Shukla Sawant, a professor at the School of Arts and Aesthetics who was a part of the delegation. She said many professors continued to be in touch with students, especially research scholars, so that their work continues even if classes were not held. “We are continuing to support the academic needs of our students. It is the V-C who has blocked the registration of 300 students. What kind of a signal does that send?” she added.

Earlier in the day, the JNU administration sent an advisory to the teachers, saying if they went ahead with their “non-cooperation”, then it would go against the administration that was making efforts to restore normalcy on the campus.

The administration added that a “non-cooperation” call violated the service contracts of the teachers and all faculty members were advised to resume their classes and other academic activities in the interest of the students.

An appeal by 12 deans and seven chairpersons of special centres stated that with over 5,000 students having registered, it was evident that students wanted to participate in their academic pursuits without delay.

They appealed to students and teachers to refrain from any activity that would hinder the conducive atmosphere in the functioning of the university.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qv8kmj/article30562609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14JNU2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/academic-blocks-deserted-on-first-day-of-winter-semester-at-jnu/article30562610.ece
253,2020/01/14,"Why FIR not filed in December 15 incident, Jamia students ask V-C","Several students of Jamia Millia Islamia on Monday gheraoed Vice-Chancellor Najma Akhtar’s office, asking why an FIR had not been registered in the December 15, 2019 incident when the police entered the campus and carried out a crackdown.

The V-C told the students that the police had not received their complaint as yet. The university had written an e-mail to the area SHO, DCP, and the Police Commissioner, demanding action against police personnel responsible for the crackdown in which several students had been injured.

“Despite who we are, we have sent objections to that government of which we are employees and also followed it up multiple times. Now, we will even go to court,” she said. In a statement, the university said a decision had been taken to “explore the possibility of moving the court for the registration of FIR in the December 15, 2019 police brutality in university library case at the earliest”.

The students also sought postponement of the semester examinations that are currently under way. On this, the university said following consultations with the Deans, HODs and other officials, the exams stand cancelled till further notice and a new schedule would be declared later. The university also said the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which had earlier sent a team to the campus, would be sending another team on Tuesday to record statements of the victims.

254,2020/01/14,Shaheen Bagh’s children learn lessons in revolution,"A closed-off space, on the landing outside a shuttered showroom, overlooking the site that has been the spot of an indefinite protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Shaheen Bagh, has been seeing a large group of people of all ages sit and draw, tell stories, and discuss various ideas.

The project was started by research scholar at Jamia Millia Islamia Usama Zakir on January 1. He said: “The idea is to pay a practical tribute to these women.”

He said: “Since the protesters’ children have been out of school for nearly a month, them raising slogans may be harmful to their mental growth. We had decided that we will start our new year by engaging young energy around this protest into something constructive.”

With mattresses laid out in the space, volunteers who include people like Delhi University student Samridhi Khandelwaal, help the children draw posters, talk to them about the protest, and engage with them in some form of “mindfulness”, he said.

‘Who was Inquilab?’

The adults present at the spot said the children do not understand the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) clearly and often ask questions related to it. “The other day, an 11-year-old asked me who was Inquilab?” said Mr. Usama. With about 50-70 children, including young adults, turning up daily at the spot, Mr. Usama said he is overwhelmed by the response.

“I never expected so many children to come and respond to these things in a rational manner,” he said. Among the host of activities carried out here, students read the Preamble and the draft of the CAA to try and understand it.

The walls in this passage are filled with posters made by the children and some artists. The children and others here pay tribute to an individual or group who “positively add energy to these protests nationwide” by putting up posters.

A poster reading “We Love You” is dedicated to TV anchor Ravish Kumar and Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh. On Monday, the participants put up a poster reading: “Fearless Journalists”.

He said he hopes the children understand that their mothers are protesting against injustice, “which could make them someone who is not conveniently deceived by power structures, who cannot be conveniently fooled, whose circle of empathy is global, who empathise with issues not only here but everywhere. That is how great people are born out of such situations”.

He termed the present situation “a transformative moment for Jamia Nagar where it all had silently started through sloganeering and candlelight marches, which is a language that the area had to effectively learn to speak through these protests”.

With women leading the protests, he said: “The gender binary had melted.” Mr. Usama believed that these transformations would make it better for the children. “They [children] have a limitless scope of flourishing into real change-makers,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/giso7w/article30562602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-baghs-children-learn-lessons-in-revolution/article30562603.ece

The video is stylish and the band has done a good job with the songs, especially adapting it to this format. This is the band’s third video/song.

256,2020/01/14,Kochi Corporation asks water-front buildings to produce CRZ certificates,"Six years after its unsuccessful attempt to make the builders of water-front buildings produce Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance certificates, the Kochi Corporation is once again at it.

The corporation has started serving notice on the builders of 93 high-rises that have come up in its CRZ area. However, no time-frame has been fixed for producing the certificates.

It was following a report prepared by the Regional Town Planning Office, Ernakulam, on the CRZ violations in Kochi in the post-Maradu scenario that the local body decided to serve the notices. The list, accessed by The Hindu, comes with the Google Earth image of the site and the building. The names and the pictures of the buildings, the nature of occupancy, the number of floors, the nature of the nearby water body and the access route to the structure are listed. The approximate distance of the building from the water body has also been provided. The corporation plans to verify the approval of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority for these buildings, sources said.

Incidentally, the Chief Secretary had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court in the Maradu apartment case that the State would track all the CRZ violations. Similar lists have been prepared in all the 10 coastal districts of the State.

The list includes one building of a hospital complex in Edappally, located 10 metres from a canal, a convention centre at Kaloor, which is 20 metres from a water body, and a five-star hotel near Vyttila. Interestingly, the residential units of Coast Guard, BSNL and Cochin Shipyard, and commercial complexes and malls that have come up on Shanmugham Road have also found a place on the list.

At the same time, a senior official of the Local Self Government Department questioned the exercise of the Kochi Corporation. The coastal local bodies should issue building permits only after the project proponent producing the NOC from the KCZMA and other agencies. The local bodies should check its dossiers for the clearance letters before asking the builders to produce the NOCs, he said.

Though the authorities had identified 34 such suspected buildings in Vyttila zone alone in the new list, the names of some leading industrialists and influential persons and builders who carried out constructions on the banks of Chilavannoor Lake are missing. Various agencies, including the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had flagged the violations along the lake.

The corporation had issued an ultimatum to 19 builders on November 22, 2014, stating that their buildings would be demolished and the permits revoked if they failed to produce the NOC from the KCZMA within 15 days. However, the builders chose to ignore it. Interestingly, it was after one year of serving notice on the builders that the civic body issued the ultimatum.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-corporation-asks-water-front-buildings-to-produce-crz-certificates/article30569689.ece
257,2020/01/14,HC seeks survey report on Chilavannoor lake banks,"A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to file a report on the survey conducted on the banks of the Chilavannoor lake to identify illegal constructions and encroachments there.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly passed the directive on a petition filed by Cheshire Tarzan of Kadavanthra. According to him, the lake area had been included in the CRZ I as per the coastal regulation notification 2011 as the land near the waterbody was ecologically sensitive. It was part of the Vembanad backwaters, a critically vulnerable water body. The banks of the Chilavannoor lake were once fertile with Pokkali cultivation and mangrove vegetation. However, it had vanished because of indiscriminate reclamation of the waterbody and illegal constructions.

When the petition came up for hearing, the government pleader submitted that the survey as ordered by the High Court was complete. The court then asked the government to file the survey report in three weeks.

The petitioner further said that encroachments, reclamation and dumping of waste including construction waste had caused serious threat to the Chilavanoor lake. No action had been taken to stop or prevent such illegal activities. The authorities were bound to take timely action against the reclamation and illegal constructions on the banks of the lake.

The petitioner also alleged that the Kochi Corporation and Maradu Municipality were aware of the illegalities and know that the lake would come under the CRZ. However, they continued to grant permissions for illegal constructions on the banks of the lake.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-seeks-survey-report-on-chilavannoor-lake-banks/article30568665.ece

Speaking at a session on Kashmir, CAA and NRC organised by Indian Socialist Lawyers Organisation here on Monday, Mr. Pandey compared the protests to the freedom struggle where the British tried to divide the country on communal lines and the people fought it united.

“The BJP government at the Centre wants the country to be divided into Muslims and Hindus to pursue its communal politics. However, the people of the country, especially the youth, have rejected the communal politics of the government and are opposing the legislation united. The political parties, which were initially confused over the legislation and protests, have started supporting it. The protests have evolved into a fight against the fascist forces,” said Dr. Pandey.

263,2020/01/14,"Corpn. to probe officials, lawyer for not presenting facts in HC","The Kochi Corporation will probe its officials and counsel who failed to present the statement of facts and represent the civic body in a case at the High Court pertaining to irregularities in garbage collection by a contractor.

The lapse on the part of the officials could result in the Corporation having to pay the contractor around ₹95 lakh, despite an audit report that specified that the contractor had not taken up the work as per the tender requirements.

Vehicles for garbage collection are hired by the Corporation on a contract basis.

Government audit reports for the local body for 2014-15 and 2015-16 found that the Corporation had suffered a loss of ₹94,55,784 in the two years when the contractor who provided the vehicles to transport solid waste to Brahmapuram transported only one load of waste per day. This was in violation of the tender, which required the contractor to transport two loads daily.

The Corporation had added the loss that accrued to the bills that the contractor submitted for continued work, to retrieve the money – a move against which the contractor petitioned the High Court.

When the counsel for the Corporation did not appear before the court to present the statement of facts, the High Court directed the Corporation in October last year to provisionally pay the contractor, till further orders from the court. The court order also said that if the writ petition eventually ended to the detriment of the petitioner, he would be liable to repay the amount with interest.

Corporation Secretary Anu R.S. said at the council meeting on Monday that the civic body’s counsel did not appear before the court thrice, resulting in the order in favour of the petitioner at the stage at which the case was to be admitted to the court.

Mayor Soumini Jain has ordered the Corporation Secretary to present a report on the matter at the next council meeting. She also suggested that a request might be made to the Chief Secretary to conduct a departmental inquiry into the matter.

“In a deliberate move, the lawyer and officials involved with this did not prepare and submit the statement of facts,” alleged councillor A.B. Sabu. Councillors called for strong action against the officials involved. The Corporation is also likely to appeal to the High Court against the order.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corpn-to-probe-officials-lawyer-for-not-presenting-facts-in-hc/article30562309.ece
264,2020/01/14,Stalled housing project for the landless gets a new lease of life,"Respite may finally be in sight for around 398 beneficiaries identified under the Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) with the Kochi Corporation council approving the decisions that could push the long-delayed housing scheme for the landless forward.

The council, at its meeting on Monday, decided to extend the contract of the company constructing the first tower at Kalvathy, and hand over construction of the second tower to Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), under the mission’s slum redevelopment project.

The Corporation will permit CSML to construct the second 12-storey tower next to the first one, where the civic body’s Mehboob Park now stands. Each tower can house 199 families.

The company’s two-year contract had expired in February last year, after which it had asked for a year’s extension without having to pay a fine.

The delay in construction, which began in 2017, had arisen because work like pile loading, testing and sheet piling had not been included in the initial cost estimates taken for the project.

Since the contractor’s request for an extension was placed before the council in August last year, no unanimous decision could be arrived at in the council meetings that followed, further delaying the construction that has been stalled since last February.

The point of contention in the council was a revision of cost estimates, that could lead to a cost escalation of ₹21 crore.

A project that was to cost around ₹18 crore as per the project report prepared in 2013, would now cost ₹38 crore, factoring in work that was not included in the initial estimates.

“As per the initial agreement, the current contractor would be allowed to complete the work worth ₹18 crore, after which another tender will be called for the remaining work,” Mayor Soumini Jain said.

The beneficiaries heaved a sigh of relief. “We have been waiting for a positive decision on this for several months. We could finally have a home, years after it was promised to us,” said Arifa M.K., who lives in Thuruthy.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/c53hq2/article30562307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KIHOUSING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/stalled-housing-project-for-the-landless-gets-a-new-lease-of-life/article30562308.ece
265,2020/01/14,Health officials to visit more houses as residents air concerns,"Field staff under the District Medical Office and the Nettoor primary health centre visited a few houses in places where dust from flat implosion is making residents quite uncomfortable. More visits are being planned, according to Health officials.

Before the implosion, the Health team had advised 12 people in the vicinity of Alfa Serene to shift as they had chronic lung problems.

“Have sent my folks away for some time as I find the dust could be quite disturbing, giving rise to new health issues,” said Sanuraj Nedumpillil.

His parents had come back to the house on Sunday after the implosion on Saturday but had found the dust too much to bear, he said. His wife and children had moved out a day before the implosion. Some of his elderly relatives have moved to other places for three months.

A word of caution

“It is advisable that all those who are prone to lung-related illness or have chronic lung disease move away from the place for a couple of months till the dust from the implosion and the dust of debris removal get settled,” said Dr. Bindu, Assistant Professor, Pulmonology, Alapuzha Medical College.

People could get chronic bronchitis, usually seen in smokers, and people who have a tendency could have asthmatic attacks too, she added.

The dew particles in the atmosphere would combine with dust and form smog, which is a health hazard, said Dr. Bindu. Rain could have settled some of the dust in the atmosphere, but the weather is hot which makes the dust to stay in the atmosphere longer.

People are advised to wear a mask and water their surroundings, the official added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/health-officials-to-visit-more-houses-as-residents-air-concerns/article30562300.ece
266,2020/01/14,Clouds of dust from debris give nightmare to Maradu residents,"After residents in the vicinity of H2O Holy Faith complained of recurrent troubles from the dust raised from debris, Fort Kochi RDO and officer in-charge of the demolition Snehil Kumar Singh has assured them that the area will be hosed down before the debris is moved.

Residents around the site gathered in front of the Maradu Municipality on Monday morning demanding its intervention. “The dust has been causing breathing troubles and allergies, but the area has not been watered regularly since the implosion,” said Jessy Raju, whose house fell within the 200-m evacuation zone around the flat. It was only after persistent complaints that firetenders were sent on Sunday and Monday evening, she said.

When heavy vehicles at the site began to separate some of the debris on Monday without spraying water, raising huge plumes of dust, people in the area tried to prevent the work, Ms. Raju said. Mr. Singh met residents on Monday evening, assuring them that the agencies handling the debris would spray water before it was removed.

“Edifice Engineering and Vijay Steels, the two demolition agencies, will separate the steel from the debris, and will spray water around the sites before they begin work on Tuesday,” Mr. Singh said. Prompt Enterprises, which will handle the debris removal, will take up spraying water when they begin work, he added.

Maradu municipal chairperson T.H. Nadeera said that dust was an issue around the other demolished flats as well, but a few residents around Alfa Serene had moved to rented accommodations before the implosion, anticipating such issues. When she met the residents around H2O Holy Faith, some of them alleged that they had not been given notices warning them of such after-effects of the demolition, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a1ctjk/article30562294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KIMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/clouds-of-dust-from-debris-give-nightmare-to-maradu-residents/article30562295.ece
267,2020/01/14,Searching for Tukaram,"Yet another production on the 16th century Saint Tukaram and his prodigious legacy opened in Mumbai last weekend at the Mumbai Marathi Sahitya Sangh, but this new Marathi play attempts to takes us to the rational core of the mystic’s philosophy through the first-person perspective of his younger brother, Kanha or Kanhoba, a poet in his own right. Based on Digambar Mokashi’s seminal 1974 novel of the same name, theatre troupe The Blind and The Elephant’s Anandowari (A Blissful Setting) is adapted and directed by Gerish Khemani, and is being staged as a two-hander featuring actors Ajinkya Shrutika Satish and Mandar Gokhale (recently seen in Gurleen Judge’s The Hunger Artist). The running time of the play is roughly 70 minutes.

Looking for salvation

Khemani was introduced to the novel through Vijay Lele’s English translation of Atul Pethe’s stage adaptation, as edited by Vijay Tendulkar, and first performed almost a decade ago by Kishore Kadam as a one-man show. Khemani’s version is not a straight-up adaptation. He introduces the character of Mokashi himself as one who provides a third stance. “I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. Tukaram has found salvation, what about the writer?” posits the director. In the same way Tukaram’s wife Avali roams the hills of Dehu in search of a husband lost in his moorings in Prajakt Deshmukh’s Sangeet Devbhabali, here too, Kanha spends long hours looking for his brother. This tiring physical search is a corollary of Tukaram’s equally onerous spiritual quest, and Khemani layers in the metaphysical, “A writer is in search of his version of Tukaram and the meaningful silence beyond his words. These quests interpenetrate and illuminate each other.” Even if Tukaram’s devotion to God is central to the narrative, quite incidentally, the play isn’t about religious matters as much as it is about the creative consciousness of a poet, and his ideas rather than his beliefs, if a thin line could be drawn between them. At one point of time, even Vithhal joins in the eternal quest that has all players in the play caught up in its swirl.

Mokashi was an important figure in a new wave of Marathi novelists who entered into their prime in the decades post Independence, and his style has been described as one of “shrewd discernment from an alienating distance”, by scholar A K Bhagwat. Anandowari, the novel, owes a debt to Kanha’s own sharp-eyed poetry on his brother, in which he emerges as much more domestically settled than thought of conventionally, as “a loving elder brother, a responsible family head, an affectionate man who is equally loved by his family,” according to one of many blogs on Tukaram.

Colloquial flavour

Khemani’s use of the character of the writer is self-reflexive to an extent, and the fictionalised Mokashi isn’t quite so much a biographical entity as he is a surrogate, perhaps, for Khemani’s own preoccupations, which he describes as, “the tremendous longing for the absolute and the infinite in a creative process dealing with the search for meaning in existential desperation.”

As in any devised process, the actors contributed in no small measure to the dramatic texture of the finished play. They also added a colloquial and accessible flavour to playwright Yugandhar Deshpande’s Marathi translation of Khemani’s English script. As is di rigueur in plays associated with Tukaram, a melodic arrangement of traditional abhangs has been created by Ruturaj Bhosle. After working with a large ensemble in his earlier play, In Search of Dariya Sagar, a treatise on Sindhi pride, Khemani wanted to work with a smaller cast. “The transition was wonderful, since managing a large cast takes a lot of bandwidth. Anandowari was more exciting and less stressful. We connected well with each other, and were able to focus on the task at hand,” he says. It was also a project which they took their time in mounting, with the outcome finally available to audiences.

Anandowari will be staged at St. Andrews Centre for Philosophy and Performing Art on January 19 at 7.30 p.m.; more details at bookmyshow.com",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/wsz540/article30568303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Anandowari-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/searching-for-tukaram/article30568304.ece

269,2020/01/14,"4,000 CRZ violations in Kozhikode district","The fear of demolition of their houses is hanging over many residents with the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) submitting the final list of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations in Kozhikode district on Tuesday.

Nearly 4,000 CRZ violations, including 1,657 within the Kozhikode Corporation limits, have been identified in the district based on a consolidated report from 35 local bodies as on January 14, 2020.

Regional Town Planner P.A. Isha submitted the report to Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao, who is also the chairman of the Coastal District Committee (CDC), following an order of the State government. Such reports from all districts will be submitted to the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) so as to be produced in the Supreme Court.

A total of 3,916 violations have been found in 35 local bodies that come under the purview of the CRZ. However, seven local bodies have reported no violation. The details of all the illegal constructions have been uploaded on the website of the Kozhikode district administration.

The recent demolition of five waterfront residential apartments at Maradu municipality has triggered a fear psychosis among the residents in Kozhikode.

“Many people did not take the CRZ rules seriously during the construction of buildings. As of now, some buildings are occupied, others unoccupied and many others are still under construction,” Ms. Isha told The Hindu.

Approval for construction of buildings should be taken from the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority (KSCZMA), which is the empowered authority to deal with environmental issues related to the CRZ. No construction is allowed within 200 metres from the coast in the CRZ-III area while works are allowed beyond 50 metres from the coast in the CRZ-II zone.

Earlier, building constructions were approved based on the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1991. Now, the coastal zones are regulated by the the CRZ notification of 2011.

In Kozhikode, more CRZ violations have been found in grama panchayats than in municipalities. Kadalundi, a coastal village close to the Arabian sea and famous for its bird sanctuary, has 486 CRZ violations.

The other local bodies are Azhiyur grama panchayat (286), Chemancherry (406), Onchiyam (267), Moodadi (227), Thalakulathoor (03), Chengottukkavu (142), Chorode (64), and Edacherry grama panchayat (44), and Payyoli municiplaity (39).

Powers to approve building constructions up to 250 sq m was vested with a district-level committee formed during 2013-14.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/iubxhm/article30569709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KI-CRZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/4000-crz-violations-in-kozhikode-district/article30569710.ece

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said on Monday that 46 new fever cases were reported from the health camp held at Anayamkunnu V.M.H.M. Higher Secondary School where the flu was reported in January first week, and at the primary health centre, Karassery. The number of fever cases was coming down compared with previous days, Dr. Jayasree said.

Awareness sessions were held at educational institutions. Fourteen teams of health activists had spoken to teachers about preventive steps to be undertaken. They covered a total of 26 institutions. A medical team inspected the students at the Anayamkunnu school. Dr. Jayasree said instructions had been issued to the students with fever symptoms not to attend classes until they were cured of the disease. School authorities had been told not to conduct assembly sessions for two more weeks. The panchayat authorities distributed hand kerchiefs among 3,000 students within their limits.

Meanwhile, the baby of a Nilgiri native, who died of H1N1 flu on Sunday, is under observation at the Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH) of the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

272,2020/01/14,Emirates may recommence operation of large flights from Calicut airport,"Dubai-based Emirates, which has been playing hide-and-seek with the resumption of the operation of wide-bodied aircraft from the Calicut International Airport, has sounded positive signals on commencing its flights shortly.

This follows a meeting between a delegation led by M.K. Raghavan, MP, and Ahmed Hashim Khoory, Emirates senior vice president, commercial operations (West Asia and Indian Ocean) in Dubai. Emirates had been showing reluctance to recommence its operations despite the Directorate General of Civil Aviation issuing No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the airline company in July last.

In their 45-minute discussion, Mr. Raghavan said Mr. Khoory had agreed to hold talks with the Ministry of Civil Aviation to speed up the process of restarting flights from the Calicut airport.

He also shared with him the hardships faced by air passengers from north Kerala as most emigrants in UAE depended on the Calicut airport.

Mr. Raghavan pointed out that Kozhikode was the hub of economic activity in Malabar. And the resumption of flights will not only help in improving bilateral relationship but also boost trade and commerce between the two nations.

Besides, he said foreign tourists would benefit with the commencement of Emirates flights. A majority of them visit Kozhikode and the neighbouring district of Malappuram for treatment purposes, apart from touring the city.

Emirates has secured approval to operate Boeing 777- 200 Extended Range, Boeing 777- 200 Long Range, and Boeing 777- 300 Extended Range aircraft from the airport.

275,2020/01/14,Consumers throng markets,"Consumers were busy buying vegetables, fruits, flowers, sugarcane and turmeric, among other essential goods, to celebrate Pongal, the harvest festival.

A bundle of sugarcane (with 15 sticks), which was sold anywhere between ₹ 350 and ₹450 till Monday, fell to ₹ 200 on Tuesday as lorries loaded with sugarcane continued to arrive while the demand came down drastically.

“We expect this price to sustain till Wednesday,” said N. Murugan, a sugarcane trader having his roadside makeshift shop in Tirunelveli.

Arrival of palmyra tubers from various parts of Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram district ensured the sale of the produce at ₹ 100 for 25 tubers since last week.

As tubers from Ramanathapuram district were sold along with palmyrah seeds, known for its sweet kernel, they were close to consumers’ hearts than the local variety.

Prices of vegetables have touched an all-time high. Consumers had to pay ₹ 140 for a kg of shallot, ₹ 120 for brinjal, ₹ 48 for potato, ₹ 160 for mango, ₹ 70 for bellary onion, ₹ 60 for beans despite decent arrival from farms. However, they did not deter consumers from buying vegetables, as huge crowd could be seen buying vegetables in all markets including farmers’ markets at Maharaja Nagar, Kandigaiperi and Melapalayam.

As the cold weather prevailing this season would hit jasmine yield, the most sought-after flower was sold at ₹ 3,500 a kg and the price is expected to move further up.

“Against usual supply of 2 tonnes of jasmine a day, we’re getting just 20 kg a day and you can imagine the demand for this flower, especially during festival seasons. I won’t be surprised if the price crosses ₹ 4,000 a kg on Tuesday night,” said flower seller I. Narayanan of Palayamkottai. Those who had to buy ‘pichi poo’ too had to spend a lot as it was sold for ₹ 1,800 per kg.

Sale of goats in the weekly market at Melapalyam was brisk on Tuesday and the demand for meat would be high on Thursday. Farmers, who had brought goats to be sold in the Melapalayam weekly market, returned home on a happy note as they fetched high price for these domestic animals. “Goats, which were sold for ₹ 8,000 till last week, were sold for ₹ 10,000 and above. On Tuesday, as they are expected to sell one kg of meat with bone for ₹ 700 and above,” said a farmer who had sold his two goats for ₹ 21,000, which is a big money for him ahead of ‘Pongal’ celebrations.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/consumers-throng-markets/article30568739.ece

Vegetables of the winter season such as tubers, sweet potato, lima beans and pulses were on sale at shops in the Gandhi Vegetable Market.

Sugarcane from Theni, Palani, Sanarpatti, Natham and Vadipatti arrived in bunches. A bunch of sugarcane was sold for ₹ 250 to 350 based on size and quality. A pair of turmeric from Karur, Erode and Oddanchatram was sold for ₹ 30 to ₹ 50. Prices of flowers continued to be higher.

Harvest and sale of palm tubers picked up since the past few days in villages and towns around Ramanathapuram. Farmers from hamlets like Regunathapuram and Natham Kulam raise palm tubers in small pieces of land and sell them once a year during Pongal.

“Due to excess water and rain, a portion of the yield has rotten and we could not get a good price. We ended up selling a tuber for 80 paise. Last year, we sold it for ₹ 2,” said G. Ramanathan, a farmer, who has raised tubers on 10 cents.

However, traders said they were able to sell the produce for an average price of ₹ 150 for hundred tubers. “Compared to last year, the price of palm tubers has come down. Too much of water is not really good for this plant. Retailers would finally sell tubers for ₹ 4 to 5,” said Krishnan, who supplies palm tubers to Madurai and Thoothukudi markets from Ramanathapuram.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/consumers-throng-markets/article30568709.ece

278,2020/01/14,HC summons Tirunelveli DFO,"MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has summoned the District Forest Officer (DFO) of Tirunelveli Forest Division, seeking an explanation on non-consideration of its order for appointment of the son of a deceased forest guard on compassionate grounds.

Justice M.S. Ramesh directed the DFO to be present before the court on February 3 with an explanation. The court was hearing the petition filed by P. Subbulakshmi of Srivaikundam taluk in Thoothukudi district.

The petitioner said her husband Pitchiah, a forest guard, died in harness in 1995. Her husband’s son, Esakkivel, born to his second wife, was two years old at that time. A representation was made to the authorities to register her stepson’s name for providing appointment on compassionate grounds.

Reminders were also sent in 1996 and 2003. After her stepson completed his higher secondary education in 2012, a representation was sent to the authorities concerned requesting his appointment in the Forest Department.

However, the request was rejected and when the authorities were informed of the reminders, they were also rejected, as “they were not made within three years of the demise of the forest guard”.

She said she had filed a petition challenging the rejection before the High Court Bench. The High Court Bench had directed consideration of the representation by the authorities concerned.

With no decision taken by the authorities, a contempt petition was filed. However, the contempt petition was dismissed with a liberty to file a fresh petition as the authorities informed the court that the representation was rejected.

Hence, she filed the present petition.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-summons-tirunelveli-dfo-madurai/article30568396.ece
279,2020/01/14,Apple-sized tumour in the heart removed by Madurai government hospital doctors,"Doctors at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) removed an apple-sized tumor from the heart of an11- year-old girl from Thottikulam village in Tirunelveli district. The young patient is on the road to full recovery, Dean, J. Sangumani announced at a press meet on Tuesday.

Former Head of the Department, Cardio-thoracic surgery, A. Rathinavel, who led a team of doctors on November 17, 2019 said that the excised tumour was very large 9cm x 6cm x 4cm and weighed around 150 g in the right ventricle. “Although such tumours exist outside the heart and near the heart, it is rare that they are inside the heart,” he said.

He said that the patient arrived complaining of palpitations and chest pain. After evaluating the problem through CT scans and an ECHO, an open heart surgery was performed on November 13 to evaluate the tumour. After four days, the doctors performed a four-hour surgery to remove it and said that this benign tumour is not likely to recur.

The doctors at the hospital also operated upon a 35 year-old man from Sivaganga district who complained of breathing difficulties following a case of poisoning. The patient who underwent a tracheal resection and anastamosis was initially admitted in October, 2019.

Assistant Professor Marwyn Manoah said that the complicated procedure caused the contraction of the windpipe -- leaving a narrow pathway for air. The operation proved to be useful after a three week recovery period when a fibrotic bronchoscopy showed signs of healing.

“Both surgeries would have cost between ₹2 and ₹ 3 lakh if done at private hospitals but patients here benefited from the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme,” said the Dean.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/i5tlk4/article30567167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14JANTH--HEART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/apple-sized-tumour-in-the-heart-removed-by-madurai-government-hospital-doctors/article30567168.ece
280,2020/01/14,"With frost, fairyland-like views in Kodaikanal","The vast expanse of grassy dunes in the upper Kodaikanal hill ranges of Mannavanur are now covered in layers of frost, making the region resemble a fairyland. The villages of upper Kodaikanal hills including Gundupatti, Kookal, Gundancholai, Poombarai, Mannavanur and Parikombai have been witnessing a steep dip in temperature over the past few days. As a result, the areas have been experiencing frosting in the early mornings.

Tourists visiting the Mannavanur eco-tourism site have been thrilled to see the spectacular scenery and have come back with stunning pictures of the landscape. “The pictures could easily be mistaken for a place in Kashmir. We were excited to see miles and miles of frost covering the grasslands,” said S. Devaki, who visited Kodaikanal over the past weekend.

Locals in the villages are are equally thrilled and have demanded that the place be promoted among tourists. “The frost is seen from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. after which it melts. Afternoons are warm but after 3 p.m. the cold starts setting in,” said a resident.

“The frosting can be seen for the next 10 days, depending on the temperature. Over the past one week, the Kodaikanal Observatory has recorded a minimum temperature of 7 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, it recorded a minimum temperature of 11 degree Celsius. In the upper regions such as Mannavanur, the temperature may further dip to 3 degrees,” said Neeraj Bairwa, scientific assistant, Meteorological Department, Kodaikanal Observatory.

“With the Pongal holidays starting on Tuesday, the tourists inflow has also increased. A large number of the tourists are moving towards the upper hills, away from Kodaikanal town. Some of them also evince interest in camping in these sites. It will be a great boost to tourism in the hill town if the tourism department introduces camping in places like Mannavanur,” said Aseer, a tourist agent in Kodaikanal.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dm5pr7/article30565050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14JANTH-Frostjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/with-frost-fairyland-like-views-in-kodaikanal/article30565051.ece

282,2020/01/14,Soulful singing by Gayathri Venkataraghavan leaves Maduraiities ecstatic,"Maduraiities listened to the soulful singing by Gayathri Venkataraghavan, accompanied by R.K. Shrikumar on the Violin, N. Manoj Siva on the Mrudangam and Trichy Krishnasamy on the Ghatam, on the 9th day of the 68th Annual Music and Arts Festival of Sree Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam.

Gayatri began her concert with Neelakanda Sivan’s Natta varnam “Shri Ganapataye thunai seivai neeye”, invoking the blessings of Lord Ganesa. She picked up speed with Navukarasar’s Viruttam “Kuniththa puruvamum kovvaich chevvayil” for the song “Iyyane natanam adiya porpada in saveri” by Muthu Tandavar, a song which in a way reflective of the happiness that Nataraja radiates as he dances on the day of Thiruvadirai at Chidambaram.

The singer delineated well for the subtle glides of pleasing Lalitha for Shyama Sastri’s “Nannu brova lalitha” and displayed her skill in singing intricate patterns of the raga. Accompanist R K Shrikumar, on the violin performed with uniform involvement in bringing out the beauty of the lyrics as well as the swaras and won the admiration of the rasikas. The audience became totally ecstatic to the verse “ninnuvina evarunnaru ma gati”.

It is said that Ravana sang many hymns in praise of the lord, but his heart cooled only when a hymn was sung in the ""Hara Priya"" ragam and hence the name, (Hara - Shiva) (Priya - Loved) - The one dear to shiva. Gayatri’s next rendition was in “Karahara priya” for Tyagaraja’s “nadaci nadaci cucera”, in which the saint pities those people who look for Lord Rama in Ayodhya by walking all the way to the city not knowing the real location.

The RTP for the Pallavi “ Kanaga Sabesan Darisanam” in the raga simmendra mathyamam witnessed Ragamalika, Dhanyasi and valaci. The vocalist delighted the listeners during the Raga alapana and Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Krishnasamy on the Ghatam co-ordinated with each other to provide a good ‘tani’.

The final songs included, “Mansa Sancharare” by Tyagaraja, “Kannanidam Eduthu Solladi” by Ambujam Krishna, and a Meera Bhajan.

Addressing presspersons, he said it was nearly two months since the election to the council was conducted. The two MLAs have not taken any interest to prevail upon the government to conduct elections to the offices of Mayor and Deputy Mayor. They should take the lead in making the government issue the notification for teh Mayoral election. With this, the new councillors can also take oath. He said the government has already issued the notification reserving the office of Mayor for the 21st term to a Backward Class A councillor and the office of Deputy Mayor to a general category woman councillor. Notwithstanding this, the MLAs have not been able to convince the government to hold Mayoral elections.

He alleged that developmental projects have come to a standstill without the presence of the council.

286,2020/01/14,"Soon, a helpline to solve grievances of students, teachers: Suresh Kumar","Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said on Monday his department would be launching a helpline to solve the grievances of students, parents and teachers on March 31.

He was speaking after inaugurating the new building of Government Higher Primary School at Mannur Padukere here and also the 75th anniversary celebrations of the school here.

Mr. Kumar said that the intention behind the launch of the helpline was to help the parents, students and teachers. There were many philanthropists, who wanted to construct buildings, and set up libraries and laboratories in government schools. Some people wanted to teach English and computer science to students in government schools. But these philanthropists found it difficult to visit several departmental offices to get permission for these works. Hence, the department had decided to launch an app to make it easy for philanthropists and others to get permission for their plans, he said.

Mr. Kumar said students were carrying school bags that were full of books. The weight of the bags was too much to bear. Hence, the government had decided to take measures to reduce the weight from the next academic year.

It would also be introducing two bag-less days a month from the next academic year. On these two days, students would not have to carry their bags to school. Instead, they would have to participate in extra-curricular activities on these days, he said.

After the video clip of recent incident of a teacher asking a student to pronounce a word went viral, his department had issued instructions to the teachers not to use mobile phones or film such incidents on their phones. “A teacher should be like a mother to the students,” he said.

Mr. Kumar said he wanted to see long queues for admission outside government schools. There should be migration of students from private schools to government schools. He would grant Karnataka Public School for the Government Higher Primary and High School here so that it could also have a pre-university college on campus, he said.

Chethan Nayak, chairman, Mangaluru Chapter, ICSI and P.S. Yadapadithaya, Vice-Chancellor, exchanged the MoU document at the university on Monday.

The ICSI is presenting this gold medal instituted under The ICSI Signature Award scheme to toppers of B.Com courses in State universities. The institute will present a gold medal each year in the signatory university.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Nayak said the institute was presenting the medal to popularise the company secretary course among students. While the topper will receive a gold medal worth ₹25,000 this year, the next three toppers in the course will be given the option to study the two-and-half-year course of ICSI for free. Noting that the ICSI head office normally takes up to two months to vet a proposal sent by its local branch to institute the gold medal, Mr. Chethan said in the case of Mangalore University, this approval was sent within 24 hours. This shows the standing of the 39-year-old university in the academic arena in the country.

Mr. Yadapadithaya said that the Associate of Company Secretary title that a student completing the foundation, executive and final course offered by the Institute will stand a good chance of moving up the corporate ladder. The ICSI is committed to providing the gold medal as per university statute every year as per the MoU, he said.

Prasanna Patil, vice-president, Mangaluru Chapter, ICSI, said the amendment to Companies Act, 2013, has mandated that companies with an equity of ₹10 crore and above must compulsorily have a company secretary, who will look into issues pertaining of setting up of board and other legal issues.

Kumaraswamy, it could order an inquiry into the same.

Harsha to say that some of the video clips on the violence had been shared with their sequence and context being changed, he said.

He alleged that the State government, through the Police Commissioner, was trying to project that the clips were ‘incomplete’. Thus, it was attempting to mislead the people.

Mr. Kunhi alleged that Mr. Harsha had failed to control the violence in the city on December 19.

The president said that his party was not politicising the December 19 police firing that left two persons killed. Mr. Kunhi alleged that the administration in Dakshina Kannada had come to a standstill. There was an atmosphere of fear in the district. The need of the hour was to restore order and peace, he said.

292,2020/01/14,Hallmarking made must for gold jewellery,"No jeweller will be allowed to sell gold jewellery or artefacts without hallmark from the Bureau of Indian Standards from January 15, 2021, onwards, Consumer Affairs Minister Ramvilas Paswan announced on Tuesday.

If jewellery or artefacts made of 14, 18 and 22 carat gold are sold without a BIS hallmark, then the jeweller could face a huge penalty and even imprisonment.

The penalty may be worth five times the cost of the object and the imprisonment up to one year.

Gold hallmarking is a purity certification of the precious metal and is voluntary in nature at present. The BIS is already running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery since April 2000 and around 40% of gold jewellery is being hallmarked currently. “This will become mandatory from January 15, 2021. We will give one year time for implementation. Jewellers will be allowed to sell only 14, 18 and 22-carat gold jewellery,” Mr. Paswan told a press conference.

Instead of 10 grades earlier, hallmarked gold jewellery will now be available in three grades of 14 carat, 18 carat and 22 carat, he said.

Jewellers have been given a year’s time to register themselves with the BIS. “There are only 28849 jewellers so far registered with us. We don’t have an exact estimate of the number of jewellers in the country but it could be 3-4 lakhs,” BIS scientist R.S. Pasriche said. The BIS will also be expanding its hallmarking centres. So far there are 892 centres across the country. Mr. Paswan said each district will now get one.

Consumers have to watch out for four marks on hallmarked gold jewellery: BIS mark, purity in carat, assay centre’s name and jewellers’ identification mark.

Mr. Paswan clarified that people who want to exchange their old gold jewellery which doesn’t carry a hallmark won’t be troubled. “This is only for jewellers who are selling new gold jewellery. The common man will not be harassed,” he said. The Minister said mandatory hallmarking will protect the public against lower caratage and ensure consumers do not get cheated while buying gold ornaments and get the purity as marked on the ornaments. “This will bring in transparency and assure the consumers of quality.

294,2020/01/14,"CCI orders enquiry into business practices of Amazon, Flipkart","Fair market watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered an enquiry into the operations of both Amazon and Flipkart on multiple counts, including deep discounts and exclusive tie-up with preferred sellers.

Finding merits in the allegations, the Commission has asked its Director General (DG) to complete the investigation in 60 days from the receipt of the order.

Traders’ body Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh had questioned four key practices of the e-commerce companies, seeking an investigation. They include exclusive launch of mobile phones, preferred sellers on the marketplaces, deep discounting and preferential listing/promotion of private labels.

In its order, the CCI said that it needs to be investigated whether the alleged exclusive arrangements, deep discounting and preferential listing by Amazon and Flipkart are being used as an exclusionary tactic to foreclose competition.

Also, it needs to be seen if such practices are resulting in an appreciable adverse effect on competition, contravening the provisions of Section 3 (1) read with Section 3(4) of the Competition Act.

“In view of the foregoing, the Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation by the Director General (DG), to determine whether the conduct of the OPs (Amazon and Flipkart) have resulted in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Act read with Section 3(4) thereof, as detailed in this order,” the CCI order said.

Complaining against the e-commerce leaders, the traders’ body said that Flipkart provides deep discounts to a select few preferred sellers, such as Omnitech Retail, on its platform which adversely impact non-preferred sellers.

It further alleged that by having exclusive tie-ups in the relevant market with smartphone companies, the e-commerce firms provide exclusivity through discounting and preferential listings, thus distorting the competition.

The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) estimated that the Indian e-commerce market was $33 billion in 2017-18 which reached $38.5 billion during 2018—19.

Flipkart and Amazon comprise the bulk of the online retail market in India.

The Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh said that Amazon and Flipkart are able to cross-subsidise because of the huge amount of funding received from their investors, which has resulted in incentives that allow pricing below cost on their platforms through their sellers, resulting in creation of high entry barriers and high capital costs for any new entrant to the market.

Commenting on the development, both the e-commerce majors reiterated their stand that they have been compliant to the laws.

“We welcome the opportunity to address allegations made about Amazon. We are confident in our compliance, and will cooperate fully with CCI,” said an Amazon India spokesperson.

A Flipkart spokesperson said: “We are currently reviewing the document. The Flipkart group is fully compliant with all applicable laws and FDI regulations. We take pride in democratising e-commerce in India and giving market access to lakhs of MSMEs, sellers, artisans and small businesses, making quality and affordable goods available to consumers through our transparent and efficient marketplace while creating lakhs of jobs.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/7wld4z/article30564550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THONLINESHOPPING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cci-orders-enquiry-into-business-practices-of-amazon-flipkart/article30564551.ece

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it was ordering a wider probe following a review of allegations that Amazon and Flipkart were promoting some “preferred sellers” and in turn impacting the business of other smaller sellers.

The two companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the antitrust move.

The investigation order comes in a week when Amazon chief Jeff Bezos is expected to visit India for a company event and potential meetings with government officials.

The complaint was filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group representing small-and medium-sized businesses, which alleged that several of Amazon and Flipkart’s preferred sellers were affiliated with or controlled by the companies themselves, either directly or indirectly.

“The Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation,” said the order.

The investigation is the latest setback for Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, which Indian brick-and-mortar traders allege violate the country's foreign investment rules and burn billions of dollars to offer steep discounts that hurt smaller traders.

The United States on Monday removed the currency manipulator label it imposed on China last summer and forex traders believe it as a sign of easing tensions between the two economic powers after nearly two years of conflict.

The U.S. Treasury in its semi-annual report to Congress said that the yuan has strengthened and Beijing is no longer considered a currency manipulator, just days before U.S. President Donald Trump is set to sign a “phase one” trade agreement with China.

At the interbank foreign exchange the rupee opened at 70.78 against the U.S. dollar, registering a rise of 8 paise over its previous close.

On Monday, rupee had settled for the day at 70.86 against the U.S. dollar.

Traders said the appreciation in the rupee was largely on the back of positive global cues.

“Over the summer, China took concrete steps to devalue its currency,” the yuan or renminbi (RMB), and those moves “left the RMB at its weakest level against the dollar in over 11 years,” Treasury said.

The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.04% to 97.38.

301,2020/01/14,Protest is at the core of poetry,"IIT-Kanpur was recently at the centre of a controversy over “Hum Dekhenge”, a popular Urdu nazm, or poem, written by Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The poem was recited by a group of students on campus during an agitation. This enraged many others, including a faculty member, who found the nazm offending their religious sentiments. Few cared to understand Faiz’s poem in context. In the ongoing protests surrounding the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens, there have been several occasions when protesters have chanted the poems of Gorakh Pandey, Vaidyanath Mishra (Nagarjun), Dushyant Kumar and Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh, to name a few.

Renowned Bengali poet Joy Goswami wrote a poem in support of JNU students who were brutally beaten up on campus. It went viral on social media. Goswami ends his poem with a lament that silence is akin to mass slaughter. Recently, an installation with Miya poetry (written by Bengali-origin Muslims) from Assam was removed from an art festival in Goa. Martin Niemöller’s “First they came” is another poem that has gained wide currency in these protests. There are many names that could join the list including Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou and Adrienne Rich. The ongoing protests perhaps endeared many more people to poetry, who discovered its subversive character.

Understanding poetry

That begs the question: why do so many people appear to be scared of poetry? Weren’t we always told that poetry is about emotions recollected in tranquillity and the gentle expression of sentiments? Or about beauty, which ought to be desired and cherished, about daffodils and nightingales that are far removed for many from their immediate contexts? Sometimes, in childhood, it felt like a conspiracy to equate the ornate or the decorative with the poetic as if the only purpose of poetry were to soothe agitated souls and offer relief from the vagaries of life.

Reflecting upon this narrative about poetry in my childhood, I am filled with outrage. Only later, when I began to read and understand poetry on my own terms, did I realise that dissent or protest is at the core of poetry. Poetry has always been anti-hegemonic. Dissent, however, must be broadly understood in this context. It could surely mean raising your voice against oppressive powers or ills that prevail in the social structure. In poetry, or any art form for that matter, dissent or protest could also be interpreted as breaking boundaries, creating new forms, genres and vocabulary of expression and thus looking at the world with a fresh pair of eyes and sensibility. Poetry has always done that. Filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak used to say, “Poetry is the art of all arts.” Art doesn’t adhere to set standards. In defiance, it seeks self-renewal. If poetry is art, how can it resist defiance?

The political events of today suggest that that poetry is a spontaneous reaction to our time. It is more adaptable to forms of protest and performance. These events also show that poetry is deeply historical. It bears testimony to the times we live in and serves as a reminder of our past. A large contingent of our Bhakti tradition poets are critical of religious dogma. Is there any other way of reading Kabir?

Giving rise to future poets

Namdeo Dhasal showed us the underbelly of Mumbai and exposed us to Dalit life in the city. Narayan Surve did something similar by tracing the history of his father’s arrival in Mumbai and the life of perennial humiliation that followed till his last day. Dilip Chitre once said that all poetry is protest.

Poetry is confrontation. It echoes the joys of living but also embodies its despairs and agonies. If so much of our lived experience and reality is a constant encounter with despair, how can poets desist from showcasing the same? Protests also birth new art and uncover new voices. Perhaps future poets will emerge from the ongoing protests and their verse will bear witness to our treacherous times.

302,2020/01/14,Is a new India rising?,"The tsunami of protests across the length and breadth of the country has several fascinating facets. Are there any significant pointers in it?

First and foremost, these are clearly the civil society’s autonomous protests, devoid of any organic links with any political party. Barring issuing some statements in support or occasional visits by leaders to a protest site, even political parties have kept themselves at a distance from these protests. Underlying the autonomy is perhaps an unarticulated feeling that the issues evoking the protests go beyond electoral battles; that these concern the very life and blood of society’s future. There is also an unarticulated assumption that the solution lies beyond the ken of one or the other political party or indeed all parties together. Therefore, reliance on a party or a group, any group, might end up in diversion, which often becomes equivalent of betrayal. The one possible link with political parties is perhaps a potential realisation by them that they might be left aside by the people if they keep the distance intact — a case of people leading the parties instead of the other way round.

The power of resistance

A consequence of civil society’s direct involvement is that it is refusing to buy the current regime’s divisive Hindu-Muslim formula. This formula has already fetched the National Democratic Alliance two terms in Parliament but seems to have hit a wall. Resistance began with society’s response to uncalled-for police brutality on students in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University. And soon the chief target of resistance became the Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register of Citizens-National Population Register strategy devised by the regime to pit the Muslim community against the rest. The wide-ranging and unrelenting participation of people from all groups in the protests is clear enough signal of society’s refusal to fall for it. Interesting also is the Muslim community’s refusal to fall for the strategy of making their identity dichotomous with their Indian identity; the Muslims have instead sought to assert their religious identity in full concert with their Indian national identity by flaunting both at the same time, which in any case is far truer than the one which counterposes the two.

The resistance from the students is an amazing aspect even as it is wise to remind ourselves that their community has been the most energetic element in India’s various resistance movements — and for that matter elsewhere around the world, whether in the anti-colonial struggles in Asia, Africa and Latin America, or the anti-Vietnam war protests in the U.S. Their protests have also grown in dimensions from repression in universities to the regime’s hitherto successful Divide and Rule policy and its latest version encapsulated in the CAA-NRC-NPR. Neither has the government’s incessant attempts to convince them of the honesty of its purpose, which could also be called brainwashing, failed to persuade them, nor has the repeated assertion by Home Minister Amit Shah of not budging an inch deterred them.

One of the most vociferous charges made against the government has been its grave attempt to prevent students and others from questioning it by simply branding such people as “anti-nationals” of which various equivalents have been newly minted: “anti-Modi”, “anti-Hindu”, “Urban Naxal”. The government has also unleashed a barrage of filthy abuse and threats on social media through a highly organised IT machine under the BJP’s control. A good segment of the media — now being called ‘Modia’ — has also pitched in with its aggressive campaign of malice against anyone with the mildest of doubts against the government’s extravagant claims.

Yet, all this could not crush the spirit of questioning, especially on campuses, repression notwithstanding. The examples are now beyond count: there are protests in Hyderabad University, Jadavpur University, Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institutes of Technology, Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi University and even in some of the safe and secure private universities. Jawaharlal Nehru University is an outstanding instance of standing up to repression for over four years now. Repression in any case is not the most durable of all forms of governance; this is one of history’s abiding lessons. The wider society is waking up to the limits of repression as state policy and responding.

Quality of leadership

One of the most endearing aspects of the current wave of protests is the exemplary quality of leadership displayed by students from the underprivileged social strata. Kanhaiya Kumar has become a national figure thanks largely to the Modi government’s atrocious handling of his “crime” which enabled him to demonstrate his extraordinary oratorical skill and his clear-headed perspectives to put forward his case with almost devastating ease. It is fascinating that the extempore slogan he raised on the JNU campus for “azadi” on his release from jail in 2016 has now become the national war cry for students and the youth. But he is one among innumerable other emerging leaders of student movements across the country. It is heartwarming to see young women taking up verbal, and now even physical, challenges to articulate their feelings and thoughts lucidly, fearlessly and forcefully. JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh has once again occupied premier space on this front, thanks again to the mishandling by the Modi regime. One also comes across a large number of such promising student leaders on local channels speaking in their local language. This is where one sees promise of a new generation refusing to buy any “line” of any party but laying down its own terms for the country’s future discourse. The conflict is no longer between the BJP and the Opposition parties’ vote banks; it is now firmly situated between the BJP government and the people of India.

303,2020/01/14,In the name of self-defence,"The killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani near Baghdad in drone strikes carried out by the U.S. earlier in January raised the spectre of war in West Asia. Later, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to attack cultural sites in Iran in the event of reprisals by Tehran. The next week, Iran retaliated by carrying out missile attacks on two facilities housing U.S. troops in Iraq. These incidents give rise to some interesting legal questions: Was the U.S. attack on Soleimani legally justified? And can cultural sites be legitimately attacked in any armed U.S. response?

Under international law, there is a general prohibition on the use of force, articulated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Article proscribes any use of force by members against the “territorial integrity or political independence” of a state. However, the Charter recognises two limited exceptions: first, in the use of force by a state in the lawful exercise of its right to self-defence; and second, when such an act is carried out with the prior authorisation of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and acting pursuant to the Council’s emergency powers “to maintain or restore international peace and security”.

Without prior consent

The use of force by the U.S. in Baghdad to kill Soleimani without prior consent from Iraq or the UN was, hence, a violation of such proscription, unless the U.S. can justify it as a lawful exercise of its right to self-defence. Not surprisingly, the Donald Trump administration was quick to claim that the killing was in exercise of its right to “anticipatory” self-defence. Mr. Trump claimed, without any further elaboration, that Soleimani was planning “imminent and sinister” attacks against U.S. diplomats and personnel.

The legal basis for “anticipatory” self-defence remains deeply controversial and contested. There are both legal and policy arguments against recognising a right to anticipatory self-defence. First, Article 51 of the UN Charter recognises the inherent right of every state to use force in self-defence, only “if an armed attack occurs”. Second, unlike an “armed attack”, which is an objective standard, an “anticipated” armed attack is a subjective one, open to abuse by states. Since the object and purpose of the general prohibition on the use of force is to minimise resort to unilateral use of force, a stricter and restricted notion of the right to self-defence is perhaps more appropriate.

Those arguing in favour of a right to anticipatory self-defence, however, stress on its customary character and frequently reference the Caroline incident. In 1837, British militia from Canada crossed into U.S. to set ablaze the ship Caroline, which had been used to ferry American insurgents that had mounted attacks in Canada. In diplomatic correspondence following the incident, the U.S. Secretary of State noted that Britain must show “a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation”. In reality, the destruction of Caroline was a response to an attack and its expansion rather than for averting any not-yet-mounted attack. Moreover, the incident took place before the conception of the UN Charter.

An anticipatory move

Nevertheless, contemporary Western scholarship, in view of the rise of terrorism and advancement of weapons technology, continues to advocate for a right to anticipatory self-defence. However even assuming that any such right has come into fruition, its contours are to be narrowly understood. As indicated, the threat of an armed attack must be so imminent that the need to act in self-defence should be “instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation”. The legality of the Trump administration’s decision to target Soleimani through drones in Iraq would, therefore, hinge on the disclosure of facts with regard to the imminence of a planned attack. Moreover, the administration will have to show that the strike was proportional to such (imminent) armed attack and necessary to respond to it. It will also have to justify its use of force in Iraqi territory and prove that Baghdad was either unable or unwilling to prevent the imminent attack. Finally, the U.S. will have to provide an explanation for the use of drones during peacetime, which resulted in collateral casualties.

Further, Mr. Trump’s specific threat to target cultural sites in Iran was in breach of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property during armed conflict. It also violated UNSC Council Resolution 2347, sponsored by the Trump administration, which in the context of the Islamic State (IS) invasion declared that destruction of cultural property would constitute “war crimes”. It was therefore not surprising that Pentagon distanced itself from Mr. Trump’s position.

304,2020/01/14,Different feathers but a political flocking together,"In Maharashtra, the three-party coalition government, of the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), under the leadership of Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray, seems to have stabilised after a bumpy start. Though negotiations over Ministry composition and portfolio allocations were long-drawn, the issue has settled. All this has led to talk of an ideological realignment in Maharashtra politics. More significantly, commentators have spoken of a tempering of the Sena’s long-standing Hindutva positions. So has the tiger really changed its stripes?

To answer this, one needs answers to one other question. Why did the Sena on one hand and the Congress-NCP on the other come together in the first place? The answer lies in how the BJP treated its allies and political opponents, at the Central level and in the State. The opponents were treated harshly; inquiries were ordered with investigations by central agencies. A number of heavyweights from the Congress and the NCP joined the BJP. It would be foolish to say that this exodus was sparked by ideological considerations. If some realised that they had no future in their local political sphere because of the Congress-NCP alliance, many were more concerned about the maintenance of support networks that they had carefully nurtured over decades. The BJP too wooed those it thought would strengthen the party in areas where it was weak.

The binding factor

The case with the Sena is similar yet distinct. The BJP appears tired of its allies and, ideally, would like a state of affairs where it could win elections without them. It tried doing so in the 2017 municipal elections in Mumbai. The stresses and strains in the BJP-Sena alliance during the tenure of the last government emerged primarily because of these efforts of the BJP. The Sena started to believe that the BJP was out to render it politically nugatory, prompting it to adopt a tough negotiating stance during seat-sharing talks and then later when efforts were being made to form a government. Thus, the three-party coalition has come about because all concerned were worried about their sheer political existence. An anti-BJP stance is the only common factor here.

The Congress’s central leadership had misgivings about an alliance with the Sena given its stand on Hindutva. But the Sena played down these very positions. The party’s opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019-National Register of Citizens (NRC), alongwith with the statement of the Chief Minister and Sena head, Uddhav Thackeray, that he would not allow students to be assaulted in the State and the relatively mild handling of the anti-CAA-NRC protests is cited as evidence of this de-emphasising. Moreover, such positions are being taken to mean that the ideological transformation of the Shiv Sena is on the anvil, or indeed has taken place. This naturally leads to the proposition that the coalition would last long since there are no ideological contradictions among them. This is indeed wishful thinking.

On ideology

The hollowness of such analyses necessitates a look at the Sena’s ideological positions which till date would demonstrate what it stands for. Though it began its journey as a party primarily asserting a regional identity, and that too in the Mumbai-Thane belt, its positions always had strong elements of Hindutva in them. The party’s spread in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra in the late 1980s occurred primarily because of this positioning. Content analysis of the speeches of the Sena founder, Bal Thackeray from that period and even later would make this clear. It was this ideological complementarity that led the BJP to strike an alliance with it in the late 1980s and early 1990s which benefited both the parties. Thus the Sena till recently was not only the BJP’s oldest ally but also its closest one ideologically. The party’s stand during the Ram Janmabhoomi agitations and the subsequent communal riots is well-known — and which it has not retracted. Thus, one can reasonably conclude the sum and substance of its positions.

One could argue that all this was in the past and much has changed. But there are many who would remember that the previous Congress-NCP government had provided for reservations for Muslims — and stridently opposed by the BJP and the Sena. The demand to rename the city of Aurangabad to ‘Sambhajinagar’ has been a long-standing Sena demand. These two issues may now have been forgotten for the time being.

Civic poll test

But what if there is communal conflict somewhere in Maharashtra? Or what if the Congress and the NCP raise a demand for minority reservations? Or what if the BJP launches a campaign on an issue where the Sena would find itself at odds with its coalition partners? The seeming stability of the coalition is not a consequence of the Sena’s ideological transformation; rather it is more about the partners having chosen to ignore contradictions by pretending they did not exist in the first place. But events could simply blow the coalition off course. The first such event where stability would be tested would be the next major round of civic body elections, in 2022. Elections to urban bodies (Mumbai and Pune) would certainly strain the coalition, whether or not the three arrive at a seat-sharing formula. This would more be so because in many places the partners would be fighting each other and not the BJP.

Besides, the BJP, now in search of an ally, has been making overtures to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), headed by Raj Thackeray, the Chief Minister’s cousin. There are enough indications that the alliance might be based on a common ideological positioning, namely Hindutva, with the MNS combining it with its regionalist politics. So the Sena would find itself competing for the same ideological constituency. It might then realise that the BJP, similar to what Sir Robert Peel did more than a century ago to the Whigs, has stolen its ideological clothes.

305,2020/01/14,Vote for status quo: On ruling party's win in Taiwan,"Taiwan’s pro-democracy President Tsai Ing-wen’s re-election, with a record mandate since the country’s first direct elections of 1996, could further strain ties with China. Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered major losses in the 2018 local elections, but on Saturday, she took over 57% of the vote against her challenger, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, which once ruled in China before moving to Taiwan. Opposition to Beijing’s one-country two-systems policy has long defined the ruling DPP. The Hong Kong protests have only served to bring into sharp relief the consolidation of democracy and sovereignty in Taiwan ahead of the weekend’s elections. Indeed, the Opposition’s landslide victory in Hong Kong’s local elections in November added momentum to Ms. Tsai’s own prospects. In a campaign marred by allegations of Chinese fake news and social media trolls on DPP candidates, she was subject to attacks on the authenticity of her degree from the London School of Economics, which the latter has confirmed. Also, the ruling party’s consolidation has coincided with the emergence of an assertive China, and with attempts of U.S. President Trump to use Taipei as a bargaining chip in his trade war with China.

Taiwan’s future remains unfinished business for China’s President Xi Jinping, who, in October, presided over the 70th anniversary of the revolution. He has in the recent past declared his intention to use force to unify Taiwan with the mainland. For his part, Mr. Trump departed from protocol after his election when he received Ms. Tsai’s congratulatory call. Recent U.S. legislation to promote Taipei relations did not go down well in Beijing. China has meanwhile leveraged its economic clout to influence much of Africa and Latin America to withhold recognition to Taiwan as a sovereign state. According formal recognition to the island nation’s official name, the Republic of China, is among the DPP’s conditions for initiating dialogue with Beijing. A ratcheting of the rhetoric by Taipei and Beijing is more likely now. But it is unlikely that Mr. Xi would want to risk global recrimination from any aggressive military display either against Taiwan or Hong Kong. Taiwan’s zealous defence of its market economy and democratic freedoms may not seem compatible with the China model of state-sponsored capitalism and one-party rule. Yet, it may not be too fanciful to imagine the establishment of a possible modus vivendi, built on the mutual interest on either side to maintain the operation of market forces. A resolution of the historic dispute could be long-drawn. But a constructive and democratic international response would be for the big powers to desist from exploiting the situation to promote their own interests.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vote-for-status-quo-on-ruling-partys-win-in-taiwan/article30561110.ece
306,2020/01/14,Unhelpful combativeness: On concerns about CAA,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019, intended only to grant citizenship to a certain class of people, and not to deny citizenship to anyone is factually accurate. But his extrapolation that hence the Act’s critics are misinformed is unfounded and misleading. The concern expressed by many is not that it allows citizenship to people escaping persecution from neighbouring countries; on the contrary the fundamental opposition to the law is that it does so in a discriminatory and inadequate manner. The CAA introduces a religious test in classifying victims of persecution, and granting them citizenship in a secular republic. The one strand of opposition, among indigenous communities in the Northeastern States, is indeed against granting citizenship rights to anyone, regardless of religion. Mr. Modi appeared to be eager to pacify them, as he should be, by reiterating that safeguards are being included in the law to protect the cultural and linguistic rights of indigenous groups. When it comes to addressing the legitimate and well-founded concerns of constitutional experts, the Opposition and several State governments, he tends to turn unhelpfully combative.

If Mr. Modi and his colleagues are genuinely concerned that there is misinformation, they must reach out to the critics rather than disparage them. Instead, party functionaries have latched on to the situation as yet another opportunity for political propaganda, a communal one at that, and launched a marathon monologue. If the CAA’s provisions reflect the BJP’s Hindutva philosophy, the straw man argument further accentuates it. The suggestion is that the CAA’s opponents are opposed to giving refuge to persecuted Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, and Christian minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, which they are not. The CAA’s rationale is that these countries have a state religion, and religious minorities face persecution. But persecution need not be only religious in nature. In Sri Lanka, Tamils have suffered in the hands of the establishment and the dominant Sinhalas. Moreover, Islamic sects, Shias and Ahmadiyyas, and non-believers that have come under attack in these three countries are denied the benefit under the CAA for no logical reason. The explanation that the current CAA is only remedying a grievance left over by Partition is unconvincing. Afghan refugees should not have qualified by that reasoning. In truth, the popular suspicion of the government’s intent draws from its political rhetoric and the link between a National Register of Indian Citizens and the CAA that its functionaries repeatedly seek to forge. Critics have laid out their concerns regarding the CAA; it is the government that needs to explain its position. By repeatedly misinterpreting the concerns, the government betrays an unwillingness to engage on the issue.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unhelpful-combativeness-on-concerns-about-caa/article30561101.ece
307,2020/01/14,‘Draft of rare diseases 2020 policy is diluted version of older one’,"The long-awaited draft of the National Policy for Rare Diseases 2020, which was made public this week, is nothing but a watered down version of the earlier policy that was kept in abeyance, said patients and caregivers in Karnataka.

The draft of the new policy has announced financial support of up to ₹15 lakh under the Rashtriya Arogaya Nidhi by the Central government for treatment of those rare diseases that require a ‘one-time treatment’.

“Beneficiaries for such financial assistance would not be limited to BPL families, but extended to 40% of the population who are eligible as per norms of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana for their treatment in government tertiary hospitals only,” the policy states.

In addition, it has said State governments can consider supporting patients of rare diseases that can be managed with special diets or hormonal supplements or other relatively low-cost interventions, and mentions an endeavour to “create alternate funding mechanism” through setting up a “digital platform for voluntary individual and corporate donors to contribute to the treatment cost of patients of rare diseases.”

All of this is a diluted version of the older policy draft, said Prasanna Kumar B. Shirol, co-founder of the Organisation for Rare Diseases India (ORDI), an umbrella organisation that represents the collective voice of all patients with rare diseases in India.

Mr. Shirol said the new draft had left out the proposal to create a national and State level corpus with an initial amount of ₹100 crore towards funding treatment of rare genetic diseases. The earlier policy had further stated that States will have a similar corpus at the State level, and the Centre will contribute funds towards the State corpus in the ratio of 60:40.

“It does not even have what the earlier policy offered. How can you talk about crowdfunding in a government policy? We will definitely file objections to this. But all this is a delaying tactic to ensure that no help reaches our children,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/draft-of-rare-diseases-2020-policy-is-diluted-version-of-older-one/article30569465.ece
308,2020/01/14,Mangaluru police firing: HC tells petitioners to explain ‘innocents’ claim,"The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday directed the petitioners, who filed a PIL petition, to explain how they had come to the conclusion that two persons, who died in the police firing during an anti-CAA protest in Mangaluru on December 19, 2019, were ‘innocent’ persons.

The court also directed the petitioners, I.K. Mohammed Iqbal Elimale and B. Umer, both residents of Sullia taluk in Dakshina Kannada district, to file affidavits disclosing the details along with documents and materials in support of their claim that they are involved in social activities and working for safeguarding the interest of the public who are deprived of their basic fundamental rights, other than filing PIL petitions.

The court directed the State government to file statement whether any inquiry has been ordered into the incident of police firing and to submit the report, if any inquiry was conducted, to the court in a sealed cover.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction after hearing the petition, in which the pleas have been made to the court to direct the government to hold a judicial inquiry and entrust the investigation into the police firing to an independent agency.

The bench observed that questioning the legality of police firing is a different aspect, but public can’t take sides while pointing out that what if the two persons, who ‘unfortunately’ died in the police firing, had indulged in rioting.

Earlier, the bench orally asked petitioner’s counsel on what basis the petitioners have given a ‘certificate of innocence’ to those who ‘unfortunately’ died in police firing.

When the counsel for the petitioners stated that newspaper reports indicated that two ‘innocent’ persons had died and seven others had sustained injuries in the police firing, the bench asked whether newspapers would decide who is innocent in the incident.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mangaluru-police-firing-hc-tells-petitioners-to-explain-innocents-claim/article30568822.ece
309,2020/01/14,Citizens’ groups want Centre to approve suburban rail project without further delay,"Praja RAAG, Citizens for Bengaluru, Karnataka Railway Vedike and other citizens’ groups have demanded that the Central government approve the suburban rail project without further delay.

In a letter to Union Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda and Members of Parliament from the city, they expressed concern over the delay in final approval for the project by the Central Cabinet. The project has been approved by the Extended Railway Board.

They want their elected representatives to put pressure on the Centre to provide budgetary support for several railway projects in the city, in the forthcoming budget.

Allocation of funds has been sought for automatic signalling works in Bengaluru (BLR to Bidadi, BLR to Chikbanavara, Yesvanthpur-Doddaballapur, Whitefield-Bangarpet and Baiyappanahalli-Hosur) at a cost of ₹250 crore; electrification of Yelahanka–Devanahalli line (₹40 crore) and the second terminal at Yesvanthpur Railway station (₹130 crore).

“The above proposals are pending with the Railway Board. In the larger interest of Bengaluru, we urge you to impress upon the Railway Board and the Railway Minister to sanction and allocate funds on priority. These projects will enable the Railways to provide good number of suburban rail services immediately,” stated the letter addressed to elected representatives.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citizens-groups-want-centre-to-approve-suburban-rail-project-without-further-delay/article30562487.ece

The woman was admitted to a hospital on January 7 and she claimed said that a group of men had attacked her in an attempt to coerce her to drop an atrocity case against them. “However, the doctors treating the woman said the injuries were caused by boiling water, not acid,” said a senior police officer.

In her statement, the woman said that some of the accused had followed her on a motorcycle when she was on her way home. “One of them, who was riding pillion, allegedly threatened her and poured something on her. The victim said that her body started burning. On hearing her cries, neighbours rushed to her aid and poured water on her,” said the police.

The woman’s husband took her to a private hospital. Subsequently, the K.R. Puram police registered a case of acid attack and criminal intimidation. “But when we went to the spot, even the people whom the victim said had helped her refused to acknowledge the incident,” a senior police officer said. “We have suspicion that she may have inflicted the injuries on herself.

313,2020/01/14,"IndiGo pilot allegedly threatens and harasses passengers who sought wheelchair assistance, taken off duty","An IndiGo pilot who reportedly harassed and threatened to arrest two passengers for seeking wheelchair assistance has been taken off duty, pending a full enquiry, Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a tweet on Tuesday.

Supriya Unni Nair, a resident of Bengaluru and former journalist, had posted on social media of the “harassment” meted out to her and her mother on an IndiGo flight on Monday. She and her 75-year-old mother Vijayalakshmi, had taken an IndiGo flight from Chennai to Bengaluru and when she sought wheelchair assistance for her mother, the captain Jayakrishna screamed and threatened to arrest them both. Though she had already asked for a wheelchair in advance, she tried calling on the assistance bell after the flight landed in Bengaluru, she said in her post. But when the crew didn’t respond, she walked up for help, and subsequently, the captain came out and began yelling at her, Ms. Nair said.

“He prevents the wheelchair people from taking my mom out of the aircraft threatening us that he will ensure we are detained and spend a night in jail. Disbelievingly I ask him whether he is serious. Shut up. Who do you think I am? I'll get my CEO to make sure you spend a night in jail, “we” will teach you some manners, he says,” she posted, further.

On seeing this complaint, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted: “I requested my office to contact @IndiGo6E as soon as I saw the tweet by Ms @SupriyaUnniNair about the pilot's behaviour with her & her 75 yr old mother in need of wheelchair assistance. The airline has informed @MoCA_GoI that the pilot has been off-rostered pending full enquiry.”

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Nair said, “I personally felt the need to put it out on a social media platform because this shouldn’t happen to anyone else. No one, especially, a senior citizen or a wheelchair passenger should have to endure what my mother did. She was nervous and shivering; she was scared for me as well.”

She said she was happy that the Minister quickly responded to the complaint.

Meanwhile, a statement from the airline said, it was aware of the complaint raised by the passenger, and that the matter was “under internal review”, and that necessary action would be taken. “IndiGo is very cognisant of the needs of its customers, and it is our constant endeavour to provide a courteous and hassle-free experience to our passengers. Our customer relations team has been in touch with the customer to ensure that her concern is understood well and to help avoid any such experiences in the future.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1ioedx/article30567061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14JANTH-INDIGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/indigo-pilot-threatens-and-harasses-passengers-who-sought-wheelchair-assistance-taken-off-duty/article30567062.ece

As many as 600 are from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Hosted by the institute’s entrepreneurship cell, the e-summit will be held from January 17 to 19. This year’s summit will include representation from both the IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

The summit will be a sum of the earlier four summits, said Khandelwal, students head of the e-cell. The theme of the summit is ‘Triumph Trails!’ and will include presentations of case studies by experts from the government, industry and academia besides showcasing successful start ups. A social campaign called D-Well, digital well-being has been planned this year. The summit will include lectures and business competitions to enrich the experience of the participants.

Srinivasan Viswanathan of the IITM Entrepreneurship Forum said, “The aim is to help students in finding business models and funding. To start a business you have to equip them with knowledge. It is nine years since we started this.” The forum had alumni from the early batches in the 1960s till those who graduated five years ago. It included angel investors and academics who were working as mentors to the students, he said.

Ashwin Mahalingam, advisor to the entrepreneurship cell said, “This year our focus is to ensure that students with entrepreneurial inclinations take a giant step towards becoming entrepreneurs themselves in a few years’ time.” According to him, as many as 500 ideas were nurtured by the E-Cell. Among the successful start ups is in the field of ed-tech learning, which is currently reaching out to 10,000 students with its peer-to-peer learning programme.

315,2020/01/14,Subway at Chennai’s Velachery station turns into bathing area,"The incomplete subway at Velachery railway station increases the risk of accidents to those visiting the area.

Southern Railway had proposed to construct a mini subway to connect the service road to the railway shed and the quarters of the railway station more than a decade ago. The subway was supposed to be used for the exclusive purpose of the railway authorities to transport materials for the railway shed.

However, since the subway work began around 2008, the subway has remained flooded, point out commuters using the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS). At present, railway authorities claim they have completed almost 75% of the work, but the subway remains submerged in water. The water-filled subway is being used for washing clothes and vehicles. Also, a large number of senior citizens and children have a bath or swim in the subway every day.

Residents’ welfare associations said it was short-sightedness on the part of the railway authorities to construct a subway with the draining area of the Pallikaranai marshland close by.

S. Kumararaja, a civic activist, said that given the fact that the railway track had been constructed on an elevated section, a road over-bridge should have been planned, instead of a subway. He said he had never seen the subway dry, without water, in all these years since the construction started. He also complained about the danger of allowing children to swim in the subway.

A senior official of the Southern Railway said they have constructed a pumping station near the subway to drain out water and have also installed temporary barricades by dumping debris at the entrance to prevent the public from using it. Very soon, a compound wall would be constructed, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ue2wic/article30565642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14JANTH-SUBWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/subway-at-chennais-velachery-station-turns-into-bathing-area/article30565643.ece

The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Sameer App showed that the continuous air quality monitoring station in Manali recording a maximum of 500 micrograms/cubic metre of particulate matter of a size below 2.5 microns (PM2.5) and an average of 222 microgram/cubic metre, which according to the air quality index (AQI) could cause breathing difficulties to most people on prolonged exposure.

The AQI also recorded an average of 109 microgram/cubic metre in Alandur, 99 microgram/cubic metre in Velachery and 160 microgram/cubic metre at the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s (TNPCB) Manali station.

Smoke from bonfires lit to celebrate Bhogi Pongal combined with thick fog considerably reducing visibility, and the drop in temperature caused coughs and colds among residents.

“This time was worse than last year. I was able to smell burning from the bonfires till as late as 9 a.m.,” said Amandeep Singh Khandhari, a resident of Royapettah.

Vasudevan, a resident of Chromepet, said the air quality was bad early in the morning and that his family preferred to stay indoors till the smog cleared. “By 9 a.m. when we could feel the sun’s heat and the visibility had improved,” he said.

Poor visibility affects flights

Some flights at Chennai airport were affected due to poor visibility because of the smog from Bhogi celebrations in the city early on Tuesday. Around 5 a.m. onwards, as the visibility had dropped, a few flights faced the impact. One flight from Chennai to Mysore was delayed by more than an hour. The flight that had to depart around 6.50 a.m., came to the runway but it couldn’t take off; subsequently, the flight left only an hour later, airport sources said.

Similarly, two flights, one that had to arrive from Mumbai and another from Thiruvananthapuram around 7.30 a.m. were not able to land at Chennai airport due to poor visibility and had to be diverted to Bengaluru airport. Also, another flight from Madurai, was delayed by more than an hour.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had issued a circular few days ago, requesting members of the public residing near the airport not to burn waste materials for bhogi. Two years ago nearly 73 departures and 45 arrival flights had been affected due to reduced visibility from the smoke from these celebrations.

“However, during 2019 Bhogi, through intense sensitisation among public and communities around Chennai Airport, we could minimise the effect of the smog, leading to fewer disruptions in air traffic,” they said, in a statement. They had distributed pamphlets to the public staying near the airport to bring in awareness about this issue.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vj0sp1/article30565444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14JANTH-BHOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-pollution-levels-spike-as-city-celebrates-bhogi/article30565445.ece

319,2020/01/14,Tangedco asks local bodies not to misuse electricity poles,"Worried over the misuse of its concrete poles by various line agencies and the resultant risks, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has written to local bodies asking them not to use the poles.

Tangedco officials said the practice was especially rampant on the outskirts of south Chennai where electricity was being predominantly supplied through overhead power lines.

Apart from being used to support street lights, the poles were being illegally utilised to support cable television lines and advertisement boards.

“Such acts would cause the poles to bear load resulting in damage to them. There have been instances of poles falling, causing accidents and also posing difficulties when we undertake repairs,” said a senior official.

A few months ago, a person was electrocuted in Kovilambakkam while he was attempting to fix an advertisement board on a pole. The victim was electrocuted when he turned on the street light fixed on the electricity pole.

More than 1.5 lakh electricity poles in and around south Chennai, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts are being misused by various government and private agencies.

Expenditure up

Tangedco was forced to replace poles that are beyond repair, which was an unnecessary expenditure for the power firm.

Tangedco has been replacing hundreds of damaged and old electricity poles every year as part of pre-monsoon preparatory works to prevent accidents caused by falling poles in addition to the ones damaged by natural calamities.

A Tangedco official said the cost of concrete poles is becoming steep, each pole costing ₹7,000. Every year a minimum of 10,000 poles are being replaced.

P. Viswanathan, convenor, Chitlapakkam Residents' Welfare Association, said the Chitlapakkam Panchayat has fixed a box with an auto on/off switch for the street lights on the poles in his locality Nehru Nagar but has left it open posing a risk.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2sbk3k/article30562722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THROADLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tangedco-asks-local-bodies-not-to-misuse-electricity-poles/article30562723.ece

“When there was a dengue outbreak, I held discussions with the Telangana State government and came up with 15 strategies for dengue control based on what I have seen in Tamil Nadu. Distribution of nilavembu kudineer was one of them. I also discussed it with Siddha practitioners in Telangana. It was distributed and helped in fever control,” she said at the inauguration of third Siddha Day celebration on Monday. She said that Indian systems of medicine were valued and well-received abroad but people in India were less aware of its benefits, especially in preventive health. She stressed on the need to focus on traditional food. “Siddha physicians should expand their research and take the benefits of Siddha to the people,” she added.

Minister of State (independent charge) for AYUSH Shripad Yesso Naik said the Ministry has proposed to include 19 Ayurvedic, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy treatment packages in the cashless health insurance scheme of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. This included treatment for neurological disorders and arthritis. “The proposal has been submitted to the National Health Authority,” he said.

He added that the Ministry had allocated fund for the Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS) to construct central testing laboratory for standardisation of Siddha drugs.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said Tamil Nadu was the only State in the country to run government medical colleges in all five disciplines of Indian medicine. An exclusive research and development wing for India medicine was established at ₹12 crore and was ready for commissioning.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said the directorate of Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy is digitising all the old texts of Indian medicine. “Till now, 900 palm leaves of original Siddha manuscripts have been digitised as 1,077 books. We shortly hope to print and publish them,” she said.

She added that one more government Siddha medical college is coming up in Palani. “Siddha treatment is available at 1,079 centres in government medical colleges, super specialty hospitals, district headquarters hospitals and primary health centres. The Indian systems of medicine get 1.10 lakh patients a day,” she said.

321,2020/01/14,Metrowater to provide nearly 1.11 lakh sewer connections,"As part of its effort to mitigate pollution in waterways and improve its sewer network, Chennai Metrowater plans to provide over one lakh new sewer connections in the city, including in added areas in six months.

The water agency is awaiting a government order to execute the projects in the areas identified across the city. Officials of the Metrowater said nearly 1,11, 237 sewer connections need to be given in various areas, including Ambattur, Ullagaram and Puzhuthivakkam, Madhavaram, Puthagaram, Nolambur and Sholinganallur. This also includes nearly 11,000 connections that need to be effected in the core areas, officials said.

The water agency had recently launched two services — ‘Azhaithal Inaippu’ and ‘Illanthorum Inaippu’ scheme — wherein consumers may dial for a sewer connection and it would be provided without seeking any documents and bills would be raised later. The agency would provide sewer connections in added areas as part of the underground drainage scheme without any application and residents can pay the bill in 10 instalments in five years.

“We have already received nearly 4,100 calls in the past one month expressing interest for sewer connections in both core and added areas. Work to provide these connections is already on in some areas and would be completed in 15 days,” said an official.

10,000 applications

On an average, the water agency receives only 10,000 applications for water/sewer connections every year. It has nearly 8.5 lakh consumers in the city and added areas.

Metrowater intially plans to provide sewer connections in buildings up to two floors under the scheme. However, residents, particularly in added areas, want the scheme to be extended to apartment complexes S. Raghuraman, a resident of Ambattur, said more residents in apartment complexes would benefit from the scheme. “Residents would come forward to take connections as the option to pay in instalments would reduce the financial burden.”

The agency would execute the scheme at a cost of ₹224 crore with funds from Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust. There are plans to engage registered contractors to accelerate the work within the stipulated time.

“Instead of temporary laying of the road and handing it over to the Greater Chennai Corporation, we would relay the road and the road cut charges would be included in the bill,” said an official.

Moreover, if a house or premises does not have rainwater harvesting structure, Metrowater would construct it and the cost would be recovered with charges for the sewer connection.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowater-to-provide-nearly-111-lakh-sewer-connections/article30562689.ece
322,2020/01/14,Access to ORR from GST Road soon,"Motorists heading towards Red Hills from Vandalur will shortly be able to gain access to the Chennai Outer Ring Road from the GST Road itself. Two arms — one to get onto the road and another to get off — are nearing completion with finishing touches, including painting, being given. Earlier, due to non-availability of land, access to the 62-km-long road from Vandalur to Minjur was via Old Perungalathur and Vandalur villages.

Sources in Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC) that manages the road said that a bus terminus and public conveniences are likely to come up in the space between the arms.

“As hundreds of visitors come to the Vandalur zoo and alight at that point, a bus bay and terminus are needed. These facilities are being created in the available space,” an official said.

Though it has been over five years since the phase I was thrown open to public use, work on phase II of the Chennai Outer Ring Road remained incomplete due to non-availability of land on a 200-metre stretch. “That issue is being resolved and we expect an amicable settlement shortly. If we get the land, it will take us only three months to complete the work. At present, motorists can get off the road, take a detour and can get back on the CORR,” explained another official associated with the project.

Increase in traffic

In the five years, since phase I of the Chennai Outer Ring Road (CORR) was thrown open to public, traffic has increased with over 27,000 vehicles plying daily. This, despite the fact that the second phase is yet to be completed.

Of these, total number of buses stand at 2,055, multi-axle vehicles 5,260, light commercial vehicles 2,330 and cars/jeeps 17,400. “In the first year, the average number of vehicles was around 5,000 a day. The number of vehicles proceeding from Vandalur to Minjur is more than in the other direction. Since the road is still not a toll facility, local residents too use the road. But this is only a small percentage,” explained an engineer associated with the project.

Motorists have sought more signages up and down the ramps and also speedy completion of the clover facility at Ponnamallee. “The road is notorious for racing. Steps must be taken to curb it. Better policing will help,” said E. Karthik, a resident of Porur.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5lw1h7/article30562671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ORR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/access-to-orr-from-gst-road-soon/article30562672.ece

Two engineering graduates, who along with their friends, went for a swim off the Besant Nagar beach drowned on Sunday.

The Tiruvanmiyur police said Narasimha, 22, a resident of Mannargudi, had come to write a competitive exam in the city. He was staying in his cousin Gokul’s house in Semmanchery.

After finishing his exam, Narasimha, Gokul and their two friends went to Besant Nagar for a swim.

Narasimha and Gokul were pulled into the sea by a big wave. The fishermen in the locality, on hearing cries of the people nearby, rescued Narasimha but could not find Gokul.

Narasimha was pronounced brought dead when he was taken to the Government Royapettah Hospital for treatment. A search is on for the body of Gokul.

328,2020/01/14,"Sparkling people, a spiritless Opposition","The long wall along the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University in Delhi is plastered with posters affirming Hindu-Muslim unity, portraits of Bhagat Singh and Bhim Rao Ambedkar and — no surprises here — charcoal scrawls against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Central Government has stepped back for now on the NRC, clearly in response to civil protests that have shown no signs of giving over, instead growing bigger and wider and taking the shape of a people’s movement covering large swathes of urban India.

Flag as the pivot

The most striking thing on the JMI wall is the national flag, hundreds of which are strung together in such a way that the tricolour runs parallel with the road. It is a beautiful, moving sight, offering scope for multiple interpretations. The flag as an act of both patriotism and protest. The flag as a symbol of citizenship as well as the citizens’ ownership of the country. It is known by now that in combination, the CAA and the NRC could be lethal for Muslims. The CAA offers priority citizenship to non-Muslim illegal migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, while the NRC, when implemented, will demand citizenship proof from India’s own citizens. Though anyone from any religion could be left out of the NRC for lack of proper documentation, the fear is that unlike Hindus and other religionists who will be protected via the CAA, Muslims stand the risk of losing their citizenship. Muslim anxieties have been stoked by Home Minister Amit Shah’s unceasing threats to pluck out and evict the ghuspetiye (Muslim infiltrators)

It is against this backdrop that JMI erupted in protest on December 15, 2019. However, the police crackdown that followed was so brutal that it set off a cascading reaction beyond anyone’s expectation and certainly beyond the control of a government that arrogantly believed that the people would acquiesce in its every unjust decision. Jamia’s answer to the police action was the flag and the Constitution. In an instant, the message communicated itself to other secular-spirited Indians. A lot more in numbers than previously believed, these were men and women who understood that there can be no India without Muslims. The young, assumed to be apolitical or coopted, emerged from their universities in swarms, proving that they carried in their blood India’s founding values of equality and inclusion.

Since then the waving of the flag and the reading of the preamble to the Constitution have spread like a contagion, but one that is lovely to behold. Indeed, the preamble seems to have become an anthem in itself as spaces in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and other smaller towns have filled up to resounding recitals of its inspirational content. Equally significant has been the emergence of women in leadership roles and from within conservative homes. They have taken the lead whether in college assemblies or in protest marches, raising slogans loud enough to be heard above the din of the city, or as in the case of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, simply assembling to show off their strength. Shaheen Bagh is a Muslim-majority neighbourhood and conventionally, women here have been home bound. Yet since the day of the Jamia crackdown, they have stayed put, day and night, in a make-shift pandal, waving the tricolour and energetically singing along patriotic songs. The flag can be seen imprinted on the cheeks of little children as also on the wrists of their mothers. Many here are uneducated but know what is at stake: They are fighting for the country and their place in it. And hence the symbolism of the flag which has now become a matter-of-fact part of their protests, their lives and their collective Indian identity.

The irony is unmissable. All these years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its right-wing allies had used the flag as a weapon against Muslims and secular Indians. Between 2016 and 2017, scores of BJP volunteers took out tiranga yatras ostensibly to instil feelings of pride in the country but in actual fact to taunt Muslims and liberal Indians.

The then Human Resource Development Minister, Smriti Irani, decreed that each of India’s Central Universities will fly the flag atop a 207-foot high mast.

Four years later, the Narendra Modi government has been rendered speechless by the sight of thousands of flags flying in all corners of India. The BJP used the flag as a threat, as an instrument of coercion, as a test of loyalty for alleged “anti-nationals”, and finally as a symbol of the Prime Minister’s New India.

A new India

Today, a different version of New India confronts the rulers, one that has turned the “anti-national” slur on its head. Unlike in the case of the BJP, those waving the flag now are not threatening anyone but are reading the preamble alongside and asserting the inviolability of the Constitution’s basic tenets. They are the patriots, not the pseudo-patriots populating the BJP.

The largely peaceful rebellion and the beauty of the spirit on show are as compelling as the message they radiate: that there exist people in India who will not be cowed down by the aggression of Hindutva, who believe in the essential unity of Indians and who have the courage of their convictions. Some questions nonetheless arise. How long can the protesters withstand the might of the state? The Prime Minister continues to be immensely popular and electorally saleable. The anti-CAA-NRC protests have also consolidated his majoritarian base.

Of and by the people

The most obvious questions, though, concern India’s political Opposition. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been outspoken and has matched wit and word with Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah. The Congress has expressed its opposition to the CAA-NRC architecture. But no politician till now has shown the leadership quality essential to take the protests forward —– from colleges and the buzzing streets of cities and towns into the farthest villages. Partly the reason for this is the people-driven nature of the protests. The movement has been of and by the people with the participants apparently keen to keep it that way. It is a wariness born of apprehension that the presence of political parties will politicise the protests and dilute their impact, which in turn will give a handle to the rulers to condemn the phenomenon as a whole as agenda-driven.

It is also evident that the political parties have lived so long in fear of a Hindu-Muslim polarisation that they have started to shy away from doing anything that could be seen as favouring Muslims. The Prime Minister knows this. In his rallies he has been asking whether the Opposition would offer citizenship to all Muslims from the neighbourhood. The question is intended as a trap and deliberately avoids nuances. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is an example of the secular dilemma. He has the right instincts but he has refrained from showing up at the protests because he has an election to fight next month.

There has not been a more opportune time than now for India’s Opposition to prove that they are in the fight. The ferment on the streets can remain citizen-driven. But surely a strong-willed Opposition can lend outside support, ensuring the fight does not fade away and India is rescued from those who want to change its character.

The decision will not help distraught Kashmiris to resume normal life anytime soon. The ruling has left a lot of scope for interpretation and the affected people may now be at the mercy of bureaucrats and High Courts to get relief on a piecemeal and case-by-case basis. Periodic reviews would only be manipulated to maintain the status quo and the aggrieved citizens may not have the wherewithal, time and energy to pursue their case to a logical conclusion. The court could have walked the extra mile and delved deeper into the question whether Internet is a fundamental right. It has missed the opportunity to set a historic precedent.

V. Subramanian,

Chennai

The razing of four apartment complexes in Maradu, as ordered by the Supreme Court, is a rare instance where an act of illegality has been exemplarily punished. The demolition of the illegal constructions has sent shock waves of disbelief and awe across the builders’ community that has been used to getting away with transgressions by paying fines. But conspicuously absent in the triumphalist narratives about the law's majesty and the higher judiciary’s uncompromising stance against environmental crimes is the role of the bureaucracy in facilitating illegal constructions by collaborating with the greedy builders for pecuniary gains. In the Maradu case, the arrests of a few local officials, presumably to give the impression that the law is taking its course, will barely deter the corrupt dealings of the state bureaucracy that doles out construction permits.

The Supreme Court adjudicates cases relating to the violation of building rules based on records of malfeasance; it can hardly track the political corruption’s invisible trail that leads to the corridors of power. The court can only look into cases that are brought to its notice, it can hardly act as a national real estate regulator. All the talk of the imminent end of illegal construction misses the deep-rooted political patronage of corruption and its extended influence on the body politic.

The protester was expressing the concern of civil society and seeking an end to the tyranny of the state. She was by no means backing the separatist cause. The Mysuru police could have sought a simple clarification and dropped the matter. This is just what the Mumbai police did in a similar recent case. Instead, the Mysuru police subjected her to hours of interrogation and pressured her to make an apology. All this does not augur well for the rule of law.

The massive protests on Marina sands three years ago might have enabled a lift of the ban on this rural sport. Yet, it does no justice to the conduct of this maddening and barbarous sport, wherein many youths lose their precious lives. In the guise of ‘taming’, bulls are kicked, punched and dragged on to the ground. A bull will not run out of the vaadi vaasal into the jallikattu arena unless it is provoked. Provoking involves biting the tail, poking rods into the animal, and inserting chillies in their anus and eyes. The tail is the extension of the vertebrate, and is like pulling the animal by the spine. Thankfully, jurisprudence has taken a new turn now. Animals’ ability to feel emotions are now being recognised and they are viewed as sentient beings. Their status in the eyes of the law is changing.

333,2020/01/14,Bringing CAA into force,"It is ironic that Prime Minister Narendra Modi bothers much about people from minority communities in the neighbouring countries who face religious persecution but ignores the ill-treatment of minorities in his own backyard (Front page, “CAA meant to give citizenship, not take it away, says PM Modi,” Jan. 13). If he is keen on giving citizenship to persecuted minorities, why not draft a Refugees’ Citizenship Act instead of the CAA? Further, the stubbornness of Home Minister Amit Shah in enforcing the CAA with scant regard for the sentiments of the people is highly deplorable. Instead of trying to take common Indian citizens into confidence, the Modi-Shah duo is beating around the bush. Here, it is unfortunate that though the Opposition parties are all sailing in the same boat, some of them like the Trinamool Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party have failed to join hands with the Congress to devise a joint strategy against the CAA-NRC combine.

A. Jainulabdeen,

Chennai

There is no doubt whatsoever that the CAA is indeed about “giving citizenship”. The problem is not with the letter of the law, it is with its spirit and the intention behind formulating it, which pertains to the exclusion of one specific community from the Act’s provisions. If the government truly believes in constitutional values, it should show equal compassion towards all persecuted communities.

Shafar,

Hyderabad

There is no need to tolerate persecution of religious minorities in the neighbouring countries. At the same time, it is uncertain how the CAA by itself will make the world take note of the atrocities committed by Pakistan. What if this becomes a precedent and Pakistan brings a similar amendment in one of its laws? The explanation given by the Prime Minister on how the CAA will make Pakistan answerable for the treatment it has given to its minorities is ambiguous. On the contrary, this initiative may even embolden the forces which are already persecuting minorities. Amending legislation is not a recipe for safeguarding interests of minorities in neighbouring countries.

A. Venkatasubramanian

Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu

The unity shown by Opposition leaders during the swearing-in ceremony of Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren has fizzled out. A reluctance to play second fiddle to the Congress may have prompted Mamata Banerjee to miss the Congress-led Opposition parties meeting. As for Arvind Kejriwal, Congress being a key rival to AAP in the ensuring Delhi elections, he perhaps wants to keep a distance from the meeting. This disunity among Opposition parties will only help BJP to push through its agenda with ease.

D. Sethuraman,

Chennai

There is widespread opposition to the CAA and the NRC across the country. Even leaders attached to the ruling National Democratic Alliance have openly aired their dissent against an arbitrary imposition of the two. More than 20 lives have been lost in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Amidst these agitations and protests, Mr. Shah’s determination to implement the Act signals political arrogance. It is becoming obvious that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has mistaken its majority to be a mandate to implement a communal agenda without caring either for the concerns of the people or the sinking economy.

A.G. Rajmohan,

Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh

Prime Minister Narendra Modi bases his case for the CAA on the contention that the law is meant ‘to give citizenship, not to take it away’. But his line of argument does not hold for two main reasons. One, religion is made the criterion or determinant of citizenship. Two, the law snatches the right to citizenship prospectively from Muslims because of their religion.

The CAA is problematic and unconscionable because it legalises religious discrimination. It is simplistic, shallow and fallacious for the Prime Minister to say from the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission, of all places, that the CAA grants citizenship and does not snatch it away from anyone.

The citizenship law should have, instead, been amended to give citizenship to all persecuted minorities of all religious persuasions from all neighbouring countries. People in distress are people in distress. People persecuted are people persecuted. Why divide persecuted people on the basis of religion?

No amount of rationalisation can alter the fact the CAA fundamentally changes the basis of citizenship. Mr. Modi’s invocation of Mahatma Gandhi to justify a law that negates the constitutionally promised equality of religions is an affront to the Mahatma’s memory. The incumbent Prime Minister should know that Mahatma Gandhi was a martyr to the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity and avoid dragging his holy name to validate unholy things.

It is not clear whether Pakistan will now stop persecuting minorities fearing the amended citizenship law in India.

335,2020/01/14,Free or occupied! Roof light on black and yellow taxis will tell commuters,"The State Transport Department has decided to install rooftop indicators on all new black and yellow taxis registered in Mumbai from February 1, which will let commuters know if the cab is occupied, free, or off duty. The move is expected to bring down ride refusals by cab drivers.

Transport commissioner Shekhar Channe said the government had already issued a notification for the installation of the indicators for taxis and autorickshaws.

“Based on the experience with taxis, we will be deciding on the date of installing the rooftop indicators on new autorickshaws in the city,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the inaugural function of the 31st Road Safety Week.

The government resolution (GR) was issued on November 1, 2019, highlighting that the indicators would have three colours: green, red and white. The green will have the words ‘For Hire’ in English and its equivalent in Marathi. Similarly, red and white will have the words ‘Hired’ and ‘Off Duty’ respectively and their equivalent in Marathi.

The GR said the installation of roof light on existing taxis should be made compulsory at the time of renewal of fitness certificate or from a date specified by the Regional Transport Authority. Roof light for autorickshaws shall be made mandatory from the date as may be specified by the transport commissioner.

Mumbai has around 43,500 black and yellow taxis and around 2.05 lakh autorickshaws.

The project, first proposed in 2012, has been in the pipeline for years owing to several issues such as language, and opposition from unions who felt that the cost of installing the indicators would have to be borne by drivers. Officials from the Transport Department said they would be having a meeting with union members and manufacturers later this week to resolve the cost issue.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2eb6vb/article30562796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMUMBAITAXI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/free-or-occupied-roof-light-on-black-and-yellow-taxis-will-tell-commuters/article30562795.ece
336,2020/01/14,Pressure build-up on boiler plate may have caused blast in Boisar,"A preliminary investigation by the Boisar MIDC police into the Palghar fire that claimed eight lives on Saturday indicates that the blast might have been caused by excessive pressure on the boiler plate.

The blaze was triggered by a massive explosion at M/s ANK Pharma Pvt Ltd in Boisar around 7 p.m. on Saturday. The impact was so strong that shock waves were felt for miles around the factory, and the presence of a large number of chemicals worsened the blaze. The National Disaster Response Force had to be called in and eight bodies were pulled out of the wreckage, while six people were seriously injured.

“Our inquiry indicates that the explosion seems to have occurred due to too much pressure building up on the boiler plate. This is still an initial estimate and we are conducting further inquiries,” Superintendent of Police Gaurav Singh said.

According to the Boisar MIDC police, inquiries were made with several of the employees at the factory after the search and rescue operation was called off. The inquiries was primarily about the sequence of events just before the explosion. The police are yet to record statements of the six injured, including Natwarlal Patel, the manager of the factory.

Officers said Mr. Patel’s statement would be significant as he was responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the factory and was present when the incident occurred.

“We are also trying to salvage whatever we can of the boiler plate so that it can be examined by experts. We are also finding out whether the boiler plate and other equipment were serviced regularly and what fire safety precautions were in place. Getting ample physical evidence is a challenge due to the extent of damage to the place,” an officer with the Boisar MIDC police said.

337,2020/01/14,Wadia Hospitals’ staff on 3-day protest,"Serving and retired employees of Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital (NWMH) and Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children (BJWHC) on Monday began a three-day protest against the hospital management, the Brihanamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), and the State government.

Under the Mumbai General Kamgar Union banner, current and past employees gathered on the hospital premises in Parel. While the existing staff are demanding payment of their salaries, which have remained unpaid for a month, the retired employees want their unpaid pensions of the last month to be released.

Prakash Reddy, general secretary of the Communist Party of India, Mumbai unit, who joined the protesters, said 15% of the hospital funds are provided by the management, as they look after the infrastructure, while the rest 85% of funds come in the form of grants from the State government and the BMC in equal proportion. “This money is used for buying medicines and paying salaries,” Mr. Reddy said.

A Wadia Hospitals’ spokesperson said as per the trust deeds of the hospitals, there are four members from the BMC on the board of management for BJWHC and two members each from the BMC and the State government on the board of management for NWMH, and it is up to the BMC who it wants to appoint on the board.

“The BMC through its representatives on the board of management of both the hospitals is party to all the decisions of the hospitals as per the provisions of the trust deed. As on date, as per the government resolution of 2010, the BMC is to clear outstanding dues of ₹ 31.44 crore to NWMH and another ₹105.85 crore to BJWHC. Further, the matter is sub judice before the Bombay High Court and thus it will be improper to comment any further,” the spokesperson said.

It is learnt that a committee formed by the BMC to look into the affairs of Wadia Hospitals in late 2019 had found serious irregularities, owing to which the civic body had decided to hold back around 10% amount due to the hospitals. However, there are differences between the trust and the BMC over the total amount due to the hospitals. According to a trust deed signed between the hospitals and the BMC, the civic body pays 100% subsidy to the children’s hospital and 50% to the maternity hospital every quarter. The BMC has held back money from its December payment.

Sonal Kale, head nurse of NWMH, said, “I have been serving this hospital for the last 32 years. Now, I do not want this hospital to be privatised as it would not be beneficial for the working class and they will not be able to afford the treatment in a private hospital. Even though the management has not paid us a month’s salary, we will still continue to do our job. The misunderstanding is between the State and the management, therefore the patient should not suffer.” She claimed that the aim of the protest is to stop the hospital from being privatised.

Minnie Bodhanwala, CEO of BJWHC, said, “Yes, the hospital is facing some financial issues but we will not shut down this hospital.”

Mr. Reddy said the hospitals were started for the working class who could not afford expensive medical treatment. “This is not a strike; both the hospitals are running according to their schedules. We are just putting out a word. Mayor Kishori Pednekar has said she will release the remaining funds in the next two-three days, but we need to find a permanent solution to this problem. We visited Mantralaya on Monday, and a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has been fixed for Tuesday,” he said.

According to information shared by additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakane on Monday, the hospital management has not given information related to how many beds have been set aside for mill workers’ families even though they are mandated to keep 50% beds reserved, and both the children’s hospital and the maternity hospital have not taken the BMC’s permission to increase the number of beds from sanctioned strength.

The BMC has alleged that the hospital management has recruited more staff than permissible, while they are not providing free treatment and instead charging twice or thrice of the municipal rates. It has claimed that at least six senior officers are receiving salaries and allowances for both hospitals. The civic body has further alleged that at least 10 staffers are receiving pension from both hospitals, and the BMC has not been submitted any records to show the hospitals’ revenue.

The Mayor on Monday held a meeting with group leaders of all political parties along with Mr. Kakane. The Mayor will be holding a meeting with the hospital management and the BMC administration on Tuesday to resolve the differences. The Mayor made it clear that the hospital would not be shut down.

A group of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters led by Leader of Opposition in the Council, Pravin Darekar, visited the hospital and raised slogans. Mr. Darekar alleged that the ruling Shiv Sena was eyeing the hospital land. “Grants have been given to the hospitals, but it has somehow not reached the hands of the right people. This has been done just to target the previous BJP government,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v80ad6/article30562781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMWADIAHOSPITALMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wadia-hospitals-staff-on-3-day-protest/article30562780.ece
338,2020/01/14,"Refused a ride, RPF constable sexually assaults taxi driver, held","A constable with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) was arrested on Sunday for allegedly sexually assaulting a taxi driver while under the influence of alcohol.

According to the MRA Marg police, the accused, Amit Kumar Singh (29), is attached to the Mulund Reserve Line of the RPF. Around 11.50 p.m. on Saturday, Mr. Singh, who was drunk, got into a taxi at Carnac Bunder and asked the driver to take him to Grant Road.

“The driver, who also works in collaboration with a fleet cab operator, was waiting for a fare that he had already accepted and refused to ferry Mr. Singh. The latter started shouting at and threatening the driver. The fare, who arrived while this was happening, cancelled the ride on seeing the commotion,” police sub-inspector Yogesh Bhosale, MRA Marg police station, said.

Mr. Bhosale said the driver then relented and agreed to take Mr. Singh to Grant Road. However, by this time, Mr. Singh started another argument over the driver’s earlier refusal and forcibly took the driver’s cell phone and wallet, which contained ₹850 in cash.

When the driver resisted, Mr. Singh allegedly dragged him out of the cab and assaulted him with a beer bottle, after which he sexually assaulted him behind a parked car.

“Two passers-by tried to stop the sexual assault but Mr. Singh scared them away. At 1.30 a.m. on Sunday, another passer-by saw Mr. Singh forcing himself on the driver and called the police control room. A patrolling vehicle was sent to the spot and both the men were brought to the police station,” Mr. Bhosale said.

The police arrested Mr. Singh and charged him with forcible unnatural intercouse and extortion under the Indian Penal Code. He was produced in court and remanded in police custody till January 20.

“Mr. Singh lived in the RPF quarters on P.D. Mello Road. We suspect he was intending to visit the red light area in Grant Road. The victim has suffered injuries to his lower back and rectum,” Mr. Bhosale said.

Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway, said, “The gravity of the case against him deems an inquiry unnecessary.

339,2020/01/14,IB officer kills himself at airport,"An Intelligence Bureau officer posted at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport was found to have committed suicide at the multi-storey parking lot near the international terminal on Monday.

According to the Sahar police, the victim has been identified as Abhishay Babu, who was posted as a junior intelligence officer with the Bureau of Immigration. He was found lying in a pool of blood on the fourth level of the parking lot, with injuries consistent with a fall from a height. He was taken to Cooper Hospital where he was declared dead before admission.

“Inquiries indicate that Babu was suffering from diabetes. No suicide note was found on his person and hence the reason behind his extreme step is still being investigated. However, we have not found any indications of foul play so far,” Additional Commissioner of Police (West region) Manoj Kumar Sharma said.

Officers at Sahar police station said he had joined his current posting in 2016 and that his diabetes had been aggravating lately, which was causing him severe discomfort. He was given a special shift from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., which is only given to pregnant women and to those with severe health ailments.

A source close to Babu told The Hindu that he had been seeking a transfer to the head office in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) for close to a year. According to the source, he was having trouble commuting from his Antop Hill residence and a transfer to BKC would have been much more convenient.

The police said specifics of his health ailments and their effect on his work are still being probed and relevant details will be sought from his superiors.

Babu had earlier worked in Hyderabad for around 20 years before being transferred to Mumbai. He is survived by his wife and two children, both of whom are in school.

340,2020/01/14,Man suspected of murder ends life in Bhandup,"A suspect in the murder of a 37-year-old woman in Bhandup was found to have killed himself on Monday night. According to the police, the woman has been identified as Yasmita Salunke, a teacher and resident of Vakratunda Palace building in Bhandup (West).

She was found bludgeoned to death with a hammer in the parking lot of her residence around 12 noon on Monday.

“Eyewitnesses told us that she was assaulted from behind by a man who seemed to have been lying in wait for her. Inquiries established that he was seen trying to talk to her earlier and we identified him as Kishore Sawant, a real estate agent. We found out that while Yasmita and Sawant knew each other for a couple of years, she had severed ties with him around a year ago after which he started stalking her,” an officer with the Bhandup police said.

Even as the police were trying to locate Sawant for inquiries, they were informed of him committing suicide at Kalpataru Building in Bhandup. The police have for the moment registered a case of murder against unidentified persons under the Indian Penal Code in connection with Yasmita’s death, while an accidental death report has been filed in connection with Sawant’s suicide.

341,2020/01/14,Advisory against flying kites near power lines,"Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited has issued an advisory against flying kites near overhead power transmission lines ahead of Makar Sankranti on January 15, highlighting that it would not only be life threatening but it would also put the city at the risk of going dark if the power grid was damaged.

An AEML spokesperson said the special threads used for kite flying, popularly known as ‘Manja’, are a good conductor of electricity, especially when the metal powder is used as one of the ingredients for coating, and can transmit very high voltage power, of even 2,20,000 volts, if it touches the overhead live wires or even enters the arching zone

“This may cause not only interruptions in power supply due to short circuit but also lead to injuries, fatalities or incidences of major breakdowns of transmission lines resulting even in grid failure. AEML advises consumers and kite flyers near the areas of Versova, Oshiwara; eastern parts of northern suburbs like Goregaon, Malad, Kandivali, Borivali; and other areas where the high voltage overhead transmission line network exists, to avoid kite flying near overhead power transmission lines,” the spokesperson said.

The company has set up a dedicated power help line, 19122, for people to report such instances.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/advisory-against-flying-kites-near-power-lines/article30562635.ece
342,2020/01/14,Accused in 2011 Shirdi double murder case held in Mumbai,"An accused wanted for the infamous Shirdi double murders of 2011 was arrested in Mumbai on Sunday. Prakash Avsarkar (32), who had fled after getting bail, had taken to stealing and robbing commuters at railway stations.

In June 2011, two young men Praveen Gondkar and Rachit Patni, were abducted for ransom, tortured to death by a local gang, and their bodies dumped in front of a hotel. The Shirdi police arrested 23 people in connection with the murders, including Mr. Avsarkar who managed to secure bail the same year and fled the city. He was wanted by the police since then. Twelve others were convicted under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act in 2018.

According to Crime Branch officers, police constable Subhash Naik with the Crime Branch Unit VII got a tip-off on Sunday saying a man staying in Vikhroli was wanted in the Shirdi double murder case.

“We sent a team to the location specified by the informant while also gathering information on the accused still wanted in the case. Avsarkar was identified and picked up for inquiries, after which he confessed to his involvement in the double murder,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said Mr. Avsarkar had become part of a gang that would target travellers of long distance late night trains departing from major railway stations.

“A large number of people gather at these railway stations well before the trains depart and many of them spend the night on the platforms. Avsarkar and his gang members would target such people, steal their cell phones or whatever valuables they could lay their hands on, sometimes forcibly if the conditions were favourable,” the officer said.

“We have handed Avsarkar over to the GRP and also informed the Shirdi police about his arrest. He has reportedly confessed to at least 100 such offences, mainly at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Some of his fellow gang members have already been arrested by the GRP. ” the officer added.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1libl0/article30562612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BM-Prakash,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/accused-in-2011-shirdi-double-murder-case-held-in-mumbai/article30562613.ece
343,2020/01/14,Christian BJP leader stands by CAA,"Tom Vadakkan, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and chairman of the National Christian Forum (NCF), on Monday said irrespective of their community, Indians should not fear their citizenship being scrapped as long as the Constitution is intact.

He was addressing a press conference on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh. Mr. Vadakkan said, “CAA is about giving shelter to minorities who may not be content, were left out during Partition or are suffering injustice, which also includes Christians. As someone belonging to the Christian community, I am nothing but thankful to the government for this step.”

He cited the example of Jogendra Nath Mandal, one of the founding fathers of Pakistan. Mr. Vadakkan said, “Mandal, who had invested his life in the uplift of the Dalit community, saw the social injustice faced by the community in Pakistan. He returned to India during Liaquat Ali Khan’s era. There still will be such people in Pakistan who are facing the brunt of something they would not face if had they been in India. Through this Act, the government is giving us so much and not taking anything as such.”

On the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Mr. Vadakkan said, “The Prime Minister himself has not specified anything. However, there is no necessity to freak out about the NRC because it has not reached an infant stage.”

Anup Joseph, secretary of the NCF, said, “The political parties who consider certain communities to be vote banks are perpetuating a sort of fear psychosis among people, which is why there is a certain unrest. I think protesting is all right because it is, basically, exercising one’s democratic freedom, but that should not lead to violence.”

Mr. Joseph said people should adopt peaceful methods to voice their dissent. He said, “The Kerala unit secretary of the BJP, A.K. Nazir, was attacked with chairs inside a mosque yesterday. How can such methods that are used by people with a difference of opinion be right in any way?”

On detention centres being set up in several States, Mr. Joseph said, “They exist everywhere, even in Maharashtra. Detention centres are inhabited only by infiltrators or those whose visas have expired. Owing to international conventions, they cannot be put in jails.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/e4pveq/article30562411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BM-NCF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/christian-bjp-leader-stands-by-caa/article30562412.ece
344,2020/01/14,Real estate industry is a tool to revive economy: Uddhav,"The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has directed the housing department to focus on redevelopment projects in the city. At a review meeting of the department on Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reportedly said that the real estate industry is a tool to revive the slowed down economy and it is important that projects are finished, after completing the due process, at the earliest.

Among the projects which the government has decided to speed up include all Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects, Goregaon’s Patra chawl redevelopment, and the redevelopment of residence of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in Parel. A special meeting will soon be organised to discuss the Dharavi redevelopment project, pending for over a decade.

An official who attended the meeting said that Mr. Thackeray stressed upon the need to push the real estate industry as it directly and indirectly helps revive the slowed down economy. “He said that it affects various other sectors and increases economic activity around. The government is looking at these redevelopment projects as a tool to push ahead the growth of overall economy,” said the official.

“A centralised mechanism should be established to sort out all the problems arising while fixing the eligibility of slum dwellers in the SRA projects and a fixed time frame must be announced for the same,” said Mr. Thackeray, while directing the speeding up of SRA projects which are pending for years under the pretext of non-payment of rent to the slum dwellers, and the unavailability of transit camps.

Goregaon’s Patra Chawl redevelopment, pending since 2008, was also taken up in the review meeting. “Uddhavji has directed the MHADA to present a proposal to pay rent to the original inhabitants of the area and directed that the project be completed at the earliest,” said the Industries Minister Subhash Desai.

As the Dharavi Rehabilitation Committee (DRC) gets ready to push Dharavi’s redevelopment under the new government, Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the original owners should get the houses with extra space being allocated to those who have set up their businesses.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i17rut/article30562358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bmCMMeeting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/real-estate-industry-is-a-tool-to-revive-economy-uddhav/article30562359.ece
345,2020/01/14,‘Need is to create a universal healthcare model for the country’,"Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd. (HCG), India’s largest provider of cancer care, believes that introduction of universal healthcare model like those of western countries can provide relief to cancer patients whose number is set to grow in the coming years. Chairman & CEO Dr. B.S. Ajai Kumar speaks about the challenges, and his vision to provide quality oncology healthcare across the country. Edited excerpts:

How serious is the cancer problem in India?

Very serious. It is increasing by the day. India reported 1.5 million cases but I think it will be 2.5 million or three million cases in a few years. Going forward China and India will have the highest numbers in incidence of cancer. So it is very important that we treat it properly. Prevention is always better. So we have taken up the issue of smoking, we have filed a case in Supreme Court and have sought a ban on smoking. We have taken up preventive measures like early screening. We want to focus on early detection and prevention. But not all cancers can be detected. So when they come in advanced stage, if treated properly, the patients can have a good quality of life.

Why will India and China have more cases?

Because of environmental and life style related issues. We have seen lot of people having style and dietary changes. Every one is eating outside and having junk and oily food. We are using herbicide, pesticides and all these will contribute. Smoking and pollution are adding to the problem. Cancer is something that does not happen overnight. Now even 25-year-olds are getting cancer and this is a matter of great concern.

What is your advise?

You must focus on lifestyle. Do good exercise, have proper diet and preferably organic food. If there is a family history we can look at the genomics criteria to see whether the patient will get cancer. One can predict. A saliva test can prove if someone has a higher chance of getting breast cancer. We are now getting more into genomics. So in future genomics will tell us who is likely to get cancer.

What is your growth plan?

Today we have 24 centres in India, Africa, Middle East and Vietnam. But most of them are in India. We have an opportunity to grow. Currently we are establishing a big centre in Delhi, possibly in Kerala. We have opportunity to grow in the Middle East and Africa. But right now we want to consolidate. Because we have grown too much, we want to consolidate first and then get into the growth phase again. We would like to go for the ‘asset light’ model. We don’t want to own real estate. And we are also coming with models wherein we will not own the equipments.

How about the treatment cost at your hospitals?

In India the problem is that we don’t have provision for universal healthcare. We have certain healthcare scheme for poor people. Today over 50% of the patients are paying from their own pocket. So naturally it becomes very expensive. In U.S. if you get a cancer treatment done it would cost $30,000 to $40,000. Here we are doing it in less than $8,000. The problem is that even if people are paying ₹5 lakh, they are paying from their pocket. But if you go to Singapore or Middle East the ₹5 lakh here is going to be ₹50 lakh. So it is very cheap here but people cannot afford that. That is why we have recommended universal healthcare.

How to make that possible?

The government has to be open and say let us create a universal healthcare model for the entire country. My frustration is that we have not done that yet. Unless we do that and measure the outcome, the existing schemes will not help. People are dying because they do not get the right kind of treatment. We have to bring that quality. Like I am a medicare recipient and have a medicare card in the U.S. When I was young I contributed for this. India has so many youngsters. Why can they not contribute? Their contribution can go towards universal healthcare pool. So billions of dollars will be there and people can benefit from that. There will be uniformity in care. When you become old you can benefit. That model has to be created. I don’t know what is coming in the way of that model.

What is the success rate for treatment of cancer?

Very good. For breast cancer the success rate is 90%, colon cancer is 80 to 90%. The only challenge is lung cancer, but with new treatment the patients are living longer. We can have better control on brain tumours, head and neck cancer if we can detect them at early stages. Late stages are also treatable. The cancer field has changed now. It is now more of a chronic disease.

What is the debt?

We have close to ₹650 crore debt. We are planning to reduce it. We have put an end to the capex cycle. We are now working on improving cash flow. Most centres are on the verge of breaking even. The whole idea is to improve the EBITDA and improve profitability. Then slowly we will reduce the debt.

What is your focus for company in the next five years?

All our centres should achieve full capacity utilisation. Then we will look at opportunity at asset light models. We are looking at operate and manage models and also areas where in we can provide our expertise. The entire Africa is a huge opportunity for us to provide good quality treatment. We have a centre in Nairobi and we want to build on this. We are looking at the partnership model like we have in Nashik and Ahmedabad. We want to grow through partnerships. Since we grew rapidly, I want to consolidate first.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fsimr5/article30562342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BM-Ajai-Kumar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/need-is-to-create-a-universal-healthcare-model-for-the-country/article30562343.ece
346,2020/01/14,"Correction and Clarification — January 14, 2020","The opening sentence and the headline of the story on a citizen’s right to own private property (Jan. 13, 2020) were wrong. Both said that ‘right to private property’ is a fundamental right. Right to private property is a human right, as explained later on in the story.

A clarification regarding “SC has no views on if ‘access to Internet’ is a fundamental right” (Jan. 11, 2020): The report is correct. It was initially misreported online that access to Internet was a fundamental right. The confusion is because the Supreme Court says quite categorically that the use of the medium of Internet for speech and expression (Article 19(1)(a)) and for trade and business (Article 19(1)(g)) are fundamental rights. However, on the question whether access to the Internet is a fundamental right, the Court said this had not been specifically argued and that it was not expressing any opinion on it. The distinction is between Internet as a technology and the use of Internet as a medium for exercising fundamental rights.

Anupam Behera, a member of The Bangalore Foodies Club, who organised Ama Odia Bhoji (my Odiya meal) says: “We decided to curate an event as we wanted to popularise lesser-known dishes such as mudhi mansha (mutton curry and puffed rice), dahi baigana (curd brinjal), pakhal bhata (fermented rice combined fried vegetables and fish), among others. It was organised for community building and not commercial reasons. That is why the food here is light and healthy because they are made by women and men who have a passion for cooking and prepare such dishes at home.”

Kanji, mutton aloo kasa (dry), served with steamed hot rice, dalma (one of Orissa’s most well-known traditional dish) with pitha, chinguri ghanta (prawn curry), macha besara (fish curry), were also on the menu. Apart from this, snacks such as gupchup (panipuri) , dahibara -aloo dum, ghuguni bara, were served.

Saipriya, who prepared the muri mangsho says: “I was born in Balasore, in North Orissa. Jagannath temple in Puri is known for its dalma and rosogolla. Baripada in Orissa is famous for mudhi (puffed rice) and it is served with a non-vegetarian gravy. Every region has a different cuisine. In Balasore, there is more influence of Bengali cuisine, whereas in Sambhalpur the food is completely different.”

Macha Besara

Anupam, who is from Cuttack, says: “A lot of our food culture is from our tribes. We include bamboo shoots and use yam in our mutton curry, instead of potatoes. We also make dishes out of fish head and chutney using red ants. The dahibada is a snack and a breakfast item.” Sai Priya adds: “We have macha besara with ambola (dried and salted raw mango).”

Tapti Pattnaik, one of the women who cooked for the meal, says: “Every household has a unique recipe for fish curry. Our food does have mustard-based curry, but it is different from what the Bengalis make.”

Smruti Mohanty, another participant, adds: “I prepared pitha, dalma and chutney. Dalma is often made with a variety of vegetables such as raw banana and papaya, but in temple food of Orissa you cannot use potatoes and carrots.” Anupam adds: “Dalma changes from region to region.”

Deepika Mishra, who made bodi churaa says: “Bodi is a signature dish from Keonjhar, where I hail from. It is sun-dried lentil dumplings and chura is a combination of badi, onion, garlic, and green chilli.”

Simple spices are used, says Saipriya, such as panch phoron (five spices), roasted cumin, and chilli powder. “Even in the dessert there is coconut and jaggery, and no sugar.” Tapti adds: “We use elephant apple, which is sour, and well known in Orissa.” Anupam says they hope to have more such events, and that he would like to keep it as non-commercial as possible.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/e65be0/article30567338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bgmodiya2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/flavours-from-orissa/article30567345.ece
348,2020/01/14,Choose heritage grains for your chakkarai pongal,"With onamatta from Kerala

All Kerala matta rice varieties are extremely nutritious. Considered heart-friendly, these bold red grains are believed to lower cholesterol. Known by the name Rosematta rice, Palakkadan Matta rice or sometimes simply red matta, it is rich in fibre content. Besides the sweet pongal, it is great to make idli, dosa, appamas and even various snacks like the murukku.

“I like using Onamatta rice as it has a beautiful fragrance. It also tends to cook fast and is a very soft rice variety. This particular pongal tastes delicious with palm jaggery,” says Nandi Shah, founder of Re:store, a popular homegrown baking and culinary brand.

As one of only three Indian graduates in Macrobiotics from the Kushi Institute, USA, she combines influences from around the world to create unique and wholesome recipes. Nandi also discovered her passion for the camera through photoshoots for her website, and formed Nandi Shah Photography in 2019. Follow her @indulgeatrestore.

Ingredients ½ cup onamatta rice

½ cup jaggery

6-8 cashews

2 tablespoons moong dal

2 ½ cups water

4 tablespoons ghee

1 pinch of cardamom powder

Method :

Roast the cashews in half a teaspoon of ghee. Add the raisins and roast until they bubble up. Set aside. Roast the moong dal in half a teaspoon of ghee until it releases an aroma. Add the cleaned and washed Onamatta rice to it. Add water and allow the rice and dal to cook until tender in a pressure cooker on a medium flame. Set aside. Add ghee in a pan. Add the palm jaggery and allow it to melt. Add the rice mixture and blend well. Add the cardamom powder, raisins and cashews. Mix well and top it off with a drizzle of ghee before serving.

With badshah bhog from Bengal

With short and bold grains, badshah bhog is a high yielding crop, rich in protein and classified as an aromatic rice varieity. According to legend, it is ‘fit to serve the king’, and hence the name badshah bhog. Traditionally used to prepare the Bengali sweet payesh, this rice used to be reserved for special guests in most households.

“Whole grains like badshah bhog are not only special but a healthy alternative to the regular rice. Unlike regular rice, it is non-starchy which gives the dish a good texture. The grain itself has a certain sweet and nutty taste, which adds to the deliciousness of the dish,” shares Sarenya Dhevi, a lawyer, special educator and food blogger who enjoys cooking and menu curation and stirs up lovely pop-up lunches. Follow her @cook_with_sarenya.

Ingredients ¾ cup badshah bhog rice

1/3 cup moong dal

1 ¼ cup jaggery, powdered

1 tsp cardamom powder

½ cup ghee

10 – 15 cashew nuts, fried

A pinch of edible camphor powder

A pinch of salt

Method:

Wash and soak the rice for an hour. Roast the dal in a little ghee until golden; add the drained rice and four cups of water. Let it cook on medium heat for three whistles and on low heat for seven whistles. Meanwhile, take the powdered jaggery and 1/4 cup of water to make thick syrup. Add the cardamom powder and bring it to a boil, until thick. Once the pressure releases, open the cooker lid, add a pinch of salt, 1/4 cup of ghee and mash the rice well. Strain the jaggery syrup and add it to the rice dal mixture. Mix well and turn on the heat. Cook for five to seven minutes adding the remaining ghee and edible camphor. Add more ghee if you require. Finally, add the fried cashews.

With karuppu kavuni arisi from Tamil Nadu

Black rice, called karuppu kavuni in Tamil Nadu, has been grown since the Chola period. Due to its high anthocyanin content, this rice turns into a deep purple when cooked. With powerful antioxidants, this sticky textured rice contains dietary fibre, anti-inflammatory properties.

“Aromatic rices such as gandakasala, mulankayama, gobindo bhog, sitabhoga or pimpudibasa, or joha are common and easy choices as their natural fragrance adds much to the final dish. This year, we have opted for whole raw Karuppu Kavuni, which adds flavor primarily by taste and texture rather than fragrance,” says the team of Shalikuta, a group of writers, bloggers, researchers, photographers, and entrepreneurs. Śālikūṭa is literally “a heap of rice,” but alludes to a granary: a storehouse of scientific and cultural knowledge about rice, which the group seeks to build.

350,2020/01/14,Jeep Compass automatic review: Worth the wait,"If you have held out for a diesel-automatic version of the Jeep Compass, your wait is now over. Yes, the Compass has been available with the much-in-demand engine-gearbox combo on the off-road-oriented Trailhawk version that debuted last year, but it is now being rolled out onto more everyday, and hence more affordable, versions in the range. As in the Trailhawk, the 2.0-litre diesel engine has been upgraded to BS-VI spec too. BS-VI-ready 4x2 manual and auto, and 4x4 manual versions will join the line-up in due time but, for now, our focus is on the new 4x4 diesel-auto that features Jeep’s Selec-Terrain Active Drive all-wheel-drive system.

Anyone familiar with the older BS-IV-spec Compass diesel will immediately note a major improvement in refinement on the BS-VI-spec Compass. You will hear a whole lot less of the engine, and interestingly, idle is quieter than what you get in the Trailhawk too. Jeep has optimised the 173hp/350Nm, 2.0-litre Multijet II diesel engine’s fuel mapping and calibration for this application, taking driving in cities into consideration. The result is more pep at low speeds and readier responses at part throttle. The Compass auto is also quicker than the Trailhawk in kickdown acceleration, with a 20-80kph time of 6.66sec (vs 7.15sec) and 40-100kph time of 8.05sec (vs 10.34sec). And for the record, its 11.4sec 0-100kph time also betters the Trailhawk’s 12.49 sec run.

However, as in the Trailhawk, what is missed here is the strong mid-range surge that gave the older BS-IV-spec engine so much character. The BS-VI engine delivers its power in a linear and measured (if also slightly unexciting) manner. The 9-speed torque converter automatic gearbox complements the engine’s characteristics well with smooth and timely shifts but, again, it is not snappy like, say, a dual-clutch can be. You can liven things up with manual shifts via the gear lever, but there are no paddleshifters.

Of the other things, the Compass continues to impress for its well-sorted high-speed manners. It feels planted at triple-digit speeds, the suspension is not perturbed by large patches of broken road, and even handling is tidy for an SUV. True to Jeep DNA, the Compass 4x4 is also adept off-road, with more ability. Much of the original Compass’ firm low-speed ride quality has also been addressed; but this top-spec Limited Plus version’s 225/55 R18 tyres cannot absorb the bumps as effectively as the Trailhawk’s chunkier 225/60 R17 tyres.

However, Jeep has not made any changes to the Compass’ exterior and interior. To give a quick recap, the Compass’ cabin is a smartly-turned-out space that makes generous use of soft-touch materials. There is reasonable space for four adults and seat comfort is good too.

Jeep will launch the Compass diesel-auto in two variants — Longitude and Limited Plus. The lower-spec Longitude trim gets four airbags, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, dual-zone climate control, a reverse camera, keyless entry and go, auto start/stop and cruise control.

The Limited Plus variant adds a panoramic sunroof, a powered driver’s seat with memory, leather seats, and auto headlights and wipers. Six airbags and a larger, 8.4-inch touchscreen are also exclusive to the Limited Plus. The Jeep Compass has become an even easier SUV to recommend, with the arrival of this new diesel-automatic version.

Sure, the diesel engine has lost some zing in the transition to BS-VI spec, but you will still like the MultiJet II engine for its easy access to power and new-found refinement. The smooth-shifting automatic transmission, on the other hand, adds in a new level of convenience. Factor in the strong build, the confident driving manners and even off-road ability — what you get is a really well-rounded package.

Jeep has priced the Compass diesel-automatic (ex-showroom, pan-India) at ₹21.96 lakh for the Longitude trim and ₹24.99 lakh for the fully-loaded Limited Plus; which, in turn, is about ₹2 lakh lower than the off-road-focused Trailhawk (₹26.80 lakh). While not cheap, the Compass Limited Plus diesel-automatic would be our pick of the range.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/qpql3z/article30567641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MP-Compass-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/worth-the-wait-jeep-compass-diesel-auto/article30567642.ece

Government sources said the meeting with the Prime Minister and Home Minister was very “cordial” and both the leaders were apprised of the “administrative difficulties” faced by the government. He also met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

A government source said the Chief Minister sought statehood for the Union Territory, and enhanced Central assistance and waiver of legacy loan.

The Chief Minister also wanted the Centre to compensate for settling the arrears of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations.

He requested the Centre to increase annual allocation by 10%.

He urged the Defence Minister to increase patrolling by Navy and Coast Guard ships to protect the interest of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry fishermen in the maritime boundary with Sri Lanka.

352,2020/01/14,Disgruntled Congress MLA an ‘agent’ of BJP: government whip,"Accusing Congress legislator N. Danavelou of playing into the hands of the BJP to destabilise the Congress government, Government Whip R. K. R Anantharaman on Tuesday said the Bahour MLA’s recent outburst against the Chief Minister was out of frustration that he was not able to topple the government.

Addressing a press conference in the Assembly along with other legislators, Mr. Anantharaman said, Mr. Danavelou had begun dissociating himself with the Congress ever since he started “hobnobbing” with the BJP, he added.

“Months ago, Mr. Danavelou along with an AIADMK legislator had approached an Independent MLA seeking support for toppling the government. The Independent legislator had informed the Chief Minister about the overtures made by Mr. Danavelou. It did not succeed and hence he started levelling false allegations and is behaving as an agent of BJP,” he said.

The photo opportunity Mr. Danavelou had with the AIADMK legislator after he first made the accusations against the government at Bahour was proof of his intentions behind the diatribe against Chief Minister Narayanasamy, Mr. Anantharaman claimed.

Also, his meeting with Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi had raised further suspicion, the government whip added.

‘Show proof’

Mr. Anantharaman said if Mr. Danavelou had proof of instances of misdeeds by the Chief Minister he should have submitted to the Lt. Governor or investigation agencies instead of making “wild” allegations.

Mr. Danavelou, who was denied ticket by All India N. R. Congress during last Assembly elections, should be “gracious” enough to the Chief Minister for accommodating him in Congress party, the whip said.

353,2020/01/14,Privileges committee in Puducherry starts proceedings against officials on SEC issue,"The Assembly Privileges Committee on Tuesday initiated privilege proceedings against officials responsible for floating an advertisement inviting applications for the State Election Commission overruling a resolution of the Assembly.

The Committee, chaired by Deputy Speaker M.N. R Balan, as a first move questioned Under Secretary, Local Administration Department, Giddi Balaram, under whose name the advertisement appeared in newspapers on January 7, for more than 30 minutes at the Legislative Assembly.

A government source told The Hindu that Mr. Balaram had reportedly informed the Committee that he floated the advertisement under instructions from his superiors. The Committee had also decided to summon Director, LAD, G. Malar Kannan. Based on the reply by Mr. Kannan, the committee would decide on summoning other officers, the source said.

The government had appointed former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan, last year, as SEC after Speaker V. P Sivakolundhu gave a ruling bestowing power to appoint the election officer with the elected government.

The Speaker, while giving his ruling, had also cancelled a similar advertisement floated allegedly at the behest of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for the SEC post.

Challenging the appointment made by the government, the Lt Governor referred the subject to Union Ministry of Home Affairs which in turn directed the Chief Secretary to again start the selection process.

354,2020/01/14,Lone policewoman in Panruti keeps station gates locked fearing protesters’ ire,"Can a police station remain locked? This strange and unprecedented incident occurred in Muthandikuppam in Panruti block on Monday. The station located in a sensitive pocket remained out of bounds for outsiders with the lone policewoman on duty locking the main gate from inside citing security reasons.

Sources said the station, which has jurisdiction over Muthandikuppam, Vallam and other sensitive areas, had been without a head for several months.

The police inspector of Kadampuliyur station is in charge of Muthandikuppam station.

A number of complainants, who visited the station on Monday, were surprised to find the main gate locked from inside and returned disappointed. A policeman attached to the station said, on condition of anonymity, that the station had been locked for security reasons.

Anantharaman, 35, of Sorathankuzhi near Panruti, had set himself ablaze in front of the police station on January 9 accusing the police of being partisan while investigating a case.

The victim was rushed to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital and later he was referred to Chennai where he died on Monday. Irate relatives of the victim resorted to a road roko at the neighbouring Vallam village protesting against his death.

The policemen attached to the station had left for Vallam to maintain law and order.

The sub-inspector attached to the station had left the station on an assignment to monitor the written examinations for recruitment of police sub-inspectors.

The police personnel were apprehensive that the road roko protesters might barge into the station and therefore decided to keep the gates locked, he said. The woman constable was reportedly unable to respond to complainants.

However, Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said that the policewoman posted at the station was on sentry duty on Monday. The constable would have thought it better to lock the main gate more as a precautionary measure and she was attending to everybody. There was a need for maximum number of personnel at Vallam till the reinforcements arrived and hence all the station personnel had left for the protest venue.

359,2020/01/14,Concern over rising prevalence of depression,"TIRUCHI

Mental health professionals and senior police officials on Tuesday expressed concern over the increasing prevalence of psychological problems among people in the society at an awards function organised by Anbalayam, an NGO working for rescue and care of mentally ill people, to mark its entry into 30th year after inception.

The way the society treats the mentally ill is a cause for serious concern, against the backdrop of the World Health Organisation predicting major prevalence of depression and other psychological problems between 2020 and 2030. “Mental illness needs to be treated with love and care,” C. Ramasubramanian, Founder and Consultant Psychiatrist, M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation, Madurai, said in his address.

“The society does not seem to be aware that uncontrollable anger, depression and other mental problems are prevalent in every person in varying degrees,” said V. Balakrishnan, Deputy Inspector General, Tiruchi Range. Department officials have been sensitised to the importance of humane handling of the wandering mentally ill people, he said.

Superintendent of Police, Tiruchi Rural, Ziaul Haque, said caring for mentally ill people facing neglect in the society warrants multiple efforts from entities rendering selfless service.

T.K.S. Senthilkumar, Founder, Anbalayam, said there was a dire need for starting separate rehabilitation homes for HIV/AIDS patients. Likewise, an exclusive ward for mentally ill people admitted as in-patients was necessary in government hospitals. The ward must be attended by nurses and guarded by police personnel as mentally ill patients tend to get away, he said.

Mr. Senthil Kumar also called upon the Police Department to create a Reunion Cell whereby periodic efforts could jointly be taken with NGOs to restore the wandering mentally ill people to their families. NGOs have prevailed upon the civic body to assign a park exclusively for use by wandering mentally ill. The Smart City concept would be meaningless if the welfare of mentally ill people is not factored in. The wandering mentally ill people, who, in very many cases, cannot be confined in shelter homes, can be given wash, clothes to change, and food at the parks every day, he said.

Former Vice Principals of St. Joseph's College G. Balakrishnan, and V. Rengarajan, and former Professor of English G. Ravindran, offered felicitations.

Presenting the Anbalayam Awards, Film Director Prabu Solomon said the real heroism constituted service to humanity. The prevalence of mental illness among people will come down when they are guided by wisdom of observations rather than the unending quest for knowledge, he said.

District Differently Abled Welfare Officer R. Ravichandran, and Medical Officer, District Mental Health Programme, P.T. Krishnamoorthy, also spoke.

Dr. Ramasubramanian of M S Chellamuthu trust & Research Foundation was honoured with Mananalam Kaakum Maamanidhar Award. A. Manohar, General manager(scientific publishing services pvt ltd.) was honoured with Anbalayam Award for Best Social Responsibility, and A. M.

361,2020/01/14,Heavy arrival causes slide in price of sugarcane,"The price of sugarcane has come down slightly in Tiruchi market when compared to 2019 even as the markets in the city witnessed milling crowds of people purchasing essentials for the Pongal festival.

A high quality sugar cane was quoted at ₹ 40 at different parts of Tiruchi. It was ₹ 30 at the Gandhi market. Medium and normal size sugar cane is available between ₹ 20 to ₹ 25 each. A bunch (10 number) of high quality sugar cane is sold at ₹ 250.

Sensing good business prospects, a number of seasonal traders have set up temporary shops at important junctions and corners. Though they set up shops on Sunday itself, Tuesday witnessed brisk sale of sugarcane, turmeric bunches, flowers, mango leaves, neem leaves and other puja items.

Heavy arrival is said to be the reason for moderate price of sugarcane. “The market has received heavy arrival of sugarcane from different productivity centres due to good yield,” says C. Manikandan, a grocery trader in Cantonment.

In some areas, people ask for Thirukattupalli sugarcane as it is superior in quality. It costs ₹ 10 more than the sugarcane grown in other areas of Tiruchi and Thanjavur.

However, the price of turmeric bunches has gone up slightly. Traders quoted a good quality of turmeric bunch at ₹ 50 as against ₹ 40 last year.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qjfgo8/article30568690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY15PURCHASEPONGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/heavy-arrival-causes-slide-in-price-of-sugarcane/article30568632.ece

363,2020/01/14,Madras Flying Club all set to take off from Tiruchi,"TIRUCHI

The 90-year-old Madras Flying Club which has shifted its operation from Chennai International Airport to the Tiruchi International Airport will start enrolling candidates aspiring to become pilots and those interested in aviation related courses in the coming academic year here.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) at Tiruchi Airport has provided necessary infrastructure to the Madras Flying Club for commencement of classes relating to Pilot Training, Aircraft Maintenance and Cabin Crew Management among others to the chosen candidates.

The prestigious Flying Club which was started in the pre-independence period in 1929 has decided to shift the six aircrafts in its possession from Chennai to Tiruchi airport before the beginning of the current academic year.

Three computer-aided smart classrooms have been set up at the Tiruchi airport to hold regular sessions for the selected candidates for various courses. Having shifted from Chennai to Tiruchi airport in a full-fledged manner, the Madras Flying Club is now all set to enrol students aspiring to become pilots and those interested in aviation-related courses, its honorary secretary Captain Jacob Selvaraj told The Hindu.

The new classrooms of the Flying Club were recently inaugurated by the Tiruchi Airport Director K. Gunasekaran in the presence of Mr. Jacob Selvaraj and others. The Flying Club has planned to have a tie-up with a foreign aviation organisation soon to further enhance the quality of training imparted to the candidates, said Mr. Jacob Selvaraj.

The theoretical and practical sessions for the selected candidates admitted for diploma and degree courses besides those seeking Commercial Pilot licence would be held at the Tiruchi airport. The Flying Club has a team of dedicated and highly qualified faculty members who would be moving to Tiruchi to conduct classes for the students, said Mr. Jacob Selvaraj.

The Flying Club which is registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975 is recognised by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, New Delhi. The shifting of the Flying Club to Tiruchi would augur well for candidates especially those hailing from down south of Tamil Nadu as Tiruchi was centrally located. In its chequered history, the Flying Club has produced over 1,000 pilots who were successfully commandeering various international and domestic flights, says Mr. Selvaraj.

The Tamil Nadu government has been extending full support to the Flying Club, Mr. Selvaraj said adding that it had allotted two acres of its land adjoining the Tiruchi airport to the club to enable it to set up comprehensive infrastructure and other facilities for its-day-to-day operations in future.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/madras-flying-club-all-set-to-take-off-from-tiruchi/article30567929.ece
364,2020/01/14,‘Vedupari’ event held at Srirangam temple,"TIRUCHI

A large number of devotees witnessed the ‘Thirumangaimannan Vedupari,’ a holy ritual held as part of the 21-day Vaikunta Ekadasi festival, at the Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple on Monday.

The event is held on the eighth day celebrations of the “Iraapathu” of the Vaikunta Ekadasi to mark the divine blessing of the Lord to Thirumangaimannan who comes to rob the valuables of Lord Narayana and his consort. The function began after the processional deity Namperumal was brought on “Kuthirai Vaganam” (golden horse) on the ‘Manalveli’ inside the temple premises marking the commencement of the event.

One of the bamboo poles on which the deity was taken in a fast paced procession (Vaiyali Vagaira Kandarulal) suddenly broke causing a flutter. The idol was thereafter taken to the Thousand Pillar Mandapam where special rituals were performed. The event continued thereafter, said the authorities.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/vedupari-event-held-at-srirangam-temple/article30567760.ece
365,2020/01/14,"Jeweller kills wife and two sons, attempts to end life in a lodge in Tiruchi","A jeweller allegedly murdered his wife and two sons and attempted to end his life on Monday night.

The crime was committed in a lodge situated on the busy West Bouleward Road, where the jeweller M. Selvaraj (47) – from Ooranipuram in neighbouring Thanjavur district – had checked in with his family on Sunday. Selvaraj ran a jewellery shop in Thanjavur.

Police sources said moments before committing the crime on Saturday, Selvaraj had called up his relative Guru Ganesh and reportedly conveyed his decision to end his life. On hearing the news, Guru Ganesh rushed to Tiruchi only to find the lodge room where Selvaraj had been staying locked from the inside. Guru Ganesh approached the lodge front office staff and got a spare key to enter the room. On entering the room, he found Selvaraj battling for his life with his neck slashed with a knife. Selvaraj’s wife Chellam (43) and his young sons S. Nikil (20) and S. Mukil (15) were found dead with their necks slashed.

On being informed, Fort Police rushed to the spot. Police sources said Selvaraj had resorted to the extreme step owing to losses in his business.

The bodies were shifted to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital for autopsies. Selvaraj is undergoing treatment at the hospital. The Fort Police has registered cases under sections 302 (murder) and 309 (attempt to commit suicide). Further investigations are on.

Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/jeweller-kills-wife-and-two-sons-attempts-to-end-life-in-a-lodge-in-tiruchi/article30564937.ece
366,2020/01/14,"After brief lull, work on new Mukkombu barrage resumes","With the monsoon withdrawing, construction of a new barrage across the Kollidam at Mukkombu has gathered momentum.

The construction work, being undertaken at an estimate of ₹387.60 crore, began in June last. The new regulator is being constructed 75 metres away from the damaged structure on the downstream of the riverbed.

The L&T, which bagged the contract, concentrated in the first two months on mobilising men and machinery at the site, map drawing and other preparatory works. It began raising piles in August. After two months of brisk work, the northeast monsoon slowed down the progress.

Heavy discharge of surplus water from Mettur dam and subsequent opening of water into the Kollidam from Mukkombu also put the brakes to an extent. After a brief lull, construction work resumed in the last week of November.

According to PWD sources, 20% of work has been completed so far. As far as raising of piles along the proposed stretch is concerned, the officials say 45% of work has been completed. Out of 484 piles, 242 have been completed. Each pile has 1.25 diameter and it has been erected from a depth of 26 metres.

Construction of a diaphragm wall is the other major work being undertaken at the project site. It is aimed at avoiding seepage of water and arresting the movement of sand in the vicinity of the structure. Out of 1,650 metres, the diaphragm wall has been constructed for a length of 600 metre.

“Below ground level work usually faces many hurdles due to various factors. Despite brief stoppage of works for a few weeks due to water flow, there has been steady progress. It is on the right track,” said R. Baskar, Executive Engineer, River Conservation Division, Tiruchi.

The work schedule has been prepared after taking into account various factors such as water flow, monsoon and natural disturbances. The period between January and June was conclusive for construction activity. It has been planned to complete all below ground level works within May. Once these are completed, there will not be much problem in taking up above ground level structural work.

“We have crossed the crucial phase of the new regulator construction. The challenging period is over. The period from January to June offers a non-irrigation season window and the works are in full swing,” a site engineer said.

It has been proposed to build 53 piers and four abutments. Construction of piers has also been started. As many as 300 persons are involved in round-the-clock work schedule. Of them, about 100 are engineers and 200 skilled workers, the engineer added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/8a5vlg/article30564273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY14-CONSTRUCTIONREGULATOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/after-brief-lull-work-on-new-mukkombu-barrage-resumes/article30564274.ece
367,2020/01/14,The bulls are getting ready,"With Pongal festivities round the corner, the majestic bulls are being readied to hit the ground for the traditional jallikattu events to be held in the district.

The State government has accorded permission to organise the traditional bull taming sport this month in four villages: Periya Suriyur, Avarangadu, Pothamettupatti and Karungulam. Hectic arrangements are underway at Periya Suriyur and Avarangadu, with locals actively getting involved to make the event a grand one.

The State government issued an order recently permitting the events to be held in four villages this month. Joint inspections will be done at the venues by a team of officials belonging to different departments to ensure that the prescribed rules to hold the event are being strictly adhered to, said a senior official of the Animal Husbandry Department.

The first jallikattu in Tiruchi district has been scheduled for January 16 on Mattu Pongal at Periya Suriyur situated on the outskirts of Tiruchi. It is an age-old custom of the villagers of Periya Suriyur to hold the event on the second day of the Tamil month “Thai”. The event in Avarangadu is to be held on January 17 and at Pothamettupatti on January 18. The event at Karungulam is expected to be organised this month-end.

Jallikattu organisers in the villages have mobilised money from locals to hold the event, which attracts bulls from Tiruchi and neighbouring districts. Nearly 90% of the arrangements connected with holding the event have been completed at Periya Suriyur, said S. Raja an organiser of the traditional sport.

Double barricades have been installed to a distance of nearly 400 feet from vaadi vaasal from where the bulls will be allowed one after the other into the arena after being subjected to medical examination. Stages have been erected to enable officials to watch the event.

Around 600 bulls are expected to be fielded at Periya Suriyur this time with the number of participating tamers being about 500. The bulls will be allowed into the arena in batches. The organisers have spent around ₹10 to ₹12 lakh for the event at Periya Suriyur, he said.

The jallikattu at Avarangaadu is to be organised by four villages: Palakurichi, Kalingapatti, Solayampatti and Keeranipatti. The arrangements for holding the event have almost been completed, says G. Simion, one of the organisers.

Double barricades on either side of the arena have been installed to a length of about 300 feet. Besides this, a stage has been erected for the officials to monitor the event. The organisers expect bulls from neigbouring districts such as Dindigul, Sivaganga, Madurai and Pudukottai district. Clearance for holding the event will be given after inspection of the venue by a joint team to ensure that prescribed rules were being adhered to.

The team will inspect the arena, collection point, separate spots for medical examination of bulls and tamers, besides ensuring that a makeshift canopy is provided to animals while they are lined up for the event.

368,2020/01/14,BJP ally LJP to contest in Delhi Assembly polls,"The BJP’s ally Lok Janshakti Party announced on Tuesday that it would contest all 70 seats in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls. This is the second instance, after the Jharkhand Assembly elections, when the party had broken away from their allies to contest solo.

The party released the first list of 15 candidates. Its leader and in-charge for the Delhi polls Kali Pandey said his party’s alliance with the BJP was confined to Bihar and it was for the saffron party to decide if it wanted a tie-up in the national capital as well.

“It is for the bigger partner in alliance to take a call about any tie-up. We have seen what happened in Jharkhand,” he told reporters referring to the BJP’s loss. In Jharkhand, the LJP demanded at least seven seats which the BJP refused to concede. The BJP fought the polls on its own after it failed to finalise an alliance with its partner All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU).

Delhi LJP president Vinod Nagar said the party would fight the polls with all its might.

The other Bihar party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, is also planning to contest in Delhi in alliance with the Congress. However, it said if the Congress does not concede seven to eight seats, it will contest all alone.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/e4ucyl/article30568862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15PASWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/bjp-ally-ljp-to-contest-in-delhi-assembly-polls/article30568863.ece

371,2020/01/14,When the earth yields a bounty: Pongal 2020 was a sweet one for Tamil Nadu’s agrarian community,"The emerald paddy fields of Poolankulam village near Madurai have turned golden yellow, rice plants stand hunched due to the weight of grains dangling like strung beads from them, the scent of freshly-thrashed husk laces the air and the morning light is shrouded in mist. It is Thai, the harvest month in the Tamil agrarian calendar and there is much happiness all around.

Farm hand S Palaniyammal stands in a lone patch of shade, beneath a large neem tree, holding a metal basin. She is winnowing the day’s harvest. At her feet is a mound of treasure — pearly grains of new-born paddy — longish, with grooves on them, in the colour of the earth, bearing the scent of the countryside.

“Now, this will go into the ural (stone mortar) to be pounded with an ulakkai (wooden pestle) and the new rice will be boiled with milk, ghee and jaggery in a brass pot atop a firewood stove, to make chakkarai pongal — first for the sun god and then for us to feast on,” she flashes a toothless smile as sparrows take tiny pecks at the grains.

“The rains have been kind this year and so has been our muthalali (farm owner),” she says. “We were able to reap 40 sacks of paddy per acre. Water was released on time from the dam and we had prepared the earth well in advance.” The final quantum of purling waters, all the way from the Mullaperiyar and Vaigai dams, gush through a channel nearby, even as tractors criss-cross farms all around, harvesting the yield, leaving behind only stumps, remnant of a bumper crop.

“After three years of drought, it’s a relief to see our efforts bear fruit. Lack of rain and insufficient storage in the dams cost us dearly last time,” says farmer S Bhuvaneswari. She has been cultivating organic native paddy for the past six years. “This time around, the grains are fleshy and fat and the number of grains per plant is also more. Our fields were flush with water and we cannot be more thankful to the rains.”

Bhuvaneswari is from Thanjavur, the rice bowl of the State. She explains how Pongal is a grand celebration in the Cauvery delta. “Typically, pongal is cooked under the sky, on a platform built with mud and decorated with kolam. The dish is usually cooked in an uruli. In fact, I have fished out a round-bottomed bronze one from my grandmother’s time to make pongal this time,” she says.

Further away, the jingle of bells tied to the horns of bulls rent the idyllic village air and half-a-dozen young men are busy cleaning and painting the cattle shed. Standing an impressive five feet from the ground, with rippling muscles and an enviable sheen on his skin is 12-year-old Kaari. The colour of rain clouds, he is a star bull in the village, an ace player in jallikattu matches and occupies the centre of the shed, his massive form tethered by two ropes to stone pillars on either side.

“Last year, he won us a car, steel utensils, an iron cot and a bicycle,” says S Prabhu, the care-taker, applying a coat of turmeric and sandal paste on its horns. Every Pongal, a new collar is made for the bull; it consists of a thick leather strap onto which bells and colourful woollen balls are stitched. “Bells are also tied to his horns and hoofs to add to his looks,” he explains.

Elsewhere in another farm, a row of women with sickles in hand reap grassy shoots. They sing as they bend over and go about the harvest and their faint kulavai (ululation) wafts across. Palaniyammal sends a silent prayer under the neem tree, thanking the earth for a good year, hoping the year to come is even better.",agriculture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/izrrkl/article30566929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MpFarm1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/when-the-earth-yields-a-bounty/article30566932.ece
372,2020/01/14,A new virus emerges in China,"On December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. A few patients in Wuhan had been suffering from respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia since December 8, 2019. Besides providing care, Chinese public health officials began carrying out environmental assessments at the wholesale market and trying to identify the microbe causing the outbreak.

How was the virus identified as coronavirus?

On January 9, 2020, the WHO issued a statement saying Chinese researchers have made “preliminary determination” of the virus as a novel coronavirus in a person with pneumonia. The researchers were able to determine the virus by sequencing the genome of the novel virus using an isolate taken from an infected patient. “Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,” WHO tweeted.

What are coronaviruses?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe common cold to more severe diseases such as the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS coronavirus was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002, MERS coronavirus was from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

Has China shared the genome sequence data?

On January 11, China shared the whole genome sequence data with WHO and submitted them to the Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) platform to allow researchers across the world to access the data. Sharing the data with GISAID will hep other countries to quickly identify the virus in infected people and provide care, and also develop specific diagnostic kits, drugs and even vaccines. Since Jan 11, five more genome sequences have been submitted to GISAID.

How many have been infected with the novel virus?

Using the genomic test kit, China was able to accurately identify that only 41 of the 59 suspected cases have been infected with the novel coronavirus. According to the WHO, the clinical signs and symptoms of the patients are mainly fever and fatigue, accompanied by dry cough, with a few having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing fluid in both lungs.

What is the condition of the infected patients?

Of the 41 patients, seven have severe illness, two have already been discharged and one person had succumbed to the disease. The remaining patients were reported to be in a “stable condition”. The last reported case was on January 2. The patient who died on January 9 is apparently a 61-year-old man who had chronic liver disease and was a frequent customer at the market which is under investigation to identify the animal species that has transmitted the virus to humans. Public health experts are yet to identify the source of the new virus.

Has the virus been able to spread among humans?

According to the WHO, 763 people, including medical staff, who have come in close contact with patients infected with the novel coronavirus have been identified for close monitoring. So far the virus doesn’t seem to have the ability to spread from one person to another as the infection has not been found in any of the close contacts. Based on preliminary epidemiological investigation, most of the patients have come in close contact with animals or frequently visited a wholesale seafood market, which has been closed since January 1.

Has the virus been seen in people outside China?

On January 8, a woman who had travelled from Wuhan to Thailand was hospitalised and mild pneumonia was diagnosed. Subsequent testing confirmed that the woman, a Chinese national, had been infected with the novel coronavirus. But none outside Wuhan in China has been found to be infected with the virus directly from animals.

Are there any travel restrictions to China?

At this point in time, the “WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available”. It does not recommend that travellers take any specific measures either. However, the WHO provides general tips to reduce the risk of infection such as cleaning hands with soap and water, covering nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing, avoiding contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoid making unprotected contact with wild or farm animals.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/hgbkyz/article30567852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/a-new-virus-emerges-in-china/article30567853.ece
373,2020/01/14,Oldest material on Earth found inside meteorite that hit Australia,"A meteorite that crashed into rural southeastern Australia in a fireball in 1969 contained the oldest material ever found on Earth, stardust that predated the formation of our solar system by billions of years, scientists said on January 13.

The oldest of 40 tiny dust grains trapped inside the meteorite fragments retrieved around the town of Murchison in Victoria state dated from about 7 billion years ago, about 2.5 billion years before the sun, Earth and rest of our solar system formed, the researchers said.

In fact, all of the dust specks analyzed in the research came from before the solar system's formation - thus known as “presolar grains” - with 60% of them between 4.6 and 4.9 billion years old and the oldest 10% dating to more than 5.6 billion years ago.

The stardust represented time capsules dating to before the solar system. The age distribution of the dust - many of the grains were concentrated at particular time intervals - provided clues about the rate of star formation in the Milky Way galaxy, the researchers said, hinting at bursts of stellar births rather than a constant rate.

“I find this extremely exciting,” said Philipp Heck, an associate curator at the Field Museum in Chicago who led the research published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Despite having worked on the Murchison meteorite and presolar grains for almost 20 years, I still am fascinated that we can study the history of our galaxy with a rock,” Mr. Heck added.

The grains are small, measuring from 2 to 30 micrometers in size. A micrometer is a one-thousandth of a millimeter or about 0.000039 of an inch.

Stardust forms in the material ejected from stars and carried by stellar winds, getting blown into interstellar space. During the solar system's birth, this dust was incorporated into everything that formed including the planets and the sun but survived intact until now only in asteroids and comets.

The researchers detected the tiny grains inside the meteorite by crushing fragments of the rock and then segregating the component parts in a paste they described as smelling like rotten peanut butter.

Scientists have developed a method to determine stardust's age. Dust grains floating through space get bombarded by high-energy particles called cosmic rays. These rays break down atoms in the grain into fragments, such as carbon into helium.

These fragments accumulate over time and their production rate is rather constant. The longer the exposure time to cosmic rays, the more fragments accumulate. The researchers counted these fragments in the laboratory, enabling them to calculate the stardust's age.

Scientists previously had found a presolar grain in the Murchison meteorite that was about 5.5 billion years old, until now the oldest-known solid material on Earth. The oldest-known minerals that formed on Earth are found in rock from Australia's Jack Hills that formed 4.4 billion years ago, 100 million years after the planet formed.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/pn10py/article30562813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/australia-meteorite,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oldest-material-on-earth-found-inside-meteorite-that-hit-australia/article30562814.ece
374,2020/01/14,Is Plastic bio-degradable at all? The Myths & Facts about bio-degradable Plastic,"Plastic, in the form of bottles, bags, packaging materials, furniture and more, has become an integral part of our present-day lives. However, there are rising problems due to over-use of plastic which has caused a worldwide alarm. The world today is aiming for a plastic detox. Starting from petitions for plastic-free shopping in supermarkets to ensuring that only recyclable packaging is used for transporting products as far as possible; companies and individuals alike are jumping on to the plastic-free bandwagon. While some are switching to natural alternatives of plastic, others are looking for bio-degradable plastic options. However, is there really such a thing such as bio-degradable plastic?

The Difference between Bio-Degradable, Compostable and Bio-Based Plastic

Now there are a lot of myths and misconceptions about plastic which is bio-degradable. We attempt to bust some of them here through this article

Biodegradable is not always Compostable

While compostable plastic is biodegradable, the opposite is not always true. Theoretically speaking, biodegradable means the material should break down into water, carbon dioxide and minerals. However, this is not the case with all plastics. Also, many of the plastics that are bio-degradable, only degrade at very specific temperatures and also need optimal levels of light, water and oxygen for the same. And even then, they leave behind residues which are toxic for the environment.

Plastics are not Naturally Biodegradable

This is another myth that needs to be busted. Many of the plastics will not biodegrade naturally. Owing to the conditions required for their biodegradation, a lot of plastics will only get biodegraded at industrial facilities.

All Bio-based Plastics are not Biodegradable

Many Bio-based plastics are known to not be biodegradable. However, they can be recycled, albeit partially. Bio-Plastics such as Bio-PET, which is made from plant materials is known to have chemical structure that is identical to the fossil based plastics such as Polyethylene and Polyethylene Terephthalate.

It is not Economically and Environmentally feasible to Recycle all forms of Plastic

Every bio-based plastic does not deliver the same amount of pure recyclate streams. These streams are the amount of product that can be recycled to produce something new. Keeping this in mind, the overall volume of recyclate produced at times will cost more economically and even environmentally to recycle some bio-based plastics. For the process will produce a bigger carbon footprint ultimately.

To conclude, bio-based plastic and even biodegradable plastic while having their virtues, also come with their own set of flaws. As such, they cannot really be substitutes to plastic due to a lot of reasons.",brandhub,https://www.thehindu.com/brandhub/8prz5u/article30565585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bisleri-30jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/brandhub/is-plastic-bio-degradable-at-all-the-myths-facts-about-bio-degradable-plastic/article30564994.ece
