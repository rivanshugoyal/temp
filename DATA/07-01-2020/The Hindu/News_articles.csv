0,2020/01/07,IOA disaffiliates Karate Association of India for violating its constitution,"The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has disaffiliated the Karate Association of India (KAI) for violating its constitution and guidelines.

The IOA took the decision during its Annual General Meeting on December 30 but the formal letter informing the disaffiliation was sent to the World Karate Federation (WKF) on Monday.

“The AGM of IOA deliberated on governance issue of karate in India. The IOA had granted affiliation to KAI on 08/08/2017, subject to ratification of executive council/General Body. The ratification of KAI’s affiliation remained pending as there has been an increasing number of complaints about them in the last two years,” the IOA said in the letter.

“During the AGM, it was agreed that any national federation violating the principles of the Constitution of IOA and its guidelines should not have the patronage of the Olympic movement in India. IOA unanimously decided to annul the affiliation of KAI and to discontinue any association with it,” said the letter addressed to WKF CEO Sara Wolff.

In September 2018, the IOA had constituted a three-member ad hoc committee to hold elections of KAI within 120 days after ruling that the tenure of the office bearers of the national sports federation expired and poll process has been delayed.

The IOA’s decision to form the ad hoc committee was challenged before the Delhi High Court but later withdrawn, according to the letter.

The KAI later held its polls (not under the supervision of the ad hoc committee of the IOA) in January last year and elected Likha Tara as president and Ambedkar Gupta as general secretary.

The duo were called by the IOA top brass for a discussion on December 27 but they did not turn up.

“KIA’s election had no presence of an observer from the IOA and there have been various allegations on the validity of the process.

“The newly-elected office bearers of KAI were invited to the office of IOA for a meeting on 27/12/2029 to discuss on a roadmap to resolve the issues. But KAI’s refusal to engage in a dialogue and insistence on defiance was shocking,” the IOA letter to the WKF said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ioa-disaffiliates-karate-association-of-india-for-violating-its-constitution/article30503360.ece
1,2020/01/07,Sindhu is a medal prospect: Jwala,"Former Indian badminton star Jwala Gutta sees a tough time for India in the Tokyo Olympics to be held later this year, but backed P.V. Sindhu to be a strong medal prospect if she could find some form leading into the event.

Sindhu, who won the World championships last year in August, has had a sedate run since then and would be looking to get things back on track.

“I don’t think it is going to be better than the last time. It will be difficult because I haven’t seen any great performances. Being a sportsperson, I am hoping let’s be positive (on getting a medal) but I wouldn’t be surprised if we don’t have any medals. That’s what I feel,” said Jwala.

“If Sindhu is training really hard and if I see some results now... yeah, of course, she is a medal prospect,” the Arjuna Awardee added.

Three athletes felicitated

As part of the Casagrand Aspiring Stars program, three young women athletes were felicitated by Jwala and Casagrand executive vice-president N. Eshwar at an event here on Tuesday.

The three athletes received a sponsorship of ₹2 lakh each to support their sports training and development requirements.

S. Ruthika, a sprinter from Chennai, Suhitha Maruri, a tennis player from Bengaluru and Abinaya Raghupathy, a roller-skating sportsperson from Coimbatore were the three winners.

Ruthika, a class X student, created a new meet record by clocking 12.35s in 100m at the South Zone athletics championships in Udipi, Karnataka. She also won a gold at the National Junior athletics championship in Guntur.

Suhitha Maruri is currently ranked No. 3 in the All India Tennis Association girls’ under-14 category.

3,2020/01/07,Facebook to remove deepfake videos in run-up to 2020 U.S. election,"Facebook Inc said it will remove deepfakes and other manipulated videos from its platform if they have been edited, but not content that is parody or satire, in a move aimed at curbing misinformation ahead of the U.S. presidential election.

Also Read The rise of ‘deep-fakes’ and threats to truth

The social media giant would also remove misleading media if it was a result of technologies like AI that “merges, replaces or superimposes content on to a video, making it appear to be authentic”, it said in a blogpost.

Last year, Facebook refused to remove a heavily edited video that attempted to make U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seem incoherent by slurring her speech and making it appear like she was repeatedly stumbling over her words.

“This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words,” Facebook said.

The company did not respond immediately to questions about how it would determine what was parody or whether it would remove the Pelosi video under the new policy.

Facebook has been criticised over its content policies by politicians from across the spectrum. Democrats have blasted the company for refusing to fact-check political advertisements, while Republicans have accused it of discriminating against conservative views, a charge that it has denied.

In the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, social platforms have been under pressure to tackle the threat of deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/pe5pqw/article26568140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgm-deepfakes,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-to-remove-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-2020-us-election/article30502095.ece
4,2020/01/07,The rise of the #MeTooBots,"When was the last time you received an email from a colleague or supervisor which worried you? One could be hesitant to report it to HR or anyone at all. Before #MeToo around the globe took off, many women said their in-house HR has not been able to ease their discomfort towards sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace.

That said, Artificial Intelligence programmers at Chicago-based NexLP are developing #MeTooBots which will scan official communications for inappropriate vernacular. The technology is hoped to be adopted globally. So, how would the Indian corporate scene respond?

What experts say

Mumbai-based Beerud Sheth, co-founder of Gupshup and founder of Elance, is credited with bringing in a new wave to India’s bot revolution. But even he knows that such a technology cannot be implemented and effective in impact overnight, but he believes that AI will gradually become more effective in handling many sensitive issues. He explains this space requires training for both humans and the AI, adding that any issue that the bot cannot handle, it can escalate to a human. “Over time, it can take on more responsibility,” he says, “Also, bots can harness vast computing power to do a first review of millions of emails that is not humanly possible.”

Much of what a #MeTooBot will have to do will rely on data, adds Jaspreet Bindra, a consultant in AI, cryptocurrency, and digital transformation. “AI accuracy ultimately depends on the accuracy and amount of data that you train it on. So, a #MeTooBot’s accuracy will entirely depend on the datasets it is trained in.”

Woeful numbers According to a Complykaro services annual report, Indian companies reported more cases of sexual harassment in the financial year of 2019 compared to a year earlier. In fact, data from BSE 100 companies, which are required to furnish this information, showed a 14% increase in sexual harassment complaints in 2019.

To get a bit deeper, let us look at language. Connotation in sexual harassment and bullying can be fairly ambiguous in something like an email. Jaspreet continues, “In my opinion, the bot will have huge problems picking up the nuances — for example, sarcasm. Take the example of the giant social networks — Facebook has had to hire tens of thousands of people, along with their AI, to try to weed out porn, racism etc from the posts that people put up. And we know that they are still not being effective enough. Pictures are another problem — if you think text is a problem, image recognition of #MeToo content will be an even bigger one. And then there is video!”

According to a January 3 article by Isabel Woodford in The Guardian, implementation will take some time. But the culture gap is where real challenges lie; nuances in language need to be learned by bots, which does not happen as quickly as we would assume. “MNCs, in my experience, will do what their global HQs direct them to. The challenges in the Indian market will be common to any other — with the added complication of language and culture. What might seem inoffensive in the US, might be regarded as offensive in India and vice versa,” explains Jaspreet, who has an extensive background in working with major MNCs in India.

This is no different from CCTV cameras etc. However, it is still critical to define privacy policies, to strictly adhere to them and to communicate it to all users

Beerud says there are four factors worth deliberation before implementing a #MeTooBot in the Indian corporate market, the first being that any such tool will have false positives and false negatives, and therefore, humans will have to supervise and train it over time. The second point is that for interactive chatbots, mismatched expectations between the bot’s ability and user expectations is a challenge. It is vital that the bot must communicate clearly what it can and cannot do. Then there is the third idea of user adoption and trust, which will take time to build, like any new product. Finally, the significant technical challenges in getting natural language processing (NLP) and AI working, as well as encoding the written and unwritten social rules into the bot.

Ethical or not?

Is there a concern around privacy? On one hand, a January 3 op-ed from RT titled ‘#MeTooBots that will scan your personal emails for ‘harassment’ are an Orwellian misuse of AI,’ elaborates, “Instead, it is an attempt to harness science to support the Culture War, to transform it into an all-encompassing presence in constant need of monitoring and scrutiny. This doesn’t just threaten privacy, but the legitimacy of AI.”

Beerud believes automated monitoring of business emails may be acceptable since employees are expected to follow certain guidelines for business communication. He adds, “This is no different from CCTV cameras etc. However, it is still critical to define privacy policies, to strictly adhere to them and to communicate it to all users.” Jaspreet adds that Google, in a way, ‘reads’ your email anyway. “No humans (at least that is what we know) read your emails but machines do, and that is why they generate relevant, targeted advertising. Machines (and now people) listen in to Alexa and Google Home. So, this is not a problem unique to this situation. Except that here, the employees will know who to complain to, which is their company HR, rather than a giant, faceless corporation. So definitely, there will be outrage of some kind,” he concludes.

However, HR managers do state that leaving it to bots, however helpful they may be, cannot be the only solution. While 2020 could be the year of more groundbreaking technology, nothing is more effective than speaking up and ensuring the offline workplace ecosystem is held accountable.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/kinsrp/article30501564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-rise-of-the-metoobots/article30501565.ece
5,2020/01/07,Nikon launches FX-format camera in India,"Japanese imaging giant Nikon on Tuesday launched its latest full-fledged FX-format D780 camera in India at a starting price of ₹1,98,995.

7,2020/01/07,Austria’s Kurz returns as world’s youngest government head,"The leader of Austria’s conservatives Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on Tuesday as the world’s youngest democratically elected leader, at the head of a coalition with the Greens following the collapse of his previous alliance with the far-right.

Vowing to “protect the climate and the borders”, the 33-year-old has become chancellor of the Alpine country’s first government to include the Greens, an arrangement called “exotic” and “unlikely” by Austrian media.

Speaking at a handover ceremony with his predecessor Brigitte Bierlein, Mr. Kurz said it was “good to be able to continue working for Austria” and promised: “We will strive every day to give our best.”

Mr. Kurz’s People’s Party (OeVP) and the Greens agreed last week to govern together after the last administration with the far-right fell apart in a corruption scandal. Both the OeVP and the Greens made key gains in September’s snap polls.

President Alexander Van der Bellen reminded the new government that “citizens have great expectations of you,” adding that “trust must be rebuilt”.

The government aims to please both parties by pushing for Austria to be carbon neutral by 2040 and also continuing previous strict anti-immigration measures.

Some observers think that if successful the alliance could become a model for other European countries as nations across the continent grapple with populist sentiments but also climate change.

‘Best of both worlds’

Mr. Kurz — whose conservative OeVP has been in government for more than three decades — has defended the undertaking as combining “the best of both worlds”.

The OeVP has 10 ministers in the new coalition, while the Greens have four with its party chief Werner Kogler, 58, taking on the vice-chancellorship.

Among the ministers being sworn in Tuesday more than half are women, including the defence minister. Many are in their 30s and 40s.

A Green politician and former activist will front an enlarged environment ministry, which includes traffic, energy and technology as well.

The Greens have also nominated an openly lesbian party veteran to hold the culture portfolio, while a Green legal expert of Bosnian origin, who arrived in Austria as a child refugee, will head the justice ministry.

No ‘love marriage’

But for all that’s new, it’s not a “love marriage”, according to analyst Johannes Huber.

“As he (Mr. Kurz) says at every opportunity, they are very different parties”, which have always been rivals rather than allies on a national level until now, Huber told AFP.

And their detractors are many, including some in their own ranks.

The Far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) -- the third strongest party in parliament after the OeVP and the Social Democrats (SPOe) -- was quick to denounce Mr. Kurz’s “swing to the left” and the “dangerous experiment” out of which “nothing good” can come for the country of 8.8 million people.

The SPOe too criticised the new government’s programme, saying social questions hadn’t been addressed well enough.

Mr. Kurz first became the world’s youngest chancellor in a government with the FPOe from December 2017 until May last year, driving a hard line against immigration and brushing off a steady stream of racist and anti-Semitic incidents involving his far-right colleagues.

But then the FPOe leader and vice-chancellor became engulfed in a graft scandal, leading to the collapse of the coalition and snap elections.

Disappointed FPOe supporters dealt the party a setback in the polls, many shifting their votes to the OeVP which won 37.5 percent -- an increase of almost six points from 2017.

The Greens, who failed to get into parliament in a shock result in 2017, garnered 13.8 percent as climate change replaced immigration as a top voter concern.

Party officials have said they have had to make “painful” compromises to reach the agreement with the powerful conservatives.

“The Greens are very pragmatic... It is important for the party to take on responsibility on a national level,” Huber said.

Mr. Kurz has promised Austrians a stable government for the next five years.

However, “the new coalition has not provided a complete answer on how they plan to finance their fiscal plans,” according to analyst Katharina Koenz of Oxford Economics.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yejmn5/article30506153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Cruz,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/austrias-kurz-returns-as-worlds-youngest-government-head/article30506154.ece
8,2020/01/07,ISI confiscates books on Zia ul Haq,"A Pakistani novelist and New York Times columnist said on Tuesday that security agents raided the offices of his publisher here and confiscated all the copies of his book about the country’s former military dictator Zia ul Haq.

The raid took place on Monday in Karachi, the largest city and key port in Pakistan, according to the novelist, Mohammad Hanif.

Mohammad Hanif, whose much-acclaimed A Case of Exploding Mangoes is a parody about the former dictator killed in a plane crash in 1988, blamed the Pakistani spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), for the raid. However, an ISI official described Mr. Hanif’s claim as a cheap attempt to gain popularity by hurling false accusations on a national institution.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ISI regulations.

The agents who arrived at the publisher’s offices identified themselves as being from the ISI, said the author, an air force pilot turned journalist. His Karachi publisher had released the Urdu translation of the novel last October.

“They asked about my book and took all copies of it,” he said, adding that he was consulting his lawyer about filing a complaint with the police.

Hanif rose to fame when the novel was first published in 2008 in English, two decades after Haq who was killed when his plane went down in eastern Punjab province. Authorities never released the results of their investigation or say what had caused the crash, which also killed US Ambassador Arnold Raphel and then-ISI chief Gen. Akhtar Abdur Rahman.

Hanif also alleged the raid came after members of his family sent a note to his publisher complaining that the novel tarnished the image of Haq, who seized power in a coup in 1977.

It was unclear his relatives would complain about his work so many years later but Hanif speculated they were unconcerned when it was only available in English but became worried once it was translated, presumably because many more Pakistanis would read it in Urdu.

The book cites a rumour that a bomb had been planted inside a crate of mangoes that were gifted to Haq and that was also aboard the plane.

Pakistan has witnessed an intensified crackdown on human rights defenders, activists, journalists and members of civil society over the past years.

Journalists, who have taken on military dictators and been beaten and jailed in the pursuit of a free press, say they now face a form of censorship that is more subtle but no less chilling, spearheaded by the security services and the ISI, to quash critical coverage.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/isi-confiscates-books-on-zia-ul-haq-mohammad-hanif/article30506080.ece
9,2020/01/07,Sanchez wins Parliament vote to remain Spain PM,"Spain’s Parliament on Tuesday confirmed Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez by a razor-thin margin as Prime Minister for another term at the helm of the country’s first-ever coalition government since its return to democracy in the 1970s.

Mr. Sanchez, who has stayed on as a caretaker premier, won 167 votes in the 350-seat Assembly compared to 165 against, with a decisive 18 abstentions by Catalan and Basque separatist MPs.

He plans to form a minority coalition government with hard-left party Podemos this time around, in what would be the first coalition government in Spain since the country returned to democracy following the death of longtime dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.

10,2020/01/07,TNA cautions Gotabaya against ‘majoritarianism’,"Sri Lanka’s main Tamil party on Tuesday urged President Gotabaya Rajapaksa not to “regress into naked majoritarianism”, that in the past gave rise to a conflict, resulting in armed hostilities spanning over three decades.

Addressing Parliament, Jaffna district legislator and the Tamil National Alliance’s (TNA) spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said the equal status of peoples belonging to different races, religions, languages and cultures is not dependent on their respective numerical strength. “This principle must be acknowledged if our democracy is to survive and indeed flourish, and not regress into naked majoritarianism. Regretfully, in his address to Parliament on 3rd January 2020, the President has articulated such a regressive position,” he said, intervening in the debate on Mr. Rajapaksa’s inaugural address.

Referring to the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948, “a rank majoritarian act” that denied Indian origin Tamils citizenship, the Sinhala only Act of 1956, and the two republican “majoritarian” constitutions enacted in 1972 and 1978, Mr. Sumanthiran said it was only after the ‘Black July’, the brutal anti-Tamil pogrom in 1983, that India intervened to “turn the tide”.

13th Amendment

The subsequent constitutional amendment — popularly known as the 13th Amendment that came out of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 — acknowledged diversity in the country and led to the creation of provincial councils to help minority communities exercise a measure of self-governance. Referring to several past initiatives towards a political solution to the Tamil national question, the Tamil parliamentarian said PM Mahinda Rajapaksa assured India at least thrice — when he was President earlier — that he would “implement the 13th Amendment in full and build upon it so as to achieve meaningful devolution.

In his January 3 address, President Rajapaksa sought constitutional and electoral reform for “a strong executive and legislature” and sovereignty of the people. He pledged to “always defend” the unitary status of the country, and “protect and nurture the Buddha Sasana whilst safeguarding the right of all citizens to practice a religion of their choice.” He made no reference to pending concerns of the war-affected Tamil community, or the Tamil people’s long-standing demand of power devolution.

However, welcoming President Rajapaksa’s proposal for a new constitution, Mr. Sumanthiran said considerable drafting work had been done during the predecessor government’s time in office, with the full participation of all parties, including Mr. Rajapaksa’s. “We still have some distance to go, and that is the direction we must continue in if the country is to prosper.

11,2020/01/07,"Cultural sites won’t be hit, says Pentagon","The Pentagon on Monday distanced itself from President Donald Trump’s assertions that he would bomb Iranian cultural sites despite international prohibitions on such attacks.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the U.S. will “follow the laws of armed conflict.” When asked if that ruled out targeting cultural sites, Mr. Esper said pointedly, “That’s the laws of armed conflict.”

The split between the president and his Pentagon chief came amid heightened tensions with Tehran following a U.S. drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Mr. Trump had twice warned that he would hit Iranian cultural sites if Tehran retaliates against the U.S.

Mr. Esper’s public comments reflected the private concerns of other defense and military officials, who cited legal prohibitions on attacks on civilian, cultural and religious sites, except under certain, threatening circumstances.

Mr. Trump first raised the prospect of targeting cultural sites in a tweet on Saturday and reiterated that view to reporters the next day.

""We have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,” he tweeted.

""They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people,” he told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One. “And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way.”

By international law, however, it does.

Specifically, the 1954 Hague Convention says nations must “take all possible steps” to protect cultural property and shall refrain “from any act of hostility, directed against such property.” It also says nations must not use cultural sites for any threatening purposes that would make such locations a military target.

The Pentagon has long had a list of potential targets both inside Iran as well as those associated with Iran throughout the Middle East. Those targets and war plans are routinely updated, including during the recent uptick in hostilities.

Officials won’t discuss the list, but it is certain to include an array of Iranian military sites and capabilities, including missile, air defence and command and control locations.

Any targets would go through a lengthy vetting process within the military and the Pentagon to determine that they are legal, appropriate and proportionate to any Iranian action. Only after that process is complete would a list of potential sites go before the president for approval.

Outside the Pentagon, Trump’s threats were met with condemnation.

""It shows that he is somewhat deranged about this,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. “The pledge to attack cultural sites, likely, is a violation of international law.”

Mr. Kaine said that all Trump is doing “is escalating tensions and he seems to believe, ‘I can strike you, but you can’t strike me.’ That’s not the way the world works.” He added that Trump needs to confer with Congress.

The threats also drew reaction from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""The targeting of sites of global cultural heritage is abhorrent to the collective values of our society,” museum leaders said in a statement. “At this challenging time, we must remind ourselves of the global importance of protecting cultural sites the objects and places by which individuals, communities, and nations connect to their history and heritage.

Ahead of Mr. Esper’s comments, other administration officials made similar efforts to distance themselves from Trump without directly contradicting him.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that any U.S. military strikes inside Iran would be legal.

""We’ll behave inside the system,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We always have and we always will.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cultural-sites-wont-be-hit-says-pentagon/article30505933.ece
12,2020/01/07,"Five years on from Charlie Hebdo attacks, France pays homage","Staff at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Tuesday stood in silence outside their former offices where, five years ago, Islamist gunmen began a three-day rampage in which they killed 17 people.

The magazine, which had angered Muslims by publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, was adopted after the attack as a symbol of free speech and the slogan “Je suis Charlie,” or ”I am Charlie,” spread round the world.

Also read | Editorial: The attack on Charlie Hebdo

The fifth anniversary has taken on fresh relevance this year because the first trial of people accused of involvement in the attacks is to begin later this year.

In Tuesday’s ceremony, staff who survived the attack stood in the street outside as a bugler played the last post.

Among them was Laurent Sourisseau, a caricaturist who suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder. He has since become the magazine's publishing director.

Also at the ceremony were the Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, and Francois Hollande, French President at the time.

On January 7, 2015, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi had burst into the magazine's offices and opened fire with automatic weapons, killing 12 people and wounding several others.

They then ran out into the street and, a few metres (yards) away were challenged by a police officer, Lieutenant Ahmet Merabet. He was shot dead.

On January 8 an accomplice of the brothers, Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge and a day later, stormed a kosher supermarket east of Paris and killed four customers.

Wreath-laying ceremonies were held on Tuesday at the spot where Mr. Merabet was killed, and outside the kosher supermarket.

All three attackers were killed by police in different standoffs on January 9. The magazine has since moved to new premises.

The trial is due to begin later this year of 14 people alleged by prosecutors to have been accessories to the attack. They have been charged with financing terrorism, membership of a terrorist organisation, and supplying weapons.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6u4klm/article30503937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANEATTACKANNIVERSARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/five-years-on-from-charlie-hebdo-attacks-france-pays-homage/article30503938.ece
13,2020/01/07,"U.S.-Iran unrest: Britain, France, Germany meet in Brussels for crisis Iran talks","The British, French and German Foreign Ministers meet in Brussels on Tuesday to hold urgent talks over Iran as they prepare their reaction after Tehran's decision to scrap the nuclear enrichment limits under a 2015 accord.

The Ministers had already been scheduled to meet with their Italian counterpart to discuss the crisis in Libya, but opted to hold separate discussions on Iran amid the crisis that erupted following the U.S. killing of an Iranian General.

Iran said on Sunday that it would scrap limits on enriching uranium, taking a further step back from the 2015 agreement with six major powers, which Washington abandoned in 2018 but the European countries are trying to salvage.

Britain’s Foreign Office said the E3 - Britain, France and Germany, would meet to discuss ways to defuse tensions between the United States and Iran.

“The talks will also cover the nuclear deal following Irans latest announcement on Sunday that it is withdrawing from further commitments in the deal,” a British Foreign Office spokesman said. A French diplomatic source confirmed the talks.

France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday the substance of the Iran nuclear deal was slowly disappearing and European powers would decide in coming days whether to launch a dispute resolution process over Iranian violations. Diplomats told Reuters on Monday that the European parties to the deal would launch the process this week.

The bloc's 28 Ministers meet on Friday in Brussels to discuss the Iran crisis.

“It is imperative that we find a way to de-escalate things,” France's junior Foreign Affairs Minister told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.

14,2020/01/07,U.S.-Iran unrest: Germany to cut troop numbers in Iraq after Soleimani killing,"Germany is moving some of its military personnel from Iraq to neighbouring countries over security concerns, the government said, days after the killing of a top Iranian military commander in a U.S. drone strike.

Slovakia meanwhile said it had temporarily relocated its seven soldiers from Iraq, who are part of a NATO training mission, as tensions in the region rise.

About 30 of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq who mainly train Iraqi security forces will be redeployed to Jordan and Kuwait, the German government told Parliament in a letter on Monday.

Iraq’s Parliament called on Sunday for the United States and other foreign troops to leave after Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at a Baghdad airport.

The drawdown of German troops was ordered by the U.S.-led joint command for fighting Islamic State, the German government said. This would apply mainly to troops in Baghdad and Taji, a city just north of the Iraqi capital where close to 30 German troops are deployed.

Out of the 120 German soldiers, about 90 are stationed in the Kurdish area in the north of the country.

The German government said the forces could be moved back to Iraq if their training mission resumes.

Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told public broadcaster ZDF he was concerned about a possible resurgence of Islamic State should foreign troops leave Iraq quickly. “Nobody really wants that,” he said.

Slovakia said it had removed its seven soldiers from Iraq temporarily.

“In view of the current situation in Iraq, which has led to the suspension of activities of the NATO training mission, the temporary relocation of seven Slovak soldiers outside the country was carried out in accordance with security rules,” Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said in a statement.

15,2020/01/07,At least 50 killed in stampede at Soleimani’s funeral in Iran,"A stampede broke out on January 7 at the funeral of a top Iranian General killed in a U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad airport in Iraq, leaving more than 50 people dead and many injured as huge crowds packed his hometown.

The tragedy in the southeastern city of Kerman came as Iran prepared to bury Revolutionary Guards Commander, Qassem Soleimani, a hugely popular figure in the Islamic republic. More than 50 people were killed and 212 people injured in the stampede, semi-official news agency ISNA said, citing officials in the southeastern city.

The streets of Kerman overflowed with mourners, while others took refuge on hillsides around the city, where the General was to be buried at the martyrs’ cemetery. Soleimani, the head of the Guards’ Quds Force foreign operations arm, was assassinated on Friday in a U.S. strikenear the Baghdad International Airport, an operation that shocked Iran.

Schoolgirls joined chants of “Death to Trump” from the crowd.

Tuesday’s funeral comes after days of processions through the southwestern city of Ahvaz and the shrine cities of Qom and Mashhad as well as the capital Tehran.People converged from afar on Azadi Square, where two flag-draped coffins were on display, with the second one reportedly containing the remains of Soleimani’s closest aide, Brigadier General Hossein Pourjafari.

16,2020/01/07,Pakistan’s National Assembly passes three Bills to extend General Bajwa’s tenure,"Pakistan’s National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, on Tuesday passed three crucial Bills to give a three year extension to Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

Mr. Bajwa, a close confidant of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, was to retire on November 29 last year, at the end of his original three-year term, but Mr. Khan gave the 59-year-old Army Chief an extension of the same length, citing the regional security situation, through a notification on August 19.

However, the Supreme Court on November 28 suspended the government order, observing that there was no law to give an extension to the Army Chief’s tenure. But the apex court granted a six-month extension to Mr. Bajwa after being assured by the government that Parliament will pass a legislation on the extension/reappointment of an Army Chief within six months.

The government, after initial hesitation, secured the support of the main Opposition parties and introduced three Bills in the National Assembly to extend the retirement age from 60 to 64 years for the Chiefs of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, and the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Committee.

The Bills were approved by the Standing Committee on Defence on Monday, paving the way for its approval by the Assembly.

Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak moved the three Bills — The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill 2020, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2020 and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2020 — for voting and all three were passed easily as parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People Party supported them.

However, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazal and Jamat-e-Islami boycotted the session to express their displeasure with the new laws.

After the approval by the National Assembly, the Bills will be presented in the Senate, the upper house, and are expected to be passed without any issues.

Once cleared by the two Houses, the Bills will be presented to the President for the final approval to be promulgated.

17,2020/01/07,"Geopolitical tensions at its highest this century, says UN Chief amid U.S.-Iran unrest","Amid escalating U.S.-Iran tensions over the killing of Iran’s most influential general Qassem Soleimani, the UN Chief has voiced concern over the geopolitical tensions, saying such conflicts are at their highest level this century and nations are taking unpredicted decisions that have a profound risk of miscalculation.

“The New Year has begun with our world in turmoil. We are living in dangerous times,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told presspersons here on Monday.

“Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century. And this turbulence is escalating,” he said.

Warning that even nuclear non-proliferation can no longer be taken for granted, he said the “cauldron of tensions” globally is leading more and more countries to take “unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation”.

Tensions have been escalating between the U.S. and Iran after Major General Qassem Soleimani, who led the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was killed in an American drone strike in Baghdad on Friday.

The strike was authorised by U.S. President Donald Trump. Iran has vowed to avenge the killing of the elite Quds Force commander, and on Sunday it indicated that it would no longer be bound by the restrictions on its nuclear programme, outlined in the 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal was debated in the Security Council just last month.

On Sunday, the Iraqi Parliament also passed a non-binding resolution calling for U.S. troops to leave the country, in a clear response to the killing of the Iranian general on their soil. In response, Mr. Trump has threatened Iraq with sanctions if forced to withdraw its forces, and also threatened, on Twitter, to destroy multiple sites of “cultural” significance within Iran , if there are reprisal attacks against Americans.

China’s Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun told presspersons that Beijing is following the situation very closely and the pressing task at the moment is to prevent the situation from further escalating and running out of control.

Regarding the U.S. pushing for a press statement on the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Mr. Zhang said China does not accept the U.S. accusation.

He said China firmly supports the protection of the safety of foreign missions in accordance with the international law, but unilateral military action undertaken by the U.S. has led to drastic changes in the regional situation.

The Chinese envoy added that action taken by the Security Council should reflect latest developments of the situation and help prevent escalation of tensions.

The U.S. Mission to the UN blamed China and Russia for blocking a UN Security Council statement condemning the December 31 attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. “Indeed, not allowing the United Nations Security Council to issue the most basic of statements underscoring the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises once again calls the Council’s credibility into question. Such expressions of support should not be controversial or warrant courage,” it said.

Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that Moscow strongly condemns the attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad, but the UNSC statement that was “nearly ready” was not taking into account subsequent actions like the attack on the Baghdad airport that targeted Suleimani.“We now have to talk about territorial integrity, about sovereignty of Iraq, about the need to de-escalate in the regions and prevent developments going down the drain, in the direction of a major conflict.”

Mr. Guterres told presspersons that amid these global tensions, there are trade and technological conflicts that fracture world markets, undermine growth and widen inequalities.

“Our planet is on fire. The climate crisis rages on. In many parts of the world, we see many people frustrated and angry. We see increased social unrest and growing extremism, nationalism and radicalisation, with a dangerous advance of terrorism, notably in Africa,” the UN Chief said.

He said it was clear that “this situation cannot go on. I have been following the recent rise in global tensions with great concern. I am in constant contact with leading officials around the world”.

The UN Chief had a clear four-point message for what needs to happen now, in capitals across the world: “Stop escalation. Exercise maximum restraint. Re-start dialogue. Renew international cooperation.”

“Let us not forget the terrible human suffering caused by war. As always, ordinary people pay the highest price.

Two of the suspected extremists were killed by the police, he said.

Since December, Al-Shabaab has increased attacks inside Kenya including Sunday’s attack on a military base that killed three US military personnel and destroyed five US aircrafts. It was the first time that Al-Shabaab had attacked US troops inside Kenya. The US on Monday said additional troops had arrived to increase security at the Manda Bay airfield in coastal Lamu county.

The US-Africa Command also said it did not assess that the attack was linked to Iran, as Middle East tensions are soaring. Al-Shabaab is linked to Al-Qaeda and has no known links to Iran or its proxies.

Under the newly adopted Bill, all U.S. forces and employees of the Pentagon and affiliated organisations, agents and commanders and those who ordered the “martyrdom” of Soleimani were designated as “terrorists"".

“Any aid to these forces, including military, intelligence, financial, technical, service or logistical, will be considered as cooperation in a terrorist act,” Parliament said.

Lawmakers also voted to bolster by 200 million € the coffers of the Quds Force - the foreign operations arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards that was headed by Soleimani.

22,2020/01/07,Australia’s leaders unmoved on climate action after devastating bushfires,"Australia's government is sticking firmly to a position that there is no direct link between climate change and the country's devastating bushfires, despite public anger, the anguish of victims and warnings from scientists.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Emissions Reduction Minister, Angus Taylor, say Australia does not need to cut carbon emissions more aggressively to limit global warming, even after a three-year drought and unprecedented bushfires.

Instead they say Australia, which contributes 1.3% of the world’s carbon emissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United States, should be rewarded for beating its emissions reduction targets for 2020.

“When it comes to reducing global emissions, Australia must and is doing its bit, but bushfires are a time when communities must unite, not divide,” Mr. Taylor said in emailed comments to Reuters on Tuesday, while he was busy at bushfire relief centres in his constituency in New South Wales state.

Stepping up efforts to cut emissions would harm the economy, the government argues, especially if it hurt Australia's exports of coal and gas. The country last year overtook Qatar as the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas.

“In most countries it isn't acceptable to pursue emission-reduction policies that add substantially to the cost of living, destroy jobs, reduce incomes and impede growth,” Mr. Taylor wrote in The Australian newspaper on December 31.

“That’s why we won’t adopt [opposition] Labor's uncosted, reckless, economy-destroying targets that will always result in a tax on energy, whether it is called that or not.”

Mr. Taylor did not detail exactly how cutting emissions would raise the cost of living.

Australians have complained that due to a lack of energy policy, power prices have risen substantially in recent years placing a heavy burden on household incomes, even as energy producers are gradually shifting to cheaper renewables.

Mr. Taylor's came in response to criticism Australia faced at the United Nations climate summit in Madrid for blocking ambitious action to cut carbon emissions.

Environmental groups say Australia will only meet its emissions targets by including old carbon credits the government wants to count from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol.

Scientists say climate change is a key factor in the destructive wildfires.

“One of the key drivers of fire intensity, fire spread rates and fire area is temperature. And in Australia we've just experienced record high temperatures,” said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University.

The burning forests are a double whammy for the environment, as they add to carbon emissions while also removing carbon sinks which will take decades to grow back, said David Holmes, director of the Monash University Climate Change Communication Research Hub.

Australia's bushfires since September have emitted about 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equal to two-thirds the country's annual emissions from man-made sources, estimated Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, based on data from NASA satellites.

To others, from opposition Labor to film star Russell Crowe, who skipped the Golden Globes awards to fight bushfires in Australia, to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the link is clear between climate change and Australia's fires which have killed 25 people, destroyed thousands of homes and razed more than 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of land since September.

“I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires,” Mr. Sanders said on social media last week.

Amid an outbreak of fires in several states in November, Labor leader Anthony Albanese urged Mr. Morrison to beef up resources to prepare for, fight and prevent disasters.

“The fire season is starting earlier and finishing later, and emergency leaders agree that extreme weather events in Australia will only increase in severity and frequency, due to climate change,” Mr. Albanese wrote in the November 22 letter, which he posted on social media.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ojxt4z/article30501689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THLTAUSTRALIABUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australias-leaders-unmoved-on-climate-action-after-devastating-bushfires/article30501690.ece

Hossein Salami issued the warning before a huge crowd gathered in a central square in Kerman, the hometown of General Qassem Soleimani, as they prepared to bury him.

Mourners in Kerman dressed in black carried posters bearing the image of Soleimani, a man whose slaying prompted Iran’s supreme leader to weep over his casket on Monday as a crowd said by police to be in the millions filled Tehran streets. Although there was no independent estimate, aerial footage and Associated Press journalists suggested a turnout of at least 1 million, and the throngs were visible on satellite images of Tehran taken on Monday.

The outpouring of grief was an unprecedented honour for a man viewed by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force.

The U.S. blames him for the killing of American troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before his death on Friday in a drone strike near Baghdad’s airport.

Soleimani also led forces in Syria backing President Bashar Assad in a long war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Soleimani’s remains and those of the others killed in the airstrike were brought to a central square in Kerman, a desert city surrounded by mountains that dates back to the days of the Silk Road.

Speaking in Kerman, Mr. Salami praised Soleimani’s exploits, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran’s enemies, Mr. Salami said.

“We will take revenge. We will set ablaze where they like,” Mr. Salami said, drawing the cries of “Death to Israel!” Israel is a long-time regional foe of Iran.

13 plans

According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans for revenge for Soleimani’s killing. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S. He declined to give any details.

Solemani will be buried later on Tuesday between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades. The two died in Operation Dawn 8 in Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq in which Soleimani also took part, a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the bloody war that killed 1 million people.

Police said they detained a man for questioning afterward but declined to identify him or provide further information.

The New Orleans Police Department said in a statement late Monday that officers were called to a Walmart in the city’s Gentilly district about another officer requesting assistance.

26,2020/01/07,U.S. denies visa to Iran Foreign Minister to attend UN meet,"The United States has denied a visa to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif that would have allowed him to attend a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York on Thursday, a U.S. official said.

Monday's comments by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, came as tensions escalate between the two countries after the United States killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad on Friday.

Under the 1947 U.N. “headquarters agreement,” the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says it can deny visas for “security, terrorism and foreign policy” reasons.

The U.S. State Department declined immediate comment.

Iran's mission to the United Nations said: “We have seen the media reports, but we have not received any official communication from either the U.S. or the U.N. regarding Foreign Minister Zarif's visa.” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric declined to comment on the U.S. denial of a visa for Zarif.

Zarif wanted to attend a meeting of the Security Council on Thursday on the topic of upholding the U.N. Charter. The meeting and Zarif's travel had been planned before the latest flare-up in tensions between Washington and Tehran.

The Security Council meeting would have given Zarif a global spotlight to publicly criticize the United States for killing Soleimani.

Iran's U.N. envoy, Majid Takht Ravanchi, has described the killing of Soleimani as “an obvious example of State terrorism and, as a criminal act, constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law, including, in particular ... the Charter of the United Nations.”

Zarif last traveled to New York in September for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations - after the United States sanctioned him for implementing “the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader.”

The sanctions block any property or interests Zarif has in the United States, but he said he had none.

Zarif also attended U.N. meetings in April and July. During his July visit, Washington imposed tight travel restrictions on Zarif and diplomats at Iran's mission to the United Nations, confining them to a small section of New York City.

27,2020/01/07,"U.S. ambassador leaves Kabul, ends 2-year Afghan tenure","U.S. Ambassador John Bass left Kabul on January 6 as his two-year tenure as America’s top diplomat in war-torn Afghanistan ended. His departure comes as U.S. tensions with neighboring Iran have soared following a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed Iran’s top general.

Until Bass’ replacement is decided, Washington is appointing a chargş d’affaires to the post, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. Ross Wilson, who has served as America’s ambassador to Turkey and Azerbaijan, is expected in the Afghan capital in the coming weeks.

The statement said Bass “skillfully advanced the Trump Administration’s goal of reaching a political settlement in Afghanistan that ensures terrorists can never again threaten the United States from Afghan soil while leading a large diplomatic mission in the face of numerous security threats.”

In a tweet bidding Afghanistan farewell, Bass said- “My earnest hope is for leaders and citizens across this country to find strength in unity, put aside their differences, and work together to negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban. Afghans and this beautiful country deserve nothing less.”

The on-again off-again talks between the United States and the Taliban appear to have again stalled. The negotiations are a key pillar in Washington’s goal of reaching a political settlement in Afghanistan. The latest hiccup in the talks appears to be the issue of what a cease-fire or reduction of violence might look like if the insurgents agree on a truce.

The Taliban’s ruling council earlier announced that it would agree to a temporary lull in fighting to allow a peace agreement to be signed, according to Taliban officials. They have said that a reduction in violence is on the table as a topic. But the fighting continues unabated as the insurgents stage near-daily attacks targeting Afghan security forces and their allies, while the U.S. and Afghan forces conduct airstrikes and anti-Taliban operations.

Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been working for more than one year to get a deal signed with the Taliban that would allow Washington to withdraw an estimated 13,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The deal would also include negotiations between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government, opposition figures and other prominent Afghans. The Taliban however, refuse to negotiate with the Kabul government.

But the government side is hampered by its own unclear future, as definitive results of the Afghan presidential election in September have still to be announced, although Afghan President Ashraf Ghani claims to be the winner, according to preliminary results.

Also, the Afghan government and opposition politicians, as well as some prominent Afghan figures, have so far been unable to agree on a negotiating team.

The negotiations, according to Khalilzad, will decide the future face of a post-war Afghanistan and would tackle thorny issues such as constitutional reform, women’s rights, free speech and the fate of thousands of Taliban fighters as well as militias loyal to Kabul’s powerful warlords.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yq96h9/article30500361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AFGHANISTAN-ACTIVISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-ambassador-leaves-kabul-ends-2-year-afghan-tenure/article30500362.ece
28,2020/01/07,Harvey Weinstein indicted on new sex crimes charges in LA,"Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on new sex crime charges in Los Angeles, just as his trial on separate rape and sexual assault charges in New York was poised to get underway, prosecutors announced Monday.

The Hollywood mogul has been charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a news release.

“We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,” Lacey said in a statement.

“I want to commend the victims who have come forward and bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward.”

Weinstein allegedly raped a woman in a hotel room on February 18, 2013, after he pushed his way inside her room, prosecutors said. The next night, he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite.

Weinstein faces up to 28 years in state prison if he is convicted of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint. His arraignment has not yet been scheduled and prosecutors will recommend USD 5 million bail.

The news came the same day that Weinstein and several of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct converged Monday at the New York City courthouse where a judge and his lawyers handled the final preparations for his high-stakes trial on charges of rape and assault.

Speaking at the New York courthouse Monday prior to the announcement, Weinstein’s attorneys suggested they knew charges might be coming. They asked the judge for potential jurors to be sequestered partly because of the possibility that charges could be brought elsewhere against Weinstein while the trial was ongoing. The denied that request.

“There is a potential LA situation going on,” his lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told reporters after the hearing.

“We don’t know what is going to happen. We’re hoping not,” added another of his lawyers, Damon Cheronis. “We have no control over what happens in Los Angeles or anywhere else.”

Earlier Monday, Weinstein, 67, entered the courthouse in New York leaning on a walker following a recent back surgery. When asked outside the courtroom how his back felt, Weinstein responded with a thin smile and a so-so gesture with his hand. .

“Not so good,” he said. “Better.”

Inside, his lawyers and prosecutors spent the morning sparring about procedural matters, including how to keep publicity surrounding the trial from influencing the jury’s thinking.

In a brief hearing, the judge declined to gag Weinstein’s attorneys from speaking to the media — in addition to denying the motion to sequester jurors. The judge also turned down a defense request to call as a witness a police detective who had been accused of mishandling part of the case.

Across the street, actresses and other women who say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein dismissed him as a villain undeserving of anyone’s pity.

“He looked cowardly. He wouldn’t look at us. He wouldn’t make eye contact,” said Sarah Ann Masse, a performer and writer who said Weinstein once sexually harassed her in his underwear during a job interview. “This trial is a cultural reckoning regardless of its legal outcome,” she said.

Jury selection in the trial will start Tuesday, more than two years since the allegations first came to widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement.

Weinstein’s lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said she was hopeful a fair jury could be found that wouldn’t pre-judge the case. .

“In this great country, you are innocent until proven guilty, she told reporters outside the courthouse.

Weinstein faces allegations that he raped one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a woman, Mimi Haleyi, who had come to him seeking film work in 2006.

He has pleaded not guilty and says any sexual activity was consensual. If he’s convicted of the most serious charges against him, two counts of predatory sexual assault, Weinstein faces a mandatory life sentence.

For that to happen, prosecutors must demonstrate Weinstein had a habit of violating women, beyond the two directly involved in the encounters in which he’s charged. To that end, they plan to call actress Annabella Sciorra, who says Weinstein forced himself inside her Manhattan apartment in 1993 or 1994 and raped her after she starred in a film for his movie studio.

They also wanted jurors to hear from a few of the more than 75 women who have come forward publicly to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault. The first allegations were brought to light by The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017.

Prosecutors got permission from the court to try to buttress their case with four other witnesses: Sciorra and three other accusers who haven’t been named.

One of those women said she had an encounter with Weinstein at a Manhattan hotel in 2004. A second was to testify about an interaction with Weinstein at a SoHo apartment in 2005. A third was described in court papers as having had an incident with Weinstein at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2013.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/67mgiw/article30498136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harvey-weinstein-indicted-on-new-sex-crimes-charges-in-la/article30498137.ece
29,2020/01/07,Pak. arrests main accused in Nankana Sahib vandalism case,"The main accused in the recent vandalism at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab province was arrested and charged with a non-bailable section of the stringent anti-terrorism act and blasphemy, a senior police officer said on Monday.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore, where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

The suspect, identified as Imran Chisti, is the elder brother of Mohammad Hassan, who married a teenage Sikh girl in September last after allegedly abducting and converting her to Islam, triggering a controversy.

Chisti, a government employee working in the Fisheries Department, was arrested on Sunday for his role in the violent incident at the Gurudwara, Nankana police station Inspector Muhammad Jamil told PTI on Monday.

“We have arrested Imran Chishti, a government employee, under terrorism and blasphemy charges. He has been booked under Sections 295A, 290, 291, 341,506, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code and 7-ATA (anti-terrorism act),” the officer said.

According to the FIR, Chishti incited a mob on Friday in the name of religion and threatened to destroy a worship place of a minority community. “The suspect incited the sentiments of Muslims in order to have his family issue settled and created a law and order situation in Nankana city,” it said.

A huge crowd, led by Chishti, held a sit-in outside the Gurdwara against the alleged police harassment over the abduction and conversion issue.

31,2020/01/07,It is up to States to provide 10% EWS quota: Centre,"The Centre on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that it would be the States’ prerogative to provide 10% economic reservation in government jobs and admission to education institutions.

“Whether or not to provide reservation to the economically weaker section in appointment to State government jobs and admission to State government educational institutions, as per provisions of the newly inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) of the Constitution, is to be decided by the State government concerned,” the Centre said in an affidavit.

The Centre was responding to a writ petition from Supreme Court advocate G.S. Mani complaining that the economic reservation law was not being implemented in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

However, the Centre said its Department of Social Justice and Empowerment “has no role in deciding the reservation policy of any State government”.

As per the notification issued by the Department of Personnel and Training on January 19, 2019, persons whose family has a gross annual income below ₹8 lakh are identified as those belonging to the economically weaker section. It said the 10% reservation law was enacted to promote the welfare of the poor not covered by the 50% reservation policy for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes.

It has been nearly six months since a Bench, led by Justice Sharad A. Bobde, now the Chief Justice of India, has reserved orders on the preliminary question that whether a bunch of writ petitions challenging the economic reservation law should be referred to a Constitution Bench.

The court had refused to pass any interim order to stay or hamper the implementation of the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, which provides for the 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the economically backward in the unreserved category.

The petitions have, however, challenged the validity of the law, saying the 50% quota limit is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and the new law whas tinkered with it. The economic reservation was introduced in the Constitution by amending Articles 15 and 16 and adding clauses empowering the government to provide reservation on the basis of economic backwardness.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/20j4p7/article30506661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07EWSCOPY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/it-is-up-to-states-to-provide-10-quota/article30506662.ece
32,2020/01/07,Army gets working on Government Owned Contractor Operated model to improve efficiency,"The Army has initiated the process of identifying potential industry partners to implement the Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) model for its base workshops and ordnance depots intended to improve operational efficiency.

A Request For Information (RFI) was issued to shortlist service providers with experience in “warehousing, logistics and supply chain management” for Central Ordnance Depot (COD), Kanpur. Separately, the Army’s Master General of Ordnance (MGO) began evaluating the GOCO model for Army Base Workshops (ABWs) to drive “higher operational efficiencies” and PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd. (PwC) hired as a consultant to run this engagement is scheduled to hold conferences and consultations with the industry.

“The agenda of these interactions would be to understand from interested industry participants their views on opportunities envisaged and issues/concerns if ABW(s) were to be run under GOCO model,” a notice issued by the Army says and the last date to send responses is January 10.

The eight ABWs identified are located in Delhi, Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Kankinara (West Bengal), Allahabad, Agra and Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), Kirkee near Pune and Bengaluru.

The tasks undertaken by these workshops include depot level (D level) repairs and overhaul of T-72 and T-90, guns, mortars and small arms, vehicles, communication systems, radars, air defence systems, armoured personnel carriers and manufacture of spares (indigenisation) and overhaul of aviation rotables.

The GOCO model was one of the recommendations of the Lt. Gen. DB Shekatkar (Retd.) committee to “enhance combat capability and re-balancing defence expenditure.” Based on the recommendations, the government has “decided to disband two advance base workshops, one static workshop and four ordnance depots” and eight ABWs are recommended to be corporatised on GOCO model.

The RFI dated December 19, 2019 aims “to shortlist Service Providers of repute with experience in warehousing, logistics and supply chain management and the last date for submitting responses “will be six weeks from the date of posting of the RFI...”

“The selected Service Provider will take over present infrastructure and related services from COD Kanpur on “as-it-is-and-where-it-is basis”. Maintenance of complete infrastructure will be thereafter the responsibility of the service provider,” the RFI states.

The existing civilian manpower/workforce will have to be absorbed by the selected Service Provider, it added. The functions of COD Kanpur envisaged for outsourcing under the GOCO model include warehousing operations, transportation of stores and area maintenance.

The service provider should be an Indian registered company with at least 10 years of working experience in related domains and have an average annual turnover of ₹50 crore for each of the last three financial years.

The total range of inventory of COD Kanpur is about 4045 items and on an average holds approximately 70,000 tonnes of stores at any given point of time, the RFI states. It consists of different types of clothing, footwear, headgear and tentage items, camping items, kitchen equipment and supply dropping equipment.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6d6ppg/article30507353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-Armyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-gets-working-on-government-owned-contractor-operated-model-to-improve-efficiency/article30506622.ece

34,2020/01/07,90% of promises in BJP manifesto fulfilled: Amit Shah,"Alluding to the achievement of several of the BJP’s ideological goals within six months of the second Modi government assuming power, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said his party has given sanctity to the election manifesto by fulfilling almost 90% of the promises made in it. Mr. Shah was speaking at an event to release a book on Prime Minister Modi entitled Karmayoddha.

“You pick the manifesto of the BJP and you can see 90% of the work promises in it has been done. There have been issues that the governments were scared to take up. Be it scrapping of Article 370, Article 35a, giving citizenship to refugees, taking a clear stand on Ram Janmabhoomi issue, removing triple talaq — people were scared to touch them. But Modi has taken a stand on issues with clarity and resolved them,” said Mr. Shah.

“In one way, sanctity of the manifestos has increased. Media persons also started looking at it. On some issues, when I tried to deflect questions, they remind me that it is written in our manifesto. Narendra Modi has created a new culture that people see the manifestos as a road map for the governance,” the Minister added.

The Home Minister’s remarks are also important in the backdrop of the protests over the proposed implementation of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) following the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last year. While the BJP manifesto for the 2019 polls mentions a future implementation of the NRC, Mr. Modi declared at a public meeting in New Delhi that no discussions had taken place on the issue within the government.

‘Challenges faced’

Mr. Shah also went into details of the challenges faced by Mr. Modi when he became chief minister of Gujarat, with the BJP in disarray and the earthquake that hit the State. He asserted that Mr. Modi had removed three demons — appeasement, casteism and dynasty politics — that had infested the country’s governments in the past.

“People have appreciated it and re-elected him for politics of performance.. What will happen and how will it happen, what will people say — these kind of questions have been removed from the system...Narendra Modi government has never taken a decision to please the people. Earlier it used to be like that because they wanted to get the people's votes.

“We won the vote of confidence at the Bhatpara Municipality 19-0,” the State’s Food Minister Jyotipriyo Mullick told The Hindu.

Calcutta HC orders

The vote of confidence at the Municipality, which was headed by BJP MP from Barrackpore Arjun Singh’s nephew Sourav Singh, was held in accordance with the directions of the Calcutta High Court.

A Division Bench of Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Protik Prakash Banerjee on Monday ordered a meeting to move the no-trust motion against the Chairman of the municipality to be held on Tuesday afternoon.

“Voting, if any, will be held under the supervision of the [State Election] Commission’s representative,” the order of the Division Bench said.

The no-confidence motion was held under the supervision of the District Magistrate of North 24 Parganas. BJP MP Arjun Singh said that the none of the BJP Councillors attended the no-confidence motion as the party has approached Supreme Court against the Calcutta High Court’s order.

The municipality has 35 wards, none of which are vacant at present.

On the boil

Bhatpara has been on boil since the results of the Lok Sabha polls were declared in May 2019. Several persons have died in politically motivated violence. After the TMC lost the Barrackpore and Bongaon Lok Sabha seats to the BJP, the majority of councillors of the six civic bodies turned their allegiance to the BJP.

Other than Bhatpara, the civic bodies that had gone to the BJP include Garulia, Naihati, Kancharapara, Halisahar and Bongaon.

“In a little over six months, we have won back all the municipalities. The reason was that the councillors were forced to join the BJP using different arm-twisting tactics.

The two influential students’ unions demanded scrapping of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying they could not allow “illegal Bangladeshis” to flood the region and rule over indigenous people.

“The Khelo India events starts in Assam from January 10. We welcome the sportspersons and others but if Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits, there will be protests, but in a non-violent manner. Do not treat Northeast people as second class citizens; we oppose the CAA,” Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharjya, adviser to the AASU, said at a press conference in Delhi.

Sonowal’s betrayal

The two student bodies accused Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal of betraying the people of the State by supporting the new legislation.

Mr. Bhattacharjya asked whether the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah will allow illegal Pakistanis to enter Gujarat through the border “the way they are allowing Bangladeshis to come to Assam”.

“CAA is communal, it is a protector of illegal Bangladeshis. Anti-CAA movement is not anti-national because it is a national movement. CAA is against the Constitution. We will continue our non-violent agitation against the new law till it is scrapped,” he said.

Mr. Bhattacharjya said the AASU and the NESO were non-political bodies and “we are not aligned with any political party; we are fighting for the nation, for the country, for the motherland.”

“All political parties have betrayed and failed the people of Assam. A class X student was killed but the Centre and State governments, the PM and Home Minister Amit Shah are mum. They switched off streetlights and killed them, can you believe this? We need help, save Assam, save Northeast,” he said.

He said there were 33 districts in Assam and seven were exempted from CAA as they fell in the Sixth Schedule (tribal) areas. “If CAA is not good for seven districts, how is it good for the rest of Assam?” Mr. Bhattacharya asked.

Burden of migrants

NESO Chairman Samuel B. Jyrwa and Secretary-General Sinam Prakash Singh said the new law will only add to the burden of illegal infiltration on the Northeast, which has taken the brunt of such migrants from 1947 to 1971. “Sonowal was given a mandate by the people of Assam with the hope that he will implement the 1985 Assam Accord under which any illegal immigrant, irrespective of religion, who entered India after 1971 has to be deported,” Mr. Bhattacharjya said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ycykfs/article30506485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8TH-AASU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/citizenship-amendment-act-aasu-plans-protest-against-pm-modi/article30506486.ece
37,2020/01/07,Factional feud in AGP over citizenship Act intensifies,"An Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) faction supporting Prafulla Kumar Mahanta staged a protest at the party headquarters here on Tuesday after the founder-president of the party was denied space in the building to hold a meeting.

The AGP, an ally of the ruling BJP in Assam, has been divided on the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. While the party leadership has sided with the BJP on the law, the section led by Mr. Mahanta is opposed to it.

Protests erupted after Mr. Mahanta, along with his supporters, found the party headquarters locked in the morning.

The administration deployed security personnel as the situation seemed to go out of control. The group later decided to hold the meeting in a nearby hall. “The CAA is an open invitation to Bangladeshis to come and settle down in Assam,” Mr. Mahanta said.

Though the other faction, headed by AGP president and Minister Atul Bora, has said that it was against the CAA, it is on the same page with the BJP on the issue.

Phani Bhushan Choudhury, a Minister in Mr. Bora’s camp, said: “It was not a party meeting and thus had no significance.” He urged Mr. Mahanta not to indulge in activities that may harm the party.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nkmzq1/article30506457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TH-THGRP-AGP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/factional-feud-in-agp-over-citizenship-act-intensifies/article30506458.ece

39,2020/01/07,Dharna by guest faculty in Madhya Pradesh enters 29th day,"Besides teaching Hindi, Shaheen Khan, removed recently as a guest faculty member at a college in Katni district, for 15 years mentored students with their career goals, even lent them emotional support. However, never did she imagine that despite having a PhD and qualifying in the National Eligibility Test and State Eligibility Test, her own future would look so bleak.

“Should we focus on our own future or that of our children?” wonders Ms. Khan, the single mother of a daughter, a BSc student, and a son, in Class 12. Not paid a salary for six months, she has been left to grapple with the payment of ₹8,000 as house rent every month, besides accruing debts of ₹2 lakh.

Facing removal

The MPPSC has made 3,418 appointments against regular posts, both vacant and occupied by 2,300 guest faculty members, who were removed as a result. Another 2,800 guest faculty members, still on the job, fear more permanent appointments that may take their jobs.

Although the State government has provided them with an edge in securing a regular job, even assured them of an appointment — though ad hoc still — elsewhere, the former guest faculty members, who earned ₹1,500 a day, are demanding regularisation. The last such appointments (via regularisation) took place in 2007, and prior to that in 1993, sources in the Higher Education Department said.

Congress manifesto

As the dharna in Bhopal entered the 29th day on Tuesday, Devraj Singh, who taught in the Vidisha district, called upon Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party to keep its election promise.

“We will create a policy to regularise guest faculty members according to the roster. In case they are not selected by the MPPSC, they will not be removed,” reads section 17.22 of the party’s manifesto for the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha election in November 2018.

During a public meeting in Indore in October 2018, when a guest professor explained his plight, Mr. Gandhi said, “The party will attempt to remove this feeling. The manifesto is not of the party, but yours.” Back then, Kamal Nath, now Chief Minister, had asserted, “The party does not believe in the tradition of guests and contracts. And this is about justice. Just wait for some days, and you won’t complain any more.”

Long march

Around 1,200 former guest professors marched 170 km from Pipariya, Hoshangabad district to Bhopal, where they launched the dharna. Tonsuring oneself, a signature campaign using blood, poster-making, and staging funeral processions for government orders, have characterised the protests.

While Ms. Khan has not received a “fallen out” letter, most, including Saraswati Pandey, 45, can use it to seek appointments at other colleges having vacant posts based on merit, according to a policy promulgated on December 17.

Though Ms. Pandey, who taught music for 20 years, with seven of them as a guest faculty member, was removed, her husband, Ashok Kumar Sharma, a geography professor, has remained a guest faculty member for 17 years now.

“I will lose my job the moment they appoint a permanent professor on my post,” said Mr. Sharma, who has two sons, aged 18 and 12. “We will never want our children to become professors.”

Meanwhile, Anand Singh Chauhan, who taught in the Dhar district and has been participating in the protests since December 2, lost his job as he had been absent from work for more than 15 days consecutively. “Guest faculty are made to do menial tasks too as they continue working as long as the Principal wants, and they often work for longer hours than the permanent staff,” he said.

V.K. Gupta, a Physics guest faculty in Rajgarh district, said that while five of his colleagues were removed, four, including he, had remained. “There is no place left to sit in the staff room as our seats are now occupied by those who cleared the the MPPSC exam. They don’t even talk to us.”

‘Filling regular posts’

D.P. Ahuja, Higher Education Commissioner, told The Hindu, “The guests [guest faculty members] were appointed in a temporary arrangement on the posts, and in the next three years, we plan to fill all the regular posts.”

Stating that the government was not aiming at regularising all the guest faculty members through a “backdoor channel”, he said, “They can have a maximum benefit of 20 marks in regular appointments and there is no age bar for them in taking the examination.”

Though the government wants to consider only “fallen out” guests for the remaining posts until permanent appointments are made, the Indore Bench of the High Court in an interim order had it opened for all candidates. The government intends to move the court against the order.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dharna-by-guest-faculty-in-madhya-pradesh-enters-29th-day/article30506086.ece
40,2020/01/07,Watch | Deepika Padukone visits JNU students,"Bollywood star Deepika Padukone on January 7 visited the Jawaharlal Nehru University to express solidarity with the students who were attacked by a mob but did not address the crowd.

Editorial | The mask of anarchy: On JNU violence

The actor reached the university campus at 7.40 p.m. and attended a public meeting, called by JNU Teacher’s Association and JNUSU in response to the January 5 attack on students and teachers by a masked mob.

Ms. Padukone stood as former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar was raising slogans and left by the time current president Aishe Ghosh started speaking. Her decision to not address the crowd prompted Ms. Ghosh to comment, “When you are in a position, you should speak up.”

JNUTA secretary Surajit Majumdar said the actor came to express solidarity with the students.

Ms. Padukone is in the capital to promote her upcoming release, Meghna Gulzar-directed Chhapaak.

On January 6, the 34-year-old actor told a news channel that she feels proud that people have come out and raised their voice without fear, in reference to the protests against the amended Citizenship Act, the National Register of Citizens and violence in JNU. “I feel proud to see that we aren’t scared to express ourselves... I think the fact that we are thinking about the country and its future.... Whatever may be our point of view, it’s nice to see,” Ms. Padukone told NDTV India.

“I feel proud about it that people are coming out — be it on the streets or wherever they are — they are raising their voice and expressing themselves as it is important. If we want to see change in life and society, it is important that a point of view be put forward,” she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/414p8a/article30506175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEEPIKA-leavesjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/deepika-padukone-visits-jnu-students/article30506076.ece
41,2020/01/07,JNU violence: Vice-Chancellor not ‘governing the university but pursuing some twisted agenda’,"A public meeting organised by the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Alumni Association in Kolkata and a civil society body Citizen’s Forum for Peace and Democracy on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Vice-Chancellor of the JNU Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar to restore normalcy in the university. Albeena Shakil, a former president of the JNU students’ union (JNUSU), said the V-C is not “governing the university but pursuing some twisted agenda”.

“Till now the V-C has not once said he is willing to talk to the teachers and the students after so much of hue and cry. Rather he is asking the students to join the university arguing that the registration will be renewed [which the students have refused] as if nothing has happened. This is unacceptable,” said Ms. Shakil. Narrating how the problem snowballed over the last three months, Ms. Shakil said all along Mr. Kumar had refused to have dialogue. He even refused to attend the meetings called by the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry, she said.

“He cannot continue to do this unless he is protected by powerful people in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP. We also now know through media leaks how the last HRD Secretary was removed…at whose behest. The Home Minister is protecting the V-C and thus we demand his resignation as well,” Ms. Shakil said. Arguing that the movement is largely led from the front by women, another former student Subhanil Chowdhury said the message of the Sangh Parivar was “loud and clear”.

“Aishe Ghosh is attacked for a reason. To underscore that if women come out of home to protest they will be assaulted brutally so that they stop taking to the streets. It is commendable that within 24 hours after being hit Aishe Ghosh was out on the streets and said she is not leaving the fight,” said Mr. Chowdhury.

Former journalist Debasish Bhattacharya said the “silence of Prime Minister and Home Minister on the violence is condemnable”.

43,2020/01/07,"Exclusive | Five months later, government invites diplomat delegation to Jammu and Kashmir","Five months after its decision on Article 370, the government has invited the first group of Delhi-based diplomats to travel to Srinagar and assess the situation there, and is now awaiting a response from them.

Unlike the controversial visit of the Members of European Parliament (MEPs) delegation in October, which was invited to India by a British businesswoman and a think tank in Delhi, this visit is being organised completely by the government, including the Ministry of External Affairs, Home Affairs and Defence. According to sources in Delhi and Srinagar, security, hotel and travel arrangements are in place for the visit that is expected as early as this week.

The Hindu has learnt that the invitation has been extended to about 20 Ambassadors and senior diplomats from the European Union, Gulf countries and others to visit Kashmir, and government agencies have organised for them to meet with various civil society groups, journalists, sarpanchs, municipal councillors as well as local businessmen there.

Officials have already contacted many of the interlocutors expected to meet with the delegation, and the logistics of the visit will be organised by the Army. Several interactions are scheduled at the Badamibagh Cantonment area.

Also Read Terrorism an acute problem in Kashmir, say European lawmakers

However, it is unclear whether the first batch of visitors will go to Jammu and Kashmir as originally planned on January 9, and whether all invitees, particularly those from the European Union countries will attend. According to diplomats from at least four of the countries invited, none of whom agreed to be identified, the invitation has been discussed at a meeting of all European Union (EU) missions in Delhi, but they have not yet confirmed their acceptance.

“The proposal [from the government] is being discussed by EU members. We have decided that our response will be a joint one, common to us all,” said one of the diplomats.

When asked why there has been no confirmation for the programme as yet, a diplomat told The Hindu that the group of Ambassadors were not satisfied to undertake the visit on the same terms as the MEPs delegation were taken on, and wanted more access to their own contacts on the ground as well as a wider range of areas to visit. “Our response will depend on how much flexibility the government shows and whether there will be a balance of views taken into account.” After the last visit, at least one British MEP had expressed his unhappiness over not being allowed to speak freely to locals.

Officials said a wider range of interlocutors had indeed been planned, and different agencies had been asked to prepare lists well in advance for the diplomats’ visit, which had been due to take place shortly after the MEP delegation in October, but couldn’t be held. Many of the embassies in Delhi, including the United Kingdom, United States and Germany had expressed their displeasure over the fact that their diplomats had not been allowed to visit Jammu and Kashmir after August 5, despite repeated requests, whereas more than 20 MEPs, mostly belonging to opposition Right-wing parties in Europe had been taken there, and had met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar as well.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2xycva/article30505234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/five-months-later-government-invites-diplomat-delegation-to-jammu-and-kashmir/article30505185.ece

Four convicts in the sensational 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case will be hanged on January 22 at 7 a.m. in Tihar jail, a Delhi sessions court said.

Nirbhaya’s mother said that January 22 will be a big day for her when the convicts are hanged.

The order was pronounced by Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora who issued death warrants against them. The four death row convicts are Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Singh and Pawan Gupta.

‘Hope people who misbehave with women learn from this’

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the issuance of death warrants against the Nirbhaya case convicts has fulfilled a long-term wish of the people of Delhi and hoped that it would be a lesson for people who misbehave with women.

“The decision has fulfilled a long-term wish of the Delhi people. I hope people who misbehave with women learn from this, that they will not be spared and law will take its course in their case,” he told news channel Aaj Tak during his townhall meeting.

His deputy Manish Sisodia said people in the whole country had been waiting for this.

“People in the whole country had been waiting for this. It is a victory of the law. I am happy that hard work of her family, lawyers has paid off,” he told reporters at a press conference.

‘Justice delayed is justice denied’

The Congress welcomed the issuance of death warrants, saying it would give peace to her family and the country, but rued the delay in justice delivery.

Welcoming the order, Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev told PTI, “I feel justice delayed is justice denied. After changing so many laws, after the Verma committee report, still it took seven years.

“I heard somewhere that the government has said it will remove the right to appeal in a serious heinous crime. I feel right to appeal should not be totally done away with...but even in appellate jurisdiction in a serious crime like Nirbhaya, it should be time bound,” the Mahila Congress chief said.

‘Verdict will strengthen people’s faith in the judiciary’

The BJP said justice has been delivered to the victim and that the verdict will empower women and strengthen people’s faith in the judiciary.

“Justice delivered to Nirbhaya. A Delhi court’s verdict to execute 4 convicts will empower women and strengthen people’s faith on judiciary,” BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted.

The issuance of death warrants will restore people’s faith in the judiciary and act as deterrent to crime against women, National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma said on Tuesday.

45,2020/01/07,Supreme Court to hear ultrasonography matter on April 8,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear, in detail, pleas challenging a Delhi High Court decision removing the mandatory six-month training required under law for performing ultrasonography.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde scheduled the case for hearing on April 8.

In March 2018, the apex court had passed an interim order staying the operation of the February 17, 2016, high court order. The apex court had said prima facie the high court verdict transgressed into an area of legislative policy.

“The Training Rules 2014 were made by the central government in exercise of the power conferred by Parliament. Prima facie, the Rules are neither ultra vires the parent legislation nor do they suffer from manifest arbitrariness,” the court had observed in its interim order.

The apex court had also observed that the high court had “squarely impinged” on its November 2016 judgment in the Voluntary Health Association of Punjab case, which called for the strict implementation of the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) (Six Months Training) Rules, 2014, to bring to an end the social evil of female foeticide.

Justice Bobde also agreed to hear on April 8 a connected application filed by National Inspection and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) member Sabu Mathew George. In his application, Dr. George said a team of the NIMC, which is monitoring the implementation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, was prevented by local authorities in certain places, including Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, from conducting its inspection.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvg2qb/article30496646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-to-hear-ultrasonography-matter-on-april-8/article30504344.ece
46,2020/01/07,"Submit report on 'police aggression' in AMU in one month, NHRC told","The Allahabad High Court has issued directions to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to submit a report on the alleged police aggression in the Aligarh Muslim University on December 15 in one month.

Listening to the criminal writ petition filed by advocate Aman Khan, the two-judge bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Vivek Varma said, “The facts of the instant case indicate alleged violation of human rights and negligence in the prevention of such violation. We have not looked into the video footage, which is said to be available with the petitioner and compact discs, which are placed on record by the respondents along with the counter. However, the photographs annexed with the petition reflect certain serious happenings which are termed by the petitioner as brutal, violation of human rights that also amounts to commission of cognizable crime. The narration of facts certainly demands a probe.” The HC said for the purpose of the inquiry, the Commission should treat the memo of the petition for writ as a complaint submitted to it.

Reacting to the order Mr. Khan said, “We didn’t want NHRC probe per se, but relief is that the HC has kept the matter before itself after inquiry.”

Explaining why he didn’t want an NHRC probe, Mr. Khan told The Hindu that the body had not been found useful in similar cases. “We have the Manipur case regarding fake encounter where the Supreme Court observed that the NHRC was not up to the mark, using the term ‘toothless tiger’.”

He said the NHRC didn’t wield enough powers and that its maximum power was that of a civil court. “But still, considering the NHRC will submit a report to the HC for its perusal, we have hope,” said Mr. Khan.

On the HC mentioning that the Jamia Milia Islamia students and teachers had also approached the NHRC, Mr. Khan said the Court had found it more convenient because the Jamia case was already being looked into by the NHRC. “My reservation is that the AMU is closed sine die, and hence, many students who might be willing would not be able to appear before the NHRC.”

M. Salman Imtiaz, president of the AMU Students’ Union (2018-19) who is also a petitioner in the case, appealed to students, teachers, and non-teaching staff who witnessed the violence or were injured or detained on December 15 to come forward and submit the personal accounts before the NHRC. “We demand the AMU administration to provide us with the CCTV footage of the university campus of December 15. We will provide necessary assistance to the witnesses,” he said.

As per the counter filed on behalf of the IG, Law and Order, U.P., and the SSP, Aligarh Range, the contents of the writ didn’t depict facts.

Police bust human trafficking ring in Bulandshahr,"The Uttar Pradesh Police busted a human trafficking ring in Bulandshahr and rescued a minor girl who was allegedly being sold for marriage in the Ahmedgarh area of the district. Seven persons, including two women, have been arrested, police said.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), the 16-year-old, who hails from a village near Ranchi, Jharkhand, was being sold by her aunt at the Naurangabad village for ₹75,000 to a family from Khurja. “The police team raided the house of Savitri, after a tip-off that a girl is being sold. We found the girl locked in a room. She was shivering with fear,” said Harendra Kumar, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Bulandshahr.

Serving as hubs

Denying local reports that men were bidding for the girl, Suresh Kumar, Circle Officer, Shikarpur, said the girl’s step-aunt Kalawati brought her to the village to sell her to a family looking for a bride. “People usually consider Haryana as the hub of such marriages but we do get to see such cases in western Uttar Pradesh as well. Here too the sex ratio is poor and rural unemployment is widespread but gets covered because districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh fare better,” he said.

The FIR said wedding material such as a sari and a vanity kit was recovered from the spot. “Prima facie, Kalawati, who hails from Ranchi, made use of the poor financial condition of the girl, who had lost her mother, and was allegedly sold by her stepmother to Kalawati. She brought her to Bulandshahr to strike a deal,” said Mr. Kumar.

Mr. Kumar said that, after a medical examination, the girl was produced before a Magistrate and was taken to the District Child Welfare Committee (DCWC) for counselling. “Efforts are being made to send her back to her native place and she would be rehabilitated with the help of the CWC,” added Mr. Kumar. “The role of Kalawati is being further investigated to see whether she was part of a bigger gang operating in the area,” the police official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/iy9o3z/article24524582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/De24-Ashok-FARIG073S64423jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-police-bust-human-trafficking-ring-in-bulandshahr/article30504174.ece
48,2020/01/07,Amarinder disagrees with Jathedar’s remark on safety of Sikhs,"A day after Giani Harpreet Singh, acting Jathedar of the Akal Takht — the highest temporal seat of the Sikh religion — said Sikhs were not safe even in India, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said he did not agree with him.

Expressing concern over the remarks, Capt. Amarinder asked the Takht to put pressure on the Shiromani Akali Dal to sever all ties with the ruling alliance at the Centre, which had been unable to ensure a sense of safety among the minorities in the country.

If the Jathedar did feel that way, the Chief Minister said in a statement here, he should take up the matter with the SAD.

“Unlike Pakistan, India has always taken pride in being a secular nation, with no discrimination on religious grounds,” said Capt. Amarinder, adding that any feeling among the Sikh community that they were not secure here was a matter of grave concern. “If Sikhs are feeling insecure, as stated by the Acting Jathedar, then it is the dispensation at the Centre which is to blame,” he said.

Capt. Amarinder said given that the Akalis claim to be the custodians of the Sikh religion and the community, they should take a stand on the issue and SAD chief Sukhbir Badal should also ask his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal to resign immediately as Union Minister.

Capt. Amarinder said while some incidents here and there could not be construed to be a case of Sikhs not being safe in India, the perception was as important as reality. “The Sikhs had lived through a very dark period in the 1980s and any feeling of being at the receiving end in any way would revive their sense of fear, which would be detrimental to the community’s interest as well as that of the nation.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/kcfo99/article30503928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Amrinder-Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amarinder-disagrees-with-jathedars-remark-on-safety-of-sikhs/article30503905.ece

To boost domestic supply and contain price rise, the government is importing onion through State-owned MMTC and also facilitating private imports.

“We have imported so far 12,000 tonne of onion from countries like Turkey and Afghanistan,” Mr. Paswan told reporters.

“We do not live at the mercy of anyone... I will not allow anyone snatch our rights,” the CM said at a public meeting in Patharpratima, on the western fringes of Sunderban forests.

51,2020/01/07,All 4 Nirbhaya case convicts to be hanged on January 22,"All the four convicts in the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case will be hanged on January 22 at 7 a.m. inside the Tihar jail.

Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora issued the death warrants for convicts Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Singh and Pawan Gupta on a plea by the victim’s parents to expedite their execution.

Before passing the order, the judge conducted a video conference call with the convicts who are lodged in Tihar to hear their side of the argument.

The victim’s mother, who was present in the court when the verdict was pronounced, said the decision would restore faith of women in the judiciary.

Hours after the court’s decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “there is some sense of satisfaction after the issuance of death warrant against the convicts in the Nirbhaya case. It took seven year. This system will have to change. Such a system must be put in place which ensures that rapist are hanged within six months”.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) said the verdict would act as deterrent to crime against women.

The Congress welcomed the decision, saying that it would give peace to the victim’s family and the country.

The BJP said the decision would empower women and strengthen people’s faith in the judiciary.

On December 18 last, the Supreme Court dismissed a review petition filed by convict Akshay Kumar Singh against its 2017 judgment upholding his death penalty.

In July 2018, the top court dismissed the review petitions of Mukesh (30), Gupta (23) and Sharma (24), saying no grounds have been made by them for a review of the 2017 verdict.

A juvenile convict in the case has been released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term. One of the accused in the case, Ram Singh, died in the Tihar Jail.

The convicts can still move a curative petition before the top court against their conviction and death penalty. Once the curative petition, the last judicial resort available for redressal of grievances in a court of law, is dismissed, the convicts can seek a pardon from the President.

Article 72 of the Constitution says the President has the power “to grant pardons, etc, and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases”.

During the Tuesday hearing, advocate Vrinda Grover, who was appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court in the case, said both Mukesh and Vinay wanted to file a curative petition before the top court. She sought time to get required documents for the curative plea.

Advocate Grover pointed out that the convicts were not informed by the jail authorities that they still have the remedy of curative petitions at the top court against the death penalty.

The prosecution counsel, on the other hand, argued that there has been delay in the execution of the death warrant. Counsel said that even after the death warrant was issued, the convicts could exercise their remaining legal remedies.

After the court reserved its order around 3 p.m., the mother of convict Mukesh came crying towards the court room urging the judge to show mercy. The court, however, declined to entertain her.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/frx185/article30337448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-convicts-correct-order,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-delhi-court-confirms-death-warrants-against-4-convicts/article30503470.ece
52,2020/01/07,"NGT seeks information on solid waste management and air pollution in States, UTs","The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to obtain information from chief secretaries on solid waste management, restoration of polluted river stretches and air quality management in States and Union territories.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the nature and extent of information submitted by the CPCB is not complete and available information with regard to sewage generation and treatment shows huge gap.

“Grading made by the CPCB into ‘good’, ‘average’, ‘poor’ and ‘no information’ is not based on any qualitative analysis but extent of information furnished,” the Bench said.

On the issue of solid waste management, the tribunal said the information is required with regard to the quantity of municipal solid waste generated, segregated and treated and quantity of legacy waste.

With regard to restoration of 351 polluted river stretches, the NGT said the States need to furnish information about the compliance of directions, including in-situ and ex-situ remediation by way of phytoremediation/artificial wetlands, bio-diversity parks to reduce load on rivers.

“Chief secretaries need to monitor and compile information on the subject of execution of action plans for containment of air pollution in 122 cities, where air quality is not within permissible limits, in terms of orders of this tribunal and furnish the quantifiable progress/achievement to the CPCB,” the Bench said.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management is one of the most serious challenges to environment protection and although Solid Waste Management Rules have been framed in 2016, their implementation remains a problem, the tribunal had said.

The NGT had earlier noted that as per CPCB data, there are more than 4,000 legacy waste dump sites which needs immediate remediation under the rules and orders of the NGT having regard to harmful impacts on environment and public health.

“Besides, this will unlock the land occupied by such waste sites which is urgently required for setting up of integrated waste management and processing facilities or for afforestation/green belts/biodiversity parks/buffer zones in accordance with the environmental laws. If necessary, a part of the land could be monetised if so decided by the state governments concerned,” the NGT had said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/62gjh8/article30503272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YAMUNARIVERWATERPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngt-seeks-information-on-solid-waste-management-and-air-pollution-in-states-uts/article30503273.ece

Another mob outside the JNU gates had not even allowed ambulances carrying medical personnel to enter the campus. Eyewitnesses said the ambulances and doctors were attacked right in front of the eyes of the policemen.

54,2020/01/07,NHAI launches a drive to remove speed breakers from national highways,"The government on Tuesday said it has launched a special drive for removal of speed breakers from national highways to ensure hassle free movement of vehicles, especially at toll plazas.

Electronic toll collection through FASTag has been implemented from December 15, 2019 to provide commotion-free movement on highways.

“With the effective implementation of FASTag on toll plazas and conversion of cash toll lanes to FASTag lanes, the speed breakers/rumble strips constructed at toll plazas are being removed with immediate effect for smooth vehicular movement,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement.

Roads of different categories and under different situations are designed for designated speeds at which vehicles can travel with convenience and safety, the statement said. At certain locations, control of speed becomes necessary to promote orderly traffic movement and improved safety, considering the fact that national highways are designed to cater to high speed traffic without any hindrance. The drive to remove speed breakers has been initiated by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

“The speed breakers result in considerable delay, damage to the vehicles and significant discomfort to vehicle occupants and more fuel consumption due to acceleration and deceleration. This initiative will save time, money and facilitate smooth vehicular movement especially to ambulances and elderly people commuting on National Highways,” the statement said. In the larger context, this will also ensure avoidable wastage of transportation fuel for which the country is heavily import-dependent, and will also result in lesser pollution.

The government said positive effects of electronic toll collection (ETC) are being realised by the commuters on toll plazas. Introduction of speed breakers-free highways is another step in commitment to provide a safe, smooth and seamless journey to commuters on national highways, it added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aj1cqg/article30502887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHINAYASPEEDBREAKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhai-launches-a-drive-to-remove-speed-breakers-from-national-highways/article30502815.ece

More than 35 students were injured on Sunday when a masked mob attacked students and professors besides vandalising property.

The JNUSU has accused the RSS-affiliated ABVP volunteers of attacking the students. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has alleged that Left activists were involved in the attack.

“Bharatiya Janata Party believes in law and order. No worker or leader of BJP can think of such a thing or incite anyone. This is the work of the Communists, the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal,”, Mr. Rai alleged.

“The violence in JNU is only part of a conspiracy by opposition parties. I would like to tell them that the students are the future of our country and therefore I will urge Congress leaders and the likes of Arvind Kejriwal (of AAP) to not mislead the students,” Mr. Rai, who is the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, told reporters.

57,2020/01/07,Banking services may be hit due to trade unions’ strike on Jan 8,"Banking services at public sector banks are likely to be hit on Wednesday due to a nationwide strike called by 10 central trade unions.

Most of the lenders have already informed stock exchanges about the January 8 strike and its impact on banking services.

Various bank employee associations, including AIBEA, All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA), BEFI, INBEF, INBOC and Bank Karmachari Sena Mahasangh (BKSM), have expressed their willingness to participate in the strike.

Banking services like deposit and withdrawal, cheque clearing and instrument issuance are expected to be impacted due to the strike.

However, services at private sector banks are unlikely to be impacted. Nearly 25 crore people are likely to take part in an all-India strike on Wednesday to protest against the government’s “anti-people” policies.

Trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC along with various sectoral independent federations and associations had adopted a declaration in September last to go on a nationwide strike on January 8, 2020.

“The Ministry of Labour has failed to assure on any of the demands of workers which called a meeting on January 2, 2020. The attitude of the government is that of contempt towards labour as we construe from its policies and actions,” the 10 CTUs said in a joint statement.

Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Tuesday, the petitioner-in-person, Satish Bhardwaj, said a ‘separatist group’ called Kashmir Graffiti made a statement on social media networking site Facebook that they stamped the currency notes with slogans in August 2013.

Mr. Bhardwaj said that to his best knowledge and according to media reports, the notes were “defaced” with “seditious and anti-India” slogans. The group had even posted a video of it on YouTube, Mr. Bhardwaj claimed.

He said the currency notes were exchanged at the Jammu branch of the RBI.

“This is a matter of national interest,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Mehta, who was specially summoned for the case.

When the court asked whether it should issue a formal notice in the matter, Mr. Mehta said he would first look into the allegations made by Mr. Bhardwaj in the petition.

The attack on the students and the teachers “some of whom are women…is horrifying in its barbarity,” the statement noted.

“Such act of terror has no place in any civilised world, least of all in the sphere of learning. We, at IIT Kharagpur, feel this terror more keenly as we have also been part of various movements in the past.”

61,2020/01/07,"Govt. to lower quota for local officers in IAS, IPS in J&K, Ladakh","The Centre has decided to lower the quota from existing 50% to 33% for local officers from state services to IAS, IPS and IFoS in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, officials said on Tuesday.

The Personnel Ministry has finalised all modalities in this regard and an official order is expected soon, they said.

The move followed the nullification of provisions of Article 370 in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year, the officials said.

Earlier norms allowed the former state to enjoy 50:50 formula for the three all India services — the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS).

This means, 50% of the total posts in these services were to be manned by those selected through direct recruitment mode, on the basis of civil services examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and the rest 50% posts were to be filled through the promotion of native officers belonging to State services to IAS, IPS and the IFoS, the officials said.

After Jammu and Kashmir state was reorganised into two union territories— Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh— it has lost its special quota provision, they said.

“Now, the pan-India rule of 67:33 (i.e. 67% posts to be manned by directly recruited officers and the rest will be for those from the State services) will apply to both the Union Territories,” an official explained, adding that the Personnel Ministry will soon come out with an order in this regard.

According to the Jammu and Kashmir reorganisation Act, 2019, the officers selected through the civil services examination will now get the AGMUT or Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territory cadre instead of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Statistics Ministry had constituted a Standing Committee on Statistics (SCES) chaired by former Chief Statistician Pronab Sen to improve the quality of data amid criticism of the government over political interference.

66,2020/01/07,"Shiv Sena slams Modi, Shah; says such ‘brutal politics’ never seen before","The Shiv Sena on Tuesday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, alleging that such “brutal politics” was never seen before in the country.

An editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ further alleged that the BJP wanted to see “Hindu-Muslim riots” over the Citizenship Amendment Act, but that did not happen.

Since the BJP has been cornered over the issue of CAA, several things are happening out of “revenge”, it said.

Comparing the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students to the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes, the Shiv Sena said “divisive politics” was dangerous for the country.

It said the Union Home Ministry’s decision to file cases against “unknown” attackers at JNU was laughable. “Those who entered JNU with masks are not unknown,” it claimed.

“The fallout of JNU attack is being seen elsewhere in the country...what Modi and Shah want is happening. The country is in danger. Divisive politics is dangerous for the country,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

Terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008 were also masked and the same was seen at JNU. Such elements need to be exposed, it said.

“Allowing blood stains in universities, colleges and beating up of students and indulging in politics over the burning situation...such brutal politics was never seen before,” the Marathi publication said while terming the attack on JNU students as a “blot” on the law and order situation.

Lashing out at Mr. Shah, the Sena claimed he hid in Delhi and was busy distributing official pamphlets door-to-door to promote the Citizenship Amendment Act.

There is “confusion and unrest” in the country over the new citizenship law, it pointed out.

“The BJP wanted to see Hindu-Muslim riots over the issue, but that did not happen. The nationwide protests are not being done by Muslims alone. Hindus will also be affected due to the new Act,” the Shiv Sena said.

It said the BJP has been cornered over the CAA issue.

Since the prevailing situation is “BJP versus the rest”, hence “out of revenge”, several things are happening, the Marathi daily said, adding that “there is room for doubt if the JNU attack was part of the revenge.”

The BJP has condemned the violence and said universities should stay away from politics, it noted. “Who brought violence and politics in universities in the last five years? Who is implementing the policy of destroying those who don’t agree with your ideology by use of power?” it asked.

Without taking any name, the Sena said those who call students opposing the CAA as anti-nationals, are themselves anti-national.

“When Amit Shah accuses Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of inciting violence, he admits that the Gandhi siblings have that much power to create mass awareness against a law brought in by the Centre and bring people to streets,” the Sena said.

One cannot say if the Gandhi siblings incited violence, but one thing is sure that the Union Home Minister and his party are forced to distribute pamphlets to “clarify” on the new citizenship law, it said in sarcastic comments.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/y64gi9/article29812245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHIVSENA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shiv-sena-slams-modi-shah-says-such-brutal-politics-never-seen-before/article30501213.ece
67,2020/01/07,"Charges against student leader Aishe Ghosh, but none held for JNU attacks","Forty-eight hours after masked goons attacked students and teachers on the campus of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the Delhi police are yet to make any arrests in the case. Instead, they have registered two FIRs against injured president of the JNU Students Union (JNUSU) Aishe Ghosh and several others for allegedly attacking security guards and vandalising a server room on January 4.

The two FIRs against Ms. Ghosh and the others were registered at 8.44 p.m. and at 8.49 p.m. on Sunday even as the masked intruders were going around the campus beating up students, entering hostel rooms and ransacking them.

Faculty plaint ignored

No FIR has been filed by the police so far on a written complaint filed on Monday by a JNU faculty member, Prof. Sucharita Sen, who suffered head injuries during the attack reportedly carried out by individuals affiliated to the ABVP.

In her complaint, which has a copy of her medical report from the AIIMS, Prof. Sen has demanded that the police register an FIR that includes attempt to murder among other Sections of the law. A police source told The Hindu that this complaint would be investigated with a general FIR on Sunday’s violence against unknown persons.

The FIRs say a large number of student agitators, including Ms. Ghosh, Saket Moon and 18 others, allegedly entered the Communication and Information Services (CIS) office located in the administration block by “breaking” a glass door.

They trespassed and damaged the fibre optic cables, servers and biometric devices and “attacked” security guards, the FIRs say.

The police said the case was registered under IPC Sections 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation).

The first incident happened on January 3 and the second on January 4.

JNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar, who has come under fire for not meeting injured students or faculty members, in a statement, said: “Our heart goes out to all injured students. The incident (violence) is unfortunate. I would like to tell students that JNU campus is a secure place.”

Scores of JNU alumni, including Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury and Kanhaiya Kumar, all past JNUSU presidents, staged a protest outside the campus on Tuesday, demanding action against the masked goons responsible for Sunday’s attack.

Mr. Yechury, now head of the CPI (M), said Sunday’s attack was not a fight between two groups, but a pre-planned attack to terrorise the student community. “The targeting of JNU started with the appointment of this V-C,” he said.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Kumar said suddenly Home Minister Amit Shah had raked up a four-year-old case against him in which nothing had been proved. “They [the BJP] want to fight elections in the name of JNU,” he stated.

A growing number of celebrities have come out against the violence unleashed by masked hoodlums in JNU, with actor Deepika Padukone visiting the campus to express solidary with those attacked.

69,2020/01/07,Solidarity statement from scholars abroad condemning attack on JNU students and faculty,"This statement of solidarity was initiated by scholars abroad and in India who were shocked by the events that unfolded on January 5, 2020 on JNU campus. The statement garnered 8747 signatories, which included a wide range of scholars, writers, and members of civil society from all over the world. A selection of the list of signatories is included at the end of the statement below.

Solidarity Statement condemning the attack on the Students and Professors of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi on January 5, 2020

As teachers, researchers, students and concerned individuals in India and abroad, we strongly condemn the attack by masked goons (allegedly belonging to the ABVP) on unarmed JNU students and faculty on the evening of 5 January 2020 with rocks and rods while the police looked on.

Timeline of the attack and context

The JNU students have been on strike over the past few months against a steep fee hike, which will make the university inaccessible to the economically and socially marginalised sections. The unprovoked violence on the protesting students was started by the JNU security staff on January 4, who were ordered to break the strike. Later in the day, some ABVP activists were caught on camera attacking the protesting students. It was against this violence that the JNU Teachers’ Association had given a call for a peace meeting on campus on January 5, 2020. While the meeting was taking place, a group of masked goons from outside the campus started attacking the peacefully assembled students and teachers with rods and bricks. Eyewitnesses interviewed on NDTV suggest that more than 50 armed goons entered the campus around 6:30 pm.

Breakdown of campus security

There was a complete breakdown of campus security on January 5. Masked attackers were allowed to freely walk all across campus and systematically go from from one hostel to another intentionally searching for students involved in the protest against the fee hike. Videos have emerged from specific hostels with broken windows, showing large stones thrown around, and cars vandalized by masked goons. They entered women’s hostels even as campus security stood by silently.

News media is showing horrifying images of the attack on the JNUSU President, Aishe Ghosh — visibly bleeding and seriously injured. Currently, thirty students and thirteen faculty have been injured and are in the trauma centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). At least three of them including Ms. Ghosh are reportedly in critical condition. Media shared images of at least one faculty member, Professor Sucharita Sen who was also attacked and suffered head injuries.

Campus lock down and slow response of university administrators

Throughout the shocking attack, the JNU administration was extremely slow to respond even as students reported continued violence. Videos emerged from JNU showing very little visible presence of the police while the attack was underway. The Registrar of JNU issued a statement only at 9 PM, two hours after the attack had begun. The Vice Chancellor at the time of writing this statement has done little to reassure students or faculty of their physical wellbeing.

Why such violence? And why now?

JNU is a premier research university with a long history of inclusive admissions policies and a questioning academic culture. This attack has come twenty-three days after the police violence in Jamia Millia Islamia University, Aligarh Muslim University, and Cotton College against students and those peacefully dissenting against discriminatory policies of the government in India.

Instead of police, this time masked goons are deliberately creating a “culture of fear” on public university campuses. Except for one NDTV reporter, media was not provided access into the university. Yogendra Yadav, President of the Swaraj party, was stopped from entering the campus and was attacked for speaking to the media. Street lights were turned off outside the North Gate. Police inaction at JNU on January 5 enabled the attackers to proceed unhindered.

Public university campuses offer a safe, unarmed space for debate, discussion and learning for students from diverse regional and class backgrounds. They are the lifeblood of democracy. At a time when protests all over the country are emphasizing the need to protect the Indian Constitution and the basic principles of liberty, equality and the right to freedom of speech, the unprecedented attack on JNU students and faculty is unacceptable.

We are forced to conclude that the administration and the police were complicit in facilitating the attack.

We demand that the Registrar Pramod Kumar and the University Vice Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar take moral responsibility for their failure to guarantee the safety of their students and faculty. Such a total breakdown in campus safety is unconscionable. We demand prompt medical aid to those injured. We demand a fair and impartial inquiry into the events of January 5 that will hold the perpetrators of the attack accountable.

We stand in solidarity with our colleagues, students and faculty at JNU.

70,2020/01/07,Modi extends New Year greetings to Trump over phone,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump to wish him for the New Year, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced on Tuesday, in a statement that made no mention of the growing U.S.-Iran tensions and situation in West Asia.

“The Prime Minister stated that India-U.S. relations, which are built on trust, mutual respect and understanding, have grown from strength to strength. The Prime Minister highlighted the significant progress made in deepening the Strategic Partnership between the two countries in the previous year and expressed his desire to continue to work with President Trump for enhancing cooperation in all areas of mutual interest,” the MEA statement said, adding that Mr. Trump had “expressed satisfaction” at the India-U.S. relationship and spoke of “further deepening bilateral cooperation.”

According to a White House release, the two leaders “also reviewed regional security matters” but gave no details.

The call between the leaders follows a conversation between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar that took place a few days after the U.S. missile strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. In what appeared to be some divergence between New Delhi and Washington, Mr. Jaishankar tweeted that during the conversation, he had “highlighted India’s stakes and concerns” in the Gulf region, and the U.S. State Department readout claimed that Mr. Pompeo had discussed “Iran’s continued provocations and threats to the region”.

India had earlier expressed global “alarm” over the tensions following the U.S. action, and described Soleimani as a “senior Iranian leader”, whom Mr. Trump claimed was responsible for “several terrorist attacks, including in New Delhi”.

When asked about the divergences between the two statements, an MEA official pointed out that there had been no “joint statement” issued on the calls, which indicated that the Foreign Ministers may have simply “shared their perspectives on the region.”

India has repeatedly stressed traditional ties with Iran, and the importance of the Indian investment in Chabahar port project, which Mr. Jaishankar committed to expediting during a meeting with Iranian President Rouhani last month. After the killing of Soleimani, Mr. Jaishankar spoke to Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, noting the “serious turn of events” that had followed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/20vhco/article30500390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-speaks-to-trump-expresses-desire-to-enhance-cooperation-in-areas-of-mutual-interest/article30500389.ece

72,2020/01/07,HC asks Centre to fund care for LSD patients,"The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Centre to consider providing medical care to economically poor patients suffering from the rare Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD), a group of more than 50 genetically inherited and potentially fatal disorders, as an issue no less than a “national emergency” and come up with a concrete plan, within a month, on sharing the financial burden with the State governments.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad issued the interim direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society of India based in New Delhi. The judges directed the Health Secretary to the State government to meet the Union Health Secretary within 15 days to discuss the financial component so that necessary budgetary allocation could be made.

The economic model arrived at, during the discussion, for sharing the expenses incurred by the Government of Tamil Nadu could be implemented in other States too, the judges said. They wanted both the Centre as well as the State government to speed up the process since the PIL petition had been pending since 2017 and also because the discussions for submitting the budget for the next financial year had already begun.

After hearing Advocate General Vijay Narayan, Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan and the petitioner’s counsel V. Ramesh, the judges directed the Centre to also explore the possibility of encouraging domestic pharmaceutical companies to manufacture the drugs required for treating LSD patients so that the issue of unavailability due to the compulsion to import, and also the issue of high price could be addressed.

The judges pointed out that Article 21 (fundamental right to life) coupled with Article 47 (duty of the state to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health) of the Constitution makes the Centre as well as the State government obligated to provide health care to LSD patients, especially to those who were living below the poverty line and could not afford the expensive treatment.

The observations were made after perusing an affidavit filed by Health Secretary Beela Rajesh who said, the State government was not in a position to support LSD patients by providing them the prohibitively expensive Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). If such therapy had to be introduced at the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, all other government health care facilities would be affected and it would paralyze “medical service in Tamil Nadu,” she contended.

“Sanctioning any expenditure for a smaller group of patients of this kind will by and large affect the larger interest of the people,” Dr. Rajesh asserted. Though the Centre had come up with a National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases in 2017, it had been kept in abeyance until the framing of a revised policy. “At present, there is no policy existing for incurring expenditure for recurring involvement of cost for any disease,” she added.

However, all other supporting therapies, other than ERT, were being provided to LSD patients in government hospitals, the Health Secretary stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-asks-centre-to-fund-care-for-lsd-patients/article30497971.ece
73,2020/01/07,‘A sinister plan to divide nation’,"Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday said the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) was a “sinister and mischievous plan” to divide the country and was part of the efforts of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party to push its agenda of a “Hindu Rashtra”.

The “trinity” of NRC-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)-National Population Register (NPR) would directly affect the Muslims as any other community, even if they were left out in the NRC, would be included through the CAA, the Congress leader said during a briefing of presspersons at the party headquarters.

“The NRC is a sinister and mischievous plan to divide India. Under the NRC, every person residing in India has to prove that he is a citizen of India. In modern, liberal democracies, citizenship is based on the principle of territoriality,” he said. “Naturally, there is widespread fear and uncertainty among the Muslims of India,” he added.

“The NRC-CAA-NPR exercise is part of the RSS-BJP plan to push its divisive agenda of a Hindu Rashtra. The Constitution of India embodies the values of equality, equal protection of the laws, secularism, humanism and constitutional morality. In order to protect these values, every patriotic Indian has the duty to fight the pernicious doctrine of Hindu Rashtra,” he said.

Terming the CAA “patently discriminatory”, he said three neighbouring countries had been included, while Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan had been excluded and some minority groups, including Muslims, kept out of its ambit.

‘World of difference’

Mr. Chidambaram, who was the Home Minister when the UPA had updated the NPR in 2010, said there was a “world of difference” between the NPR of 2010 and the proposed NPR of 2020. “NPR 2010 was conducted in a few States when there was no controversy about NRC and without the unhappy experience of the Assam NRC,” he said. “NPR 2020 will ask for information on the last place of residence, the place of birth of the parents, voter identity, passport number, driver’s licence, PAN and Aadhaar. Who added these additional fields and why.”

“In terms of text and context, NPR 2010 and NPR 2020 are very different. NPR 2020 with the additional fields is a disguised attempt to do an Assam NRC-like exercise throughout the country and therefore, it must be stoutly opposed.”

Commenting on the protests over the CAA-NRC, he said thousands of people, especially students, were on the streets to protect the Constitution given by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Babasaheb Ambedkar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pv5s1h/article30497851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TH-THGRP-CHID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-sinister-plan-to-divide-nation/article30497852.ece

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a plea filed by the two challenging the SEBI notices for alleged violations in regulations. The first notice was sent to the Roys on February 12, 2015 alleging violations of the SEBI Act and Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations.

On August 31, 2019, the SEBI again sent notices to them alleging that they have traded shares of NDTV while being in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. Thereafter the duo sought for papers relied upon by the SEBI to send them the notices.

‘Abuse of power’

75,2020/01/07,Letter on US pullout from Iraq a ‘mistake’,"The U.S. military on Monday told the Iraqi government American troops were preparing to pull out of the country but a top U.S. general in Washington said the message was sent by “mistake“.

It came after a deadly American drone strike on Baghdad on Friday that killed senior Iranian and Iraqi military commanders, sparking fury in both countries with Tehran vowing “revenge“.

The head of the U.S. military’s Task Force Iraq, Brigadier General William Seely, informed his Iraqi counterparts in a letter dated Sunday that troops were preparing to leave.

“We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure,” said the letter, whose authenticity was confirmed to AFP by both Iraqi and U.S. defence officials.

Seely said the U.S.-led coalition would “be repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks“.

“In order to conduct this task, Coalition Forces are required to take certain measures to ensure that the movement out of Iraq is conducted in a safe and efficient manner,” said the letter.

It said helicopters would be travelling in and around Baghdad’s Green Zone where the U.S. embassy is located as part of the preparations.

AFP could hear helicopters flying low over Baghdad throughout the night on Monday.

But Pentagon Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley said on Monday the letter was a mere “draft” and “should not have been sent“.

“This was a mistake,” Mr. Milley told reporters. “It was a mistake, an honest mistake, a draft unsigned letter, because we are moving forces around,” he said.

“It shouldn’t have been sent,” Mr. Milley said.

US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the letter was “inconsistent” with Washington’s position, denying there has been a decision to leave Iraq.

The latest developments came as a sea of black-clad mourners paid homage Monday in Tehran to Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force killed Friday in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

Following his death along with Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Iraqi lawmakers on Sunday urged the government to oust all foreign troops from Iraqi soil.

Some 5,200 U.S. soldiers are stationed across Iraqi bases to support local troops preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State group.

They make up the bulk of a broader coalition, invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help combat the jihadists.

On Monday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei fought back tears as mourners flooded the streets around Tehran University to honour Soleimani.

The targeted killing of the 62-year-old Soleimani ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump saw Iran vow “severe revenge” and step back even further from the already tattered 2015 nuclear accord with world powers.

In an escalating war of words that has heightened international concern and rattled financial markets, Trump threatened yet more “major retaliation” if Tehran hits back, including strikes on Iranian cultural sites.

Writing in all-caps on Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted: “IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!”

IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2020

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned Iran must avoid “further violence and provocations” after the alliance held emergency talks in Brussels on the crisis.

“At our meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no-one’s interest,” he said.

The European Union, whose foreign ministers will hold emergency talks on the crisis Friday, said it was in both Iran and Iraq’s interests to “take the path of sobriety and not the path of escalation“.

Saudi Arabia — an oil-rich U.S. ally seen as vulnerable to Iranian counter strikes — also appealed for calm after a “very dangerous” escalation.

The EU’s diplomatic chief Josep Borrell said he “deeply regrets” Iran’s latest step back from the nuclear deal.

The agreement had offered Tehran relief from sanctions in return for curbs to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons -- but Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from it in 2018 dramatically weakened the agreement.

Despite its latest step, Iran insisted it will continue to fully cooperate with the UN agency overseeing its atomic programme.

The raw emotions sparked by the killing of Soleimani were on full display in Tehran, where mourners formed a sea of black, dotted with red Shiite flags and white signs, in what state television said was a “several million-strong” turnout.

“The last time I remember such a crowd was at Ayatollah Khomeini’s funeral 30 years ago,” said Iranian journalist Maziar Khosravi.

As they marched down a main artery of Tehran, the mourners chanted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel“.

Mr. Soleimani was one of Iran’s most popular public figures, seen as a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

He will be laid to rest in his hometown Kerman on Tuesday next to a war veteran he used to fight alongside with.

Khamenei was flanked by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top political and military figures as well as the slain general’s replacement as Quds commander, Esmail Qaani.

Trump on Saturday issued a U.S. strike list of 52 targets in the Islamic republic.

“Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655 Never threaten the Iranian nation,” Mr. Rouhani tweeted, referring to 290 lives lost in July 1988 when a U.S. warship shot down an Iran Air plane in the Gulf.

Trump said his figure of 52 targets represented the number of Americans held hostage at the US embassy in Tehran for more than a year starting in late 1979.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8sc5gu/article30446027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31IN-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/letter-on-us-pullout-from-iraq-a-mistake/article30499629.ece

77,2020/01/07,Attack on JNU students well-planned conspiracy:Union Minister,"Union Minister V. Muraleedharan on Monday claimed that the attack on students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi by a masked gang was a well-planned conspiracy, even as the Congress in Kerala hit out at the BJP saying it cannot always suppress dissenting voices.

Mr. Muraleedharan, the lone Kerala union minister, alleged that there was a conspiracy to malign the country’s universities.

“The violence inside the JNU campus was a well-planned conspiracy. This was a conspiracy to malign universities of the country saying campuses are marred by violence,” Muraleedharan told the media here.

He also alleged that the marxist party has a history of unleashing violence and then portray the victims as criminals.

“The students of extreme left and the Congress are behind the violence. They want to sabotage the normal functioning of the campus,” the minister said.

However, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala said the attack on teachers and students of JNU by “Sangh Parivar forces showed the horror of fascism that has plagued the country.”

“The BJP must understand that they cannot always suppress the dissenting voices. The criminal silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah has encouraged violence,” the senior congress leader said in a statement.

He also cited reports that purportedly said the attack on the students and the teachers were provoked after two girls protested Shah’s visit to some houses in Delhi as part of the BJP’s outreach campaign on the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“At night, masked criminals entered the JNU campus and brutally attacked students including girls and teachers. The police were silent on providing support to the attackers,” Mr. Chennithala said.

The brutal assault of students shows the attitude of the BJP towards the university which had produced many stalwarts including Nobel laureates, he added.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also condemned the violence saying “Nazi-style attacks” on students and teachers inside the campus were an attempt to create unrest and violence in the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h4uuoo/article30497779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MURALEEDHARAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/attack-on-jnu-students-well-planned-conspiracyunion-minister/article30497780.ece

81,2020/01/07,"Dilution of Art. 370, CAA needed to clear out accumulated problems: Jaishankar","India should take a lesson from China in “problem-solving”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said. He defended the actions taken by the government, including dilution of Article 370 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as necessary to deal with India’s “accumulated” problems.

“The big learning out of China is that unless a society has the mindset to decisively address its current issues, it is not going to go up in the world. The more the Indian and Chinese systems deal with each other, a lot of Indians will pick that up,” he said, referring to how the Indian governments in the past had allowed issues like the Citizenship Act, Article 370, Ayodhya, the GST and “social and economic” issues to become an “accumulated legacy of problems”.

He was answering questions at the launch of a book on China, Pax Sinica: Implications for the Indian Dawn, authored by Samir Saran and Akhil Deo.

Mr. Jaishankar was asked whether the government’s categorisation of “dissenters, students and critics” as anti-national, and in particular the reference to students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) as “tukde-tukde gang”, was consistent with India’s democratic principles, especially when compared with China. “I can certainly tell you that when I was a student, we did not see any tukde-tukde gang,” Mr. Jaishankar, himself an alumnus of the JNU during the 1970s and the Emergency, said, using the pejorative term popularised by the ruling BJP to portray the protesting students and Opposition members as “anti-national”.

On Sunday, Mr. Jaishankar condemned the violence on the JNU campus, and said it was “against the tradition and culture” of the university.

In a direct swipe at the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in particular former National Security Adviser and Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon, Mr. Jaishankar said the joint statements with Pakistan on terrorism signed at Sharm El Sheikh in 2011, as well as the anti-terror mechanism agreed to in Havana in 2006, were the outcome of a “lack of strategic clarity”. His words are believed to have been a riposte to Mr. Menon, who had said at a public hearing last week that the Modi government’s actions were leaving India “diplomatically isolated”.

To a question, Mr. Jaishankar denied that the government’s invitation to Pakistan investigators, including intelligence officials, to the Pathankot airforce base after the 2016 terror attack was a lapse. He said the Modi government had always been clear about who the victim was and who the perpetrator of terror was. “Even the Pakistanis accepted who was behind the Pathankot attack. The investigation happened so as to pressurise Pakistan into taking action. The government has always been clear who the victim is and who the perpetrator of terror is,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x929wu/article30497670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07JAISHANKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dilution-of-art-370-caa-needed-to-clear-out-accumulated-problems-jaishankar/article30497671.ece

All tourist spots including Borra Caves, Padmapuram gardens, Chaparai, Araku Museum and Katika waterfalls, which are managed by both private agencies and the government, remained closed from Monday morning. Lambasingi too wore a dull look with few tourists being allowed to the area.

Many visitors, who started for the Agency areas on Monday unaware of the bandh, were forced to return to Vizag as protesters closed roads and staged a ‘rasta roko’. According to locals, tourists leaving Araku through S. Kota route were stopped at Chakaligedda area, while tourists going to Paderu and Lambasingi were stopped near V. Madugula and Narsipatnam routes respectively. All hotels, commercial establishments and markets also remained closed since the last 48 hours following bandh call.

It was learnt that most of the hotel managements and cab drivers informed tourists who were in the Agency areas on Sunday about the bandh. Most of the tourists left the tourist spots by Sunday evening or Monday morning.

Many tourists from neighbouring districts and States who reached Visakhapatnam were left disappointed after coming to know about the bandh.

“We are really disappointed to know of the bandh. My children were very eager to visit Lambasingi as single-digit temperatures are recorded there in winter. We knew that there is a nationwide bandh on January 8, but were unaware of this bandh call,” said M.K. Raju, a tourist from Rajahmundry, who came to Visakhapatnam along with his family.

Dileep Padhi, a tourist from Berhampur, said: “Our plan was to tour Visakhapatnam and Agency areas like Araku and Lambasingi. After coming to the city on Sunday, we came to know about the bandh. So we have dropped our plans to tour the Agency and are instead planning to visit temples in Srikakulam district on the advice of our cab driver.”

Adinarayana Reddy on Tuesday, accusing him of usurping ₹700 crore that was collected as a deposit by the school management operating in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Mr. Madhusudhan Reddy also sought security, stating that he feared a threat to his life from the former Minister and his family members.

Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Madhusudhan Reddy said that the former Minister was behind the alleged diversion of funds from the school. It was due to this that the school failed to repay the amount, thus suffering damage to its reputation as well as its ‘creditworthiness’, he said.

Mr. Madhusudhan Reddy said that Mr. Adinarayana Reddy, with the support of party general secretary Nara Lokesh, had exerted pressure on inclusion of their ‘benamis’ into the school society, which was thwarted. Mr. Madhusudhan Reddy added that he accepted the position of chairman of the school management only after being promised by Mr. Adinarayana Reddy, then a Cabinet Minister, that the money would be repaid. “When I demanded payment of money, I was threatened with dire consequences,” he said.

Mr. Adinarayana Reddy was not available for comment. Meanwhile, Mr. Lokesh condemned the allegations as ‘baseless’ and dared Mr. Madhusudhan Reddy to prove the charges. “It is nothing but an attempt to besmirch my image, which the YSRCP leaders have been doing for the last five years.

Rao Committee to recommend the region as the Capital.

In a letter to the high-power committee on Tuesday, members of the group urged it to establish the Capital in Rayalaseema, considering the sacrifices made by the people of the region.

Former MPs Gangula Prathap Reddy and M.V. Mysura Reddy, former Ministers S. Sailajanath and R. Chenga Reddy, former MLAs K. Madana Mohana Reddy, K. Madhusudhan Gupta, and V. Shivarama Krishna Rao, and former DGPs Anjaneya Reddy and Dinesh Reddy were among those who took part in the meeting.

In the letter, they recalled the sacrifices made by thousands of farmers who had parted with their land for the Srisailam reservoir project decades ago.

“The people of Rayalaseema have sacrificed a lot. They let go the opportunity of having Kurnool as the Capital,” the signatories to the letter said.

Members of the G.N. Rao Committee and the BCG might not have considered the sentiments, sacrifices, feelings and rights of the people while preparing their reports, they said.

Jagan Mohan Reddy on the Capital issue. He said if insider trading, as claimed by the YSR Congress Party, had really taken place in Amaravati, why its leaders were silent for seven months, and why no cases had been booked till date.

The TDP leader said the decision on Amaravati was taken only after securing the approval of everybody, including Mr. Jagan, who was then Leader of the Opposition.

“People of Visakhapatnam have never asked for capital there. The Chief Minister is creating rifts between regions for political gain,” he alleged.

‘Flight of capital’

Farmers had parted with 33,000 acres land reposing trust in the then CM N. Chandrababu Naidu. Many buildings had been constructed in the area as part of capital development. Mr. Lokesh said big companies which were interested in investing in the State were now shifting their proposed projects to neighbouring Telangana.

He said police personnel deployed in the Capital region were asked to thwart farmers’ protests. It was unfortunate that the farmers who were fighting for a just cause were being portrayed as “hired crowd.” He said farmers’ protests would continue until the government conceded their demands.

Addressing the workshop on ‘Women safety – role of Mahila Mitra’, organised by Vijayawada city police, she said that the Bill passed in the AP Assembly recently was aimed at curbing crime against women and all steps were being taken to award punishment to the offenders in the time-frame given by the government.

Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, who presided the workshop, said that victims can send messages to Vijayawada city police WhatsApp No.7328909090, or dial 100, 112 or 181 for help.

Pat for Mahila Mitras

The Commissioner praised the Mahila Mitra groups for organising meetings in various educational institutions in the limits of each police station to enlighten the students on crime against women.

Another Disha Special Officer, Kritika Shukla, said Mahila Mitra should work in tandem with the Grama Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarshi, who has been appointed to address the grievances of women.

Praising Mahila Mitra members for creating awareness among the public on women protection, she said that Disha One-Stop centres would have police, legal, medical and other facilities to help the victims.

A Mahila Mitra member of Penamaluru police station, Lakshmi, said she had learnt a lot about the policing, the laws on women and child protection after joining the group.

Psychiatrist Radhika Reddy, who attended the workshop, stressed the need for change in bringing up of children to bring down the crime rate.

Cyber cell circle inspector Shivaji explained how women and girls were being trapped by using fake profiles on various social media sites. He cautioned girls not to respond to strangers online and over mobile phones.

“Of late, there has been a rise in cyber frauds and some strangers are trapping women online. I request the Mahila Mitra to enlighten the girls on cyber offences,” the CI said while presenting some case studies.

89,2020/01/07,Left parties gear up for national strike in Anantapur,"Five Communist parties on Tuesday gave a call to the people of Anantapur to come out on to the streets to support the nationwide strike being observed by all Left parties and Trade Unions against the alleged anti-workers’ policies being adopted by the Centre and the neglect of the country’s economy.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary V. Rambhupal, Communist Party of India district secretary D. Jagadeesh, CPI(ML) leader Peddanna, CPI-ML leader Tarimella Nagi Reddy in a statement asked people to oppose the policies that were taking away existing jobs and increasing unemployment, dividing the country on religious lines by bringing in CAA, NRC and NPR.

Massive protests would be organised at all mandal headquarters by the students, trade union leaders, farm labourers, political party workers opposing the slowdown in economy and reduction in allocation of budget for NREGS workers’ wage component. The agriculture sector was witnessing a downward trend and wherever there was good produce, the prices were so low that growers could not recover their input costs also, they observed,.

JNU violence

Communist parties unanimously blamed the BJP for instigating violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi allegedly through its student wing ABVP. “The incident displays the brutality of the government, backed by police,” they added. The police is directly under the control of Home Minister Amit Shah and he should be held responsible for all the violence, they demanded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/left-parties-gear-up-for-national-strike-in-anantapur/article30505577.ece
90,2020/01/07,Trade Unions gear up for nationwide strike today,"Several organisations including CITU, AITUC, INTUC and others organised a preparatory meeting on Tuesday to chalk out an action plan for the nationwide strike on Wednesday.

CITU State vice president D. Govidna Rao said that the Union government had diluted all 40 Labour Laws in the country and introduced four Codes without giving scope for the protection of workers’ rights.

All India Federation of Trade Unions State Committee Member Reddi Narayana Rao said that there would be a massive rally from Prakasam Park to Vizianagaram Fort on Wednesday. Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association State vice president M. Janaki Ram Reddy said that all the truckers would join the nationwide strike against the detrimental policies of the government.

Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police B. Raja Kumari has reportedly reviewed the situation and asked the officials not to give any scope for violence during the strike. Meanwhile, many educational institutions including schools and colleges declared holiday in the wake of the call for bandh.

Traffic on National Highway is expected to disrupted with the participation of truckers in the strike. Many lorries bound for long destinations were already stopped in several places including Itchapuram, Palasa, Pydibimavaram and other places.

The police department had reportedly deployed additional forces in sensitive areas like Pydibimavaram Industrial Zone to prevent any untoward incident.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rikb5c/article30505548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJVIZIANAGARAMSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/trade-unions-geared-up-for-nationwide-strike-today/article30505549.ece
91,2020/01/07,State fails to pressurise govt. contractors to use M-sand,"At a time when there was a severe crisis for sand in the construction sector, the government had been urging large construction groups to use M-sand or manufactured sand (rock sand) But ironically it did not put pressure on its own departmental contractors to use this sand for the government works.

The government contractors and departmental engineers are constrained by the Standard Schedule of Rates (SSR), which does not include M-sand. Unless the State government includes it in the SSR, none of the estimates can be prepared using this and bills will not be passed. Karnataka, which has encouraged large-scale use of M-sand, had asked the majority of construction companies in and around Bengaluru to use this sand.

When contacted, Anantapur Deputy Director of Mines and Geology Alavakonda Chandramouli told The Hindu that there were large reserves of granite and road metal (another form of granite) and if M-sand was made compulsory in the government works and large construction projects, the sand from streams and rivers could be used for domestic/individual purposes. This will ease the pressure to a large extent, he observed.

Many people had come forward to set up factories/crushers about a decade ago, but due to lack of patronage had shelved the idea. Similar thing was witnessed with the ‘sand dunes’ at Kannekal, which pose a great problem to farmers and residents in the area. “This sand is very fine and can be used in refractory bricks, ceramics and for plastering only in general house construction. But people stopped coming forward to utilising this with several apprehensions,” he added.

This area, which is popularly known as the desert of Andhra Pradesh, or where according to many the process of desertification had started due to low rainfall in the district, can become hub for such industries, and experts said at least 10 of them can survive for a long time. Post summer and during early monsoon, gusty winds pose big problem for farmers and residents as sand shifts from one place to another.

Door delivery

The door delivery of sand, which has begun in the Krishna district on a pilot basis, is likely to begin in Anantapur district in the last phase between January 20 and 31. Meanwhile, the GPS-fixed vehicles were registering themselves so that people can book sand online and pay the transport charges from the stock point or the loading point in the reaches, Mr. Chandramouli said. Currently, there are 335 overexploited villages in Anantapur, where sand mining cannot be done. But about 15 lakh tonnes of sand was available and of which 3.35 lakh tonnes had already been mined and some quantity supplied to the users, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/y9cgoa/article30505291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08-VJ-SANDREACHES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-fails-to-pressurise-govt-contractors-to-use-m-sand/article30505292.ece
92,2020/01/07,Legal metrology officials book case against commission agent,"A commission agent N. Peddanna, who purchases agriculture produce at Rayalacheruvu in Yadiki mandal of Anantapur district, had been found cheating farmers for the last two years.

Anantapur Legal Metrology Inspector Mohammed Ghouse, in a release on Tuesday, said that the weighing stones he was using, turned out to be 1,200 grams less than its actual mark of 20 kg. Peddanna was purchasing jowar packed in bags by farmers at his facility and a case has been booked against him by the department.

The compounding fee would be levied soon based on the rules, said Mr. Ghouse. A panchanama was made on the spot and a copy of the same was handed over to the commission agent. The farmers asked if the quantity cheated by him would be recovered from the businessman in cash.

On Tuesday at Rayalacheruvu, officials also tried to inspect fair price shops, but all of them were found closed.

At Narpala village, one case was registered on a fair price shop dealer for giving short delivery of 1.5 kg for 20 kg. The department also registered a case on a fertilizer dealer for not declaring the name of the country from where it was imported.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/emelo/article30505128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08-VJ-LEGALMETROLOGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/legal-metrology-officials-book-case-against-commission-agent/article30505129.ece
93,2020/01/07,"Jagan, KCR likely to meet on Jan. 13","Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is likely to meet his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao on January 13.

The meeting will be arranged tentatively at Pragati Bhavan in Hyderabad, the official bungalow of the Telangana Chief Minister, on the eve of Sankranti.

Both the leaders are expected to discuss the issues pertaining to the A.P. Reorganisation Act. This will be the third meeting between them in the last seven months. The agenda of the meeting is not known.

Inter-linking of rivers

When they met on September 24, 2019, the two leaders had a lengthy discussion on the diversion of the Godavari waters to the Krishna, and decided to go ahead with the inter-linking process with less land acquisition.

The officials are tight-lipped on whether the meeting is being convened on the initiative of Mr. Rao or Mr. Reddy.

The meeting assumes significance as it is reported in a section of the media that the relations between both States are under stress of late. There have also been reports of both States deciding to put up a joint fight against the Centre’s policies.

Though Mr. Reddy’s office condemned the media reports as false and fabricated, Mr. Rao did not deny it.

Later, the State government put the joint irrigation project on the backburner.

The proposed meeting also evokes some interest as it will be held in the wake of the government’s plan to shift the Capital to Visakhapatnam.

94,2020/01/07,CBI books cases against bank staff in ₹90 crore fraud case,"The Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday registered a case against several employees of the Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and a few companies for allegedly swindling the bank of ₹90 crore by drawing fraudulent loans last year.

Cases were registered against Bellamkonda Murali Krishna Sharma of Vijayawada, Heli Veepuri, posted as Regional Resource Manager at the IOB Regional Office in Vijayawada, Kandrathi Sireesha and Vuyyala Suresh, posted as Assistant Managers at the IOB Mangalagiri branch in Guntur, and Mothukuri Adinarayana, posted as a clerk at the IOB Mangalagiri branch. The CBI also registered a case against Green Valley Ministries Welfare Association in Visakhapatnam and M/S Bhaktinidhi of Vijayawada.

According to the allegations made by the CBI, Mr. Veepuri opened a current account in September 2019 in the name of Green Valley Ministries Welfare Association at the IOB’s Mellampudi branch in Guntur.

After opening the account, he obtained a cheque from Green Valley Ministries Welfare Association for ₹90 crores, drawn on an account maintained in Punjab National Bank’s MVP Colony branch in Visakhapatnam, and deposited the money on October 24, 2019, at the IOB’s Mangalagiri Branch where he was posted earlier as Branch Manager.

Thereafter, without waiting for the cheque being cleared, he allegedly transferred ₹89 crore to the account of Bhakthinidhi maintained with HDFC’s Vuyyuru branch and ₹1 crore to the savings bank account of Mr. Murali Krishna Sharma, which was maintained with IOB’s Ramavarappadu branch, without any vouchers.

On the same day, Mr. Murali Krishna Sharma, who is the proprietor of M/s Bhakthinidi, approached the IOB’s Ramavarappadu Branch for withdrawal of the amount. However, the amount was not disbursed to him. He then approached HDFC Bank’s Vuyyuru branch for transfer of ₹10 lakh to his savings bank account and the same was transferred.

Searches conducted

It is further alleged that Green Valley Ministries Welfare Association, in cahoots with bank officials, issued the cheque without having sufficient balance in its account. For processing the transactions at IOB’s Mangalagiri Branch, Mr. Veepuri used the log-in IDs and passwords of Ms. Sireesha, Mr. Suresh and Mr. Adinarayana, of IOB’s Mangalagiri Branch, allegedly with their consent.

As per a CBI release, the bank officials conspired with several individuals to cause wrongful loss to the tune of ₹90 crore to IOB and a corresponding wrongful gain to themselves.

After registration of the case, searches were conducted at the office and residential premises of the accused at various places in Visakhapatnam, Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts. During the course of the searches, several incriminating documents were allegedly seized.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cbi-books-cases-against-bank-staff-in-90-crore-fraud-case/article30504995.ece
95,2020/01/07,‘Retain Capital in Amaravati or make Greater Rayalaseema UT’,"Former MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy has asked Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to either retain Amaravati as Capital or create Greater Rayalaseema, which includes Nellore, as an Union Territory (UT).

Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Diwakar Reddy said that shifting of the Capital would harm the interests of the State to a large extent. The Rayalaseema region, in particular, would be the worst-affected.

“If the Capital is shifted to Visakhapatnam, I demand creation of Greater Rayalaseema as a UT, or as an independent zone,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy said.

Taking objection to the idea of creating a “headless” capital at Amaravati and Kurnool, the TDP leader said without the Secretariat there would be no development.

‘Vizag too far’

It would take two days to travel from Anantapur to Visakhapatnam. At Amaravati, Assembly sessions will be held once in every four months. This will stall development, he observed on Monday.

At the time of bifurcation of the State, Mr. Diwakar Reddy had put forth a similar demand. He had then suggested creation of ‘Rayal Telangana’, as many people had links with Hyderabad. Alternatively, he had suggested merger of Anantapur with Karnataka as many people had close links with the neighbouring State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/retain-capital-in-amaravati-or-make-greater-rayalaseema-ut/article30504818.ece
96,2020/01/07,Four youngsters on a ‘save Amaravati’ trek to Tirumala,"A group of four youth demanded that the government retain the Capital in Amaravati, respecting the sentiments of farmers who sacrificed their land in the larger interests of the State.

The group, on a brief stopover here on Tuesday, while on a gruelling padayatra from Vijayawada to Tirumala, feared that the three capitals proposal of the ruling YSR Congress Party would lead to flight of industries from Andhra Pradesh, which was still struggling to overcome bifurcation blues.

‘Hold referendum’

If at all the government wanted to change the Capital, it should hold a referendum to ascertain the views of people, T. Satya, a post-graduate in management, felt.

The Centre should immediately intervene to stop the move by the YSRCP which had backed the proposal to locate the capital in Amaravati while it was in the opposition, said P. Srikanth, a techie.

The sentiments of farmers should not be ignored, said A. Keshava from Chimakurthy on a mission to drum up support of people during the more than 425-km-long march in south coastal Andhra Pradesh.

The farmers had peacefully given their land unlike their counterparts in Singur which had led to change of government in West Bengal, recalled yet another trekker, P.

98,2020/01/07,Rain dampens spirits of Prakasam farmers,"Farmers in Prakasam district were hoping for a good harvest following bountiful rains this year after a gap of five years, but the untimely rains during this month have put paid to their hopes of getting decent returns.

Tobacco farmers in the drought-prone district were the worst affected as the incessant rains disrupted picking of leaves in almost all areas coming under the Southern Black Soil (SBS) and Southern Light Soil (SLS) auction platforms.

The wet spell damaged the crop in the Tangutur, Kandukur and Kanigiri areas where the farmers went for a late crop. “Now we have no option but to go for re-plantation,” lamented a group of farmers in Tangutur.

“Even if we replant, the grade outturn will be affected,” said M. Satynarayana Reddy, a farmer, after taking stock of the condition of the crop. “This year also, we will be saddled with more of low grade and greens,” he added.

It was estimated that the production, which was expected to cross the 100-million kg-mark, would come down by about 15 million kg, Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) sources said.

Those who went for Bengal gram, the other main commercial crop during the rabi season, were equally affected as the coastal mandals received more than 7 cm rainfall in a short span of time.

‘Unusual phenomenon’

Paddy growers also had sleepless nights as their paddy fields got submerged.

“We are hoping against hope for rain to abate,” said a group of farmers in Santamagaluru village. It is almost after 10 years that heavy rain occurred in the month of January, pointed out K. Srinivasa Rao, a farmer, who was busy protecting heaps of freshly-harvested paddy.

Bengal gram in 4,000 hectares were damaged in the district as also paddy in 3,000 hectares, according to reports received from different parts of the district. Agriculture Joint Director P.V. Sriramamurthy said the wet spell disrupted harvesting operations in 1,300 hectares.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rcbran/article30504435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08-VJ-TOBACCOFARM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rain-dampens-spirits-of-prakasam-farmers/article30504436.ece
99,2020/01/07,Consumers happy as onion price plummets in Chittoor district,"Immediately after Deepavali in 2019, the price of onions started increasing. The price level kept increasing from ₹30 a kg, with a sudden jump at ₹100, followed by an incredible hike at ₹240 a kg by December. However, the price hovered around ₹140 a kg all through the month.

For the last two days, onions are being made available at several retail shops at ₹70 a kg. Unlike the previous months, the product is considerably good, offering satisfactory shelf life. It was widely expected that the price would not come down till Sankranti festivities are over. This sudden development came as a big breather to the consumers, a week prior to Sankranti.

For the last three months, the Chittoor district remained the worst hit compared to all other districts of the State, with insufficient supply of stocks.

Assistant Director (Marketing) P. Gopi told The Hindu that the price of onions would further come down immediately after Sankranti. “The main reason for sudden plummeting of onion prices in the retail markets is the ban imposed on export of certain varieties of onions by the Centre. This has led to diversion of produce to the domestic market at ₹50 a kg, particularly in Rayalaseema region,” he said.

The official said that in a span of three months, the district administration had supplied about 400 metric tonnes of onions. “In recent weeks, we sold the highly subsidised onions (imported from Egypt) at ₹25 a kg, and the Krishnapuram variety (of Kadapa district) at ₹15 a kg,” he said.

Regarding the Krishnapuram variety, the government had purchased the stock at ₹50 a kg, and selling it to consumers at ₹15 a kg, following protests from farmers about the ban on exports. To some extent, the stocks from Karnataka and Maharashtra had also started coming in good quantities.

Lakshmi, a woman farmer of Vijayapuram mandal, summed up the present scenario of the vegetable market. “After a long gap, people are thronging markets and roadside vegetable shops with interest. All prime vegetables are now available at a price range between ₹30 and 40 a kg. Now that the onion price is also coming down, it will just mean happy days,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6f51t7/article30504342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08-VJ-ONIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/consumers-happy-as-onion-price-plummets-in-chittoor-district/article30504343.ece

Nagamani directed all teachers to make surprise visits frequently to the houses of students preparing for Class X examinations. She says that such visits would spur students to concentrate on studies for the crucial examinations.

Speaking to The Hindu, she said that many students of rural areas were lagging behind due to lack of tuitions and support from parents as most of them are illiterate.

Special classes

“We have also been conducting teleconferences with headmasters to resolve their grievances since the district administration is aiming for top rank in Class X results this year. They were suggested to conduct special classes both in the morning and evening for students. Special care has to be taken for students who are not good in subjects like mathematics, science and English,” she added.

“The district registered 97.28 pass percentage and could get fourth place in Class X exam results previous year. We are also aiming for more 10/10 grades since only 582 students achieved the highest grade in 2018-2019 academic year,” she said. According to her, as many as 30,361 students would write SSC exams which would be conducted from March 23 to April 8. Among them, 23,565 students are studying in government schools.

Study material

District Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal released ₹30 lakh for study material which is expected to simplify preparation and instil confidence among students. “The government schools will give a tough competition to corporate and private institutions this year with the availability of all books including study material.

More than 5,000 people from various parts of the district converged at Chinakakani, opposite Haailand Resort, and squatted on the highway. Caught unawares, the police forces moved in to quell the situation.

Wrath of protestors

Traffic was held up for more than four hours on the NH and hundreds of trucks and cars were left stranded. Police forces were deployed in large numbers and temporary barricades have been set up on the highway.

The situation continues to remain volatile on the NH.

103,2020/01/07,"Hon’ble President, please declare Amaravati ‘unconstitutional’: YSRCP MLA Dharmana Prasada Rao","When thousands of farmers from the Capital Region are agitating seeking withdrawal of the government’s plans for relocating the State capital, ruling YSRCP MLA and former minister Dharmana Prasada Rao, in a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind sought declaring Amaravati as ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘illegal’. He also wanted the Centre to make necessary changes to the political map of India and publish a new version.

In the letter dated January 6, Mr. Prasada Rao said the TDP government declared Amaravati as the new capital without considering the recommendations of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee which was appointed by the Central government post bifurcation in 2014.

Violated the Constitutional principle

“The Sivaramakrishnan Committee report was neither discussed in the Cabinet meeting nor in the Legislative Assembly and Council. This action of declaring ‘Amaravati’ as capital is unconstitutional as it violated the fundamental constitutional principle of ‘Justice’ and ‘Equality of Opportunity’ enshrined in our Constitution. It is also illegal as it violated the provisions of the AP Reorganization Act 2014, and did not follow the recommendations of the expert committee,” Mr. Prasada Rao wrote.

He further stated that the decision of Amaravati was not notified by any official gazette or by any Government Order. “It is unfortunate that constitutional functions are not conducted from ‘Common Capital Hyderabad’ and are run from a place which does not have legal sanctity. The expert committee in its report clearly stated that “the committee does not consider a single large capital city as a feasible option available to AP.”

Didn’t co-operate with Sivaramakrishnan Committee

Further quoting the Sivaramakrishnan Committee report Mr. Prasada Rao said: “It is clearly stated that the GoAP has already suggested that the new State capital should be in Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri (VGTM) region and that the GoAP has not waited for the study by the ‘Expert Committee’. Further, it is clearly stated that GoAP did not co-operate with the Committee, and it seriously recommended against the location of capital in VGTM region, and recommended that GoAP should revisit its decision as it would affect the best available agriculture lands in the country, as it contributes more than one per cent of rice production of the country.”

“The current government of AP, following the recommendation of the Expert Committee is seriously thinking about revisiting the decision and had appointed a High-Level Committee to study the reports of G.N. Rao Committee and Boston Consulting Group,” he said.

The government is considering to implement recommendations of distribution of various capital functions to all three regions of the State, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-mla-dharmana-prasada-rao-asks-president-to-declare-amaravati-uncontitutional/article30502146.ece

During his visit to the station on Tuesday, Mr. Yadav inaugurated battery-operated, self-balancing scooters, to be used by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) cops.

Covering the station premises, with five platforms, each of them 600-700 m long, on foot, is an arduous task and hence the vehicles are expected to be a major intervention in the policing job.

Mr. Yadav was impressed at the cleanliness and sanitation maintained by the staff and also advised them to maintain the upkeep. Later, accompanied by SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya, he went around the compound to witness the ongoing developmental works and infrastructure projects.

They expressed regret that the TS utilities relieved them during the pendency of the approval of the modalities of the Dharmadhikari Committee consequent upon a petition filed by them in the Supreme Court.

Besides, the Energy Secretary of A.P. wrote a letter to the CMD of TS-Genco and TS-Transco a couple of days ago requesting that no employee should be relieved at this juncture and that the A.P. utilities were not in a position to accommodate them.

109,2020/01/07,"643 rooster fight knives seized, two arrested","Police on Monday conducted a raid and seized 643 rooster fight knives at Ozubandi village in Gangavaram mandal in the district.

Two siblings — Agarti Veera Brahmam and A. Balaiah — were arrested by Gangavaram police. The knives were meant to be tied to the legs of the roosters during the fights, Rampachodavaram Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Vakul Jindal said.

“On information, that knives are being prepared in a big way at Ozubandi hamlet, the team led by Addateegala CI R. Ravi Kumar and Gangavaram SI K.

Police produced the accused before the Gangavaram Mandal Executive Magistrate. Veera Brahmam and Balaiah, both working as carpenters, were known to be rooster fight organisers.

“They have been making the knives for a few days and are planning to sell each piece at ₹300 and above each during Sankranti festivities,” the ASP said.

The Kakinada police arrested a person and seized 3,900 knives used for rooster fights in December last.

110,2020/01/07,"Federation chairman post is our right, say Kurnool fisherfolk","Fisherfolk of Kurnool alleged that injustice is being done to the community of the region in the matter of appointment of chairperson of the Andhra Pradesh State Fishermen Cooperative Societies Federation (AFCOF).

Former director of Fisherman Corporation B.S. Naveen Kumar told The Hindu that the post was given to Nellore during the TDP regime, and later a person from Krishna district was chosen. This time too, the post is once again set to go to Nellore, thus denying the fishermen of Kurnool their due.

“Rayalaseema fisherfolk have not been given even one State-level position,” he claimed.

Rayalaseema in-charge of the National Fisherman Association expressed concerns over the choice of candidates. “There are a few cases against the one chosen from Nellore who is set to become the chairman,” he said.

Adding to that, Mr. Naveen said that the person does not have any experience in dealing with fisherfolk issues.

The Rayalaseema fisherfolk have also expressed concern over the government not giving compensation to the inland fishermen during the annual ban. “While marine fisherfolk get compensation from the government, the inland fishermen do not get any compensation,” they said.

“There are about 12,000 families in Kurnool district alone, in about 120 cooperative societies, who are not eligible for the compensation,” Mr. Venkatesh said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/federation-chairman-post-is-our-right-say-kurnool-fisherfolk/article30497980.ece
111,2020/01/07,Fishing cat pugmarks revive hopes on population increase in Bandar Reserve Forest,"The pugmarks of fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) were recorded by the Forest Department in the three locations adjacent to the salt fields in the Bandar Reserve Forest (BRF) near Kona village in Krishna district.

The pugmarks were sighted in the 50-hectare area on which the Forest Department was restoring the mangrove cover through the fishbone method.

Accompanied by representatives of the Forest Department, this Correspondent had photographed the pugmarks at the site (Latitude 16.036405 - Longitude 81.130546) on Sunday.

The pugmarks appeared fresh by Sunday, leaving a clue on the presence of the fishing cat in the reserve forest. A technical study is required to be carried out to ascertain the gender of the fishing cat(s), the Schedule-1 species under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

The crab hunters living in the core area of the BRF told The Hindu that the animal moving around in the forest during nights.

The team representing the Forest Department — Pandu and Allaparthi Appa Rao — told The Hindu, “The pugmarks of the fishing cat have been found in three locations in the area which has not been surveyed earlier. Sighting of the pugmarks gives us a clue that the BRF continues to be a safe habitat for the species.” All the pugmarks were sighted within the radius of half a kilometre.

“Last July, a drive has been launched to restore the mangrove cover in the 50-hectare area in the BRF. The restoration nears completion with this area witnessing a healthy growth of plants,” added Mr. Appa Rao.

112,2020/01/07,Cattle festivals turn into jallikattu events in Kuppam area,"Gone are the days when organisers used to be afraid of police in Kuppam area to hold ‘cattle festivals’, which are an inferior version of Tamil Nadu’s jallikattu. Now, the festival is being held on a par with jallikattu at several places in the Kuppam Assembly constituency.

The organisers have announced the jallikattu events and are circulating the information on social media. They have announced cash prizes up to 50th position. According to a pamphlet circulated on WhatsApp, the first prize is ₹60,000 and the 42nd prize is ₹500 at a bull race event scheduled at Balla village of Ramakuppam mandal for January 10. Another event near Kuppam, scheduled for January 16, has set the first prize at ₹1 lakh. A series of jallikattu events (locally termed as Mylaru Panduga) are scheduled at Gudupalle, Ramakuppam, Mittapalle, Kenamakulapalle, Ontipalle and Baireddipalle in the division, between January 7 and 16. The organisers have even mentioned their names, along with sponsors and the mobile numbers.

About 700 bulls would be brought in by farmers and youth not only from the Kuppam area, but also from border villages in T.N. and Karnataka. On an average, the entry fee for each bull is fixed at ₹1,500, making it a big business.

Veerappan’s posters

The Mylaru Panduga organisers at the tri-State junction of Kuppam, which shares borders with the north-western districts of Tamil Nadu, have even gone to the extent of invoking the blessings of the slain forest brigand Veerappan for the success of the events. At Kanapalle village of Gudupalle mandal, the image of Veerappan sporting his rifle on a huge flexi set up beside an inter-State highway, intended as a public invitation for the Mylaru Panduga, remains a cynosure of all eyes.

A senior police official in Kuppam said that “it is next to impossible to control these jallikattu events.” Earlier, the organisers of the milder version of jallikattu (just parading the cattle) used to place repeated requests with the area police for permissions, mostly orally. But this year, the organisers have become emboldened. They are printing pamphlets and circulating them openly, and even putting up public displays. It was observed that the political pressure was unprecedented on the police not to act against the organisers.

On the display of Veerappan’s image for the promotion of jallikattu events, Deputy SP (Palamaner) Areefulla said immediate steps would be taken to remove such publicity material. “It’s a crime to sport the image of the forest brigand who had ruthlessly killed several police personnel,” the Deputy SP said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/g0u8l9/article30500607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJPAGE4BOX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cattle-festivals-turn-into-jallikattu-events-in-kuppam-area/article30497953.ece

Leading the protest rally from the flyover on the arterial Kurnool road to the busy Church Centre, JAC Convenor Md. Rafi urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to take a cue from his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan and ensure passage of a unanimous resolution in the State Assembly against CAA, National Register of Citizens(NRC) and National Population Register(NPR).

‘Constitution under threat’

CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna said already several non-BJP-ruled States had expressed their stout opposition to the CAA and pledged to stand by ‘democratic and secular forces’, striving to bring together all sections of people opposed to the ‘sectarian’ agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) and ‘save the country from divisive forces’. It was unfortunate that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had unleashed a reign of terror to suppress the democratic protest by secular forces, he said.

Constitution was under threat under the Narendra Modi regime, contended Constitution Protection Forum Convenor K. Lakshmana Rao, MLC, while addressing the rally attended by various Muslim organisations led by theologians Mufti Azad and Maulana Abdul Rahim.

Addressing the students, the Governor said the competitions would be a memorable event in the history of RGUKT, which was for the first of its kind in the Telugu States.

Complimenting the Nuzvid IIIT management for hosting the mega event, he asked the participants who were taking part in the competitions to do their best. Mr. Harichandan recalled his childhood days in which he practised yoga, he is continuing it even today.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the initiative to promote yoga for maintaining good health and discipline, which is being followed in the entire world and everyone has realised the importance of yoga,” the Governor said.

Explaining about the increasing pollution by the day, especially in Delhi, where educational institutions were shut for seven days due to high pollution levels, Mr. Harichandan asked the students to protect the environment.

Special Chief Secretary to Government (Higher Education) Satish Chandra, RGUKT in-charge Vice-Chancellor K. Hemachandra Reddy, Director D. Suryachandra Rao, Administrative Officer P. Shyam and other officers were present.

Kishan Reddy here on Monday fuelling speculation that the TDP strongman might join the Bharatiya Janata Party. The meeting was very brief at the Government Arts College helipad at noon. He welcomed him with a bouquet and greeted him and did not talk anything elaborately.

After the general elections speculation was rife that Mr. Diwakar Reddy would join the BJP as former Dharmavaram TDP MLA Varadapuram Suri (Gonuguntla Suryanarayana) switched sides within two months of losing his election. After getting conditional bail from the High Court on Saturday and getting released from the Anantapur Rural police station, Mr. Diwakar Reddy had accused the YSR Congress Party government of targeting him and other Opposition leaders.

On Monday, Mr. Diwakar Reddy, however, clarified that he had no plans to switch over to the BJP.

At a press conference on Saturday night, he even asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dismiss the Andhra Pradesh government and announce elections afresh for the State Assembly. He alleged that the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government was running a police raj and wanted the Centre to analyse all his actions and dismiss it suo motu. A day after, Mr. Diwakar Reddy met BJP national secretary Satya Kumar at the R&B Guest House here and later commented that there was no future for regional parties.

117,2020/01/07,Ravela files defamationsuit against Buggana,"BJP leader Ravela Kishore Babu filed a defamation suit against Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy claiming ₹10 crore in damages for making the allegation that he had purchased 40.85 acres land in Amaravati.

Mr. Kishore Babu said that the Minister repeatedly accused him of buying land in the Capital region thereby created the impression that he was one of those involved in insider trading.

It was a baseless charge, he said and claimed that if there was no response, he would lodge a complaint under the SC/ ST Atrocities Act.

Addressing media persons here on Monday, Mr. Kishore Babu said he was staying in a rented house and was struggling to make ends meet in spite of being a Minister for four years (in the TDP government).

By alleging that he bought land, Mr. Kishore Babu said the Minister had tarnished his reputation, for which he (Mr. Rajendranath Reddy) should tender an unconditional apology or pay damages.

‘Ill-advised move’

Mr. Kishore Babu said the proposed shifting of the Capital was a conspiracy and it would jeopardise development and also flare up regional passions.

118,2020/01/07,20 State fishermen released by Pakistan head home,"Twenty fishermen belonging to Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, who have been languishing in a Pakistani jail since December 2018, were finally freed on Monday and were handed over to the Indian authorities and a delegation of the State government led by

Fisheries Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana at the Wagah border by Pakistan Rangers. The fishermen were taken to Amritsar and are likely to be flown from New Delhi to Visakhapatnam on January 7 evening and from there taken to their respective villages. Speaking to media persons at Amritsar, Mr. Venkataramana said he was happy over the release of the fishermen — 15 from Srikakulam district and the remaining from Vizianagaram— and they were thankful to the Pakistan Government for being sympathetic to them. Necessary formalities were completed and arrangements made to enable the fishermen to get back to their villages.

‘Credit goes to CM’

The Minister said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy took personal interest in getting the fishermen released and they were excited to meet their families after a long time.

The Central government (Ministry of External Affairs) played its role in securing the fishermen’s release, for which the A.P. government was grateful.

The Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs communicated the decision to repatriate the fishermen to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad on December 31, 2019.

The State government has since stepped up the efforts to secure their release. Two more fishermen belonging to East Godavari district are still in the process of being set free as there was a delay in establishing their identities.

119,2020/01/07,Three capitals a great idea: TGV,"BJP Rajya Sabha member TG Venkatesh has welcomed Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s proposal of three capitals, saying it will contribute to the all-round development of the State. He, however, said that it was his personal opinion.

While welcoming the decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital and Kurnool the judicial capital and retaining Amaravati as the legislative capital, Mr. Venkatesh said a mini Secretariat should also be set up in Kurnool.

This would ensure development of all three regions and prevent future demands for separation from the backward regions, he asserted at a press conference organised by the Vizag Journalist’s Forum (VJF) here on Monday. He recalled that when Amaravati was chosen as the capital, the people of Rayalaseema region had demanded that the Capital region be made a free zone apart from making Kurnool the winter capital.

Mr. Jagan was now keen on making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital and he was right in doing so. Both North Andhra and Rayalaseema regions had remained backward for long, and justice should be done to the regions. The three capitals proposal could be a smooth process once contentious issues were sorted out.

Money matters

He said the three capitals could be built at a lesser cost than the temporary buildings constructed at a huge cost by the previous government. Ample rocky land was available both in Rayalaseema and near Visakhapatnam, where buildings could be constructed. He took exception to the charge that Kurnool was prone to floods and said that such incidents were rare. On the contrary, the severe heatwave in the Amaravati region during summer results in sunstroke deaths.

“Visakhapatnam, which is protected by Dolphin’s Nose, is the safest place to locate the capital,” he said.

To another query, he said: “I was among the first to raise the demand for special status for AP. The former Chief Minister took a ‘U’ turnafter agreeing to the special package, thinking that Mr. Jagan will get the credit for the special status if it was granted by the Centre.’’",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-capitals-a-great-idea-tgv/article30497855.ece
120,2020/01/07,Jagan moots tram-like transport facility from RK beach to Bheemili,"Chief Minister Y.S.

This is against the backdrop of invitation of fresh tenders for the Visakhapatnam metro rail project being taken up as per the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014.

In a review meeting on the development works of MA&UD Department on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy also sought proposals for supplying drinking water to Visakhapatnam through an underground pipeline from the Polavaram project to meet its requirements.

These plans hold significance in the context of the government’s determination to shift the capital from Amaravati to the port city.

He further said 1.50 lakh house sites should be given under the weaker sections housing scheme in Visakhapatnam.

Special officer

Mr. Jagan ordered that a special officer be appointed to take care of development works in Mangalagiri, Tadepalli and Pulivendula municipalities and to complete the construction of the retaining wall along the Krishna river bund in Vijayawada city to put an end to flooding.

Officials of the Housing Department told the CM that reverse tenders were called for 48,608 units in urban areas whose contract value was ₹2,399 crore and a sum of ₹303 crore was saved. Reverse tendering was being extended to remaining units.

Underground drainage

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested that due priority be given to the construction of underground drains in municipalities and disposal of solid waste.

The estimated cost of constructing those drains in 34 towns having more than one lakh population was approximately ₹11,180 crore. If all the 110 municipalities were to have underground drains, the cost would be roughly ₹23,040 crore.

He wanted desalination plants to be set up to make the industries use only treated water so that drinking water resources could be conserved for domestic use. If required, a law should be made for it, he stated.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/d9sfab/article30500599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJJAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cm-moots-tram-like-transport-facility-from-rk-beach-to-bheemili/article30497832.ece

Rao Committee and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the strategy for all-round development of the State, including the Capital, is scheduled to begin its exercise on Tuesday (January 7), according to official sources.

Members of the panel led by its convener and Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney will look into the two reports which advised that the Capital should be a distributed model and separate development plans be drawn up for the regions.

Both the expert panels suggested that Visakhapatnam should be made the Executive capital, Amaravati the legislative capital and Kurnool judicial capital having the principal seat of the High Court (HC) with Benches in Visakhapatnam and Amaravati.

The recommendations on the Secretariat and the HC were more or less the same but the views on the location of Assembly were slightly different.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had stated in the Assembly on December 17 that A.P. could have three capital cities.

125,2020/01/07,"‘Take out your anger on me, spare Amaravati’","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu has asked the YSRCP government to unleash its anger, if any, on him and spare the Amaravati capital region. He invited the government to order an inquiry into alleged insider trading by the TDP government if they wanted to act and not resort to shifting the capital citing insider trading as a reason.

On Monday, Mr. Naidu visited the 24-hour hunger strike camp by Vijayawada East MLA Gadde Rammohan Rao in the city in a show of solidarity with the farmers fighting against the relocation of the State Capital. CPI national leader K. Narayana also visited the camp and extended support to Mr. Rao.

‘People won’t forgive’

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Naidu said the Capital Region and the State would not forgive the YSRCP and its leaders if they continued with their plans of shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam. “People from various walks of life in Kurnool, Nellore, Ongole and other districts have formed Joint Action Committees expressing solidarity with the capital farmers and opposing shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam,” Mr. Naidu pointed out.

He said about ₹10,000 crore had already been spent in Amaravati for construction of several buildings. If the YSRCP government could not develop it further, it could just keep using the existing buildings which would be enough to house all the government functionaries.

Regarding the issue surrounding his alleged comments against Commissioner and Director of Municipal Administration G.S.R.K.R. Vijay Kumar, Mr. Naidu denied disrespecting the former. “I always respect officials, unlike CM Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, of whom officers are scared,” he quipped.

Donations pour in

Mr. Naidu called upon youth and the people of the State to come forward and join the farmers in protest against shifting the capital.

Meanwhile, donations poured in to support the agitating capital farmers. A woman donated four gold bangles and another woman donated two bangles to Mr. Naidu. Many others donated thousands of rupees to the TDP chief.

A woman, Nagalakshmi, who gave away her finger ring as donation to Mr. Naidu, immediately asked for a help surprising everyone. “Worried after seeing the agitation by farmers during past few days, I came here to support the cause without the knowledge of my husband. I request you to ask my husband to excuse me for not informing him,” she told Mr. Naidu.

Mr. Naidu immediately responded and spoke to her husband Ramakrishna on the phone. He said: “I am Chandrababu Naidu. We are in a meeting here. Nagalakshmi garu came here and told me that she was out with your permission and also gave a ring as donation. You too should bless her and cooperate for the agitation.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ri3qj2/article30500567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJPAGE4NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/take-out-your-anger-on-me-spare-amaravati/article30497715.ece
126,2020/01/07,Education Dept. announces common exam for Class 7 students this year,"After months of speculation, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education announced that a common examination will be conducted for Class 7 students.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said no student will be detained on the basis of this exam. It will be conducted in place of the second Summative Assessment which is part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system prescribed in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. Students will be tested only on half a year’s portion and the exam will be conducted in March for students of government, aided as well as unaided schools.

While a common question paper will be set by the Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council, evaluation will be done at the district level in an attempt for ‘neutrality’.

Justifying the need for the exam, Mr. Kumar said there was a need to evaluate the learning outcomes of students and provide remedial assistance when they graduate to Class 8. “There was no serious evaluation being done till Class 10 and based on feedback from stakeholders, we decided to go ahead with the exam,” he said. Students will be evaluated based on performance, and will be given guidance in Class 8. The Minister added that a common exam had been conducted in the Belagavi division on a pilot basis, which will be extended to all divisions across the State.

While the department had initially planned a public exam, they were forced to tweak how it was conducted after receiving flak from the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

Institutes offering substandard education to be shut

The Governor of Karnataka, Vajubhai Vala, directed the State government to shut down those higher education institutions that were imparting substandard education. He raised the issue at the silver jubilee celebrations of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council on Tuesday.

He told NAAC that it was important to assess institutions accurately, and said that those failing to adhere to standards were doing a great disservice to the student community and harming them. He urged the Council to submit a proposal to the Union government in this regard.

During his address, Vice-President M.

At a press conference here on Tuesday, Commissioner for Public Instruction K.G.

It had found that the companies that supplied the bicycles did not meet all parameters agreed upon. He said however, that this has not impacted the overall quality of the cycles.

Even last year, the former Chief Minister had directed officials to stop distributing cycles after he received complaints about them.

129,2020/01/07,"Loan waiver, free power will not solve farm crisis: Venkaiah","Terming farm loan waivers and free electricity to farmers as “temporary measures” that will not resolve agrarian crisis, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said only science and technology can make agriculture sustainable and profitable and take the country forward in combating global warming and climate change.

Addressing the valedictory of the 107th Indian Science Congress 2020, which had “Science and Technology: Rural Development” as its theme, he described climate change as the biggest challenge the world was facing today.

“We cannot depend on import-based food security. We need to become self sufficient in all aspects and build home-grown food security. Presently, agrarian distress is so severe that there is large-scale migration from agriculture, posing a big challenge to us. The only way to retain people in agriculture is to make it sustainable. I come from a farming family and from experience I tell you that loan waiver and free power are only temporary measures. Free power often means no power, and farmers need loans every year and if we go on waiving loans, how can we expect the banks to issue new ones?” he asked.

Calling upon scientists to engage their resources and focus on the agrarian issues and improve the lives of farmers, Mr. Naidu placed a few challenges facing the farm sector today. “Optimum use of water is a major challenge, even in the light of climate change. We need to device newer methods that increase the efficiency of water usage in farming. I recently visited Vietnam, where the average yield for paddy per acre is more than our country. We need to seriously work on ways to improve soil fertility,” he said, adding that devising climate-resistant crop varieties was also a major concern in the coming years.

Mr. Naidu also stressed on the need for value addition to agricultural products, which he said the country was lacking. “Why do we import tomato ketchup and potato chips when we grow both on a large scale. The scientific fraternity needs to put in efforts at not only value addition in the food chain but also on new preservative technologies,” he said.

“We cannot wish away global warming and climate change. It impacts all of us and especially agriculture. The scientific community needs to help us combat this,” he said.

Moral science too

“We need to reorient science and technology to build a sustainable planet, not just for the sake of technological advancement,” he said, stressing on the need for morality. “When I was in school, there were science classes and moral science classes. But now the morals have gone and only science continues. We need to reorient ourselves as even if science advances, we will face new problems due to lack of morals,” he said.

130,2020/01/07,SC expresses reservations in Karnataka land-grabbing case,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed reservations about an NGO, Samaj Parivartana Samudaya, intervening to fight a land-grabbing case allegedly involving Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar when the original complainant had himself withdrawn from the litigation.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde asked advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, to make good its claim that it did not parachute into the case at the level of the Supreme Court but had been doggedly fighting for justice right from the level of the Karnataka Lokayukta.

The court gave the NGO two weeks’ time to provide proof of its long-standing involvement in the case and that it too had filed a separate complaint with the Lokayukta.v The original complainant and petitioner in the case, Kabbale Gowda, had suddenly withdrawn his case from the Supreme Court on February 21, 2019.

‘Compromised’

It was then that the NGO had intervened to get the apex court to re-call its order disposing off the petition. Mr. Bhushan, who had earlier appeared for Mr. Gowda and is now representing the NGO, said the case had seen many such complainants become “compromised” and bow out. In the previous hearing in March 2019, Mr. Bhushan had urged the court to list the case again for hearing on merits, saying it concerned “corruption and crime” across party lines in the State. He had alleged how neither the Lokayukta nor the State government challenged the Karnataka High Court’s decision in December 2015 to quash charges.

On Tuesday, Chief Justice Bobde orally observed that the NGO cannot “ride piggy-back” on Mr. Gowda’s petition, especially after the latter had withdrawn from the case. “You are riding on someone else’s shoulders. You cannot do that.. This person [Gowda] has withdrawn. Now, you can file separately to pursue your own case… And if you claim that you had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta, show us what happened to that complaint… Was it dismissed or allowed?” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Bhushan in court. Mr. Gowda’s petition was originally filed in the Supreme Court against a Karnataka High Court decision in December 2015 to set aside a trial court order of February 2012 to prosecute the politicians and other accused persons. The High Court had quashed the entire criminal proceedings. Mr. Gowda was the de-facto complainant in the case.

The history of the land measuring over five acres dates back to 1962 and reveals the alleged corrupt acts, right from the level of the village accountant to the then Chief Minister, Mr. Gowda’s petition had said in the apex court.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xncf2o/article30506407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Suprem-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sc-expresses-reservations-in-karnataka-land-grabbing-case/article30506408.ece

He was speaking at the silver jubilee celebrations of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council in Bengaluru on Tuesday.

Politics should be kept out of the campuses of educational institutions, said Mr. Naidu, adding that while there are over 900 universities in the country, only a few universities were in the news for the wrong reasons, without directly referring to the incidents at the JNU. “One should not disturb the peace on campus. There is nothing wrong in discussing ideologies, but that should be done outside the campus. Universities are places of learning,” he said.

He argued that academic endeavours and co-curricular initiatives must attain primacy in universities and not factionalism or divisive tendencies. “Our children, when they leave the portals of educational institutions, must be enlightened citizens who will take an abiding interest in protecting our democracy and preserving the fundamental values that are enshrined in our constitution,” he said.

133,2020/01/07,"‘Big Data, AI will drive agriculture in future’","Big Data today dominates many fields, but scientists at the science congress think agriculture will also soon be driven by data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).

“With advancement of satellite and drone technology, agriculture is entering the domain of big data,” said Partha P. Banerjee, Asia Pipeline Lead, Bayer Crop Science Ltd., delivering a plenary lecture at ISC 2020 on Tuesday. Incidentally, the State government has already begun experimenting with drone technology for farm data collection and crop pattern analysis.

“From mobile phones to satellites, we are producing data on the farms everyday. If tillers are fit with sensors, we can analyse the soil nutrient conditions of every inch of the farm and its applications are immense. Drone technology and data analytics are already being used to recommend advanced water irrigation strategies and diagnose disease on the farm in real time. This will help farmers understand which part of the farm needs more water or where the disease is spreading from, so that it can be tackled,” he said.

“Yield of a crop is a function of seed and plant genetics, environment and climate, and farm practices. To each of these, we have data layers, for instance, soil health, temperature, humidity, and rainfall for climate input. We have identified 40 key decisions a farmer makes from sowing to harvest. Data analytics can help farmers make informed decisions based on three larger parameters the yield is a function of,” he said. “We are still in the prescriptive analytics stage and science will move towards predictive analytics,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/big-data-ai-will-drive-agriculture-in-future/article30506347.ece

Kumaraswamy and some of his family members and close relatives have encroached upon several acres of government gomala land on the outskirts of Bengaluru city.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hamant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition, filed by Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya, seeking a direction to the government to implement the direction given by the Lokayukta.

The Lokayukta had asked the Principal Secretary, Revenue Department, to hold a detailed inquiry on the grant or not grant of gomala lands, bearing survey numbers 7,8,9,10,16.17 and 79 of Kethaganahalli Village of Bidadi Hobli of Ramanagaram taluk in favour of the vendors/donors of the persons, who are found to be in possession of the said lands, within four months.

In case it was found that such grants of lands were not there then the government was asked by the Lokayukta to take necessary steps for the recovery of the lands from encroachers and also to initiate criminal action against persons found trespassing the government land and against guilty officers/officials of the government, the Lokayukta stated, while asking the Principal Secretary to submit a compliance report within 15 days after inquiry.

The workshop is organised by the Department of Civil Engineering and sponsored under the grants of the World Bank-aided third phase of Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP).

The event proposes to popularise and promote field hydrological research and comprises a day's lectures and two days of fieldwork in Kumaradhara field hydrological laboratory developed by NIE in Kodagu.

The Water Resources Centre of NIE has pioneered research in hydrology and has been carrying out field investigations in the experimental watersheds it has developed in the districts of Kodagu and Hassan for over two decades in the Western Ghat region of Karnataka, according to a press release.

“Relative to the other fields of science, hydrology is a new field of learning and is unexplored. Knowledge about many hydrological processes in wet and hill slope areas was little and a lot remains to be learnt on the field. The workshop provides enthusiasts with a platform to learn and research,” the release added.

The teaching faculty of Civil Engineering, PG students of Water Resources and research scholars in the field and professionals working in the water sector can participate in the workshop.

For registration, call the workshop coordinators R.Y. Putty (98802 55920), Y. Javeed (99860 62198) or Chandramouli (94487 73056).",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nie-to-host-session-on-hill-slope-hydrology/article30504208.ece
140,2020/01/07,‘Swachh’ survey: MCC seeks GPs’ help for hygiene on city outskirts,"Even as the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is going all out to cheer the citizens here to vote for Mysuru in the ongoing Swachh Survekshan-2020 for sustaining its recognition on the cleanliness front, it is now roping in Gram Panchayats (GPs) for their support in realising the ‘Swachh’ goals since many localities are controlled by the panchayats.

Cleanliness on the city outskirts, especially along the service roads of the Outer Ring Road (ORR), is crucial since the MCC limits extend till the ring road and the teams that are part of the survey are expected to take a tour of the city before giving their score on various parameters.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, which is conducting the survey from January 4 to 31, has said that citizen feedback - SS2020 “VoteForYourCity - on the progress made by the city in realising the ‘Swachh’ goals plays a key role in the survey. For voting, citizens have to visit www.swachhsurvekshan2020.org/citizenfeedback

Sources told The Hindu that the MCC had written to the panchayat development officers (PDOs) of some GPs under whose jurisdiction many residential localities exist, requesting them to handle solid wastes scientifically, particularly segregation at source, and clearing the trash.

Many layouts have come up beyond the ORR and some of them have spread across 3 to 4 km from the ORR. The MCC handles its designated responsibilities until the ORR and thereafter the responsibilities lies with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), which develops and approves layouts, and GPs.

The GPs, despite being revenue-rich, had failed in their duties in handling the solid wastes in their limits, citing infrastructural deficiencies. The MUDA had distanced itself from the ‘Swachh’ responsibilities arguing that such tasks rest with the MCC and the GPs.

MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj said the MCC had written to the GPs seeking their support. The PDOs of GPs including Srirampura, Hinkal, and Bogadi have been requested to maintain hygiene in their limits, clearing solid waste on daily basis, and segregating waste, in view of the ongoing survey.

Along with building and construction debris, solid waste is being dumped along the service roads of the ORR, spoiling the city’s beauty and reputation. Ring road is sort of a gateway to the city and garbage and debris dumped along the road gives a poor impression of the city.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swachh-survey-mcc-seeks-gps-help-for-hygiene-on-city-outskirts/article30503919.ece

Schools and colleges in the State too would function as usual on Wednesday, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ksrtc-buses-will-ply-as-usual-on-wednesday-bommai/article30503830.ece
142,2020/01/07,Supreme Court expresses reservations in Karnataka land-grabbing case,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed reservations about an NGO, Samaj Parivartana Samudaya, intervening to fight a land-grabbing case allegedly involving Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar when the original complainant has himself withdrawn from the litigation.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde asked advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, to make good its claim that it did not parachute into the case at the level of the Supreme Court but had been doggedly fighting for justice right from the level of the Karnataka Lokayukta.

The court gave the NGO two weeks’ time to provide proof of its long-standing involvement in the case and that it too had filed a separate complaint with the Lokayukta.

The original complainant and petitioner in the case, Kabbale Gowda, had suddenly withdrawn his case from the Supreme Court on February 21, 2019.

‘Compromised’

It was then that the NGO had intervened to get the apex court to re-call its order disposing off the petition. Mr. Bhushan, who had earlier appeared for Mr. Gowda and is now representing the NGO, said the case had seen many such complainants become “compromised” and bow out.

In the previous hearing in March 2019, Mr. Bhushan had urged the court to list the case again for hearing on merits, saying it concerned “corruption and crime” across party lines in the State. He had alleged how neither the Lokayukta nor the State government challenged the Karnataka High Court’s decision in December 2015 to quash charges.

On Tuesday, Chief Justice Bobde orally observed that the NGO cannot “ride piggy-back” on Mr. Gowda’s petition, especially after the latter has withdrawn from the case. “You are riding on someone else’s shoulders. You cannot do that.. This person [Gowda] has withdrawn. Now, you can file separately pursue your own case… And if you claim that you had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta, show us what happened to that complaint… Was it dismissed or allowed?” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Bhushan in court.

2015 petition

Mr. Gowda’s petition was originally filed in the Supreme Court against a Karnataka High Court decision in December 2015 to set aside a trial court order of February 2012 to prosecute the politicians and other accused persons. The High Court had quashed the entire criminal proceedings. Mr. Gowda was the de-facto complainant in the case.

The history of the land measuring over five acres dates back to 1962 and reveals the alleged corrupt acts, right from the level of the village accountant to the then chief minister, Mr. Gowda’s petition had said in the apex court.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvg2qb/article30496646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/supreme-court-expresses-reservations-in-karnataka-land-grabbing-case/article30503607.ece

Speaking at the silver jubilee celebrations of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council in Bengaluru, he said politics should be kept out of educational institutions and one should not disturb the peace on the campus. “There is nothing wrong in discussing ideologies but that should be done outside the campus. Universities are places of learning.”

144,2020/01/07,Bommai asks Muslims not to fall for smear campaign of Congress,"Reiterating that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will not affect Muslims, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday asked Muslims not to fall for the smear campaign by Opposition parties, especially the Congress.

Launching the signature campaign in support of CAA at Suratkal, Mr. Bommai said there will be no trouble for any Muslim from the CAA. “Your ration card will be more strengthened. Nothing will happen to your Aadhaar card. Nobody will drive you out from the place you are staying. Opposition parties, more so the Congress, are trying to create fear and building a sense of insecurity among Muslims,” he said.

Mr. Bommai said the CAA was nothing but the process of legitimising the stay of a person who has fled from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh following religious persecution. “You see a good number of people from different parts of the country, who have problems at their place, come to earn a living in Mangaluru. Government gives such residents electricity, water and title deed for the place they are staying. Does this in any way affect you at all? No. With CAA, a similar exercise will be carried out and it will not affect Muslims or any other residents here.

“Those spreading lies and creating fear among Muslims are acting against the State,” he said.

BJP State President Nalin Kumar Kateel said the BJP will hold a massive CAA awareness programmes at three places including Mangaluru and Sindhanur in Raichur district, which has large number of Bangladeshi refugees. There will be awareness campaigns in all district centres.

Mr. Bommai and Mr. Kateel earlier signed on a poster to begin the campaign to send letters addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah in support of CAA.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cb8r0r/article30501768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bommai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bommai-asks-muslims-not-to-fall-for-smear-campaign-of-congress/article30501769.ece
145,2020/01/07,AIUEC demands inquiry into JNU incident,"Strongly condemning the attack by a group of masked men at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday, All India University Employees Confederation (AIUEC) demanded a high-level inquiry into to the incident.

District general secretary of the confederation M.B. Sajjan, addressing presspersons here on Monday, said that the violence was backed by the BJP and the RSS. A group of members from right wing organisations wearing masks were moving around on the campus with rods and sticks, he said and added that the attacks were planned by those in power.

The goons attacked the elected office-bearers and unleashed violence on the university campus, he said and condemned the act of hooliganism.

AIUEC comprising more than three lakh non-teaching employees of universities across the country would stage a protest against the incident on January 8.

The confederation also demanded that the government withdraw the Draft National Education Policy 2019 and to scrap the new pension scheme and restore the old pension benefits.

Mr. Sajjan urged the Union government to extend uniform University Grants Commission(UGC) pay-scales to non-teaching employees of universities on par with teaching staff and provide representation to non-teaching employees in decision-making bodies such as the senate, syndicate, board management and executive council. He demanded that the government fix a minimum wages of at least ₹ 21,000 per month. He also opposed contracting work of permanent and perennial nature.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aiuec-demands-inquiry-into-jnu-incident/article30500636.ece
146,2020/01/07,Billava Muslim Sammilana programme opposed,"Kiran Kumar, a leader of Billava community and BJP, on Monday said that some forces were trying to divide the Billava community by organising the Billava-Muslim Sneha Sammilana programme here on January 11.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Kumar said that some Congress leaders wanted to use this programme to build their political base. It was not right on the part of these politicians to use the innocent Billava community for their political purposes. Nearly the entire Billava community was opposed to holding this programme.

Cancellation sought

“This programme should either be cancelled or the name ‘Billava’ should be dropped from its title by January 9. If this is not done, then the members of the community would stage a protest in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s Office. If this programme is held despite our opposition, then the organisers and district administration would be responsible for its consequences,” he said.

Even the names of some of the leaders printed on the invitation of the programme was done without informing them properly. Kota Srinivas Poojary, Minister for Ports and Fisheries, had already clarified that he had nothing to do with the programme and would not attend it. Similar was the case with other leaders, Mr. Kumar said.

‘Rename the programme’

Achyut Kalmady, another Billava leader, said that they had no objection if the organizers renamed the programme as ‘Hindu Muslim Sneha Sammilana.’ But their investigations had revealed that the organisers had done this deliberately to create differences within the Billava community and create two groups in it. There were cultural differences between the Billavas and Muslims, which were fundamental and could not be bridged, he said.

Rishiraj Poojary, grandson of Chandu Poojary, said that the name of his grandfather, the late Chandu Poojary, had been given to the stage of the programme. But the permission of the family had not been sought and nor had they been invited to the programme, he said. Sunil K.R., Ramesh Poojary, Mahesh Poojary, and other Billava leaders, were present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/billava-muslim-sammilana-programme-opposed/article30500600.ece

149,2020/01/07,Attack on JNU students triggers protests in Kalaburagi,"The attack on the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) by masked men on Sunday night triggered multiple and simultaneous protests in Kalaburagi on Monday.

Just as the news of masked men and women armed with rods, heavy sticks, stone and other weapons barging into JNU campus and indiscriminately beating up students and teachers came, a group of students from Gulbarga University and activists associated with various Left and progressive organisations gathered near a petrol pump in the city and staged a protest throughout the night. Leaders of various organisations, including K. Neela of Communist Party of India (Marxist), Maula Mulla of Communist Party of India and Nazeer Ali of Social Democratic Party of India, participated in the night-long agitation. In the morning, responding to a call given by All India Democratic Students Organisation, Campus Front of India and Students Federation of India, students and youths took out protest rallies and staged demonstrations outside the district administrative complex. The agitating students raised slogans.

“Peace-loving Indians could not sleep after watching the video clippings showing the brutalities of armed goons that emerged from the JNU campus. The police were not just mute spectators of the rampage and barbaric attack but they actively supported the attackers by offering security cover to them. It is clearly State-sponsored terrorism. The BJP government at the Centre is targeting universities that encourage rational thoughts and inculcate awareness among students,” Rajendra Rajwal, a leader of Karnataka Vidyarthi Sanghatane, said during one of the agitations.

The students of Gulbarga University and Central University of Karnataka also staged demonstrations outside the administrative complexes of their respective universities in the morning. Afternoon saw two more protests at Jagat Circle where hundreds of activists from different organisations participated. The activists disfigured posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah with black ink and burnt their effigies.

“Mr. Shah had said that he would teach a lesson to the ‘tukde tukde gang’ referring to JNU students who were agitating against fee hike, CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act] and NRC [National Register of Citizens]. Now, he has done it ‘by sending armed men’ to the JNU campus. Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah should step down immediately owning responsibility for the attack on JNU students. The Union government should ban all right wing organisations such as ABVP and Bajrang Dal that have been attacking innocent people and spreading hate and violence in the country,” K.

150,2020/01/07,‘Send proposals for allocations before Jan. 10’,"Minister for Animal Husbandry and Yadgir district in-charge Prabhu Chavan has directed officials of all government departments to submit fresh proposals for the 2020-21 budgetary allocations before January 10 after discussing issues with their taluk-level officers. Chairing a pre-budget meeting here, Mr. Chavan said that the district can get all the required infrastructure and witness development only if officials put in efforts in implementing projects. The district lacks development in various sectors, particularly health, education, industry, basic facilities, including drinking water and roads. Therefore, the officials concerned have to send fresh proposals, including identified works for public purpose, to get necessary grants in the budget for 2020-21, he added. He said that he would discuss with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa how to get works done once the Deputy Commissioner sends the proposals.

Responding to the Minister’s appeal, officials from various key departments explained the new proposals. Health officials said that ₹ 130 crore from the State’s share should be included in the allocation towards construction of a medical college and providing basic infrastructure, including hostels for boys and girls and residential quarters for doctors and other staff. The medical college will come up on 30 acres of land on the outskirts of Yadgir at a cost of ₹ 325 crore, including 60 % (₹ 195 crore) under the Union budget.

152,2020/01/07,"Students protest in Mysuru, Shivamogga, Hassan against JNU violence","Students gathered at Ramaswamy Circle in Mysuru on Monday to protest against the violence unleashed on the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on Sunday evening.

The students, who had come together under the aegis of All India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO), held aloft placards expressing their “solidarity with the victims of atrocities in JNU” and shouted slogans against the ‘goondaism’ and ‘hooliganism’ on the campus.

A statement issued on behalf of AIDSO’s Mysuru district unit said the “masked goondas belonging to Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), who were wielding iron rods and lathis” had unleashed terror on the JNU campus by attacking students and teachers.

The attackers targeted the students, who were protesting against the hike in fees by JNU, AIDSO claimed while describing as ‘shameful’ the alleged cooperation shown by the Delhi police to the goondaism on the campus.

AIDSO also accused the JNU administration of supporting violence by allowing the masked goondas to enter the campus and attack the students opposing the fee hike. Meanwhile, a group of activists from different organisations staged a demonstration in front of Ambedkar’s statue at Town Hall condemning the violence in JNU. The protest was led by social activist Shabbir Mustafa of the Save Constitution Committee.

In Shivamogga

Condemning the assault on students by masked men on the JNU campus, students from various colleges in Shivamogga city staged a protest on the premises of Deputy Commissioner’s office under the aegis of National Students Union of India (NSUI) on Monday.

Addressing the protest meet, Chethan K., vice-president of NSUI State unit, alleged that JNU students have been targeted for the protests they had staged against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens(NRC) recently.

He said there was a glaring failure by the Delhi police controlled by Ministry of Home Affairs to collect intelligence inputs on the incident and to provide security for the students.

Referring to the incidents of police beating up students on the campus of Jamia Milia Islamia University and the crackdown at Aligarh Muslim University during the protests against CAA, he said students who are against the CAA are being targeted in a systematic manner.

The intolerance displayed against the students for expressing their political views is against the democratic ethos of the land, he said.

The protesters raised slogans demanding a thorough probe into the JNU incident and arrest of the assailants at the earliest. They requested the President to take note of the atrocities being committed against students who have taken stand against CAA.

Memorandum

They submitted a memorandum to the President in this regard through the office of Deputy Commissioner. Functionaries of NSUI Balaji, Vinay, Vijay and Ravi took part in the protest.

The functionaries of Students United Movement staged a separate protest in the city condemning the attack on the students at JNU.

In Hassan

The Hassan district unit of the Students Federation of India, here on Monday, staged a protest condemning the assault on students and teaching faculty at JNU.

The protesters raised slogans against the ABVP and the Central government for the incident.

They staged a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office.

‘Barbaric’

Asha, district SFI president, said the incidents at JNU were ‘barbaric’. The police and the university administration remained mute spectators to the violence, she alleged. For the last two months, members of Jawaharlal Nehru University students’ union had been staging a protest against the fee hike. The ABVP attacked the students to stop their protest against the fee hike, she further alleged.

The protesters demanded that the Centre act against those who attacked the students and provide justice for the victims.

153,2020/01/07,Pre-budget consultation sees a gamut of suggestions,"A pre-budget consultation by Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi here on Monday saw a gamut of suggestions, mainly those pertaining to railway infrastructure and service sector, being made.

During the consultation held in association with Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), participants gave suggestions on improving railway infrastructure, emphasised on the need for reduction on direct tax rate, pointed out harassment by Income Tax officials, raised issues related to Goods and Services Tax and other sectors. The participants also stressed on the need for initiating steps to come out with an investment-friendly policy, particularly for drawing entrepreneurs and industrialists to North Karnataka, particularly Hubballi-Dharwad.

Expressing concern over harassment by Income Tax officials, Chairman of KCCI Tax Subcommittee Sumer Oswar, however, clarified that traders and industrialists were not averse to paying taxes but were facing hardships because of pressure tactics of the officials.

He said that there was a need for widening the tax net to bring in more players rather than bringing pressure to bear on existing traders, industrialists and businessmen who were already paying taxes. As several other participants raised concerns over the issue, Mr. Joshi told them that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government was taking steps to prevent human intervention in tax assessment. The tax officer would not have information about whom he was assessing as the process would be made online, he said.

Representatives of various organisations and associations and professionals from different sectors presented their suggestions during the consultation.

Responding to the suggestions, Mr. Joshi hinted that major economic reforms were on the card and several high-level teams were working on the proposed reforms that were aimed at building a ₹ 5 trillion economy.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jl3pfg/article30498161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HBHUBBALLIJOSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pre-budget-consultation-sees-a-gamut-of-suggestions/article30498162.ece

156,2020/01/07,Cabinet clears draft ordinance,"The Cabinet has cleared a draft ordinance for amending the Kerala State Cooperative Societies Act to facilitate the merger of the Malappuram District Cooperate Bank with the Kerala Bank.

As per the draft ordinance, the Act would be amended again to merge the Malappuram Bank with the Kerala Bank.

This would be done in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.

Even after the Assembly amending the Act in 2019 to do away with District Cooperative Banks, the director board of the Malappuram bank led by the United Democratic Front had refused to merge and decided to maintain the status quo.

Primary cooperative societies, urban cooperative banks in the district and employees of the bank had urged the government to initiate legal action to facilitate the merger.

Once the Act is amended and all 13 district banks become part of the new bank, the Malappuram bank alone will not be able to function as a separate entity. For, it will have to face issues such as the service of its employees, handling deposits and loans and also non-performing assets.

The Ordinance would expedite the merger and end the confusion over the issue, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cabinet-clears-draft-ordinance/article30506480.ece

158,2020/01/07,Violence in rural areas of Kozhikode,"A series of violent incidents in rural areas of Kozhikode in the wake of the legislation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act have raised fears of re-emergence of political violence ahead of the three-tier local body polls.

Te situation appears to be grim and going out of control in the Azhiyur area even as political parties have called for an all-party peace meeting.

Several houses belonging to Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bharatiya Janata Party workers came under attack from Sunday night and violence continued unabated till midnight on Monday. Miscreants vandalised the house of BJP State council member P.M. Ashokan while stones were thrown at the newly constructed CPI(M) Kunhippally branch office (K.P. Achyuthan Smaraka Mandiram). The house of CPI(M) local sectary M.V. Babu also came under attack.

Attacks at night

Most of the attacks were carried out at night. Rioters went on the rampage at Kunhippally, Avikkara, and Kallanmala. The houses were attacked with axes and iron rods. Windows were smashed, furniture destroyed, and doors razed down. Incidentally, houses of people who were not actively involved in politics were also attacked.

Not just houses, vehicles parked in porches bore the brunt of the rioters. About 15 vehicles were either partially damaged or destroyed. The police said three CPI(M) workers were arrested in connection with the incidents at Azhiyur.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/violence-in-rural-areas-of-kozhikode/article30506462.ece
159,2020/01/07,A new lease of life for tribal languages and art forms,"Model residential schools (MRS) have been set up across the country nearly two decades ago to ensure quality education for tribal students. Though the objective has been realised to a certain extent, authorities are yet to take any serious initiative to conserve tribal languages or art forms.

Now, the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), U.K., in association with the University of Leeds and the University of Lincoln, has come up with a pilot project in model residential schools in Wayanad district to address the issue.

The project is being implemented in the five MRSs with the support of the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (KDISC), Kerala Social Security Mission(KSSM), Department of Education, and Scheduled Tribes Development Department.

In the initial phase, the project aims to integrate tribal cultural heritage and performing arts with the mainstream school curriculum and make schools an open and safe space for tribal students to express their identities and share cultural practices, says Sreenath Nair, senior lecturer, College of Arts, University of Lincoln.

“We are planning a curriculum intervention using theatre as a medium to bring teachers, students, experts in general and tribal education, and the tribal community together to celebrate the richness of tribal arts, culture, and heritage,” he said.

“Theatre will also serve as a supportive tool for education as the project also intends to form theatre groups in each school which will meet weekly. The formation of theatre groups will not only ensure integration of tribal knowledge into formal education but it will also help in personality development and boosting the confidence of tribal students,” P.E .Usha, project manager, said.

Although the project will be implemented only in Wayanad, it aims to develop an educational tool kit that can be applied to all 20 MRSs in the State. The project was launched at Eklavya Model Residential School at Pookode in the district on Monday with a music session for students by K.J. Baby, a writer and film director from Wayanad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hsyam7/article30506446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvwymusicalsession1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-new-lease-of-life-for-tribal-languages-and-art-forms/article30506439.ece
160,2020/01/07,When fuel price hikes stop making news,"Not so long ago, fuel price increases used to hit the headlines often, leading to heated discussions, protests, and even rollback of prices, when public anger became too much to contain. However, since the introduction of dynamic fuel pricing by the Narendra Modi government, it had disappeared from the headlines and discussions, even though prices have been inching up by a few paises daily.

Though absent from public discourse, the common man is feeling the pinch of the daily fluctuations in prices, which have been invariably going up. One of the hardest hit are autorickshaw drivers in the city.

Drivers’ plight

“When petrol price increases by 40 paise, it means a reduction in savings of ₹30 for us daily. Imagine, how much we are losing through the increase of ₹5 or ₹6 in fuel prices in the gap of a few months. The minimum charge was fixed recently as ₹25. There will not be any increase in this for the next few years. No passenger would give us even a rupee extra after understanding our plight. The price of meals has increased from ₹40 to ₹60 while that of tea has increased from ₹5 to ₹8. While everyone else can increase prices at will, we have to be content with the fixed charges,” says K. Radhakrishnan, an auto driver at the Dewaswom Board junction stand.

Diesel price in the city which was at ₹70.77 on November 1 last year went up to ₹73.86 this month while petrol prices went up from ₹76 to ₹78.36 during the same period. It is predicted that this would go further up as a result of the ongoing tension between Iran and the U.S.

“Though initially I was not conscious of the daily price fluctuations, later I started paying attention when the pump visits started getting more frequent. Now, I use my motorcycle more often than the car,” says Jose George, who works in the insurance sector.

Promise rarely kept

According to the manager of a petrol pump at Pattom, the prices have only gone up and rarely fallen, although the promise in the early days of deregulation was that the benefit of fall in global crude oil prices would be passed on to the customer.

Government-run oil firms have put on hold the price increases only during important elections.

“Before the era of dynamic pricing, when crude oil prices hit ₹120-₹130 in the global market some years ago, the then government kept the prices here under control by subsidising public-sector oil companies. Two major private companies could not compete and they were forced to close many pumps. The deregulation and dynamic pricing has ensured that the private players and the public sector companies are selling at the same rates. This was a move to help these companies at the expense of the consumers,” said an office-bearer of an association of petrol pump owners.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xokl08/article30506211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tv-petrol-priceREV02col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/when-fuel-price-hikes-stop-making-news/article30506220.ece

165,2020/01/07,"MG University to study effect of Maradu implosion on air, water quality","A team of researchers from the Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) here will be at Maradu on Saturday to assess how the implosion of four apartment units there will affect the quality of ambient air and water.

The university has stationed its mobile ambient air pollution facility in front of the Maradu municipal office, located outside the exclusion zone established by the authorities.

The unit, according to the university officials, will start monitoring the presence of pollutants in the ambient air and water samples continuously over a week starting from January 10.

Continuous sampling

“The mobile unit, to be stationed at a corner of the civic administration office by assessing the wind direction, will study the short-term as well as long-term impact of the implosion on the local climate. The continuous sampling will provide more data on the peak time of emissions on that particular location,” said C.T. Aravindakumar, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the university, who heads the initiative.

According to him, the researchers will assess the presence of different air pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, SOx, NO, NO2, NO x, CO, CO2 and O3.

Additionally, three high-volume air sampler units have been installed at various locations to ascertain the presence of heavy metals such as led and organic chemicals in the air before and after the explosion.

Alongside, water samples to be collected from various waterbodies, including Vembanad Lake, will be analysed for determining the presence of heavy metals, turbidity and organic chemicals, before and after the implosion. Mr. Aravindakumar said this might be the first time such a study was being initiated for demolition of high rises in the Indian conditions.

“Besides mapping the pattern of the dust propagation, distribution and settlement, we will also compare it with similar studies taken up in the western countries to evaluate the differences,” he added.

The team is slated to come up with a preliminary report soon after the implosion and will commission a detailed study report in a later stage.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lfjdof/article30505721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvktmaradu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mgu-to-study-effect-of-implosion-on-air-water-quality/article30505722.ece

172,2020/01/07,Houses in Koodali panchayat to get piped natural gas soon,"Households in Koodali grama panchayat here will soon get piped natural gas (PNG).

In the first phase of the project, houses located on the stretch from Koodali to Kannur would be given PNG, said a senior official of the Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Limited (IOAGL).

In addition to the licence for Kannur, the IOAGL has been granted permission to implement the project in Palakkad, Thrissur, Kasargod, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, and Mahe, he said. The survey for the first phase had begun and PNG would be supplied to Koodali panchayat and surrounding areas as soon as the Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline project was commissioned. The panchayat would have a GAIL station from where gas would be supplied to the houses through the pipeline, he said.

A preliminary survey for laying the pipeline in Kannur city had been completed. Gas would be transported from the main station to various parts of the city by means of an eight-inch diameter steel pipe laid parallel to the road, he said.

From the main pipe, a polyethylene pipe would carry the cooking gas to houses.

Fixed rate

The officials said house owners would be charged at a fixed rate for the gas similar to the system adopted for drinking water connections.

Gas would be available at any time and unlike now, the customer need not wait for any gas cylinder to be delivered home. Natural gas being supplied through pipes was safe because it was lighter than LPG. Unlike LPG which sank to the bottom when it leaked from a cylinder, LNG would rise quickly in the air and dissipate as it was lighter than air, he said.

173,2020/01/07,Kuttanad bypoll a litmus test for both fronts,"The byelection for the Kuttanad Assembly seat is still months away, but it is already turning out to be a tall order for major political fronts in the State. The seat fell vacant after the death of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Thomas Chandy.

The feud in the Kerala Congress (M) between factions led by Jose K. Mani and P.J. Joseph has put the United Democratic Front (UDF) in a quandary. With both the factions laying claim to Kuttanad and a truce between them unlikely soon, a section in the Congress is pressing to take the seat back from the KC(M).

Amidst the tussle in the KC(M), the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee has deputed P.T. Thomas, MLA, and other leaders, who were in charge of the Aroor Assembly byelection, to coordinate UDF’s electioneering in Kuttanad.

According to Congress leaders, the party will not remain a mute spectator to the bickering in the KC(M). “We have not yet held any discussions with the KC(M) on taking the seat back. But the Congress leadership has conveyed its displeasure to leaders of the KC(M) factions,” said a Congress leader.

LDF candidate

In the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) may not be able to nominate a suitable candidate to replace Thomas Chandy, who won the seat thrice in a row. Although talks of fielding someone from the family of Thomas Chandy are doing the rounds, there are no grounds for the LDF to be complacent as it tries to retain the seat.

The CPI (M) district leadership had earlier demanded that the party take back the Kuttanad seat from the NCP. However, with 2021 Assembly election not far away, it is to be seen whether the LDF and CPI (M) would approve such a move.

The bypoll will also be a challenge to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In 2016, NDA candidate Subash Vasu of the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) had polled 33,044 votes in the Kuttanad constituency.

However, Mr. Vasu, who is general secretary of the BDJS, is now leading a rebellion against the BDJS and Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam leadership. BDJS president Thushar Vellappally said the BDJS candidate would be decided later.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qjsilr/article30506131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tv-Kuttanadrev-1colcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kuttanad-bypoll-a-litmus-test-for-both-fronts/article30505476.ece

Mr. Ramakrishnan said the government was examining whether Muthoot had committed a breach of contract by walking out of an agreement arbitrarily. He noted the firm had several retired IPS officers on its board as advisers. He accused the firm of repeatedly challenging the government.

The deceased have been identified as Sooraj Viswanathan, 35, his father Viswanathan , 65, mother Girija , 61, and Ajitha, 51, sister in-law of Viswanathan. The accident occurred around 5.45 a.m. on the Vaikom-Cherthala route. The bus was proceeding to Ernakulam from Vaikom.

Lost control

Preliminary investigations suggest that the bus driver lost control of the vehicle when the car suddenly entered the main road from a pocket road at a very high speed. After ramming the car, the bus went on to hit the compound wall of a property.

The mangled remains of the car had to be cut open to take the four persons outside. They, however, were declared brought dead at hospital. The deceased were on their way to a temple near Cherthala.

The incident occurred in the heart of city while Mr. Alexander was close to his company headquarters on Banerjee Road.

The City Central police registered a case and arrested two persons in connection with the attack. The arrested have been identified as Salim, 52, a headload worker, and Sasikumar, 54, a resident of Palluthury. A case has been registered against them invoking Sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to a senior Muthoot official Mr. Alexander sustained injuries behind his left ear. He continued be in hospital. His condition is stable.

The attack appears to be the fallout of a standoff between the company management and a group of employees who are on strike since January 2 demanding that around 160 of their colleagues sacked since December last year be reinstated.

CITU blamed

The company management blamed activists of CPI(M)-affiliated Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) for orchestrating the attack while the secretary of the Non Banking Finance Company Employees’ Association C.C. Ratheesh blamed the management for triggering a drama over the strike in the company. “We were all at the venue of the strike and we have nothing to do with the attack on Mr. Alexander,” he said. Meanwhile, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) condemned the attack on Mr. Alexander.

“Industry and trade are all deeply concerned about the ongoing agitation and forcible blockade by a major political trade union against Muthoot Finance Ltd. in Kerala,” said a statement issued here. Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the police to chalk out modalities for providing protection to the employees who had been granted police protection by the court.

177,2020/01/07,Sabarimala case: no dissenting judge part of Constitution Bench,"None of the three Supreme Court judges who dissented at various points in the Sabarimala litigation is part of the nine-judge Constitution Bench, which will hear, from January 13, over 60 petitions challenging the entry of women of menstruating age into the temple in Kerala.

The court on Tuesday published the names of the judges who would be part of the Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde. The other judges are Justices R. Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L. Nageswara Rao, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, S. Abdul Nazeer, R. Subhash Reddy, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant.

Justices Indu Malhotra, A.M. Khanwilkar, Rohinton Nariman and D.Y. Chandrachud are not part of the Bench.

Justice Indu Malhotra had been the lone dissenter on September 28, 2018, when the court, in a 4:1 decision, quashed the rule that barred women aged 10-50 from entering and worshipping at the temple.

Justices Nariman and Chandrachud, part of the Review Bench, had jointly dissented from the majority decision on November 14, 2019, to refer the issue to a larger Bench. Justice Nariman, in a strongly worded minority opinion for himself and Justice Chandrachud, ordered Kerala to follow the rule of law and grant women pilgrims protection.

Incidentally, Justice Khanwilkar, who is also not a part of the nine-judge Bench, had agreed with the majority decision on September 28, 2018, and November 14, 2019.

The nine-judge Bench would essentially set the parameters for a judicial review in cases, especially public interest litigation petitions, touching on customs and practices believed to be essential to a religion. In the Sabarimala case, the review petitions argued that the entry of women of menstruating age is against the essential practice and belief associated with the temple and its deity.

In the Shirur Mutt case in 1954, a seven-judge Bench had, for the first time, gone into what constituted “essential religious practices”. The court had held, “What constitutes the essential part of a religion is primarily to be ascertained with reference to the doctrines of that religion itself.” It had said the state was not meant to regulate religious practices. Under Article 25(2)(a) of the Constitution, it said, the state regulation could only extend to religious practices and activities which were economic, commercial or political.

The nine-judge Bench may now examine this judgment delivered 65 years ago.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/yngef/article26192145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-sabarimala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-case-no-dissenting-judge-part-of-constitution-bench/article30504831.ece
178,2020/01/07,Maradu demolition: Blast preparations reaching final stage,"Preparations for carrying out controlled implosions of four Maradu apartments have entered the final stages with three days left for the event.

H2O Holy Faith, with a height of 68 metres, will be the tallest building in India to be thus demolished. After loading the building with explosives the other day, explosives experts completed their job at the first tower of Alfa Serene on Tuesday. As many as 1,500 holes were dug in the building and 200 kg of explosives loaded. The explosives in the holes were connected using 5,500 metre-long detonating wires.

In Jain Coral Cove, 1,471 holes were drilled to load 215 kg of explosives and 15,000-metre-long detonating wires used, said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives.

The loading of explosives in the second tower of Alfa Serene and Golden Kayaloram began on Tuesday afternoon and will be completed by Wednesday evening.

Joint inspection

A joint inspection of the sites will be held 24 hours before the blast on Friday. Experts from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, the Ernakulam District Collector and police will carry out the inspection in the morning.

Experts from companies and their mining engineers will carry out the final inspection on January 11.

The sirens for issuing signals arrived at the site and were handed over to the authorities concerned, said Dr. Venugopal.

Control room

The Maradu municipality office will function as the control room for the blasts and it will be headed by Snehil Kumar Singh, Fort Kochi RDO in charge of the demolition.

Besides municipal officials, representatives of the police, Fire and Rescue Services and medical personnel would be stationed at the control room. It would be from the control room that all emergency and rescue management activities would be coordinated, said Mr. Singh.

Experts from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, will place 10 seismographs at strategic points to gauge the vibrations that would be generated when the buildings hit the ground. The IIT team members will be inside the 200-m exclusion zone demarcated by the authorities. Red flags indicating the boundary of the exclusion zone will be erected on Friday.

Other than the ambulances and fire tenders, no vehicles will be permitted inside the exclusion zone.

Power supply

Power supply to the area will be switched off at 9 a.m. The two ends of the Kundannur bridge that runs next to H2O Holy Faith will be blocked five minutes before the blast.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said the agitating Muthoot employees had not waylaid their employer. “It is not their method,” he said. A police probe was on to identify the real culprits.

CITU Kerala president Anathalavattom Anandan said the police should investigate whether the firm had stage-managed the attack to tarnish the image of the striking employees. The Kerala High Court is due to hear their case against the management soon.

The agitators, who had mustered under the banner of the CITU, had accused Mr. Alexander of unilaterally violating the wage and service accord they had struck with the firm in October.

The Labour Department had mediated the agreement in the presence of the observer appointed by the High Court. The firm had agreed to reinstate dismissed employees and open shuttered branches.

185,2020/01/07,Malabar migration: is the dream coming to an end?,"The pastures of Malabar are no longer as green or inviting as they used to be. Most of the agrarian patches in the hilly terrains are now more like abandoned ships in the making, in fact. For, the second and third generations of migrated settler farmers are in search of greener pastures elsewhere.

Malabar’s unexplored land with its invigorating petrichor beckoned the poverty-stricken villages of central Travancore in the 1920s. The highlands of this region appeared to be their promised land to transcend the days of hand-to-mouth existence. With their humble belongings, they packed for their own exodus. It was the beginning of their new innings as Malabar’s enterprising green thumbs.

The peasant immigration, which was in full swing during the 1945-1970 period, changed Malabar forever – geographically, culturally, socially, and economically, as large tracts of uncultivated cheap land were transformed into productive fields. It was not plain sailing for them. They fought wild animals and deadly diseases. But they tilled the land for survival. Rural settlements popped up. Food and cash crops set the financial rhythm of life in those settlements.

Little wonder that the sweat of enterprising settlers left an impressive mark of development on Malabar’s most sought after hinterlands. Around 80% of settlers were from Kottayam, Idukki, and Ernakulam who also brought home their unique culture, faith practices, and a distinct dialect of Malayalam.

However, the inherited agriculture land is no more an attraction for many. Price fall and poor yield have doused their enthusiasm; wild animals continue to pose threat to their lives and crops; recurring natural calamities in high ranges are persuading them to think of a second exodus to safer lands. Once the backbone of urban markets, the hill produce is constantly on the decline.

There is no denying the fact that the region is witnessing irreversible change in the highland eco-system. Unregulated mining in the Western Ghats area is the main reason. The adverse impact is only too true: fresh air, water, and fertile land are now a bygone bliss in many settler villages. To cap it all, for many nuclear families of the third generation, the available patches of land in their agrarian villages are just properties to be sold in the realty market.

The changing pattern of landholding too is serving as an impetus for a second exodus. When a majority of the first generation migrants had high extent of land, their sons or daughters got only one-fourth of it or even less as inherited property due to partition. This fragmentation of cultivable landholdings subsequent to family partitioning or resale for financial needs is forcing many to shift their vocation to non-agricultural fields.

The good news is that many of the educated youngsters in settler belts have emerged as breadwinners for their parents who have been fighting a losing battle with the traditional vocation. True, the boom in careers like nursing and hotel management abroad has saved many youths and their families. Educational loans too helped several underprivileged farmers give professional education to their children and prepare them better for the new-gen job market.

There is room for hope, though. A reverse migration of those youngsters may give some respite to the old captains with their forsaken agri-ships in the settler belts. The possible comeback of professionally trained youths to their agriculture roots with their expertise, wealth, and passion make them dream of a future that is green, once again.

But it remains to be seen how realistic those hopes are.

188,2020/01/07,Unions’ strike call may get support in State,"The State is likely to witness a virtual shutdown on Wednesday with a majority of trade unions across the political spectrum set to participate in the nationwide 24-hour general strike called in protest against the Centre’s labour policies.

Milk and newspaper supply, hospital and other essential services, the tourism sector and vehicles transporting Sabarimala pilgrims have been exempted from the strike, which will begin on Tuesday midnight. The trade unions have solicited the support of the trading community to make the strike a success. Unorganised workers in shopping malls and commercial establishments have also been urged to participate.

‘Historic victory’

Leaders of the Joint Action Committee of Trade Unions, an umbrella organisation of nearly 20 trade unions, have said the strike is certain to become a ‘historic victory’ in the State with a majority of labourers, government, public sector, bank, insurance and BSNL employees participating.

Addressing mediapersons, CITU State secretary Elamaram Kareem said that while 20 crore workers had participated in the general strike in the country a year ago, many more were likely to agitate against the Centre’s policies this time. Besides being backed by parties including the Shiv Sena for the first time, the strike is also expected to gain traction in National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled States, including Bihar.

Minimum wages

Mr. Kareem accused the Union government of scuttling the critical provisions in the legislation pertaining to fixing minimum wages. The Code on Wages, passed recently, has subsumed four legislation and has empowered the government to fix minimum wages even without the recommendation of the advisory body on minimum wages. “The government has decided to implement a daily minimum wage of ₹178, much less than the rate of ₹376 recommended by an expert panel constituted in 2017. On the basis of scientific considerations, we have demanded that the monthly minimum wage be fixed at ₹21,000,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unions-strike-call-may-get-support-in-state/article30497427.ece

The movie is said to be inspired from the life of GR Gopinath, the founder of Air Deccan. Suriya’s name in the film was earlier revealed to be Maaran and the actor has also rapped for a song in the film titled Maara Theme composed by GV Prakash.

The biographical film, jointly produced by Suriya’s 2D Entertainment and Guneet Monga, boasts a stellar cast including Aparna Balamurali, Jackie Shroff, Karunas, Mohan Babu and Paresh Rawal in prominent roles.

190,2020/01/07,"Telugu remake of ‘96’ titled ‘Jaanu’, first look is released","Cinematographer-turned-director Prem Kumar’s directorial début, 96, was received with open arms when it hit screens in 2018. Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha Krishnan in lead roles, the romantic drama opened to rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, and became successful at the box office. The movie was particularly appreciated for its music by Govind Vasantha, especially the song Anthaathi.

Now, the Telugu remake of 96 has been titled Jaanu, the character name of Trisha in the Tamil original. The makers on Tuesday released the first look poster of Jaanu, featuring Sharwanand.

191,2020/01/07,Mehreen Pirzada looks forward to 'Pattas' and 'Entha Manchivadavura',"Mehreen Kaur Pirzada might have had delivered many successful films but she is eagerly waiting for this Sankranti like never before. Two of her films, one Tamil — Pattas with Dhanush and Entha Manchivadavura with Kalyan Ram are hitting the screens this month. Towards the end of the month there is Aswathama with Naga Shourya.

Not all films will offer her a huge space like in F2; is she ready for that? “I believe one can make a difference with a two-minute appearance on screen. I am not a writer and director. All I can do is deliver the best from what is given to me and is expected of me. I hope and pray I get something better with each film. Also I notice a vast change in the Telugu film industry; it isn’t how it used to be when I started out. My role as Mahalakshmi in Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gaadha is not something one often gets. Take other movies where my colleagues got to do some fantastic work... be it in Oh Baby! or Mahanati — people are welcoming women in central roles,” she says.

Mehreen emphasises that she narrates the story in Entha Manchivadavura. She plays Nandini, fondly addressed as Nandu in the film. She and the hero are childhood friends and she helps him in his journey but he doesn’t respond as she expects. It is a role she is proud of and is waiting for the audience’s reaction.

From the beginning of her career, Mehreen enjoyed good offers with great footage — be it Mahanubhavudu or Raja The Great. Out of the 16 films she had worked in, 13 of them had been quite satisfactory and Mehreen says she learns something new from her work each day. “I learn from my mistakes and never think that I am already 16 films old. I have already begun thinking in Telugu,” she smiles.

Mehreen’s role in F2 was very entertaining. She acknowledges the compliments humbly and credits all the success to her director Anil Ravipudi. Doing comedy is tough but Mehreen pulled it off naturally. She recalls, “He had so much faith in me and I promised that I’ll give it all to this character. “I feel it is more difficult to be yourself on screen. There were certain parts where I am funny and I am actually funny in real life too. I have those childish traits, I don’t think before I speak, I laugh uncontrollably and don’t worry about someone watching me. I am blessed yo have got that role. Twenty years later, if people remember F2, they will remember my character Honey too.”

Coming to Entha Manchivadavura, she shares the way director Satish Vegesna functions; he tells the actors what he expects from them and then gives them a free hand. A debut director Teja with whom she worked also has equal clarity; he comes without a baggage and wants to give his all to the story. He is supportive and open minded. The film has come out really well. Mehreen honestly admits that her role in it isn’t fresh or challenging, . Nevertheless, she adds, it helps to be a part of a successful film at the end of the day.

Finally we ask Mehreen what she does to de-stress? “I love travelling, it helps me unwind, take off my stress. If you haven’t travelled, you are still on the first page of the book. What books can’t teach, travel experiences do.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/afgx2o/article30502711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym08mehreen2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mehreen-kaur-pirzada-on-her-new-releases-pattas-with-dhanush-entha-manchivadavura-with-kalyan-ram-and-aswathama-with-naga-shourya/article30502713.ece
192,2020/01/07,Todd Phillips’ ‘Joker’ leads BAFTA nominations with 11 nods,"Dark drama Joker led the nominations for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards on Tuesday, earning 11 nods at the United Kingdom's top movie honours.

Martin Scorsese's gangster movie The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood followed with 10 nominations each.

Immersive World War One drama 1917 got nine nominations.

That movie, which uses a long-shot format to follow two young British soldiers sent on a mission across enemy lines, triumphed at Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony where it picked up best drama and best director for Briton Sam Mendes.

The four movies will compete against South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's darkly comic Parasite for best film at the Feb. 2 awards in London as well as for best director.

Joaquin Phoenix's turn in Joker, where he transforms from vulnerable loner into confident villain, won him a BAFTA leading actor nomination. He will compete against Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Adam Driver for Netflix divorce drama Marriage Story, Taron Egerton in Elton John musical biopic Rocketman and Jonathan Pryce in papal drama The Two Popes.

Nominees for leading actress featured Scarlett Johansson for Marriage Story, Saoirse Ronan for Little Women, Charlize Theron for Bombshell, Jessie Buckley for Wild Rose and Renee Zellweger for Judy, in which she plays actress Judy Garland, a role which won her a Golden Globe on Sunday.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4jisdr/article30502460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILMREVIEW-JOKER,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/todd-phillips-joker-leads-bafta-nominations-with-11-nods/article30502461.ece
193,2020/01/07,Rashmika Mandanna: ‘The comedy in Sarileru Neekevvaru has a lot of physicality involved’,"Rashmika Mandanna gives a characteristic shrug when she says ‘never before, ever after’, the phrase that’s become popular from the trailer of Sarileru Neekevvaru.

Taking time out for this interview at Annapurna Studios, with barely days to go for the release of the much-hyped film, she says, “I never thought I could make people laugh. When I did my first Telugu film Chalo, it was to see if people here would accept me. In Geetha Govindam I had to be angry and grumpy most of the time, which I am not in real life. My friends said I was slowly turning into a grumpy Geetha off screen as well. And in Dear Comrade I cried quite a bit. With Sarileru I got to laugh and hopefully will make everyone laugh.”

She punctuates our brief conversation with a lot of laughter. Those who’ve seen her on set know her as someone full of life and eager to talk. But she admits that enacting the comedy portions wasn’t that simple. “There was a lot of physicality involved,” she says, throwing up her arms and imitating some of the exaggerated body language her character demanded. “Anil sir [director Anil Ravipudi] helped me with it,” she adds.

Rashmika was 19 when she acted in her first film Kirrik Party (Kannada); it was a blockbuster. At 23, she feels she has become responsible with the recognition after each film. “Initially it was all about giving acting a try. It (Kirrik Party) was welcomed so well that I realised it’s a responsibility to be an actor. When people give you so much love, you’ve got to give back by choosing good, entertaining films. I am trying to experiment and see what I am capable of. I am evolving, have learnt Telugu, and believe that even in a film with a normal storyline and script, I can bring in some value addition,” she avers.

Sarileru Neekevvaru places Rashmika amid established actors — Mahesh Babu, Vijayashanthi, Sangeetha, Prakash Raj and others — and she says about breaking the ice, “I’ve acted in big films before, but the co-stars there were more like friends. The thought of acting with superstars like Mahesh and Vijayashanti ma’am made me nervous. I went in thinking what do I do now! I started talking to them, understanding how they built their careers. Soon I was like ‘they were also new at one point; they are also normal people’. I have huge respect for them and slowly, I started being myself on sets. I had fun and didn’t pretend to be mature beyond my age in their presence. It came to a point where, in all seriousness, we would discuss which flavour of ice cream is good.”

Rashmika has signed up director Sukumar’s next project starring Allu Arjun, and director Venky Kudumula’s Bheeshma is up for release in February. She’s also a part of the Karthi-starrer Sultan (Tamil). She signed these films before the release of Dear Comrade, in which she played the vulnerable cricketer Lilly who faces sexual harassment. “Unless you put your work out there, a lot of people don’t realise what you are capable of. My work got noticed. I realised I cannot be just an eye candy any more. All the three films I am doing now have such different roles,” she says.

She remembers getting emotional while filming the climax of Dear Comrade: “Vijay [Deverakonda] and [director] Bharat Kamma talked to me about how women express their anger when they are pushed to their limits. I got so involved emotionally. I could imagine how a girl caught in such a situation would react,” she says, signing off.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kqir/article30502276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rashmika-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rashmika-mandanna-talks-about-trying-comedy-for-the-first-time-in-mahesh-babu-and-vijayashanthi-starrer-sarileru-neekevvaru/article30502277.ece
194,2020/01/07,"Satish Vegesna pits his 'Entha Manchivadavura’ against biggies this Sankranti, yet another time","A few years back Satish Vegesna’s Sathamanam Bhavati was pitted against big films for Sankranti release and it emerged a winner and even won a National Award. This year too, his Entha Manchivadavura starring Kalyan Ram and Mehreen Kaur, will be releasing around the same time,competing with Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikunthapurramloo and Mahesh Babu’s Sarileru Neekevvaru, directed by Trivikram Srinivas and Anil Ravipudi respectively.

Satish believes his story has an audience and it is coming out at a time after people would have finished watching the other two. Ask him if his films and its titles aren’t driving away youth from the theatres, aren’t his family dramas getting too moralistic? He admits that his films Srinivasa Kalyanam or Sathamanam Bhavati are message-oriented but Entha Manchivadavura will be a commercial film, with the message not being so pronounced. “All the titles of my films are positive. They are in tune with the characters and not an exercise in elevating the hero’s image in the market. In this film we show that to spread love, one need not be related by blood. When we help and are good to others, our families and society prosper. The hero is one such character who everyone considers a manchi abbayi (good boy).”

The film is Aditya Music’s first venture into movie production. A friend of the producer apparently saw a Gujarati film and suggested that it could work in Telugu as well, so rights were brought and Satish made 70 % percent changes in his style. The core point was however kept untouched. Satish observes the film has a universal point, “When I saw it, I thought it was like one of the stories I write. The director of Oxygen came to the sets and watched the shoot, he was happy with the changes and is planning to direct it in Hindi as well.” He also reveals that the story is inspired by a Japanese man Ishii Yuichi who started ‘Rent a Friend’ business wherein he sends people as emotional support; it has a business angle too. In this film, the business part has been deleted and the story is made to suit the native audience.

Satish adds, “Sometimes, you need to talk to someone when you are alone. One needs to find that ‘someone’ to talk to for emotional support. A man says his daughter is upset because his mother died and perhaps a grandmother could help her. So a person in an old age home is approached and sent to their home.”The film is told in an entertaining way. Rajiv Kanakala plays the villain. Annapurna does a one-minute role but adds value to the story. Mehreen, Tanikella Bharani, Baladitya, Suhasini, Sarat Babu, Subhalekha Sudhakar are the rest of the cast.

Satish signs off, “I was aware that I was dealing with a commercial hero but I didn’t drive the story for him. The character is important here.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9gidum/article30502232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07-satish1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/satish-vegesna-is-confident-about-entha-manchivadavura-starring-kalyan-ram/article30502236.ece

197,2020/01/07,A.R. Rahman launches collaborative project to curate and celebrate the sounds of Tamil Nadu,"Music composer A.R. Rahman’s birthday on Monday saw the announcement of ‘Ta Futures’, a collaborative culture project that would curate and celebrate the sounds of Tamil Nadu.

“While this idea initially started off like a city symphony project where we were looking at capturing the sounds of the city, I wanted to make it more participatory. In children, particularly, I want it to trigger a whole different thought process as this is not about film music or film stars and I want them to create and compose their future,” said Mr. Rahman.

Announcing his collaboration with filmmaker Bharat Bala and Tod Machover, a composer known for innovation in the technology of music, Mr. Rahman said that the focus would be on capturing the culture of Tamil Nadu and bringing it out in the form of a new creative expression. “I’ve travelled to so many places and I find talented people from our State everywhere. We have the blessing of a large population and I want to facilitate nurturing and sharing of knowledge,” he added.

The launch saw several artistes taking to the stage and performing short instrumental pieces. While children from the LEAP Boundary Breakers choir led by Srinivas Krishnan sang, art director Thotta Tharani painted the logo of ‘Ta Futures’ to the music. Mr. Bala said that they would soon launch a website which would detail how the project would be participatory. “We will be capturing and creating sounds as well as inviting people to pitch in. As a curated culture project, we hope to discover so much more about Tamil Nadu and the people,” he said.

Having envisioned the project as something beyond a song or even a concert, the team behind ‘Ta Futures’ said that they have a lot of ideas on what shape it would take. “It can be museums or even art installations. We want ‘Ta Futures’ to instigate and create a kind of energy which will produce something unique and this will revolutionise the way people hear Chennai and Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Rahman said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/57nkrv/article30498094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AR-Rahman,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ar-rahman-launches-collaborative-project-to-curate-and-celebrate-the-sounds-of-tamil-nadu/article30498095.ece
198,2020/01/07,Governor’s reference to ‘dual citizenship’ for Sri Lankan Tamils triggers debate,"Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s address to the Assembly on Monday, in which he advocated dual citizenship for Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka living in Tamil Nadu, has triggered a debate on the advisability of such a proposal.

According to Prof. V. Suryanarayan, founding Director of the Centre for South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of Madras, the Governor could have avoided the reference in his customary address. Prof. Suryanarayan, who has been studying the subject for years, points out that there is no sanction in the country’s Constitution for dual citizenship. The Centre may never agree to the idea, he feels.

It is for the first time that the matter was included in the Governor’s address, even though it was floated by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in April 2016 during her campaign for the Assembly elections. But, the issue did not figure in the address of Governor K. Rosaiah in June 2016 to the Assembly, despite Jayalalithaa retaining power. However, it was included in the memorandum submitted by Jayalalithaa to Prime Minister Narendra Modi around the same time.

The rationale behind the demand is to help the refugees get employment or run businesses in the country “without any hindrance.” Since then, the issue has been raised by her successors, O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

In the light of recent criticism by the Opposition on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act excluding from its ambit the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, Mr. Palaniswami raised the issue during his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah.

To substantiate his position that the Governor should have avoided the reference, Prof. Suryanarayan recalls instances wherein Governors of other States did not toe fully with the text of what their State governments had prepared. To illustrate a few cases, in March 1969, the then West Bengal Governor Dharma Vira skipped portions of the address to the Assembly. In January 2018, Kerala Governor P. Sathasivam left out certain portions of his address which, he felt, used a strong language used against the Central government.

Naturalisation option

However, the academician strongly supports the idea of giving Indian citizenship to refugees who prefer it. He suggests: “If the Central government withdraws its instruction to the State government — issued first in 1983 and reiterated in 2007 — not to entertain applications for citizenship from the refugees, a large number of willing refugees will be eligible to apply for citizenship, under the option of naturalisation.”

Differing with him, former Madras High Court judge K. Chandru, says Governors can communicate objections to the governments if they feel certain references are not proper. However, once the text is approved finally, there is not much choice left for them.

Asked whether it is proper on the Governor’s part to refer to a matter, which falls exclusively under the domain of the Union government, Mr Chandru says that even on foreign policy or matters of international implications, the Tamil Nadu Assembly in the past adopted resolutions, some of which got included in the Governor’s addresses too. Recently, the Kerala Assembly adopted a resolution, calling upon the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.

Two prominent jurists, wishing to remain anonymous, say there is nothing wrong in such a reference, as such an address reflects “aspirations” of the State government. After all, the demand for dual citizenship is “only a recommendation” of the government, they add.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2x8k6d/article30503432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH--GOVERNOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/governors-address-on-dual-citizenship-for-sri-lankan-tamils-triggers-debate/article30503433.ece
199,2020/01/07,Padma Bhushan artist Akbar Padamsee no more,"Celebrated painter and artist Akbar Padamsee died at the Isha Yoga Center near Coimbatore late on Monday night.

One of the most versatile and prolific artists of the modern age, Akbar Padamsee, a long-time resident of Isha, passed away at 91, owing to natural causes arising out of ageing. His last rites were performed at the Yoga Center yesterday.

Paying tribute to the artist, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, Founder, Isha Foundation said “Akbar Padamsee, a genius of colour and craft, it has been our fortune to have you spend the last part of your life with us at Isha Yoga Center. Generations to come shall relish and be inspired by your magic of colour.”

For the last few years, Padamsee and his wife Bhanu were residents of the Isha Yoga Center. After having visited the Yoga Center a few times, they decided to move in there permanently.

Padamsee refused to fit into any artistic compartment and he had earlier said, “Do not label me or my art.” His paintings extensively depicted the elements and senses. “It is actually Shiva’s Metascape,” he said of a form he seemed to have a special affinity to. “I came to know about Dhyanalinga through books. The moment I saw the picture of the Dhyanalinga temple on the cover of a book, I knew that I was looking at a 21st century temple,” he had earlier said, referring to the famous yogic temple at the Yoga Center, a release from Isha said.

Though Akbar Padamsee was best known for his radical paintings, he was also a photographer, sculptor, film-maker, engraver and lithographer. But Padamsee was most recognized and decorated for his paintings which have found a place of prominence in eminent galleries in India and around the world. His brother was the celebrated late film-maker and ad-man Alyque Padamsee.

Born into a Muslim family, Padamsee embraced a free-spirited seeking that were reflected in the versatile themes of his work. He was deeply influenced by Vivekananda’s commentary on the yogasutras of Patanjali. He studied Shilpa Shastra, the ancient text on the art of sculpting and confessed to spending hours perfecting the dimensions that the text specified, a release from Isha added

Padamsee was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2010. He was also awarded Fellowships by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the JD Rockefeller Foundation apart from recognition by several global art bodies. The family took on the name ‘Padamsee’ when his grandfather earned the title “Padmashree” after he distributed his entire granary to his village in Kutch during a famine.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8c4h9j/article30502512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH-AKBAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/padma-bhushan-artist-akbar-padamsee-no-more/article30502513.ece
200,2020/01/07,Court dismisses Karti Chidambaram discharge plea in tax evasion case,"The judge of the special court for cases related to elected MPs and MLAs in Chennai, has dismissed a discharge petition filed by Congress Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Chidambaram in a case relating to the alleged non-disclosure of income for the financial year 2015-16 and evasion of tax.

Officials had earlier alleged that Mr. Karti had received ₹6.38 crore in cash while his wife received ₹1.35 crore in cash during that financial year. The transaction has come to light when IT sleuths had conducted inquiries with employees of Agni Estates Foundation, the firm which purchased land near Muttukadu belonging to the Chidambaram family, according to sources.

On December 1, 2015, the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax officials, during a search on the premises of Advantage and Chess Global and other places with which Mr. Karti was associated, had seized electronic evidence which purportedly contained evidence on the money transfer in the case. The ED and IT department had submitted this to the court in December 2018 along with a printout of documents, which the Court had reviewed recently.

Judge D. Lingeswaran rejected the plea of the accused that hard drives cannot be admitted as evidence. He noted that it is clear that the hard drives in question were seized from Chess Global Advisory Services Services and the seized hard drives were sealed properly and they were under custody. So far there is no reason to believe that the incriminating contents were voluntarily inserted by the officers who seized it, the Judge said.

Judge D. Lingeswaran also said that the small note books seized from Agni Group showing alleged cash payments and also the sworn statements of its officials K. Narayanan and Jayaprakash recorded by Rohan Raj, Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation) and the complainant can be considered as evidence,

The judge dismissed the discharge petition stating that there are adequate grounds to presume the accused has committed offences.

The chunk of ambergris, a waxy solid substance that is an intestinal secretion of sperm whales, was first spotted by Ashok Kumar, a fisherman of Devanampattinam on the shore at around 6 a.m. He informed other fishermen, who mistook it for a floating object and alerted the Marine Police and Forest Department.

According to E. Karthavarayan, Deputy Director of the Fisheries Department, the Marine Police and Forest Department personnel went to the coastal village and took possession of the rare find. He said that the import and export of ambergris was banned and possession of the substance was punishable under the Customs Act. The Forest Department will seek the permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden to destroy it, he said.

Mr. Karthavarayan said the ambergris found was pale white in colour denoting that it may be a few days old.

Sperm whales mainly prey on squids, and the undigested portions are eliminated through their vomit. Ambergris is mainly used in perfumes and cosmetics and fetches a handsome price based on its age.

202,2020/01/07,TN Local Body Polls: Counting of votes for four wards in Tiruvannamalai to be on Wednesday,"The deferred counting of votes for four posts in the local body elections in Tiruvannamalai district is to be held on Wednesday. District Election Officer and Collector, K.S. Kandasamy had earlier ordered the countermanding of the counting of votes after the report of missing names of contestants in the supplementary voters list.

After the acceptance of their nominations, it was found that one of the contestants’ name was missing in Ernamangalam Village in Kalasapakkam block; Aanaibogi village in Peranamallur block, in wards 19 and 26 of the Chengam Panchayat Union.

As per the provisions of the Election Rules the ballots were separated and stored in treasuries of the respective blocks when the counting was taken up last Thursday.

203,2020/01/07,"CBI probes transfer of ₹1,038.34 cr. to Hong Kong","The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against 48 Chennai-based companies, three individuals and unknown officials of various banks for having allegedly transferred ₹1,038.34 crore in unaccounted cash to Hong Kong in 2014-15.

Bank accounts opened in the names of these companies were allegedly used to receive money from a large number of accounts in different parts of the country and divert it to the accounts of several firms in Hong Kong.

The three individuals have been identified as Mohammad Ibramsa Johny, a resident of Sivaganga and Zinta Midhar and Nizamuddin from Chennai.

The case is based on information received from a source about the transfer of black money through foreign remittances, mostly by residents of Chennai, in connivance with bank officials.

In all, 51 current accounts for the 48 firms were opened in four branches of the Bank of India, the Punjab National Bank and the State Bank of Mysore for transferring the funds, the FIR alleged. As many as 24 of these accounts were used for outward remittances in foreign currency — valued around ₹488.39 crore back then — on the pretext of advance payment for import of goods, while the other accounts were used for outward transfers totalling ₹550 crore, purportedly for foreign travel by Indian tourists. It is alleged that the companies had submitted identification papers and certificate of import-export codes issued in the name of 25 firms, of which only 10 had made imports in small quantities. The value of the imported goods was much lower than that which was declared in the invoices submitted by the companies to the banks concerned at the time of transferring the funds abroad.

The persons who facilitated the transactions were paid commissions, and bank officials were bribed. Most of the transactions were made in the second half of 2015. The annual turnover of the firms was shown in lakhs, while the funds sent abroad were in crores.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cbi-probes-transfer-of-103834-cr-to-hong-kong-via-chennai-firms/article30498222.ece
204,2020/01/07,Poor performance in eight districts dragged AIADMK down in rural polls,"The poor performance of the AIADMK in eight districts in the recent elections to rural local bodies has substantially brought down its overall tally in terms of district panchayat wards, when compared to the 2011 polls.

The districts in question are: Tiruvannamalai, Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Tiruvallur, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai and Nagapattinam. In these districts alone, the loss of district panchayat wards for the party was 126. Eight years ago, the AIADMK secured 473 wards in the 27 districts on its own, whereas now, it has netted only 214 wards, apart from its allies winning 28 wards.

In 2011, Tiruvannamalai was one of the two districts (the other district being Vellore) where the AIADMK’s score exceeded 30. It had captured 31 wards then, whereas this time, the party has got only nine seats. Thanjavur was another district where it bagged 27 wards during the previous elections. But this time, the figure is just 6.

In Tiruvallur, in the northern region of the State, the ruling party has managed to obtain only five seats, as against 23 in 2011. The figures for wards secured by the party this time in other districts, with the 2011 tally in brackets, are: Dindigul - 7 (22); Tiruchi – 5 (22); Pudukottai – 8 (20): Nagapattinam - 5 (17) and Ramanathapuram – 4 (15). Even in the western belt, where the AIADMK has done far better than in other regions of the State this time, the most recent performance was worse than the party’s showing in the previous elections.

For example, in Salem, the home district of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the party previously made a clean sweep with 29 seats. This time, it got a majority of the wards by winning 18 of them.

A.S. Maheshwari, the party’s spokesperson, says the 2019 performance should not be compared with that of 2011, when Jayalalithaa was at the helm.

“If at all you want to make a comparison, you will have to take the party’s showing in the Lok Sabha polls into account,” she argues, adding that since then, the party has been making efforts to regain lost ground.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ehu4j6/article30497957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07AIADMK-performancecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/poor-performance-in-eight-districts-dragged-aiadmk-down-in-rural-polls/article30497958.ece
205,2020/01/07,Male relatives take oath while women councillors stand aside in Krishnagiri,"While the presence of a large number of women candidates in the electoral fray during the panchayat polls was a welcome sight, it was disconcerting to see the spouses of elected women representatives standing in their place and even taking oath on their behalf during the swearing-in ceremony.

This is what happened to some elected district panchayat ward councillors in Krishnagiri.

For instance, newly-elected ward 4 councillor of a district panchayat, M. Anita, stood aside to let her husband take the oath in her place, in the presence of officials.

Of the 23 ward councillors of the district panchayat, 13 were women. In the case of four women councillors, their male relatives took the oath while the elected representatives watched.

The powers of district panchayats are second only to those of the Collector, vis-à-vis the ability to sanction funds for the development of the district. The local body elections, which saw the reservation of 50% of the seats for women, was lauded for being progressive.

The Hindu spoke to the Project Director of the District Rural Development Agency, C. Periasamy — who presided over the oath-taking ceremony of the ward councillors — about the instances of male relatives taking oath on behalf of elected women representatives. “It’s only customary and they are only expected to sign, saying they are aware. Sometimes, they are not literate, or language is a problem,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bslxbg/article30497949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THOATHTAKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/male-relatives-take-oath-while-women-councillors-stand-aside/article30497950.ece
206,2020/01/07,Fight between two DMK factions over panchayat post triggers tension,"Tension gripped the Thiruvarankulam panchayat union office in the district on Monday after two factions of the DMK came to blows while trying to win over some newly-elected councillors for the selection of the panchayat union chairperson.

The incident took place after the panchayat union councillors took oath.

The Thiruvarankulam panchayat union has 25 councillors, 14 of whom are with the DMK. The AIADMK has six councillors, while the Congress, the CPI and the MDMK have one councillor each. There are two Independent councillors. The tussle broke out over the selection of the panchayat union chairperson — a post that had been allocated to a woman. It involved DMK factions led by Thiruvarankulam West union secretary K.P.K.T. Thangamani and East union secretary Gnana Ilangovan.

Both Mr. Thangamani and Mr. Ilangovan were trying to drum up support for their wives. The police said the trouble began soon after the oath-taking ceremony. Both factions tried to win over party councillors, those belonging to alliance partners and Independent councillors, leading to a verbal duel. One of the factions tried to take the councillors away in a car, which was stopped by the other faction. Members of the two factions then came to blows. Following police intervention, they dispersed from the spot. As a precautionary measure, police personnel were deployed at the union office. A case against both the factions was registered at the Alangudi police station.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fight-between-two-dmk-factions-over-panchayat-post-triggers-tension/article30497921.ece
207,2020/01/07,"Consider plea of Subasri’s father for compensation of ₹1 cr, HC directs Corporation","The Madras High Court on Monday directed Greater Chennai Corporation to consider within four weeks a representation made by the father of techie R. Subasri, who got crushed under the wheels of a tanker after an illegal flex board fell on her while riding on a two-wheeler in September last, for a compensation of ₹1 crore.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha passed the order while disposing of a writ petition filed by R. Ravi, 57, of Chromepet. The court had last year ordered for a compensation of ₹5 lakh to the petitioner family while passing interim orders on a contempt of court petition filed by activist Traffic K.R. Ramaswamy regarding illegal flex boards.

Apart from the court ordered compensation, the family had also received solatium from various political parties though the victim had died due to an unauthorised flex board erected by All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam former councillor S. Jayagopal to welcome party bigwigs to his son’s marriage near Pallikaranai here.

While ordering immediate relief of ₹5 lakh after the accident, the court had made it clear that it shall be over and above the compensation to which the parents would be legally entitled to under the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988. On Monday, when the judges wanted to know whether any claim had been made before a tribunal, the petitioner’s lawyer replied in the negative.

Wondering why no motor accident compensation claim had not been raised yet, the judges multiplied the annual salary of ₹2.2 lakh received by the techie at the time of her death with the highest multiplier of 18 and found that the parents might get somewhere around ₹30 lakh after deducting the personal expenses of the deceased if she had been alive.

In the meantime, the judges also took note of suggestions made by senior counsel B. Gnanadesikan, representing the Tamil Nadu Digital Printing Association, for bringing in certain amendments to the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies (Permission for erection of digital banners and placards) Rules. The counsel said, the amendments would help in curbing illegal flex boards.

Stating that many people erect illegal flex boards only because the rules in vogue, mandating permission from various authorities, were very cumbersome, he suggested that permission could henceforth be given by the local police and Assistant Engineers of the Corporations. Similarly, the maximum size of flex boards could be limited to 160 square feet.

He also suggested that erection of flex boards on road medians should be discouraged and could be allowed only on roadsides.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/consider-plea-of-subasris-father-for-compensation-of-1-cr-hc-directs-corporation/article30497891.ece

The Madras High Court is slated to take up for admission on Tuesday a public interest litigation petition filed by Madurai Mavatta Devendra Kula Vellalar Uravinmurai Sangam accusing the government of having denied permission to it for installing a statue of Maaveeran Sundaralinganar at a roundabout close to Madurai district court campus and instead having permitted installation of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s statue there.

The petition has been listed for hearing before a Division Bench of Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan. The association, represented by its president K.C. Selvakumar, urged the court to quash a G.O. issued on July 4, 2019, refusing permission for Sundaralinganar’s statue following objections raised by Madurai City Police on the ground that erection of a statue at the junction would lead to traffic chaos and block vision of vehicle users.

Stating that now a statue of Jayalalithaa had come at the same spot and it was not known whether permission had been granted for it or not, the petitioner urged the court to order its removal. Further, stating that the statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar had also been installed at the busy Goripalayam junction, the petitioner sought an interim order to remove it too.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-to-hear-today-plea-against-statues-in-madurai/article30497446.ece

Responding to a public request to fill up old wells in the village, Mr. Harish Rao instructed the officials to take up the work immediately. He said that water from river Godavari would reach the villages and irrigation would be supplied for summer crops. He suggested that wet and dry garbage be segregated at source.

On his way back, he stopped at Tornala village. When some villagers alleged non-payment for selling paddy at procurement centres, he directed officials to clear the arrears immediately. He also suggested setting up a shelter for sheep and goat in the village to keep the surroundings clean.

212,2020/01/07,ITDA boost to tribal entrepreneurship,"The Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, has readied an ambitious plan to give an impetus to micro-entrepreneurship development among women in the predominantly tribal populated mandals of the erstwhile undivided Khammam district.

It has devised an action plan to set up a drumstick (moringa) leaf processing unit under the aegis of a trained group of tribal women for producing iron-rich moringa powder at Mucherla village in Kamepalli mandal.

The plan forms the crux of the Tribal Welfare Department’s multi-sectorial initiative involving the Telangana State Girijan Cooperative Corporation (TSGCC) and various other government departments and agencies to turn tribal women into micro-entrepreneurs through multiple interventions including training and skill development, credit and marketing support.

Plans are afoot to set up another Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) unit under the aegis of a Joint Liability Group (JLG) of trained tribal women to make jaggery-based groundnut chikkis in Palvancha town, sources said.

Iron-rich products

The Department has drawn up plans to purchase the two iron-rich products from the JLGs for supply to the residential and ashram schools run by it in the district and elsewhere in the State, sources added.

Glycerine soaps and aloe vera-based shampoos being produced at the Bhadrachalam-based unit operated by the Dammakka JLG are fast gaining popularity just a few weeks after their introduction under the brand name ‘Giri’ in the local market, said TSGCC-Bhadrachalam manager Kunja Vani. There is a huge demand for natural toiletries made of plant-based materials in the market, she noted.

“The proposed units for moringa powder and chikkis to be set up by trained members of the JLGs in Kamepalli and Palvancha towns, respectively, are bound to become successful ventures due to increasing awareness of iron-rich foods,” she said.

The ambitious plan would also serve as a key initiative to improve nutritional intake of children and combat anaemia in Agency areas.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a4i67s/article30506899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07-KHM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/itda-boost-to-tribal-entrepreneurship/article30506892.ece

Though a few doctors suggested amputation from hip, the Oncology Institute’s medical specialists replaced the patient’s femur, from hip to knee, with a metal implant. He was admitted to the hospital on December 15, and the surgery was performed two days later.

Musculoskeletal Oncosurgeon at the institute, Dr Kishore B Reddy said that the patient Sanaullah has recovered, is able to walk, and is ready to be discharged. The incidence of osteosarcoma is three cases per million, each year. Patients who land up in Stage 4 tend to have a lifespan of a few months. Mr Sanaullah was suffering from Stage 2 of the cancer.

The cause is unknown, but generally thought to be due to radiation exposure, genetic inheritance or mutation.

214,2020/01/07,SEC notifies municipal elections,"The stage is set for over 79.94 lakh voters to cast their vote for election of mayors and councillors for 10 municipal corporations and chairpersons and ward members of 120 municipalities spread across the State.

With the High Court dismissing the petitions filed against the conduct of elections to urban local bodies, the Telangana State Election Commission issued notification for the ensuing polls on Tuesday. Accordingly, filing of nominations will commence from Wednesday and January 10 would be the last day of filing nominations.

The SEC would take up scrutiny of nominations on January 11 and appeals if any against the rejection of nominations would be disposed of the next day. The last day for withdrawal of nominations would be January 14 and the final list of contesting candidates would be announced the same day. Polling would be held on January 22 from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and counting of votes and declaration of results would be on January 25.

State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy issued the notification after the commission had completed the process of reserving the ULBs going to polls to different categories. The division-wise and ward-wise reservations had also been announced by the government in the last couple of days. The SEC planned to set up a little over 8,000 polling booths in the ULBs, allocating around 800 voters to each polling station.

215,2020/01/07,HC dismisses PIL plea on municipal polls,"The Telangana High Court on Tuesday dismissed the PIL plea, filed by Nalgonda MP and Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, seeking to stay municipal polls in the State.

A Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, which had directed the State Election Commission (SEC) the previous day to put on hold for a day the poll notification, dismissed the petition giving green signal to elections in 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations in the State.

After seeking several clarifications from petitioner’s lawyer D. Prakash Reddy and SEC counsel C.V. Mohan Reddy, the Bench delivered the verdict having heard their contentions and citations for nearly six hours. Senior lawyer Prakash Reddy argued that the notification issued by the SEC on December 23, 2019 was not an election notification in accordance with Section 195 of Telangana Municipalities Act-2019.

“The notification was issued hurriedly. The dates for filing nominations, announcement of reservations to different groups shows fixation of unreasonable timings. This does not create level playing field for everyone,” the senior counsel told the court. The CJ sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel what was wrong if division of wards and voters list were finalised simultaneously.

Reasonable time gap

The Bench observed that on one hand the government would be criticised for delaying polls if it took longer time for poll arrangements and would be accused of hurrying if the processes were completed quicker. When the senior lawyer said the political parties would require reasonable time gap between declaration of reservations of wards and filing of nominations, the Bench observed that political parties would be planning well in advance for elections.

Mr. Prakash Reddy, before concluding his arguments, appealed to the Bench to consider deferment of municipal polls at least by a week to 10 days if it did not want to pass direction to stall the elections. Mr. C.V. Mohan Reddy told the court that notification issued by the SEC was not an election notification but a notice aimed at alerting people at large about the ensuing municipal polls.

Lottery system

The Bench, however, issued notices to the State government on the constitutional validity of adopting lottery system to decide upon reservations for women in the municipal elections in a separate writ petition.

Lawyer B. Rachna Reddy moved a lunch motion challenging the lottery system to declare reservations for women. It was taken up for hearing after the counsels for the SEC and the PIL petitioner concluded their arguments.

216,2020/01/07,Labour scarcity hits cotton harvest in Telangana,"Narayana, a farmer from this village in Narayanakhed mandal has cultivated cotton in about eight acres. So have many of his fellow farmers in the village and all are happy at the bumper yield. But there’s a damper. The crop has come for harvesting at the same time resulting in shortage of labour.

Cotton was cultivated in about 3.45 lakh acres across the district with an estimated yield of 28 lakh quintals. Agriculture officials pointed out that cultivation this season was 59 % more than normal.

In fact, hundreds of labourers came from far off places in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to pluck cotton for the local farmers.

Mala Yellappa is in his early 30s. He has been taking care of his two children — Sai Pallavi and Sindhu Priya — while his wife and other relatives are plucking cotton balls in the adjacent field in Jukal village in Narayanakhed mandal. About 20 persons from Parlapally village in Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh, have travelled some 400 kilometres, to work on the fields for cotton plucking.

Paltry pickings

They are paid ₹ 8 per kg of cotton balls collected. The families are lodged in temporary huts covered with blue plastic sheets on the village outskirts. They are all camping here from the beginning of this month and may stay for another two weeks. While scohol-going children are left behind in their native places in the custody of grandparents, smaller ones are brought along.

Yellappa has been regular to this area for the past five years and he may be forced to come again if the rain god is unkind next year.

Wage labour

“There are no rains and no irrigation facilities in our area forcing us to work as migrant labour. We work here for about two months and then move to Guntur to pluck chillies after Pongal. Then some of us will go to Bangaluru and Kapdapa in search of work. We hardly stay two or three months in our village,” rued Pulikanti Urukunda, the team leader who brought them here.

“I am staying and working in Hyderabad for the past several years as farming in our area is not remunerative due to lack of rains and irrigation. I have already sold about eight acres of land, each for ₹ 1 lakh or less, to meet my family expenses,” said B. Venkatramudu from the same village. Ditto is the case of Narasimhulu, owner of about 10 acres, who was forced to migrate for similar reasons.

Similarly, a family of 10 came from Deglur in Nanded district of Maharashtra to work in the field of their relatives, and were paid an amount of ₹ 10 per kg. They work from morning to evening, and make about ₹ 800 per day.

217,2020/01/07,"Cash, liquor winning elections for TRS: Uttam","Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Tuesday said the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi had won all elections with cash and liquor, and expressed fear that it would resort to the same practice in the urban local body elections now.

Speaking to party leaders in a meeting here at Halia, he advised them to be vigilant about such ‘poll offers’ and also check the practice at local level. “TRS election victories after 2014 are not based on performance, but on distribution of cash and liquor. If elections are held in a free and fair manner, it could not have won even a single seat,” he said. Commissions earned through irrigation projects are funds for elections and all claims of poll surveys favouring TRS victory, by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, are to mislead people, he said. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy also described the poll promises of the TRS as “tall and fake”, and said the promises of 2014 and the 2018 elections are yet to be fulfilled.

“Promise of reservations to STs and Muslims and three acres land to Dalits made in 2014 is forgotten, and ₹ 3016 allowance for the unemployed and ₹ 1 lakh crop loan waiver announced in 2018 are not talked about,” he said.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said Nagarjunasagar constituency, like others, also has promises to be fulfilled.

He assured that he would explore opportunities to make Nagarjunasagar an international tourist destination, besides utilising funds from the MPLADS soon to better civic amenities.

He reiterated that his public interest litigation against the State Election Commission was over violation, in releasing the poll schedule before announcement of wards reservation, of the Telangana Municipalities Act.

218,2020/01/07,Telangana State working for empowerment of farmers: Niranjan Reddy,"Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy has stated that Telangana government has been working towards the financial empowerment of the farming community.

Speaking at a meet on “value addition for income generation in agriculture” at Thrissur in Kerala on Tuesday, he explained how Telangana government had taken up interventions to help the agriculture sector overcome the crisis by completing pending irrigation projects, taking up new ones, giving input support of ₹5,000 per acre, ₹5 lakh life insurance cover, restoration of minor irrigation tanks and 24×7 free power supply, among others.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy felt that farmers could get better income only with the help of food processing, managements of crops that were being produced in excess of consumption, steps for better and longer storage agriculture and horticulture produce and ensuring support price at the farm gate itself. Such measures would not only improve the farmers’ income but would also encourage ancillary industries.

Food processing

Stating that the State government had included food processing industries in 14 priority sectors in the new industrial policy, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said encouragement of farm mechanisation, construction of poly/green houses and micro irrigation had also been helping in increase in production and productivity of various crops.

Further, he stated that the government had set up an officials committee to study food processing units and a cabinet sub-committee was working on the new food processing policy. The new policy would encourage establishment of food processing unit by providing basic infrastructure and would tie-up them with farmer producer organisations (FPOs) of women self help groups for supply of raw material and a FPOs’ company Be’nishan was also launched recently.

Cooperative farming

Later, Mr. Niranjan Reddy visited the rice research station near Thrissur and enquired about rice cultivation methods, mechanisation, irrigation, yield, availability of labour and others. He was informed that about 800 farmers had formed into a cooperative society to cultivate paddy in 900 acres and it had also helped them overcome the labour problem.

219,2020/01/07,TS origin staff in AP to be hit by government relocation to Visakhapatnam,"The plight of over 700 employees of Telangana origin working in the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat and offices of the heads of departments in the neighbouring State appears to worsen with the AP government’s decision to shift a major chunk of the State executive to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati.

These employees, particularly in the Class III and Class IV ranks, are already facing considerable burden on account of their allocation to the neighbouring State as their families are settled in Telangana and they are forced to travel to the State Capital more often than not. Shifting of their base from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam is likely to exacerbate their plight as fulfilling basic requirements like finding a house and visiting their home State will take a toll on their meagre salaries.

Of the total employees, 176 are working in different secretariat departments while another 538 are working in the HoDs. These employees were locals to Telangana and opted for allotment to the State, but were allotted to the neighbouring State against their options in the reverse order of seniority as per approved guidelines.

Official request

The then AP Chief Secretary L.V. Subrahmanyam, after a series of discussions with senior officials of Telangana government, sought the State’s concurrence for sending back these employees who were allotted to AP post-bifurcation. In a letter addressed to former Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi, Mr. Subrahmanyam said the AP government was prepared to relieve these employees as and when a formal request was made by the Telangana government either to send them back on permanent basis or on deputation to their home State leaving a final decision on the issue to Telangana government.

The letter followed the Telangana government’s proposal for accommodating Class IV staff by way of redeployment with pay protection in the heads of department/zonal district officers. But, no formal request has been sent to the AP government in this regard subsequently. “A file in this regard has been prepared immediately after the receipt of letter from the then AP Chief Secretary and circulated. It is still awaiting clearance from the government,” a senior official told The Hindu.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-origin-staff-in-ap-to-be-hit-by-government-relocation-to-visakhapatnam/article30505414.ece

222,2020/01/07,Solar rail section between Nandyal-Yerraguntla,"South Central Railway (SCR)’s Nandyal – Yerraguntla section in Guntakal Division became the first ‘solar section’ where all the stations on the section have been provided with solar panels at a stretch to tap the renewable energy.

It is a relatively new line for the Indian Railways and has been opened for passenger traffic in 2016 only to bring the hinterland areas into rail map by providing rail connectivity to Yerraguntla on Guntakal-Renigunta main-line with Nandyal on Dhone-Guntur main-line.

While solar panels have been installed at the stations, service buildings, level crossing gates etc., across the zone, the concept of all stations of a particular section being provided with solar panels at one stretch to tap the natural energy is a first such initiative. Besides, meeting power needs of all the stations in the section but also save expenditure for the Railways, said Chief Public Relations Officer Ch. Rakesh.

All the eight stations in the section — Madduru, Banaganapalle, Koilakuntla, Sanjamala, Nossam, S. Uppalapadu, Jammalamadugu and Proddutur —have been provided with solar panels capable of meeting the power needs at these railway stations.

About 148 KWh energy units can be generated throughout the year resulting in generation of 54,020 power units. The expected savings in terms of revenue is around ₹5 lakh per annum and carbon footprint reduction of 49 metric tonnes per annum as contribution towards green environs.

To make use of solar power, 37 kWp off grid roof top solar plants along with 250/125 Wp solar panels were installed in each station. In addition, inverters and 12V 150 AH battery banks were also installed at all these stations. In total the connected load on solar plants is on an average 30 kWp and 152 solar panels were installed with an an average exploring of eight sunny hours per day.

225,2020/01/07,Monkey menace an issue for contestants Karimnagar,"With the municipal elections around the corner, the monkey menace issue is likely to cause a stiff challenge to contestants from various divisions of the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK).

Thanks to the destruction of the forests and the hillocks following granite quarrying, the monkeys have been intruding human habitations for food and water for over a decade in the town. The simians are causing umpteen problems to residents of the town.

The monkey menace is rampant in all almost all the divisions, particularly Rampur, Bhagathnagar, Ramachandrapur, Ganeshnagar, Tirumalnagar, Jyothinagar, Vavilalapalli, Kapuwada, and Mankammathota. The simians arrive in hordes and damage houses, by clinging to water pipes, destroy plants, and snatch eatables.

Besides, the monkeys are attacking residents, causing them injuries. On an average, at least more than 100 persons were being injured by the simians in a month in the Karimnagar town. The injured persons were forced to take at least four doses of anti-rabies vaccine.

Children, elderly persons and women are scared to move about because of the menace. Some residents constructed their houses in such a way that the monkeys do not enter their premises. Traders have closed their shops entirely with grills and keep close surveillance. The monkey menace have affected small-time traders in the localities.

The voters are likely to place before the contestants the monkey menace before the elections. “We don’t have any other issues in some localities except the monkey menace and we are chalking out strategies to solve the issue,” said a contestant from the Baghathnagar locality. Some contestants are promising to end the monkey menace and planning to rope in langurs and monkey catchers to end the menace and woo the voters.

Sharada, a resident of TNGOs colony in Bhagathnagar, who runs a kirana shop, said the residents had decided to demand that the contestants solve the monkey menace before the elections.

226,2020/01/07,Greylag goose spotted in Telangana,"When wildlife biologist at the Palarapu vulture habitat M. Ravikanth, and animal tracker Adduri Mahesh photographed the migratory waterfowl, the Greylag goose (Anser anser), in the tank outside Bejjur mandal headquarters in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district recently, little did they realise that the sighting will add to the list of birds found in Telangana State.

This is the third recorded sighting of the large-sized bird in Telangana, which makes it ‘eligible’ to be the latest addition to the State’s exhaustive list of birds.

“The bird was seen in Mahabubnagar and Hyderabad in 2014, then in undivided Andhra Pradesh, and now in Bejjur (which is part of Kagaznagar Forest Division). As per scientific and accepted norms, a species has to be seen three different times in three different places, or by three independent observers, before it can be accepted as an addition to a State’s list,” birder Humayun Taher of Deccan Birders, Hyderabad, explained the process of including a new bird species in the list. Also, underscoring the need to make the addition.

Blown off course?

Mr. Taher recalls that in all the earlier instances — like the sighting in question — the birds were single or in a pair though the geese are found in large flocks or skeins. “These could be the birds that have been blown off course by strong winds or rain during flight,” he opined.

“Yes, the Greylag goose has been sighted in Bejjur,” confirmed KB Asifabad District Forest Officer Laxman Ranjit Naik. “The Kagaznagar Division and other parts of the forest, especially Tiryani mandal, are conducive to many a bird species thanks to the wetlands,” he stated.

For Ramsar status

The Greylag geese are common visitors to North India in winters, and are found mostly in wetlands there feeding generally on acquatic weeds and grass. “We are now in the process of identifying, surveying and protecting the wetlands in our district by trying to get them the coveted Ramsar status,” Mr. Naik revealed of his department’s efforts in making the place a birding haven.

The Convention on Wetlands or Ramsar convention, named after the city in Iran, aims at conservation and sustainable use of identified wetlands. “If our wetlands get that status, the protection levels will also be improved,” the DFO pointed out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ae6o8l/article30504659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08GREYLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-list-of-birds-likely-to-get-greylag-goose/article30504660.ece

Campaigns, counter campaigns

While, the national trade union leaders were organising gate meetings with the coal miners in the coal belt region appealing them to participate in the strike in the interest of workers, the SCCL management had been organising counter meetings and appealing to the miners to attend to their duties and not to cause losses to the company.

The Singareni management had also released pamphlets in a bid to educate the workers that the strike would have a serious impact on the profits of the company. Stating that the company would lose ₹ 53 crore due to the strike, the management had also stated that the workers would lose ₹ 20 crore in wages for participating in the strike. It has also emphasised that the national trade unions’ demands do not come under the purview of SCCL.

Security cover to mines

Meanwhile, the Ramagundam Commissionerate of Police is taking all measures to provide adequate security at the mines to ensure the coal miners attend to their duties. The police had been appealing to the union leaders not to obstruct the miners from attending to their duties.

232,2020/01/07,Lack of drinking water and poor sanitation hits Jangaon,"The first local administrator with the designation of tahsildar was appointed in 1935 by then Nizam king to Jangaon town when local body elections were held across the country, except in Hyderabad State.

The Nizam appointed the tahsildar as chairman and selected five eminent persons of the town for the committee. The committee ruled for 17 years until 1952 when the first elections were held and the town was divided into 14 wards. The first chairperson was Koduri Jagannatha Reddy and vice-chairperson was Peddi Narayana.

The ensuing election to Jangaon municipality would be 13th one. Since inception, the municipality in its 66 years of history, was ruled by special officers for 13 years and rest by 13 elected chairpersons. Ninth time, the election was held in 2014 with 28 wards, and foLacr the first time, a woman, G Premalatha Reddy, was elected chairperson.

The population of the town in 1952 was 13,000. The main problem facing the municipality is lack of drinking water and poor sanitation. The town did not witness development in proportion to the population growth.

It was in 2005 that the State government constructed a reservoir at Cheetakodur to cater to the drinking water needs of the town’s population. It was set up with a capacity of 11.13 MLD and now the town draws 73 lakh litres per day from the reservoir.

The third municipal chairman, V. Venkatanarasimha Reddy recalling his days at the helm, said that at one time the State government allocated funds to transport drinking water through tanks. But during his tenure, he decided to dig borewells which the then Collector refused to allow. However, following the public pressure, they dug up several borewells all over the town.

Presently, the Jangaon municipality gets a revenue of ₹9.91 crore per year of which expenditure is ₹ 3.64 crore. The local body collects four tones of garbage per day. The town has 19 slum areas, 17.5 kilometre road and 105.60 km drainage line.

The Jangaon municipality now has 16,084 families with a population of 52,408 as per 2011 census -- of which, men account for 26,763, while women account for 25,648. But now it could be over 70,000.

Remarkable power

In a tough life, sport had the remarkable power to heal the wounds. Campriani chose three refugees, Khaoula, Mahdi and Luna, in collaboration with Swiss Immigration Authorities and started training them in air rifle, with 500 days to for Tokyo Olympics, at he World Archery Excellence Centre in Lausanne.

The target was to help the three learn a new sport and get to feel the Olympic atmosphere.

They had to achieve the Minimum Qualifying Score of 595 to be eligible to participate in the Olympics.

Campriani, who won both the air rifle and 3-position gold medals in the Rio Olympics in 2016, did know about a refugee team. He was keen to make his contribution.

The Olympic Channel is making a five-part series on the project of Campriani, Taking Refuge, projecting the power of sport and its ability to transcend borders and connect the world.

After getting a taste of competition in the Italian and German championships, Mahdi achieved the minimum qualifying score for Tokyo in the Asian Championship in Doha.

Mahdi and Khaoula also visited Bengaluru in December, and were trained in a special range, with the likes of two-time World Cup gold medallist Apurvi Chandela and coach Rakesh Manpat.

They got to experience Indian culture apart from getting full body assessment and customised high-performance training plans at the Abhinav Bindra Foundation.

Theme song

Already, the Grammy award-winning composer, Ricky Kej, has volunteered to make a theme song for the project and did the recording during the India visit of the athletes.

There are two more competitions ahead in Wroclaw and Pilsen where the athletes will get a chance to achieve the MQS and be eligible to compete in Tokyo Olympics.

Former World champion, Campriani, who had also won the silver in air rifle in the London Olympics, apart from his three gold, has put his own aspirations to defend the Olympic titles, in training the three. He believes that the next Olympic champion would continue with the cause.

Already, Abhinav Bindra, who is a member of the athletes commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has shown the way by generating the funds to make the project an inspiration for everyone.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/elm8sw/article30506107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08Taking-Refuge-group,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/champions-ignite-olympic-dream/article30506108.ece

237,2020/01/07,"Primary school students to participate in 16,000km-long human chain in Bihar","The Bihar government has made it compulsory for all school students and teachers to participate in the over 16,000km-long human chain to be organised across the State on January 19 to raise awareness about climate change. The theme of the human chain, much ambitious programme of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, will be climate change and other social issues.

Earlier in 2017 and 2018 too, human chains were organised in the State in support of prohibition and against social issues such as dowry and child marriage. However, in these two human chains, participation of primary school students from classes I to V was not allowed but, this time their presence was made compulsory, along with teachers and other middle-, high- and higher class students.

In a directive issued to all District Magistrates on Monday, the State Education Department asked them to ensure participation of all school students and teachers in the proposed human chain on January 19. However, school students from classes I to IV would form human chain inside campus of their respective schools and from class IV and above would make human chain on main roads or lanes near their schools. “But, their safety must be taken care of”, said the directive.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/primary-school-students-to-participate-in-16000km-long-human-chain-in-bihar/article30506648.ece
238,2020/01/07,Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija denied permission to visit Mufti Muhammad Sayeed’s grave,"Family members of the late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, former Chief Minister and patron of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), were denied permission to visit the leader’s grave on his fourth death anniversary on Tuesday.

Sayeed’s granddaughter Iltija Mufti alleged that she was stopped from stepping outside her residence in Srinagar’s Gupkar Road.

“Despite fulfilling all the formalities and informing the authorities well in advance, the Special Security Group (SSG) stopped me. No one was allowed to meet me. I was pushed and sustained bruises too. Is this a sign of the normalcy that has returned to Kashmir?” Ms. Iltija told The Hindu.

Ms. Iltija Mufti, who is a SSG protectee, said she is writing to the Director-SSG, Muneer Khan, over the incident. “I will seek withdrawal of the SSG. My grandfather has served as a Union Home Minister long before [incumbent Home Minister] Amit Shah. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is crushing voices across India, whether it is JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) or Assam,” she said.

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who remains in a sub-jail in Srinagar since August 5, and Sayeed’s brother-in-law Sartaj Madni, were also not allowed to visit the grave.

However, Sayeed’s wife, and his daughter Rubiya Sayeed, who was kidnapped in 1989 by militants, managed to visit the grave in a private car.

The PDP held a low-key commemoration function at its headquarters in Srinagar.

“The late Mufti had a vision to resolve the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan amicably. He motivated former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to resolve the Kashmir issue in a manner that India and Pakistan don’t feel they have lost. He was keen to bring India and Pakistan closer,” said a PDP spokesman.

On the future course of action, the PDP spokesman said, “Till our party leadership is not released from illegal detention, we can’t frame future strategy.”

No PDP MP made an attempt to visit the grave on the occasion.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/do21e1/article30505867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUFTIGRAVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mehboobas-daughter-iltija-denied-permission-to-visit-mufti-muhammad-sayeeds-grave/article30505868.ece
239,2020/01/07,IIT-Kharagpur scholars condemn ‘unprecedented violence and terror’ in JNU,"The Research Scholars’ Council of Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur (IIT-Kharagpur) issued a statement extending “full support and solidarity” to the faculties and students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

In a strongly worded statement issued late on Monday, the Council condemned the “unprecedented violence and terror” on the JNU campus, led by “hooded, armed mobs”.

The attack on the students and the teachers “some of whom are women… is horrifying in its barbarity”, the research scholars said in the statement.

“Such an act of terror has no place in any civilised world, least of all in the sphere of learning. We, at IIT Kharagpur, feel this terror more keenly as we have also been part of various movements in the past.”

The scholars also condemned the Delhi police. “In JNU, the attacking mob was protected by the Delhi Police who stated that they cannot enter a campus without permission. However, the same police did not wait for permission when they assaulted students inside other university campuses, turning them into war zones,” the Council said.

“We strongly condemn these acts of hooliganism inside university campuses. We should never forget the purpose of our education which is not to spread hatred or violence but to propagate acts of love and sympathy that would let us strive for humanity,” the scholars said in the statement.

240,2020/01/07,New Islamic literary body triggers a storm in Assam,"Less than a year after Miyah literature associated with Bengal-origin Muslims stoked controversy, the birth of an Islamic literary organisation in Assam has triggered a storm with several organisations, including one representing Assamese Muslims, questioning the new body’s motives.

The Assam Islamic Sahitya Sabha had on January 5 issued a statement announcing its upcoming conference at Adabari in western Assam’s Nalbari district, from March 13-15. A meeting of the Sabha’s delegates headed by its president Iftikar Hussain, a retired government officer, is scheduled for January 12 in Guwahati.

The Sabha had named Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Narayan Deka, who represents the Barkhetri constituency, as the chief patron of its Nalbari conference. Adabari is in Mr. Deka’s constituency.

The right-wing Hindu Kranti Dol criticised the BJP MLA for “sacrificing your religion and culture for vote-bank politics”.

Mr. Deka, however, asserted that the Sabha had named him as its chief patron without his consent. The disclaimer notwithstanding, the MLA’s name has generated suspicion about the BJP having promoted the organisation to undermine the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

“It is anybody’s guess why a religion-based literary body has sprung up when the people of Assam are agitating for the repeal of CAA,” All Assam Students’ Union president Dipanka Kumar Nath said on Tuesday.

The Assam Sahitya Sabha, the State’s highest literary body, also sniffed a political design behind the creation of the Sabha.

The All Assam Goria-Moria Yuva Chhatra Parishad, an Assamese Muslim students’ forum, also slammed the Sabha’s formation. “This is a conspiracy and we will not allow them to succeed,” the Parishad said in a statement.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/new-islamic-literary-body-triggers-a-storm-in-assam/article30503558.ece
241,2020/01/07,"12 injured as NSUI, ABVP workers clash in Ahmedabad","At least 12 persons, including NSUI general secretary Nikhil Savani, were injured in a clash between NSUI and ABVP workers here on Tuesday.

Mr. Savani sustained serious head injuries and was admitted to V.S. Hospital in the city. Late at night, the Ahmedabad police registered a First Information Report (FIR) naming Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha president Rutvij Patel, former president Pradipsinh Vaghela and 70 others.

“We have filed an FIR and launched a probe,” a police officer from Zone I said.

The clash occurred when the NSUI workers tried to stage a protest in front of the ABVP office against the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi. ABVP members, armed with sticks, allegedly came down heavily on the NSUI workers.

As the clashes continued, the police resorted to a baton-charge to disperse the crowd at Paldi.

NSUI national president Neeraj Kundan condemned the incident. The ABVP maintained that NSUI members came to its office and turned violent.

Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda demanded that an attempt to murder case be filed against ABVP and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha workers as Mr. Savani was brutally assaulted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6oh0su/article30502927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nikhil,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/abvp-nsui-members-clash-in-ahmedabad/article30502929.ece
242,2020/01/07,"Santiniketan sees outcry against JNU attack, CAA","The new citizenship law and the mob attack in JNU have ignited protests even in Santiniketan — the abode of peace — which generally remains insulated from political unrest.

A place that has seen only candlelight marches in the past and where emotions are expressed mainly through art and poetry has, of late, been simmering with anger quite uncharacteristic of it, with students as well as teachers of the Visva-Bharati University openly protesting against first the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and now the violence in JNU.

Many walls on the campus, usually adorned with artwork, now bear anti-CAA slogans; students are openly making scathing remarks against the Central government in their Facebook posts; and Upasana Griha, the famous glass-walled prayer hall, has become the venue of angry demonstrations.

On Monday, more than 500 students and teachers — a considerable number by Santiniketan standards — gathered outside the prayer hall to express solidarity with the JNU students. Tagore’s songs were sung, slogans chanted and speeches made.

Visva-Bharati is a Central university and its chancellor happens to be the Prime Minister of India.

“We are a part of India, and whatever is on India’s agenda is on our agenda as well. Right now, our aim is to make the [Wednesday’s] nationwide strike a big success,” said Sudipta Bhattacharyya, professor of economics and president of the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association, who was at the forefront of Monday’s protests.

“[On Wednesday] students are going to hold a demonstration outside the central office and we teachers are going to support them. I have already applied for leave so that I can participate in the strike,” Mr. Bhattacharyya, himself a former student of JNU, told The Hindu.

Student leader Somnath Sow, who belongs to the SFI, said he was carrying out a campaign to make the strike a success. “We are going to boycott classes tomorrow,” he said.

Quite ironically, Wednesday is also when the university is holding a lecture by BJP ideologue Swapan Dasgupta: he is going to speak in favour of the CAA. The protesting groups have given a call for its boycott.

“I’ve been teaching here for almost 20 years, but never before have I seen protests of this kind. The anger and participation is spontaneous. It’s not just a left-liberal movement; people who have no political affiliation are also joining in,” said a professor, who did not wish to be named.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nuivgx/article30502492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shanthiniketanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/santiniketan-sees-outcry-against-jnu-attack-caa/article30502479.ece
243,2020/01/07,"‘You eat here but sing songs of Pakistan’, Congress worker told in police detention","Congress worker and social activist Sadaf Jafar on Tuesday alleged that not only did male police officers assault her in custody but the police also subjected her to communal slurs and humiliation and asked her to go to Pakistan.

“They said ‘you are a Pakistani’,” Ms. Jafar told The Hindu at her residence after being released from jail, more than two weeks after her arrest following the violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Lucknow.

“They said ‘khate yahan ke ho, bajate wahan ke ho. Kya kami ki hai humne tum logo ke liye. [You eat here but sing songs of Pakistan. What have we not provided to you people] You are doing jobs here, getting to eat and also produce kids’,” she narrated.

Ms. Jafar, a single mother with two minor children, said the police accused her of receiving funds from Pakistan. She claimed that “male policemen beat her up more” than the female constables. When she begged the police to allow her to inform her family of her detention on December 19, a male police officer beat her up and she was slapped multiple times by women constables and abused, she alleged.

“An officer walked up to me and pulled my hair--the whole strand of hair came off-- and then he kicked me on my stomach and my knee,” said Ms. Jafar. “They used such filthy language that I can't repeat it.”

Ms. Jafar and retired IPS officer S. R Darapuri were among the 14 persons granted bail by a Lucknow court on Saturday in connection with the violence.

After his release, Mr. Darapuri (76) also alleged mistreatment at the hands of the police during his police custody. He said he was even denied a blanket in the cold when he asked for it and was also not provided food for 24 hours. “I was locked up in the Hazratganj thana at midnight [December 20]. I didn’t have any [warm] clothes. I was taken by police at 11 a.m. and didn’t eat anything after that,” he said. “I was feeling cold and asked the police to give me a blanket. But they refused to give me a blanket and food,” the septuagenarian told The Hindu.

Mr. Darapuri, who is also an Ambedkarite activist, said the arrests were an attempt by the government to suppress the voice of the social and political activists.

“The government was rattled by the manner in which the entire country opposed the law and adopted a tactic of suppression. They sent political and social activists to jail with the strategy that it would leave protesters outside without anyone to guide them. But the government has failed in it,” he said.

Mr. Darapuri was under house arrest on December 19 but was arrested by police the following day. During his house detention — he did not attend the protest — he posted on Facebook a photo of him holding a placard, which read “Save Citizenship,” to express solidarity.

He would continue to exercise his “democratic right to protest till the law is withdrawn.” When he was under house detention, he continued to protest through social media following which the police kept him under “illegal detention” to suppress him, he said.

“On December 20, I was picked up from my house at 11 a.m. and kept the whole day at the Ghazipur police station and was taken to the Hazratganj police station in the evening. They showed my arrest at 7 p.m., and not 11 a.m., from some park,” he said.

The police also did not record his statement at the police station and fabricated it, he alleged.

Outside jail, Ms. Jafar, who is also an actor in Mira Nair’s A Suitable Boy, said the “struggle” against the “inhuman” CAA would continue till it was withdrawn.

“I pity how the Yogi government is rattled and scared. I was initially angry but I feel like laughing looking at the Sections [of the IPC] they slapped on a woman when I was peacefully protesting. The police there was witness to it,” she said.

Mr. Darapuri alleged that the violence was orchestrated by the RSS and the police in order to malign a peaceful demonstration. She claimed that RSS workers arrested during the protest were let off by the police without any charges.

Ms. Jafar said she was arrested and taken to a police station without the presence of any women constables.

In a detailed memorandum signed by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and submitted to Governor Anandiben Patel recently, the Congress said Ms. Jafar was arrested from the spot “without cause or reason”while she was clicking a video when the protest turned violent.

Ms. Jafar said Ms. Vadra filled the “gap of a mother” for her children while she was in jail and vowed to intensify her struggle against the CAA. “Yogi ji has removed from me the fear of going to jail and getting beaten up,” she asserted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e3ingd/article30501483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sadaf,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-protest-sadaf-jafar-retired-ips-officer-sr-darapuri-released-from-lucknow-jail-after-two-weeks/article30501454.ece

245,2020/01/07,Protest in Panjab University against JNU violence,"Members of the Left-leaning student organisations on Monday staged a protest at Panjab University against Sunday’s violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.

A few disrupted the address of Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta by shouting slogans against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), its student outfit the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Gupta was addressing a gathering on “women’s participation in decision-making” here. Security personnel removed students from the seminar hall amid slogan shouting.

‘A predetermined act’

Mr. Gupta later told journalists that the protest by students was a ‘predetermined act’ and was organised by those who want to break the country. “While everyone has a right to speak, it should be done in a decent manner,” he said.

ABVP students also staged a demonstration against Left-leaning student outfits on the university campus.

Amarinder’s appeal

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, while demanding strictest action against the perpetrators of the violent mayhem in the JNU, irrespective of their political affiliation or ideology, asked the Centre and the Delhi government to stop the blame game and ensure restoration of law and order in the country’s premier university.

246,2020/01/07,Close relatives may be allowed to visit Mufti’s grave on anniversary,"The J&K administration is likely to allow close relatives of Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, including son Tassaduq Mufti and granddaughter Iltija Mufti, to offer prayers at the grave of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) patron on his fourth death anniversary in south Kashmir on Tuesday. But the party was denied any major commemoration function in Srinagar and Anantnag.

An official said the formal application submitted by Ms. Iltija to Director, Special Security Group (SSG), Muneer Khan, has been approved “with a nod.” The family sources told The Hindu that the administration’s signal suggested that “close relatives will be permitted to offer prayers at the grave.” Sayeed died of illness in 2016, just a year after he stitched an alliance with the BJP to form a government in J&K.

In her letter to the SSG, Ms. Iltija wrote, “It would be a crying shame if the administration or the police deny us [the family] the right to even mourn and remember Mr. Sayeed. If the situation is normal, I don’t see any reason to deny us permission.”

Last week, Mr. Khan denied permission to Ms. Iltija to visit the grave “for not following the SSG protectee protocol.”

“We have followed the protocol this time. The close relatives will visit the grave tomorrow [on Tuesday],” she told The Hindu.

Sources said Mufti’s son has also arrived in Srinagar for the occasion. However, incarcerated daughter Mehbooba Mufti and brother-in-law Sartaj Madni will not be allowed to visit the grave.

Meanwhile, two separate representations were made by the PDP to Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, and Deputy Commissioner, Anantnag, to allow them to organise commemoration functions. “There is no reply from the government. There is no clarity whether we will be allowed or not,” said a PDP leader.

247,2020/01/07,3 cops shunted out for serving notice on dead man over anti-CAA protests in Firozabad,"Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were on Monday shunted out for sending a notice in the name of a dead person over the December 20 anti-CAA protests, an official said.

The action was taken on the basis of an inquiry report submitted by the city circle officer (CO) which found the three policemen guilty of negligence and laxity, he said.

After the December 20 protests, Firozabad police had sent out notices to at least 200 people asking them to prove they would not be a threat to peace in the area and furnish surety of Rs 10 lakh each.

Among those who were served notices was Banne Khan, a resident of Kotla area, who had died six years ago.

An inquiry in this connection was handed over to CO, City, Arun Kumar Singh who has submitted his report. Taking the matter seriously, Naalband Chowki incharge Rajiv Chitransh and two constables have been attached to the police lines with immediate effect, Senior Superintendent of Police Sachindra Patel said.

The inquiry found that a notice was served to a dead person and these three policemen were found guilty of negligence and laxity, he said, adding that departmental action is also being initiated against them.

Six people had died in the clashes in Firozabad. As many as 29 people were booked and 14 arrested in about 35 cases registered in connection with the violence.

248,2020/01/07,NGO made famous by Steve Waugh is running out of funds,"Udayan, the NGO that works for leprosy-affected children and that earned countrywide popularity because of Australian cricketer Steve Waugh’s association with it, is running out of funds. So bad is the situation that the institution, founded in 1970 by Englishman James Stevens, nearly closed down about three years ago but managed to keep itself afloat with help from SBI Life Insurance and ad hoc donations.

“We don’t know where the next money is going to come from,” Udayan chairperson Emily R. Menon told The Hindu. “We are desperately looking for local support. Kolkata is a prosperous city, I am sure it has enough companies that can help us, considering that CSR is now mandatory.”

“This is happening at a time when leprosy is once again on the rise, contrary to the belief that it has been eliminated. As many as 71% of leprosy cases worldwide are reported from India,” she said.

What has obviously gone against Udayan, based at Barrackpore near Kolkata, is the perception that it is always cash-rich, thanks to high-profile donors such as the French writer Dominique Lapierre and Steve Waugh. But Mr. Lapierre has been in coma after he suffered a fall in 2012 and the donations from him — which were substantial — have completely dried up.

Mr. Waugh, on the other hand, is responsible for the education and training of only 60 of the 100 girls at Udayan and donates about ₹25 lakh a year. “Our annual budget is about ₹1.8 crore,” said Ms. Menon. “While Mr. Waugh is doing a great job, we obviously need more funds. Our capacity is for 300 children, but right now we house only 260 [160 boys, 100 girls] because we cannot afford to have more.”

The former Australian cricket captain became associated with Udayan in the late 1990s after a meeting with Mother Teresa inspired him to do charity work. “Udayan feels like a second home,” the former cricketer , who was “Steve da” to the boys here, had said.

But that was then. Father Stevens, the founder of Udayan, died on Easter Sunday last year. His death largely went unnoticed, even though countless stigmatised children from the slums of Kolkata — either suffering from leprosy themselves or having parents affected by it — benefited from the childhood-to-livelihood scheme of his NGO.

At the moment Udayan has seven children undergoing treatment for leprosy and about 35 who are under observation. “This year we intend to start a fresh community outreach programme considering that leprosy is once again on the rise. But we need local support,” said Ms. Menon. “Ad hoc donations alone won’t do. We need sustained funding.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ngo-made-famous-by-steve-waugh-is-running-out-of-funds/article30498343.ece
249,2020/01/07,"Scuffle between students, BJP supporters near JU","Jadavpur University has been on the boil since Monday morning in protest against the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday.

The situation turned volatile late in the evening when supporters of the BJP and the students came face to face near the university. Around 9 p.m., the two groups had a few rounds of scuffles and both sides started a sit-in near the Bagha Jatin crossing, a km south of the university. The police asked both sides to leave but they decided to stay put. The police resorted to lathi-charge and members of both sides received minor injuries.

250,2020/01/07,"University, college campuses across State erupt in protest","The attack on students and teachers at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi by alleged members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) evoked a storm of condemnation from students, student groups and politicians across Maharashtra on Monday.

Protests against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and the ABVP erupted on college campuses in different parts of the State, including the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and the Abasaheb Garware College in Pune, and the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad. There were protests in other parts of Pune as well, including Good Luck Chowk.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule said such incidents were lowering India’s standing at the global level. “The spirit of liberal thinking prevalent at JNU has always been the country’s pride. It is unfortunate that the Central government has been repeatedly targeting the institution,” she said, demanding a thorough investigation.

Targeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the breakdown of law and order, Ms. Sule said, “Any such attack on an educational establishment is utterly shocking. What kind of signals are we sending internationally? This kind of violence on the campus of an eminent educational institute also raises a question mark on the country’s unity.”

Meanwhile in Nashik, tension reigned late in the afternoon as members of the National Students’ Union of India (the Congress’s youth wing) and the NCP youth wing clashed with ABVP activists. The two factions nearly came to blows when the NCP workers attempted to storm an ABVP branch in the city, prompting intervention by the police.

Earlier, several students of the Abasaheb Garware College in Pune protested against the Central government and the Delhi Police, raising slogans and carrying placards against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Shah and accusing the police of repressing the voice of JNU students.

The SPPU campus saw a spirited protest in solidarity with the JNU students. “The country is being brought to the brink of lawlessness owing to constant attacks on students. The aggressors are usually those upholding right-wing, regressive Hindutva ideas. The unfortunate result of this unabating series of attacks has been to give a bad name to the students’ movement in general, while jettisoning vital issues like fees, education, and concern about syllabus and lodgings in general,” Kuldeep Ambekar, leader of the student wing of the Loktantrik Janata Dal United, said.

He accused the Modi government of nurturing a socially divisive disposition among students and backing hooliganism for the BJP’s petty political gains.

“The hooliganism of the ABVP and RSS-backed goons inside the JNU campus is emblematic of the rule of fascist forces in this country today. This attack is an assault on the community of teachers and students and the very idea of JNU, which has contributed in making spaces in other universities more liberal. Violence of any scale is violence itself. This shameful incident should be condemned by all students in the country. If we stay silent and meek, our campus could turn into another JNU tomorrow,” said Ishwari Kale from Pune’s S.P. College.

The ABVP, meanwhile, also held a protest at the SPPU, blaming Left groups for the JNU attack.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5xxt72/article30498294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMPUNE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/university-college-campuses-across-state-erupt-in-protest/article30498295.ece
251,2020/01/07,"Violence has no space in democracy, says Naveen Patnaik","Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and several Left parties and civil society organisations in Odisha on Monday condemned the Sunday attack on JNU students and teachers. .

“Shocked to know about the violent #JNUattack. Violence has no space in democracy and such attacks on students must be condemned unequivocally. Appeal law enforcement agencies to take swift action to apprehend the culprits and wish the injured students a speedy recovery,” the Chief Minister wrote on Twitter.

Hundreds of protesters, including leaders and workers of CPI(M), CPI, Forward Block and CPI(ML) Liberation, gathered at the Master Canteen Square near the Bhubaneswar Railway Station around 11 a.m. Activists of several democratic organisations also took part in the protest, holding banners and placards condemning the JNU incident. The leaders and activists demanded a judicial probe and action against the culprits.

Former State secretary of CPI(M) Janardan Pati demanded that the Supreme Court use its powers and order a probe on its own to bring out the truth.

A group of activists of the All-India Democratic Students Organisation staged a demonstration in front of the Rama Devi Women’s University. “Stop hooliganism on JNU campus,” said a placard.

Activists of a civil society group with the hashtag OdishaStandsWithJNU, who participated in the protest, also organised a candlelight march at the Master Canteen Square in the evening.

252,2020/01/07,Mamata terms JNU violence ‘fascist surgical strike’,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday described the violence in Jawaharlal National University on Sunday as a “fascist surgical strike” and urged students to “unite and fight together against the BJP government at the Centre”.

“Our stand is very clear. We are absolutely with the students. I appeal to all my student brothers and sisters to be united and work together and fight the battle together”. The attack was a “dangerous planned attack on democracy”, she said.

“They are torturing the professors also. It is disturbing not only for me but for all. Such a development had never occurred in the country... While they send the goons of the BJP, they kept the police inactive,” said Ms. Banerjee. As someone who started her political life as a student leader, she said she understood the issues relating to student politics.

“I feel ashamed to point out the way in which democracy is being attacked in such a dangerous and pre-planned manner. Anybody voicing dissent is called a Pakistani or labelled an enemy of the state. See what the situation is like in JNU, AMU, IIT, and even Vishva Bharati,” she said. A Trinamool delegation, led by former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, was going to Delhi to show solidarity with JNU, she said.

253,2020/01/07,AMU students take out ‘Tiranga Yatra’,"Continuing their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, hundreds of students of Aligarh Muslim University took out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ on Monday to condemn the brutalities committed against the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday night.

This was their second protest within 24 hours.

On Sunday night, they took out a candle march in solidarity with the JNU students after news of violence in the university spread.

Seek action

In a memorandum addressed to the President of India, the students demanded immediate opening of the university and hostels. The memorandum pointed out that Jamia Millia Islamia had opened as per schedule on Monday. It also demanded immediate action against the perpetrators of violence in JNU.

Interestingly, in the absence of a students’ union, the protest was led by non-resident students of different faculties.

“The government’s fascist stand on the CAA has made us unite by overcoming all our ideological and regional differences. In this protest, the conservatives, the liberals, and the atheists, all are united,” said Ansab Aamir, secretary of the Literary and Debating Club.

Sumaiyya Khan, a student of law faculty, said the protests and the government action proved that the students had emerged as the face of the Opposition in the country. “The way the BJP government and its affiliated groups had targetted JMI and AMU, and now JNU shows that they are in fear of students. In fact, they are in fear of the ‘educated’ who could see through their agenda,” said Ms. Khan, citing the recent discourse on the poetry of Faiz.

‘We’re the fourth pillar’

“Faiz’s poetry is recited not only in JMI and AMU. It is an anthem of dissent and hope across the country. We have also emerged as the fourth pillar of democracy as a large section of the media had failed to play its role,” she added.

Mr. Aamir pointed out that spontaneous protests in 12 universities across the country on Sunday night after the JNU violence showed that it had become a pan-Indian student movement.

Security was beefed up around the campus and SSP Akash Kulhari himself came to the university gate to receive the memorandum.

Earlier, the Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union (2018-19) had described the violence in JNU as an act committed by “the masked goons affiliated to ABVP having the patronage of the Union government”. “This vandalism is a blot on the constitutional democracy of India. The entry of men and women holding lathis, rods and other weapons into a campus, beating students, attacking media fraternity and yet the police acting as silent spectators for hours raises serious questions on the intent and conduct of police,” said M. Salman Imtiaz, president AMUSU (2018-2019).

Mr. Imtiaz met the injured at AIIMS and joined the protest march in Delhi on Monday.

The AMU Teachers’ Association and the Aligarh Society of History and Archaeology also condemned the “fascist attack” on JNU.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mnc4r0/article30497759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07FLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amu-students-take-out-tiranga-yatra/article30497760.ece
254,2020/01/07,Panjab University students protest against JNU violence,"Students belonging to the Left-leaning organisations on Monday staged a protest at Panjab University against the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.

A few also disrupted the address of Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta by shouting slogans against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, student outfit Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Gupta was addressing a gathering on “Women’s participation in decision-making” here.

Students removed

Security personnel removed some students from the seminar hall amid slogan shouting.

Mr. Gupta, later talking to the journalists, said the protest by the students was a “predetermined act” and was organised by those who want to break the country.

“While everyone has a right to speak, but it should be done in a decent manner,” he said.

ABVP activists also staged a demonstration against the Left-leaning student outfits on the university campus.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, while demanding the strictest of action against the perpetrators of the violence in JNU irrespective of their political affiliation or ideology, asked the Centre and the Delhi governments to stop indulging in a blame-game over the issue, and ensure urgent restoration of law and order at the country’s premier university.

Capt. Amarinder said clashes witnessed in Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU in recent weeks had not just marred the country’s international image but had caused irrevocable damage to its education system.

Blaming the Central government, the Delhi government as well as the Delhi Police for the unbridled and vicious attacks on students in JNU last night, Capt. Amarinder said such unruly scenes were unparalleled in independent India.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/panjab-university-students-protest-against-jnu-violence/article30497752.ece
255,2020/01/07,‘BJP has given free hand to supporters to attack dissenters’,"Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan on Monday said the BJP government at the Centre had a tendency to write off dissenting voices by calling them names and branding them enemies of the country, and had given a free hand to its supporters to attack them.

‘They should be scared’

Speaking at a protest organised by students and activists in Bhopal against the violence at JNU on Sunday, he said, “When it’s students, they call them tukde-tukde gang; educated middle class, urban naxals; Muslims, terrorists; Sikhs, Khalistanis; and Hindus, anti-national. The government has a name for everyone asking questions. It has given a free hand to supporters to attack them.”

Stating that even during the Emergency of 1970s attacks like this had not occurred on campuses, Mr. Gopinathan, who resigned from service over the removal of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status by the Centre, said, “We should be scared. But they should be scared a thousand times over since their one move has brought thousands of students on the streets.”

People took activism on the social media as democracy, he said, but now they were trying to understand issues, and if needed, hit to the streets. “This is democracy... this is a country of social movements. And I don’t think the government follows Mahatma Gandhi, it’s actually these protesting students.”

On Sunday evening, 22 students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, two teachers and two guards were thrashed on the campus by a mob of masked persons wielding rods and sticks.

‘BJP’s gundaraj’

“The larger purpose of the protest is to dissent against the systemic oppression by the BJP against those asking questions and the fourth pillar of democracy. This government has a tendency to react violently,” said Pallavi Mishra, a law student in New Delhi. “It’s the larger picture that everyone needs to reckon with.”

Calling out “apolitical” people, she said, “They are idiots, because they can’t fathom the amount of distress our democracy and the constitution is under at this point.”

Meanwhile, educationist Anil Sadgopal said the men wore masks not just to evade action, but since they were ashamed of their own actions. “They can’t face the youth today, who’ve been leading protests for weeks now,” he said.

Quoting from freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s Student and Politics, he said, “Students understand that they need to study. But what use is education when it doesn’t explain prevailing issues, spell ways to deal with them and define the youth’s duty.”

Terming the JNU incident “heart-wrenching, Saumya Singh, a graduate, said, “The gundaraj of the BJP has come out in the open. It is trying to create chaos across the country to win forthcoming elections.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pqqj4y/article30497748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07IAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-has-given-free-hand-to-supporters-to-attack-dissenters/article30497749.ece

The special court for hearing dacoity-related cases was expected to deliver the verdict in the 1981-Behmai massacre case on Monday. But it allowed the defence counsel to submit its written arguments by January 16, government counsel Raju Porwal said.

The court has now listed the case for January 18, when the judgment is expected on the role of the four surviving accused — Bhikha, Posha, Vishwanath and Ram Singh.

Defence counsel Girish Narain Dubey appeared before the court, seeking more time and was granted 10 more days, Mr. Porwal said.

‘Bandit Queen’ Phoolan Devi, who later turned to politics, and her gang members were accused of killing 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981.

257,2020/01/07,"No bandh in Bengal, says Chief Minister","Two days before the all-India general strike called by the Left trade unions, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said there will be no strike in the State.

Several trade unions affiliated to the Left parties and the Congress had called for a bandh against the economic policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre on January 8. The demands of the trade unions include protection of public sector units and increase in minimum wages. The unions will also protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Speaking to journalists after an administrative review meeting at Ganga Sagar, Ms. Banerjee said though she supports the issues, she will not allow any bandh in the State.

‘Poor will suffer’

“There will be no bandh in Bengal. Ever since we came to power we have not allowed any bandh in the State. What will happen due to bandh? Thousands of crores will be wasted and the poor will suffer,” she said.

The Chief Minister said there were other means to protest and highlight their demands rather than calling a strike or bandh.

Earlier in the day, a notification by the West Bengal government said that “no casual leave for absence either in the first half or in the second half of the day or for the whole day or any other leave shall be granted to any employee on the said date”. The notification said any absence on January 8 will be treated as “dies non” and no salary will be administered for the said date.

‘Will resist’

Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and State general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) the labour wing of the party, Anandi Sahu said any attempt to forcibly foil the strike will be met with resistance.

“There is no difference between the economic policies of the Narendra Modi government and the Mamata Banerjee government and that is why attempts are being made to foil the strike,” Mr. Sahu said.

258,2020/01/07,‘Harsimrat using violence in Pak. for political gains’,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, accusing her of attempting to use the killing of a Sikh youth and the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan to carry out her political battle against the Congress.

Referring to Ms. Harsimrat’s tweets in which she had sought to promote the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the context of the persecution of minorities in Pakistan, and attacked the Punjab CM and the Indian National Congress leadership, Capt. Amarinder said, “This is the height of ignorance and stupidity.”

‘Minorities affected’

“The CAA, coupled with National Register for Citizens is the kind of tool with which minorities in India will be persecuted even more than those in Pakistan,” he said.

Capt. Amarinder added that it was apparent that the Union Minister had no clue about the implications of the CAA or the damage it will cause to India’s secular character, particularly in conjunction with the NRC.

‘Attacks indefensible’

Capt. Amarinder said that the brazen attacks on minorities, including Sikhs, in Pakistan were so appalling as to be indefensible. As if these attacks were not shocking enough, Ms. Harsimrat and the rest of the Akali leadership had stooped to a shocking low by using them to defend the CAA and target the Congress, he said in a statement.

The Chief Minister also accused SAD of “double-speak” on the issues of the CAA and the NRC, pointing out that just days ago, Akali chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had said that the minorities be included in the purview of the CAA.

‘Akali double-speak’

“Don’t they have any clear stand on the issue?” he asked. Capt.

259,2020/01/07,Saini and Shardul prove too hot for Sri Lanka,"India made short work of the insipid Sri Lankans, cruising to a seven-wicket victory in the second T20I at the Holkar Stadium here on Tuesday.

Chasing a sub-par 143-run target, India rode on handy contributions from K.L. Rahul (45, 32b, 6x4), Shikhar Dhawan (32, 29b, 2x4), Shreyas Iyer (34, 26b, 3x4, 1x6) and skipper Virat Kohli (30 not out, 17b, 1x4, 2x6) to get the job done with 15 balls to spare.

Rahul was especially good with the drive, dispatching Lahiru Kumara and Lasith Malinga with a straight bat. A wild slog off spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, however, ended his stay.

Sedate Dhawan

His partner Dhawan, who is fighting to keep his place in the side, was more sedate in his approach. He was not quite fluent, but stuck around long enough to make a mark. The Delhi southpaw moved to 32, before Hasaranga trapped him leg-before on a review.

When the television umpire declared Dhawan out, the crowd cheered, as Virat Kohli, the main attraction, walked in.

The captain had an easy task ahead of him, with India needing 57 from 52 balls. Kohli patiently went about his business, picking up singles and twos initially.

Fireworks

Shreyas provided the fireworks, smashing Hasaranga for two fours and a six in the 16th over. The 51-run third-wicket stand between Shreyas and Kohli sealed the issue in favour of the Men in Blue. Sri Lanka was hampered by an injury to left-arm speedster Isuru Udana, who landed awkwardly on his knee while fielding. Udana, the leader of the pace pack, was forced to walk off the field and did not bowl in the chase.

After winning the toss, India did well to restrict Sri Lanka to 142. The Sri Lankan batsmen fired in spurts, but failed to get a big one. Opener Avishka Fernando started impressively, striking a couple of perfect cover drives.

Lovely yorker

Avishka fell in spinner Washington Sundar’s first over — a mishit falling in the safe hands of Navdeep Saini at mid-off. His partner Danushka Gunathilaka looked unsettled during his 21-ball stay, before Saini disarranged his stumps with a yorker. The visitors depended heavily on Kusal Perera, who came to the crease at 54 for two. Perera was lucky early on when Shreyas picked the wrong end to attempt a run-out.

Perera got going with a mighty slog-sweep off Washington that went for a six. Not long after, he executed a shot of great ingenuity. A reverse-sweep to a length ball outside off from Kuldeep sailed into the stands, earning appreciation from even the partisan home crowd.

Kuldeep had the last laugh, however, removing Perera off the very next delivery. The batsman could not get to the pitch of the ball, yet went through with the stroke. Shikhar Dhawan tip-toed inside the long-off fence to pull off a good catch.

From here, Sri Lanka crumbled in quick time. Jasprit Bumrah took his first, and only, wicket with a clever slower ball, while Shardul Thakur picked up three in one over.

Bumrah struggles

Bumrah, playing his first match in four months, was not quite at his best. He started proceedings with a wide down leg, and continued to struggle with his direction.

The Gujarat fast bowler was most disappointing in the 20th over, bowling over-pitched deliveries to No. 8 batsman Hasaranga.

While Bumrah eased his way back into international cricket, Saini hit his straps. He bowled at great pace, consistently touching the 145-kmph mark.

Saini finished with two for 18 in four overs, effectively applying the brakes on the Sri Lankan scoring rate and walking away with the Man-of-the-Match honours.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g47j9n/article30506663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08SAINI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-t20i-indore-january-7-2020-match-report/article30506664.ece

264,2020/01/07,SA vs Eng | Inspired Stokes seals dramatic England victory at Cape Town,"Ben Stokes took the last three wickets as England subdued a stubborn South Africa to win a thrilling second Test by 189 runs late on day five on Tuesday, their first victory at Newlands since 1957.

Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen had frustrated England for 44 overs before Stokes provided late drama to finish the match with 8.2 overs to spare and level the four-match series.

The win will be especially pleasing for England for the way they stuck to their task on a flat fifth-day wicket, with Stokes's superb burst earning the all-rounder figures of 3-35.

“A great day's play and a great Test match,” England seamer Stuart Broad told Sky Sports. “We had to work incredibly hard, we knew we were going to have to do that.

“It was incredible discipline from South Africa throughout the day but we kept saying one bit of magic.

“We set some funky fields. One breakthrough and we could apply some pressure. You need a lot of character and skill to chase 10 wickets. We are proud of taking our chances.”

Chasing a Test record 438 to win, South Africa looked relatively comfortable as they reached 237 for five with 26 overs remaining in the match.

For the second time in the innings, however, a key man gave his wicket away. De Kock (50) attempted to pull a dragged down delivery from part-time leg spinner Joe Denly and succeeded only in picking out Zak Crawley at mid-wicket.

It was an unnecessary stroke that opened the door for England and when Broad removed the obdurate Van der Dussen (17 from 140 balls), it was well and truly ajar.

Stokes accounted for Dwaine Pretorius and Anrich Nortje in successive balls, both caught at slip, and sealed the victory in front of an ecstatic Barmy Army when Vernon Philander was caught fending a lifting delivery to Ollie Pope.

South Africa had given themselves a chance with some stern resistance, not least from debutant opener Pieter Malan who lasted 288 balls for his 84.

But England looked on course for victory at lunch after grabbing the key wicket of South Africa captain Faf du Plessis (19), who will be disappointed with his shot selection as he tried to take on spinner Dom Bess with a powerful sweep and picked out Denly at square leg.

“The boys fought very hard. They bowled really well and congrats to them,” De Kock said.

“Obviously we tried to push them as far as we can. Unfortunately we fell just short. I was disappointed because we had a good partnership going and I smoked one straight to a fielder.”

South Africa won the first Test in Pretoria by 107 runs.

265,2020/01/07,Naseem Shah withdrawn from U-19 World Cup on team management’s request: PCB,"The Pakistan Cricket Board on Tuesday said it withdrew Naseem Shah from the U-19 World Cup squad only because of the team management’s request, dismissing reports that it had held an inquiry into an alleged age fraud by the pace sensation.

“The factual position is that since the ICC youth World Cup is to be held from this month in South Africa we had all the documents submitted by all the players, and verified again, which is a routine procedure and this included Naseem Shah,” said a PCB spokesman.

He said after the procedure, the documents issued by the government to Shah confirmed he was below 19 years of age and eligible to play in the youth World Cup.

“But the senior team management of Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis felt that since he had already played Test matches it would be best if he is released from the U-19 squad and practices with the senior team for upcoming assignments,” the official said.

There has been a lot of speculation regarding Shah’s age since he first broke into the Pakistan team on the tour of Australia in November-December last year. As per documents, Shah’s current age is 16.

However, during the tour Down Under, questions over Shah’s age were raised before the PCB categorically denied all such reports.

The PCB official insisted that Shah was not released from the U-19 team because of age related issues.

“He is under 19 as per official documents which are accepted by the ICC and he was only released on the instructions of the senior team head coach and chief selector, Misbah,” he added.

At 16 years and 279 days, Shah became the youngest Test cricketer to make his debut on Australian soil, when he was picked in the Pakistan XI for the first Test in Brisbane in November.

He has so far played three Tests for Pakistan in which he has taken eight wickets.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/qu9ma9/article30027247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAMSEEMK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/naseem-shah-withdrawn-from-u-19-world-cup-on-team-managements-request-pcb/article30504559.ece
266,2020/01/07,Tendulkar urges ICC to refrain from ‘tinkering’ with the Test format,"Iconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar has vehemently opposed the International Cricket Council’s proposed “four-day Test”, urging the governing body to refrain from “tinkering” with a format in which the spinners come into play on the final day.

The ICC wants to change the 143-year old five-day format to four days with more emphasis on limited-overs cricket for the next cycle but it has met with stiff resistance across the globe from leading stars including Virat Kohli, Ricky Ponting, Justin Langer and Nathan Lyon to name a few.

“From a purist’s point of view and being an admirer of Test cricket, I don’t think it should be tinkered with. The format has to be played in the way it has been played for so many years,” Tendulkar told PTI in an exclusive interview.

A day less, according to the world’s highest run-getter across two formats, will lead to batsmen thinking of Tests as an extended version of limited-overs cricket.

“The batsmen will start thinking that it is a longer version of limited overs match because the moment you bat till the second day lunch, you know that there’s only two and half days to go. That changes the thinking and dynamics of the game,” said the only man to have played 200 international games in the longest format.

The other worrying aspect could be spinners being rendered ineffective with a day less in hand.

'Fifth day is vital'

“Taking away the fifth day track from a spinner is like taking away the first day track from a fast bowler. There is no fast bowler in the world who wouldn’t want to bowl on a fifth day track.

“On the final session of a fifth day, any spinner would like to bowl. The ball doesn’t turn from the first day or the first session. The wicket takes time for wear and tear. The fifth day brings with it, turn, bounce and the unevenness of the surface. It doesn’t happen on the first two days,” he explained.

Tendulkar fully understands that there’s a commercial aspect and audience interest attached to the game but he wants one format to remain the true Test of batsmanship.

“We first need to understand why do they want it and what are the reasons for that. That’s one side of it and obviously it’s got to do with the commercial side as well,” he said.

“Audience-friendly, yes, it is important. But for that, from Tests, we have moved to ODIs and T20s and now we even have T10s. So there should be something for the purists and that’s Test cricket,” the maestro added.

“The batsmen, are they being Tested in Test cricket? At least, there should be one format that should challenge the batsmen and that’s why it’s called Test cricket because it’s not over in two sessions. You need to bat for long hours on difficult surfaces at times.”

Tendulkar has time and again stressed on the need to have good Test match wickets.

“For good Test matches, you need good wickets. If the Test match pitches have quality, the game will not get boring. There are tracks where even the bowler feels that he can’t get the batsman out on this surface.

“They then think let’s bowl maiden overs and wait for the batsmen to make mistakes. Batsmen also know that if I don’t play a foolish shot, no one can get me out.”

And Tendulkar feels therein comes the shorter version which excites audiences.

“In shorter versions, spectators have got used to action on every ball in T20s and almost every over in ODIs. Then they come to a format where it might not be as exciting.

“So, we have to have pitches where it should seem something can happen anytime which can make people come to the stadium or remain glued to the TV sets.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/46d7hu/article30502049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTENDULKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tendulkar-urges-icc-to-refrain-from-tinkering-with-the-test-format/article30502050.ece
267,2020/01/07,"Nothing tougher than playing India in India, says Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne","Considered another Australian legend in the making, young batsman Marnus Labuschagne is keen to test his skills against India, which he says is the toughest place to travel on a cricket assignment.

Labuschagne, 25, had a remarkable Test summer during which he scored four hundreds in five Tests, including a double century against New Zealand in the just-concluded third Test, which Australia won by 279 runs.

As the focus shifts from the red to white ball format, Labuchagne is gearing up for a tough test after being named in the Australian squad for the three-match series, starting January 14 in Mumbai.

“Whenever you play India, it’s a tough series because they’re a very tough opposition. They’ve got great batters and bowlers, so it’s going to be a challenge,” Labuschagne was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia website.

“But as a player you always want to test yourself against the best opposition in the toughest conditions, and there’s nothing tougher than India in India.”

Just 14 Tests old, Labuschagne is likely to claim the third position on the ICC Test rankings, behind India’s Virat Kohli and his compatriot Steve Smith.

He has already drawn comparisons with these modern-day greats but Labuschagne played down the plaudits.

“For people to speak like that is amazing, but there’s a lot more work to be done before anything like that can be talked about,” he said.

“Kane Williamson, Virat Kohli, Steve Smith – those guys have been doing it for five, six, seven years. To have one good summer doesn’t make you a great player. So for me it’s about trying to be consistent and trying to get Australia to win games.”

Labuschagne, who toured India with an Australia A side in 2018, said he would ask his teammates who have played in the IPL and in other international tours that have happened in the country.

“If I get an opportunity that’d be great. Luckily I have a wealth of experience there with Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steve Smith to continue to learn from those guys is great.”

Labuschagne said competing in Sydney where conditions favoured spinners was good preparation before the India tour.

“It’s probably good preparation coming from [playing on the SCG] going to India that’s probably the closest we have in Australia to spinning conditions. But with the format change, and the wickets will be different. I’ve got a lot of experience to lean on with guys who have played five, six, seven years of IPL and Test tours over there for Australia, so there’s a lot to learn.”

The second match of the series will be played in Rajkot on January 17 while the third and final ODI will be played in Bengaluru on January 19.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bv6lqh/article30501480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THLTMARNUSLABUSCHAGNE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nothing-tougher-than-playing-india-in-india-says-australian-batsman-marnus-labuschagne/article30501481.ece

269,2020/01/07,200 bulls expected to participate in jallikattu on January 18,"As many as 200 bulls from across the State are expected to participate in the jallikattu scheduled to be held for the second consecutive year on A.E.T. School premises on January 18 here.

Organised by the Erode Jallikattu Peravai, the traditional sport was first conducted on January 19, 2019 in which 122 tamers took part to tame 192 bulls. About 40,000 spectators witnessed the sport that was successfully conducted without any untoward incidents.

271,2020/01/07,Pregnant woman’s locked bank account opened on humanitarian grounds in Krishnagiri,"A pregnant woman’s bank account was locked and later opened on humanitarian grounds for an outstanding self-help group (SHG) loan the woman claimed she was unaware of.

The woman, Sujatha of Arasampatty Gandhipuram village in Pochampalli, had gone to the Barur Indian Bank to withdraw the first instalment of the Muthulakshmi Reddy maternity benefit assistance of ₹4,000 from her account. However, the bank had reported her account as locked for an outstanding loan with the Pochampally Indian Bank. Sujatha had then visited Pochampalli Indian Bank, where she was shown documents that belonged to an SHG, of which she was purportedly a member along with her affidavits.

The SHG, called Mullangi, had borrowed a loan, and the loan documents had the signature along with the photograph and Aadhar copy of Sujatha. According to Sujatha’s accounts, she was not part of any SHG, but recollected having given her photograph and Aadhar copy to a woman running an SHG in her village three years ago for a loan. “But, the woman returned the photograph along with the Aadhar copy stating that the loan was not available. I have not been part of any SHG,” Sujatha said.

She came in for a rude shock on Monday, when she visited the bank to withdraw cash transferred under the maternity benefit scheme of the State government for pregnant women. “My account was dormant since it had no money or transactions at all. Now, since the maternity benefit money was deposited, I came to withdraw it because my daughter had fallen ill,” she said. That was when the bank had asked her to clear up the loan.

Shocked by the revelation, Sujatha’s husband doused himself in kerosene and threatened suicide alleging false claims by the bank.

When contacted about the rights of the bank to lock an account for a collective loan of an SHG, G. Baskar, Lead Bank Manager, Indian Bank said, banks could use a ‘lean clause’ to lock an account, since SHG loans do not demand collateral security. “The members of the SHG are jointly and severally liable and the repayment and fiscal responsibility of the group is based on peer pressure. It is possible that the loan taken by the group was shared between a few members. However, all the members of the group had signed the documents and the supporting documents were shown to them,” said Mr. Baskar.

The manager the account was released open on humanitarian grounds later. Sujatha and her husband, both daily wage labourers, have demanded that they be released from the loan they never took. “I also appeal to the public to be careful of their documents and not to blindly trust people with their photographs and Aadhar copy.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5gb5c7/article30503595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07Krishnagiri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pregnant-womans-locked-bank-account-opened-on-humanitarian-grounds-in-krishnagiri/article30503111.ece

According to officials in the revenue wing, the civic body had issued the notice to residents to step-up collection of property tax for the current financial year and also pay arrears, if any.

The Corporation did so as by the end of December 2019, the collection of the tax stood at only 56% or ₹ 100.10 crore of the total demand of ₹ 196 crore.

277,2020/01/07,Delay in onset of ground frost points to climate change: ecologists,"The unprecedented delay in the onset of ground frost in the Nilgiris this year could have an impact on local ecology by providing an advantage to invasive species of flora and help them spread into native grasslands, ecologists warn.

Ground frost, which usually sets in by the middle of December each year, leads to most places in the upper Nilgiris, from Mukurthi National Park to Udhagamandalam and parts of Coonoor and Kotagiri becoming carpeted with a layer of ground frost each morning for up to two months at a time.

The ground frost, which sets in during December extends well into January and leads to the gradual drying up of flora, which then leads to a cycle of regeneration a few months later, providing fresh reserves of ground fodder for ungulates in the Nilgiris.

K. Kannan, Principal Scientist and head of the Udhagamandalam station of the Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (ICAR-IISWC), said that based on records compared since 1968, the dew gauge has measured the intensity of ground frost on an average as being around 4-6 during December and 6-8 during January.

“However, the scale has been at three on an average even in January this year,” said Dr. Kannan, adding that visible ground frost covering large parts of the Nilgiris has not been recorded this winter as yet.

He added that the lack of ground frost could have an impact on fruiting trees. “The process of vernalization, or exposure of a plant or tree to prolonged winter coldness induces flowering and eventual fruiting,” said Dr. Kannan, who added that such a cycle might be disrupted due to the delay in the onset of ground frost this year.

There are also concerns among conservationists that the lack of ground frost could provide an opportunity for invasive flora to spread into native grasslands in the Nilgiris.

Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist based in the district, said that ground frost acts as a control to prevent the spread of woody plants that would otherwise have an opportunity to take over grasslands.

“Moreover, invasive plants like Eupatorium, Lantana camara and Cestrum will be killed off from any grasslands that they manage to spread into due to the freezing and thawing effect of ground frost. So, the weather itself acts as a natural controller of invasive species,” said Mr. Bosco, who added that climate change could be a factor leading to the delay in the onset of ground frost.

“The fact that we have not seen ground frost in December and January shows that night time air temperatures are not cold enough to force the air to condense and settle on the ground below,” he said.

He added that people needed to take cognizance of the subtle changes in weather and ecology as a warning sign that climate change was having a huge impact across the world, including biodiversity hotspots such as the Western Ghats.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/b8f0g8/article30497666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OO07-FROST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/delay-in-onset-of-ground-frost-points-to-climate-change-ecologists/article30497667.ece

279,2020/01/07,Apartments oppose ‘bulk waste generator’ categorisation,"Apartment owners, in no uncertain terms, told the Coimbatore Corporation on Monday that it was wrong on the civic body’s part to categorise them as bulk waste generators (BWGs) to demand that they manage their waste.

At a meeting organised by the West Zone officials at Corporation Kalaiarangam, the owners told the Corporation that it was wrong to categorise them as BWGs and club them with restaurants, wedding halls, cinemas, education institutions or others because while the rest were establishments where business took place, apartments were purely residential in nature.

And, considering them residential but giving the BWGs tag was also not right because by such categorisation, the Corporation was treating them not on a par with houses, where it continued to collect waste at door step.

On the contrary, the Corporation should give incentives to apartments because the civic body could collect waste generated from all the flats within an apartment at one place. If the Corporation had to collect waste from as many houses as there were in the apartments then the Corporation would have to send its vehicles to at least a couple of streets and that involved time and labour.

The apartment owners also asked the Corporation the trust worthiness of the third party vendors it suggested that they engage to dispose of the waste and what mechanism it had to ensure that the vendors scientifically processed the waste.

They also highlighted the vendors charging apartments at their will and the absence of any uniformity in the price for the service provided.

The owners said while they were ready to comply with the Corporation’s directive to segregate waste and then handover the same, they were opposed to they being treated differently from houses.

The Corporation officials earlier explained what they meant by BWGs – establishments that generated over 100kg a day – the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 that mandated such a classification and what the Corporation expected of the apartment owners.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said the apartments were no different from houses expect how they were constructed. When the Corporation did not discriminate between flats and houses in property tax how could it treat them differently in waste collection. The right way would be to divide the waste generated in apartments by the number of flats to find out if they could still be classified BWGs.

The apartments had every right to demand that the Corporation continue to collect waste and they should challenge the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 that paved way for such a discrimination.

The Corporation officials said they would take the apartment owners’ suggestions to the notice of the Commissioner.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bhcsca/article30497652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB07MEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/apartments-oppose-bulk-waste-generator-categorisation/article30497653.ece

It is within the purview of the government to issue permission for a special show.

Deputy Superintendent of Police P.Kumar said that there appeared to a confusion over the orders issued. “Rajinikanth fan clubs had approached cinemas seeking special shows. So, the theatre owners approached us for protection as there was violence last time.” On Deepavali day, the fans of actor Vijay went on a rampage after the special show slated for 2 a.m. for the fans got delayed. Property worth ₹10 lakh was destroyed.

“If the government grants permission for special show, the police will have to allow. It is not for us to deny or grant permission,” said Mr.Kumar. He had earlier chaired a combined meeting with the Rajini Makkal Mandram and the theatre owners here for Krishnagiri sub-division, which includes five cinemas in Krishnagiri and Kaveripattinam that will show Darbar. “But, if a special show is announced, the fan clubs have been told that will be responsible for public property,” he said.

According to S.Karthikeyan, district joint secretary, Rajini Makkal Mandram, the fan clubs have accepted that there will be no special show unless the government allows one. However, the fans are expecting bulk purchase of tickets for the first regular show, subject to their negotiation with the cinema owners.

Asmathullah Khan, owner of Nayanthara theatre, said, the movie halls would have nothing to lose either way. “People will watch the movie anyway. We have been told not to allow full hall for fans during the first regular show and that they will have to buy tickets through the counter.”

290,2020/01/07,CM likens violence to 26/11 attacks,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday likened the attack on the students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to the 26/11 terrorist attacks, and assured the youth of Maharashtra that if someone resorts to such violence here, they will be dealt with strongly.

Following the JNU attack on Sunday, Minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted, “The violence and brutality faced by students, while protesting, is worrisome. Be it Jamia, be it JNU. Students mustn’t face brutal force! Let them be! These goons must face action. They must be brought to time bound and swift justice.”

Addressing a press conference in the presence of Aaditya at Matoshree, the CM said, “Whatever happened in JNU, there can be different opinions, but this attack reminded me of 26/11. Who are these people? Where did they come from? Their real face should come out. Such attacks will not be tolerated in India. Youth needs to be taken into confidence; we bring so many schemes for them because they are the pillar of this country’s future.”

Mr. Thackeray said students are restless across the country. “If youths are not safe in hostels, it’s a blot on the country. In Maharashtra, such things will never be tolerated. I assure the youth that they have nothing to worry. Nobody can touch you; if anyone tries, such forces will be dealt with a strong hand by the Maharashtra government; we will not be lenient.”

He also said the masked men were cowards. “If they had courage they wouldn’t have done it. They should be given stringent punishment. They are cowards and cowards will not be tolerated. I assure protesters in Maharashtra that they have nothing to worry.” The CM said if required, security at universities will be increased.

He did not get into the ABVP versus Left argument. “It appears the police were biased. It’s their job to take action, punish the guilty, otherwise they will also be under suspicion,” he said, adding the power of the youth should not be provoked or it may lead to an explosion.

When asked about his stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act, Mr. Thackeray said, “I will not allow anyone to take away the rights of citizens.”

Meanwhile, other political leaders also have condemned the violence at JNU.

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “On some days, it is police violence while on others, it is masked assailants. This does not paint a good picture of the country’s law and order. Why has JNU been targeted for the last five years?”

NCP chief Sharad Pawar had also tweeted against the JNU attack on Sunday night. “JNU students and professors were subjected to a cowardly but planned attack. I strongly condemn this undemocratic act of vandalism and violence. Use of violent means to suppress democratic values and thought will never succeed.”

In a dig at the newspaper, he said it seemed that The New York Times consists of the most “ardent bhakts” of Lord Ram as they seem to find him everywhere.

He also said he was waiting to read the newspaper’s report on last week’s violence at a historic Sikh shrine in Pakistan.

The Union Minister’s criticism of the U.S. daily came a day after he hit out at the British daily Financial Times for referring to the masked mob that attacked JNU students and teachers as “nationalists”, asking it to stop predicting India’s disintegration at every opportunity.

Tagging screenshots of the NYT report, Mr. Javadekar said on Twitter, “It seems @nytimes consists of the most ardent bhakts of Lord Ram as they seem to find him everywhere. On a serious note, waiting to read @nytimes ground reporting of the violence and religious persecution from Shri Nankana Sahib. Which slogans did they hear there?”.

In a series of tweets on Monday slamming the British daily, Mr. Javadekar had said, “I know it’s a bit too much for you to understand India, but here’s an effort: Stop predicting the breaking apart of India at every possible chance you get. India is a diverse democracy and it has always assimilated all differences to emerge stronger.”

‘Impartial judicial probe’

“The Delhi Police, the JNU administration and Cyclops [university security], all need to be questioned as to how masked men were allowed to enter the campus and unleash such violence. All the events would have been captured on CCTV and only an impartial judicial probe will be able to bring out the truth,” the JNUTA said.

The teachers said that outsiders had gathered at JNU gates between 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m on Sunday but the administration did nothing to stop the violence that happened inside the campus.

“It is not a law and order problem or a clash between students as it is being portrayed to be. The problem is that the administration is allowing ‘goondas’ to enter the campus and create mayhem,” said JNUTA secretary Suryajit Mazumdar.

Several of the teachers who were attacked on Sunday recounted the incident.

They first threw stones at us... after people started panicking and running around, the mob of about 50 came with rods and sticks with an aim to destroy everything that came in their way... students, teachers, vehicles...”

Former JNUTA secretary Vikramaditya Chaudhary said his wife was chased by a mob into her house during her evening walk. “They stood outside our door and banged continuously. They went from door to door in the teachers’ housing complex,” he said.

‘Son opens door’

Myung Lee, a JNU professor, said her 15-year-old son opened the door when the masked men banged on it. “One of them searched the house as if they were looking for someone,” Ms. Lee said.

Professor Saugata Bhaduri said he was near the Sabarmati bus stop when he and three of his colleagues were attacked. “The mob of 50 masked people pelted stones at us and beat us up,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ek0ruz/article30499111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06JNUTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnuta-demands-v-cs-removal-no-probe-possible-with-him-at-helm/article30499112.ece

299,2020/01/07,Haryana government to extend RRTS corridor,"The Haryana government has decided to extend Sarai Kale Khan-Delhi-Panipat corridor of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) up to Karnal, the Assembly constituency of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

It will enhance seamless transport facilities throughout the National Capital Region, including Karnal.

Haryana’s share in the said RRTS corridor is around ₹5,000 crore, which is 16% of the total cost.

The decision to this effect was taken in a meeting chaired by the Chief Minister held at Chandigarh on Monday regarding the implementation of SKK-Delhi-Panipat corridor of the RRTS.

In the meeting, the Chief Minister was apprised that under the Functional Plan on Transport for NCR-2032, eight RRTS corridors will be constructed. In the first phase, three corridors will be constructed under RRTS in NCR namely — Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Panipat and Delhi-SNB.

It was said that a 103-km-long Delhi-Panipat corridor will be constructed which will have 17 RRTS stations (including Sarai Kale Khan). Under this project, earlier, Panipat North station was the last station.

However the Chief Minister directed the officers concerned to extend this corridor up to Karnal with a provision for a station at Gharaunda as well.

The Chief Minister was told that the total alignment of these three RRTS corridors is 291.67 km, out of which more than 50% (149.31 km) is in Haryana and therefore, commuters of Gurugram, Rewari, Sonipat, Panipat and Karnal would be benefited the most from the corridor.

Meanwhile, heading out in the north-westerly direction from Delhi, this corridor aims to connect Delhi to Sonipat, Gannaur, Samalkha , Panipat and Karnal in the State. This corridor will not only cut down the travel time but will also bring environmental and economic benefits to the entire region.

It was further informed that the RRTS stations and trains will be seamlessly integrated with other transport modes like Airport, Railway, Metro, ISBTs etc. The Chief Minister was informed that the RRTS stations will be inter-operable. Commuters would be able to travel from one corridor to another without changing trains.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/p715l9/article30499443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07KHATTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-government-to-extend-rrts-corridor/article30498286.ece
300,2020/01/07,Plea against DigiLocker rules: Centre told to reply,"The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Centre on a petition against the rules pertaining to operation of DigiLocker, the government’s online document storage facility app, on the ground that it does not have a nomination facility.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar asked the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) to give its stand on the issue.

DigiLocker is a flagship initiative of MEITY under ‘Digital India’ programme. The issued documents in DigiLocker system are deemed to be at par with original physical documents.

The plea by Kusum Arora, who claims to be a poet and author of short stories, argued that not allowing a user to nominate a successor or heir to operate the facility on her/his death was “arbitrary” and “unconstitutional”. It sought striking down of the Information Technology (Preservation and Retention of Information by Intermediaries providing Digital Locker facilities) Rules 2016 “to the extent it does not provide for a nomination facility”.

The plea contended that in the absence of a nominee, on the user’s death, all the documents uploaded on Digilocker app would not be accessible by his or her kin and would automatically get passed on to the government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-against-digilocker-rules-centre-told-to-reply/article30498271.ece
301,2020/01/07,Conviction of balloon seller upheld in rape case,"The Delhi High Court on Monday upheld the conviction and ten-year rigorous imprisonment awarded to a man, who was a vendor of balloons, for raping an eight-year-old girl after enticing her with a balloon.

The court concurred with the decision of a trial court here ruling that the prosecution established that convict Rais alias Lala had “committed the offence for which he was charged beyond reasonable doubt”.

The prosecution had stated that the convict had enticed the victim by giving her ₹20 and one balloon and thereafter, lured her into bushes and had sexually assaulted her opposite Qutubgarh Telephone Exchange here.

When the victim raised an alarm, a passer-by heard her and rescued the victim. The convict tried to run away, but was apprehended.

In the 17-page judgment, Justice Vibhu Bakhru noted that throughout the trial, the testimony of the victim was “unambiguous” and remained consistent. She testified that when she raised an alarm, “one uncle” had come to save her.

The High Court remarked that although the medical evidence obtained in this case does not indicate that there was a complete penetrative assault, the same does not absolve the convict from committing a penetrative assault as described by the victim.

With the observations, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the convict against the trial court judgment, convicting him of the offence and sending him to ten years in jail.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/conviction-of-balloon-seller-upheld-in-rape-case/article30498268.ece
302,2020/01/07,"High Court seeks reply of Centre, Twitter on senior advocate’s petition","The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Centre and micro-blogging site Twitter on a plea by a senior advocate Sanjay Hegde to frame guidelines for censorship on social media strictly in accordance with the provision of the Constitution.

Justice Navin Chawla issued notices to the Ministry of Information Technology and Twitter on a plea by Mr. Hegde, whose account was permanently suspended on November 5 last. It posted the case for further hearing on February 11.

Central government’s standing counsel Kirtiman Singh, appearing for the government, said guidelines were already in place on the issue of censorship on social media.

Twitter had, in October last, suspended the senior advocate’s account over the use of an image of August Landmesser on his page referring it as “hateful imagery” and violation of the company’s rules. The account was subsequently restored but was suspended again over a two-and-a-half-year old tweet. Mr. Hegde had tweeted to a post by Kavita Krishnan, Secretary of the All India Progressive Women’s Association, on Gorakh Pandey’s poem ‘Usko Phaansi Do’ with its English translation ‘Hang Him’.

In his petition, Mr. Hegde also sought restoration of his Twitter account, with an interim plea for a direction to Twitter to refrain from deleting the data of his account.

“The arbitrariness of Respondent No.2’s [Twitter] conduct is clear from the fact that while the petitioner’s account was suspended for sharing a post/tweet by another user, no action has been taken against the user who wrote the original tweet. The same continues to be in public domain,” the plea said.

The senior advocate argued that the suspension of his account was against Twitter’s own rules and terms of use. Terming the suspension of his account as “illegal and arbitrary”, Mr. Hegde said it has violated his rights under Article 19 of the Constitution, including his right to free speech and expression.

The plea also submitted that Mr. Hegde had appealed against the suspension of his Twitter account by following the company’s internal appeals procedure. This was rejected, it said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/high-court-seeks-reply-of-centre-twitter-on-senior-advocates-petition/article30498267.ece

The level is, however, almost six times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) as set by the World Health Organization.

Under the influence of an approaching Western Disturbance, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is expected in the city over the next two days.

Other forecasts

Also, an increase in surface winds and an increase in the minimum temperature are the forecast for the coming days.

“Under these favourable conditions, air quality is forecast to improve to the lower end of ‘very poor’ to the ‘poor’ category by tomorrow [Tuesday]. Further improvement is expected in case of sufficient rain, towards the lower end of the ‘poor’ to ‘satisfactory’ category by Wednesday,” SAFAR said.

Rainfall washes away pollutants in the air and faster winds help disperse pollutants and clean the air.

The city’s air quality index (AQI) on Monday was 325, slightly better than Sunday’s 330, according to the 4 p.m. bulletin of the CPCB that is the average of the past 24 hours.

This is simply hooliganism and against the ethos of JNU. No such person will be spared and appropriate action will be taken,” he said.

The ABVP said they have videos to show that it was the JNUSU president, who was leading the mob. Mr. Jangid said “On Sunday, I was trying to help JNU students get their registrations done when the union, that was trying to enforce a boycott of the registrations, attacked us. We were only standing up for the students who wanted to continue with their studies.”

Aftre the incident, several screenshots of a WhatsApp conversation have been doing the rounds. The conversations allegedly show that the attack was planned by the ABVP.

316,2020/01/07,"Visually impaired student assaulted, another thrown off balcony","Surya Prakash (25), a visually impaired research scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), was in his ground floor room at Sabarmati Hostel on Sunday around 6.50 p.m. when a mob started knocking at his door shouting abuses.

They first smashed the glass window of his room. The shards hit Mr. Prakash’s head but fortunately his winter cap saved him.

Next, the mob broke open Surya’s door.

He kept shouting that he was blind and that they should be let him go, but to no avail.

“They hit my back with sticks and punched me also. A few minutes later, the mob left saying ‘He is blind… no point in thrashing him’,” Mr. Prakash said, adding that the men reeked of alcohol.

He was given first-aid by his fellow hostellers and then taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he was given treatment and later discharged.

His parents, who live in Uttar Pradesh’s Deoria, have been calling him incessantly worried about his safety.

Mr. Prakash said he has also been getting several threat calls. “I am getting so many calls and they are telling me that I should not speak to anyone but I will because I am not scared of them and I will not stop talking,” he said.

Opposite to Mr. Prakash’s room lives Santosh Bhagat, a PhD scholar from West Bengal. Mr. Bhagat said he was thrown off the first-floor balcony. The scholar said he was going for tea when a group of students told him that masked men had entered the hostel and that they should all stay together.

Mr. Bhagat and the other students barricaded themselves in a room on the first floor but the mob — armed with rods and sticks — managed to break inside and vandalised the room. “I was in the balcony when one of them hit me with a stick... then they threw me off the balcony,” he said.

He managed to reach the nearby house of a professor from where he was taken to a hospital. He was discharged and came back to his room around 3 a.m. on Monday. Mr. Bhagat has not told his parents about the incident, “I do not want them to worry”.

‘Most vandalised room’

On the first floor of the hostel was a room that students said was the “most vandalised” during the incident.

The occupant of the room is from Jammu and Kashmir, and is also very active in hostel activities.

The student suspects his identity was the reason for the especially brutal attack. “I was in my room when the mob started breaking the door with a fire extinguisher. While they were doing so, I ran to the balcony and hopped onto my cousin’s room, which is adjacent to mine. The two of us sat against his room’s door and they were unable to break in,” he said.

Inside the student’s room was a broken planter with soil spread all over, his bedsheets had bootprints, and shards of glass were everywhere.

A 25-year-old woman hosteller in the women’s wing of Sabarmati Hostel recalled that she could hear the mob abusing and screaming “Nikalo inko (bring them out)”. The armed men also took a round of the women’s wing. “They did not vandalise our side a lot but we were so scared that we locked ourselves in our rooms and switched off the lights. People were knocking,” she said.

Several injured students came to the women’s wing seeking help.

The woman said that a first-year male student had come to her room and was bleeding from his head. “He kept saying “didi maine to kuch nai kiya (I did not do anything) and he was shivering with fear. He was not even ready to leave the room to go to hospital,” she said.

Students at Sabarmati Hostel alleged that they made several calls to the police and while they answered, they did not come to help. The students further alleged that two male wardens had fled their posts but the two female wardens had stayed.

The residents further alleged that additional security had been requested and that the administration had been “categorically informed” of the worsening situation on campus.

Some rooms untouched

The hostel rooms with ABVP posters were untouched, the glasses of their windows intact. Hostellers alleged that the masked goons passing such rooms said “Ye apna hai, isko chhoro (This is our own, leave it)”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/azkglh/article30498112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7DESTUDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/visually-impaired-student-assaulted-another-thrown-off-balcony/article30498113.ece
317,2020/01/07,"FIR lodged for rioting, damage to property","A day after violence broke out on the premises of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, the Delhi police on Monday registered an FIR against unknown persons for rioting and damage to property.

Delhi Police spokesperson M.S. Randhawa said that the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch and a team visited the hostels on Monday.

The FIR reads that JNU students had been protesting against the hostel fee hike for the past few days. A police team headed by an inspector was at the Administrative Block on Sunday at 3.45 p.m. when they got information that a few students had gathered at Periyar Hostel and that a fight had broken out and some property was damaged.

‘Police retreated’

The inspector and his team reached Periyar Hostel where they found around 50 masked people armed with sticks beating up students in the hostel and damaging property. The personnel then retreated, reads the FIR

“The police then got a request letter from JNU administration to control violence happening inside the campus. More personnel were called and a request was made to students to maintain peace... all of sudden more PCR calls of violence started pouring in,” the FIR reads.

“Around 7 p.m. more PCR calls of violence started coming... about vandals barging into the Sabarmati Hostel and beating up students. With the help of the public address system, a warning was issued to the vandals, but they kept damaging property and beating up students. All of them then ran away. Many students received injuries and were taken to AIIMS,” reads the first information report.

The FIR has been registered under IPC Sections 145, 147, 148 149, 151 and Section 3 in The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. Mr. Randhawa said they are collecting mobile videos from various sources to identify the people involved in the violence. “It will also help to identify if any outsider were involved,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4z8bl7/article30498105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7DECRIMEBRANCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fir-lodged-for-rioting-damage-to-property/article30498106.ece
318,2020/01/07,Bandaged JNUSU president recounts mob attack,"JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, who received 16 stitches on her forehead and was left with a broken hand after she was attacked by a mob during Sunday’s violence on campus, said the attack on her was an attack on the 8,000 students of the university.

Ms. Ghosh said that a man sitting in a car near Sabarmati Hostel singled her out after which 30 masked men attacked her with an iron rod and hammers.

She alleged that the JNU security staff present at the spot did not intervene and were in collusion with the vandals “who were out to destroy JNU’s democratic culture”. Ms. Ghosh said Sunday’s violence was not an isolated incident, but comes on the heels of incidents at Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Millia Islamia and several other universities where students were attacked for “raising their voice against the policies of the Centre”.

“For the past four-five days, some RSS-affiliated professors have been promoting violence to break our movement against the hostel fee hike. Are we wrong to ask for safety from JNU and the police?” Ms. Ghosh said.

Also read: FIR against JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, 19 others for attacking security guards

She added that when the union realised that several outsiders had entered the campus, she messaged the SHO of Vasant Kunj police station. “The SHO replied that the outsiders had been removed from the campus. But after half an hour or so, the mob attacked me,” she said.

‘The mute spectators’

“The campus security stood aside, the police were mute spectators, and ambulances were attacked,” the JNUSU stated, adding: “Sunday’s violence was a systematic and planned attack coordinated by the ABVP, JNU administration, JNU Teachers’ Federation — the breakaway group of the JNU Teachers’ Association — who collaborated with outside forces to unleash violence.”

The union said despite existing police presence, the V-C delayed his response and allowed a free reign to outsiders to attack and riot.

Thousands of students took out a march from Sabarmati T-Point to the North Gate and back along with their teachers on Monday. The students said attempts have been made to break the democratic nature of the campus but they will not bow down and would fight back not with violence but with words and ideas.

Outside the university gates, a large gathering of protesters from the ABVP were seen raising slogans. They were, however, not allowed to enter the campus.

The JNUSU said they have called for a strike on January 8 and requested students from across the country to participate in it.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ixlbzt/article30498103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bandaged-jnusu-president-recounts-mob-attack/article30498104.ece
319,2020/01/07,This exhibition brings crafts persons and weavers from North East to Chennai,"“For the people of Nagaland, the jewellery they adorn themselves with is a mark of identity, and even today, the necklace is an integral part of their everyday life. We have also started designing our jewellery to suit contemporary outfits and lifestyles. Today, it is only the brides who wear tribal traditional jewellery from head to toe,” says Pamringla Vashum, who along with a group of artisans has come to Chennai to participate in the exhibition, Treasures from the North East, organised by the Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India, (CCIC) — an organisation under the Ministry of Textiles.

Naga jewellery is handcrafted with seeds, precious stones, animal bones, fish bones and glass beads. Pamringla, who belongs to the Tangkhul Naga tribe, presents handwoven traditional Naga shawls, wrap-around skirts and western wear. “I work with the weaving community in Chingjaroi village in Manipur, where every woman is trained in back strap weaving. In our community, men do not weave, and women do not go hunting. From the age of five, we train girls in weaving,” she says. They never buy fabric; women in the family weave them instead. “Naga textiles are characterised by longitudinal stripes and lines. The motifs you find in our weaving are of plaits, sun rays and crickets; the colour scheme is red, black, white and green.”

The quintessential gamchha — a traditional thin, coarse cotton towel, always with a checked design — is available at the fair in a wide range of colour combinations and sizes. “Muga silk, moirang phee handlooms and gamchha have got the GI tag and we take great pride that Assam is the only region where muga silk is manufactured,” says Susant Phukan, who has displayed some of his resplendent and regal sari collections in eri, muga (also known as ahimsa silk), mulberry and nooni silks, and moirang phee. “All my collections are hand-spun, hand-woven and use natural dyes. We have traditional designs, but we are also developing fusion saris and I also combine two different silks in one sari.”

Paromita Baruah, who runs Rini’s Boutique in Guwahati, is on her maiden visit to the city with a range of affordable mekhela chadar sets with blouse material. Sabya Barman, the master weaver from Assam, flaunts his Kaziranga-themed handloom cotton saris with pride — his 100 rhino-motif sari is a best-seller. He also has limited editions of padmini silk saris.

The exhibition has a whole range of bamboo products, from beer mugs to modas and baskets, made by Dheeraj Rajbhangshi. Water reed baskets by V Laishipem are worth the investment, as they retain their shape after being washed. Sarojini Devi’s colourful woollen shawls, balaclavas and scarves are a big draw too.

For those interested in gardening, the fair has a collection of bamboo planters and creatively designed garden accessories. Vijaya Biswa from Meghalaya, a master craftsperson who specialises in softwood, palm leaf and all natural dry flower making, offers his collection here.

Artisans from Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura are participating in this fair, supported by the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region.

The exhibition is on at Central Cottage Industries Emporium, Nandanam, from 10.30 am to 7.30 pm, till January 15.

320,2020/01/07,A walk through some of the oldest parts of Coimbatore with city chronicler Rajesh Govindarajulu,"I hope to snatch a few moments with Rajesh Govindarajulu before he starts the curated walk of the Town Hall area, as part of the Coimbatore Vizha. Rajesh says we can take a quick look inside the Koniamman temple, where the walk begins; after all Koniamman is one of the presiding deities of the city (there are eight more devi temples, he says).

While the temple has been built and rebuilt several times, the present idol is very, very old. Even older is the devi (just the head) who resides at a shrine at the rear. Almost all marriages in the old days began here (from matchmaking and girl-meeting-boy-sessions) and wedding photographs of the older Coimbatoreans will definitely include one with the temple in the background. Today there are flower shops and stalls with salt and pepper being sold in leaf cups to ward off the evil eye. What is today the Corporation parking lot was once the temple pond.

There is nothing really visually appealing in the area today, unless you shut out the the crowds, noisy buses and the garlands of electric wires overhead. You do that automatically when Rajesh begins speaking. The noise, grime and chaos disappear. In their place suddenly, are gracious old homes like Lakshmi Vilas (the city’s first double-decker house constructed in 1888) where philanthropists like the phenomenally rich Rao Bahadur AT Thiruvengadaswami Mudaliar and his family members dispensed charity and good will. They were also responsible for the development of the Government Hospital on Trichy Road. Hidden away somewhere there is the home of Rao Saheb Arokiaswamy Pillai that is today MG Eye Hospital, the first in Coimbatore, started in 1928; the Royal Theatre belonging to the RHR family in 1931; and others.

“Sivaji Ganesan films were all the rage here. But, more than the movies, it is the cycle stand that was more significant. The hall boasted a cycle stand that could accommodate 634 cycles. “The cycle ticket was very important and the theatre made a lot of money from those,” says Rajesh. As we wind our way down the road, we spot old neighbours Shri Balaaji & Co Bakers and Durghalal Pickles. Not too far is the Bangalore Biriyani Hotel (set up in the 1960s) where filmstars ate often. Then we cross the road that witnessed hundreds of fans thronging MGR as he greeted and spoke to them when his films released at the nearby Raja Theatre.

The history of this area goes way back to before films and restaurants came up. The Kongu region had a brisk trade with the Romans.

The name Kottai Medu comes from a Vijayanagara era fort, which was visited by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Eventually it was pulled down in 1973, after the Third Mysore War. Before the Europeans took over, Coimbatore, says Rajesh, was ruled either directly or indirectly by all the major dynasties in this part of the world, including the Cholas, Cheras, Pandyas, Pallavas and the Gangas of Thalakkad in Karnataka who reported to the Rastrakutas .

We visit an akhara where wrestlers of the Jatti community trained and once provided security to the city. Their weights and barbells made of stone and wood still stand, garlanded. Curiously, the Maharaja of Mysore looks on from a photograph (he is significant to this community, says Rajesh). Next door is the Garadi Perumal temple where we admire the beautiful old bronzes, said to have been spirited away from Srirangam when there was the fear of Malik Kafur sacking the temple.

Rajesh packs the walk as much with historically documented information as he does with anecdotes. A visit to the historic residence of freedom fighter/advocate Sivakavimani CK Subramania Mudaliar (1878-1961), who wrote a treatise on Periapuranam, is a moving experience. The home, built around a small courtyard, is just as it must have been when he sat and worked on his labour of love, with its wooden beams and pillars now shiny with age. His puja room remains the way it was in his day and old photographs and Tanjore paintings add to the ambience...

That evening, we get a sense of what our city was and how it has remained deeply multicultural for centuries, tolerant (well, almost always), entrepreneurial and with a strong sense of nationalism. Mahatma Gandhi came here (his statue stands behind dusty bars) and he visited the home of one of the area’s oldest inhabitants — the Korangu Seth family, just round the corner.

We cross the revered Attar Jamath Mosque, old convents and churches like St Michaels, Presentation and Fatima. In this part of Coimbatore, the gods do not squabble. It is a happy walk. One all Coimbatoreans should take.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/rwa583/article30502829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CKSUBRAMANIAMUDALIARHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/walking-down-coimbatores-town-hall-area/article30502832.ece

322,2020/01/07,"After seven-year gap, JNAFAU to host its third convocation","The Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University (JNAFAU) will confer over 6,000 bachelor’s and master’s degrees and 242 gold medals at its third convocation ceremony to be held at Shilpakala Vedika here on Wednesday, after a gap of seven years.

The degrees, gold medals and Ph.Ds will be conferred to students who completed their courses for academic years 2012-13 to 2018-19.

The convocation is the first to be held after the formation of Telangana State; it could not be held earlier as the executive council for the university after the bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh was constituted only towards the end of 2017.

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan will preside over the convocation while Council of Architecture president Habeeb Khan will be the chief guest. Padma Shri Kalal Laxma Goud would be conferred Ph.D for his contribution to the field of visual arts as well as fine arts education. Five doctoral theses in the faculty of Architecture and Planning will be awarded.

Sharing the details of the convocation at a media conference here on Tuesday, Vice-Chancellor Kavita Daryani Rao said the University has overhauled the academic functioning to improve research and innovation. The choice-based credit system has been introduced in the academic year 2017-18 to allow students to choose subjects from other departments. The university extended affiliation to 12 institutions with approval from government for conducting BA and B.Sc programmes in visual arts, design, film and media and gaming, interior design, fashion design, animation and VFX in view of demand for those subjects.

Ms.Kavita said the university had initiated an incubation centre in 2017 focusing on three thrust areas — rain water harvesting to educate the students as well as to offer consultancy and execution of projects for communities and individual clients; affordable art and low cost furniture.

The infrastructure on the campus has been upgraded with 20,000 sq.ft. of space and a new computer lab for animation department.

323,2020/01/07,Engg. college teachers asked for academic certificates again,"The Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad has once again directed the faculty members working in all its affiliate engineering colleges to present their academic credentials following reports surfacing that some of them had presented fake Ph.Ds and other qualification certificates to get the teaching jobs.

The scrutiny exercise was carried out in October last year, but the university has still been receiving complaints at the grievance cell. All the faculty members have been asked to report to the academic audit cell and the subject expert committees.

As per directions, they have to present their post graduate and Ph.D degrees, Ph.D admission letter, thesis copy and result certificate of the pre-Ph.D examination. The subject expert committee members will not only verify the degrees but their other skills as well.

Ineligible teachers

Reports suggest engineering colleges have been employing ineligible teachers though it was mandatory to have heads of departments who are Ph.Ds. It is mandatory for the colleges to gain accreditation status as well. However, several colleges have been found to be preferring to employ non-Ph.D faculty members, so that they can get away by paying them low salaries.

324,2020/01/07,Time to make systemic changes to reduce money power in politics: JP,"With concerns over increasing role of money power in politics, three organisations have come together to take a hard look at the Indian democracy and brainstorm over making the democracy work better.

Foundation for Democratic Reforms (FDR), Indian School of Business-Bharti Institute of Public Policy and University of Hyderabad have decided to organise a series of annual conferences under the ‘Indian Democracy at Work’ forum to deliberate on critical levers of change that need to be pushed to make democracy deliver better results.

The first two-day conference in the series to be held at ISB on January 9 will be inaugurated by Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu and its theme is ‘Money Power in Politics’. It will provide a platform for conversations and dialogues between political leaders, civil society groups, social activists, media persons, civil servants, business people, academics and other professionals.

FDR founder Jayaprakash Narayan told The Hindu that one needed to stop blaming politicians and parties for all that is wrong with politics and governance. They are as much victims of vicious cycle as they are a part of a dysfunctional system. “Whatever may be the preferences and view points of individuals and parties, status quo is not an option. People cannot afford to wait for decades for our democracy to improve. The forum decided to act thoughtfully, responsibly and with urgency to suggest systemic changes to reduce role of money in elections,” he said.

Many independent studies estimate that in a five-year period, the expenditure incurred is about ₹1 lakh crore for all elections. In addition, direct and indirect cost of party maintenance accounts for another ₹1 lakh crores in five years. That is ₹40,000 crore a year! For a poor country, it is an unnecessary burden on parties. Most of that expenditure is illegitimate is another grave concern, he said.

So, alternatives like direct election for head of government, separating powers of legislature and executive, system of proportional representation to political parties on basis of percentage of votes they get to reduce expenditure on vote buying, governance and service delivery with accountability will be discussed, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/time-to-make-systemic-changes-to-reduce-money-power-in-politics-jp/article30506902.ece
325,2020/01/07,"West firms up as preferred residential, office space","An intent and incentives of the government to spread real estate development to areas in the east notwithstanding, west Hyderabad seems to firm up its position as a preferred destination for office and residential space.

Stretching from Kukatpally to Kokapet and encompassing the popular areas of Madhapur, Kondapur, Gachibowli and Raidurgam, west Hyderabad at 5,176 units witnessed the highest number of residential launches in the second half (from July to December) of 2019, a report of real estate consultancy Knight Frank released on Tuesday suggests.

Almost two-third of new units were getting added in the west. Residential launches in the second half of 2019 across the city was 8,065 units, a six-year high and a 375% year-on-year (YoY) increase.

For the full year (2019), residential project launches in Hyderabad registered a 150% YoY jump to 13,495 units, Knight Frank’s India Real Estate report that analysed residential and office market performance across eight major cities said. Residential sales in Hyderabad saw a strong 9% YoY growth in the half year under review and a steady 4% YoY growth in 2019 on account of strong growth in commercial segment activity, the consultancy said.

Branch Director-Hyderabad of Knight Frank India Samson Arthur said demand, supply and investments were showing an upward movement. Backed by a solid performance from the office market, Hyderabad is likely to see a corresponding surge in housing projects.

In contrast to the India’s housing market, Hyderabad is trending as a preferred destination primarily due to demand from IT office growth, immigrant attractiveness and affordable property market, he added.

According to the report, office transactions in Hyderabad clocked an all-time high of 1.2 million sq.m (12.8 million square feet) in transaction volumes in 2019, an 82% YoY growth.

The supply of new office spaces also saw a massive 181% YoY increase to one million sq.m (10.9 million sq ft) in the same period.

Overtakes Bengaluru

Hyderabad overtook Bengaluru in terms of leasing volumes in the second half of 2019 demonstrating strong commercial trends in the market. The growth in transaction volumes can be attributed to increased activity of the IT/ITeS industry and of the co-working sector, a release said.

Demand continues to remain concentrated in west Hyderabad, mainly in and around the HiTec City. “Primarily driven by the organic growth of technology and ITeS companies, this demand is expected to remain stable in the near future. Most of the large new projects are planned in and around HiTec City and Gachibowli and a similar quantum is proposed in the micro-markets of Nanakramguda, Financial District and Kokapet where large lands are available,” he said.

To queries, Mr. Arthur said the eco-system available in west Hyderabad coupled with availability of large land parcels, at prices that comparatively are affordable, is a major attraction. In east Hyderabad, getting the quantum of land at the right price is sometimes a challenge.

“In fact, land price in east is not low. Lack of demand may keep the rental low… but with high land prices it becomes unviable,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w5mgha/article30506888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07-HIGHRISEBUILDINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/west-firms-up-as-preferred-residential-office-space/article30506879.ece
326,2020/01/07,NRC shadow over ‘routine’ cordon and search?,"The concern and anxiety among citizens over the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register became palpable when residents of the Old City panicked and objected to the police asking them for documents, including Aadhaar card, during a ‘routine’ cordon and search operation.

The incident reportedly took place in the Syed Ali Chabutra locality, which comes under the Shalibanda police station limits, on Monday evening.

The video clip, which has since been widely shared on social media, shows Charminar Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen legislator Mumtaz Ahmed Khan intervening on behalf of locals.

Mr Khan then proceeds to inform the police officers that there are concerns in connection with the NRC, and objects to police allegedly instructing residents to produce Aadhaar cards, and claims that they are ‘harassing’ people. He then urges police to leave the area.

“The people are worried about NRC in the first place. What kind of cordon and search is this? Why are you asking for Aadhaar cards?” he says and then claims to have received 25 calls in this connection.

When contacted, Falaknuma Division Assistant Commissioner of Police M A Rasheed confirmed that the incident took place. “We began the cordon and search at 5 pm. The MLA came around 6 pm when we were about to finish. We asked them for vehicle documents, registration and driving licence,” he said.

When asked whether asking residents to produce Aadhaar cards was as per procedure, Mr Rasheed said, “We generally ask them for identification.”

GHMC Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar confirmed that the loan had been sanctioned by the State Bank of India with an interest rate of 8.65%, payable over 15 years.

The GHMC has listed 24 components of the SRDP under the loan, including the ongoing ones at various locations, which had slowed down for lack of fund flow.

The corporation cannot avail the whole amount at once as in the case of bonds, but will get phase-wise release of funds paid directly to the agencies, based on the progress of the works, and the bills raised thereof.

That way, the GHMC can save on the interest accumulation over the idle funds, officials said.

This is the first time that the GHMC is exploring the loan option from the funding plan sanctioned by the government, after going for bond issue thrice.

Of the ₹1000 crore aimed to be raised through bond issue, the corporation has been able to raise ₹495 crore so far in three instalments.

In the latest instance, only ₹100 crore could be raised through the electronic bidding platform of the Bombay Stock Exchange, against the ₹300 crore target, as the coupon rate was very high at 10.23%, moderated to around 9% after ₹13 crore incentive by the Central government.

The rupee term loan is a shot in the arm for the corporation, thus far facing difficulties even to pay for property acquisition, which constitutes a sizeable component of the prestigious project.

Several properties are yet to be acquired on stretches such as Jubilee Hills, Uppal, Amberpet, L. B. Nagar, Bairamalguda, Bala Nagar, and Bahadurpura, the compensation for which could amount to ₹800 crore.

The funds could also be useful for the upcoming projects which could not be grounded due to lack of funds even after tenders are finalised.

328,2020/01/07,CPI(M) seeks inquiry into Chengicherla abattoir lease,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has raised questions about the sanction of lease for Chengicherla abattoir and demanded a thorough inquiry into the issue.

Through a letter to the Director-General, Vigilance & Enforcement on Tuesday, the party’s city unit alleged that the lessee of the abattoir had got undue favour from the Telangana State Sheep & Goat Development Cooperative Federation, in grant of the least at ₹1.92 crore per annum.

With the capacity of 6,000 sheep or goat and 400 cattle per shift, the 70-acre Chengicherla facility is the largest in the city, yet it was given away for the least amount of lease, it alleged.

On the contrary, the slaughter house at Amberpet, with a capacity for slaughtering 2,400 sheep/goat and 720 cattle, was leased out for ₹10.29 crore.

The one at New Bhoiguda, with a capacity for slaughtering 1200 goat/sheep and 480 cattle, was leased out for ₹9.29 crore, and the Ramnaspura facility with a capacity for 250 cattle, was given for ₹5.19 crore, the letter said.

Participating in the IITH Alumni Day held at the premises on Sunday, Mr Mohan Reddy said that IITians are valued across the globe for their intellect and IIT Hyderabad alumni now has a responsibility to make the institute a known entity.

Mr. Mohan Reddy also spoke about the need and importance of endowment and how the institute’s alumni can play a pivotal role in it. He also announced the PAN India IIT Meet which will be hosted by IIT Hyderabad in December 2020.

Prof. B.S. Murty, Director, recalled how overwhelming it was to see the institute’s alumni in Japan and knowing they are excelling in their fields.

He highlighted the importance of mentoring the existing students. Prof. Murthy has announced the first weekend of every year as Alumni Day for IITH from this year onwards and agreed to support alumni with a certified course in their field of work.

Prof. K Siva Kumar, Dean International & Alumni Affairs, said being a second-generation IIT, the institute was proud to say that they have at least an alumnus in each continent.

“Alumni undertake a Mentorship Programme where they mentor first-year students. An Alumni does an exclusive mentoring session for one new student. To increase the Alumni-connect, IITH alumni are meeting as often and wherever possible.

For example, in November 2019, out of 130 alumni based in Japan, around 100 alumni turned up to meet the new Director, Prof. B. S. Murty,” said Mr. S Shalu Kumar, president, IITH Alumni Association.

336,2020/01/07,BCs stage protest seeking release of fee reimbursement dues,"Members belonging to the Backward Classes Welfare Association (BCWA) staged a protest in front of the Samkshema Bhavan here on Monday demanding release of fee reimbursement dues, cancellation of biometric attendance system in hostels and sanction subsidy loans to BC Corporation beneficiaries.

Speaking at the protest, National BCWA president R. Krishnaiah alleged that the State government is functioning with anti-BC attitude and that it needs to be changed. On the condition that meals would be provided to inmates of BC welfare hostels only after registering their biometric attendance, he said that it hurts their self-esteem.

He explained that the budget allocation for BC communities was reduced to ₹2,890 crore this year (2019-20) from ₹5,678 crore last year, when there was a need to increase it to at least ₹10,000 crore. Demanding immediate release of ₹1,400 crore fee reimbursement dues pertaining to the last year, Mr. Krishnaiah said several college managements are pressurising BC students and their parents to clear the fee and are refusing to give certificates to students who completed their studies.

As a result, a large number of students who had passed BE, B.Tech, Pharmacy, M.Tech, MBA, MCA and other post-graduate courses are unable to get their pass certificates and marks memos since the college managements are holding the documents in lieu of fee dues, the BCWA founder said. When asked, the managements respond that they would give certificates only after the fee dues are cleared.

Further, the managements are also asking the second and third year students to clear the fee stating that they would refund it after they get the amount released from the government. He also pointed out that some colleges are not allowing students to attend classes if the fee is not paid. The managements are not giving certificates even to the students who secured jobs after completing the academic courses, he alleged.

Mr. Krishnaiah also demanded the government to increase the scholarship amount from ₹500 a month to ₹2,000 to Intermediate and under-graduate degree students, from ₹650 to ₹2,500 per month to students of engineering, pharmacy and other post-graduate courses, open 300 new college hostels for SC, ST and BC students, to commence 119 BC residential schools at least from the coming academic year and sanction of stipend to all eligible students.

337,2020/01/07,"On day 1, patrol vehicles receive 28 complaints","A day after police announced that citizens can lodge their complaint with police personnel in patrol vehicles, a total of 28 complaints were received on Monday, of which 10 First Information Reports (FIR) were registered.

Speaking to The Hindu, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said that apart 10 FIRs, four petty cases were booked and the rest were entered in the general diary of the station as they don’t have any cognisable content.

“The highest number of cases, 10, were booked in West Zone, followed by six each in North and South Zones and three each in Central and East Zone,” he said.

On Sunday, Mr Kumar said that instead of going to a police station to lodge a complaint, citizens can approach a police patrol vehicle, lodge a complaint and get an FIR.

“You can give a complaint in writing by mentioning your address and cell number to the patrol car officers of your area for getting a case registered. For registration of FIR, one need not come to the police station,” he said, adding that the new initiative which was started at the beginning of the New Year is part of the people-friendly policing concept.

According to the Kotwal of Hyderabad, the concept of lodging a complaint will help women and senior citizens, as they don’t have to go to a police station in case of an emergency. Before this new initiative was announced, it was mandatory for the complainant to go to a police station and submit a written complaint, after which an FIR will be issued to launch a probe.

Citizens can also get details and contact numbers of the nearest patrol vehicle from Hyderabad City Police website or Telangana police’s HawkEye mobile application.

338,2020/01/07,‘Start Practice School option for engg. students’,"IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao has suggested that colleges incorporate a ‘Practice School’ option, that exists in Germany, to allow students to practice concepts learnt in classrooms in real-life situations.

The Minister said the practice school also sensitises students to the ways of workplace behaviour by assigning time-bound projects as in a company, and the JNTU-H was actively considering this.

His comments are significant in the context of his opinion that IT for 20 years has been Information Technology but now IT is Intelligence Technology and the time has now come to redefine it. The practice school can be of six or 12 months duration, he said.

He expressed the views while addressing engineering education experts at the inauguration of 7th International Conference on ‘Transformations in Engineering Education’ held at Anurag Group of Institutions (AGI) campus near Ghatkesar on Monday.

The IT Minister hoped that the colleges would kick-start this concept from the next academic year itself and suggested the gathering to seek help of founder and executive director, Cyient India Ltd, B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, who is also the honorary Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Stating that the Telangana government was committed to quality in all stages of education, he reminded how Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took a tough call of getting all the 220 engineering colleges inspected to maintain standards.

He said when industry complained of lack of skill-sets among engineering students, the government came out with the Telangana Academy of Skills and Knowledge (TASK). In the past five years, TASK reached out to 680 colleges, trained 5,070 faculty members and 2.9 lakh students in various skill-sets, he informed.

Mr. Rao also announced that TASK will expand its footprints to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities like Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Khammam and Nalgonda soon.

Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, MLC and Chairman of Anurag Group of Institutions, said the college believes in building a strong nation by delivering better engineers. He said the Anurag group would soon be a private university.

Michael Milligan, executive director and CEO, Abet, and Education Minister Sabitha Indra Reddy also spoke.

340,2020/01/07,Construction on Musi riverside continues unabated,"On a Sunday evening in September 1908, it began to drizzle in surrounding areas of the city. Then it began to pour in an area sprawled over 2,227 square kilometres at the foothills of Anantagiri forest in Vikarabad and its surrounding areas. This was the catchment area of the Musi River. It had 17,000 small and medium tanks and had sparse vegetation.

On September 28, 1908, as rain continued, the embankment of these tanks gave way one after the other creating a wall of water estimated at 425,000 cusecs that roared through Hyderabad killing 15,000 people. Today, it is unimaginable to think that the river can be in spate.

The two dams built in early 20th century have effectively killed the river. Within the city, the Hussainsagar, Mir Alam, Afzal Sagar, Jalpalli, Ma-Sehaba Tank, Talab Katta, Saroor Nagar Lake have all but disappeared reducing the flow of rain water into the river.

The result has been runaway construction activity on the river bed. In Ramdevguda, the area under Army on the river’s western bank has zero construction activity. But on the eastern side,many apartment complexes, warehouses and work sheds have come up. Downstream, dumping construction and building waste in the river is a 24-hour activity as chunks of it are reclaimed and flattened. The island of Imlibun in the Musi is now part of the city with a spiderweb of roads connecting it.

On Monday, a social media user posted photographs on the other side of Imlibun where construction material has been flattened to create parking space. Though everyone, from the MA&UD Minister to GHMC official, was tagged, there has been no response to the post. In the absence of tough laws to deal with encroachers, destruction of Musi’s riverbed is unlikely to stop any time soon.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/construction-on-musi-riverside-continues-unabated/article30497425.ece

Principal Secretary (Agriculture) C. Parthasarathi said at a meeting held at the Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University at Mulug in Siddipet district on Monday.

Import and cultivation

Experts on oilpalm cultivation from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Costa Rica and other countries would attend the meeting being jointly organised by National Oilpalm Research Centre, Indican Council for Agricultural Research, Ministry of Agriculture and Telangana Government.

Stating that the country was importing 14 million tonnes of edible oils, particularly palm oil, from Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina and other countries, Mr. Parthasarathi said against the expert committee report that while there was scope for oilpalm cultivation on 20 lakh hectares in 18 States, it was being cultivated in only 3.45 lakh hectares.

Specialised areas such as genome sequencing, smart farming, digital technology and others in developing the high-breed varieties with higher productivity would be discussed at the meeting to be held from April 16 to 18.

342,2020/01/07,Sea of sewage: Musi reduced to a stinking slurry,"First, the good news: the Musi River that flows through Hyderabad is now a perennial river. The bad news: most of the water is sewage dumped into the river basin by the booming population.

The river begins its journey in the city from the Himayatsagar dam. Just under the dam wall, there are small pools of water. Water that seeps and collects just under the 20th-century dam built to protect Hyderabad from the monsoon fury of the Musi. This is the Esi tributary of the river. A few kilometres to the west is the Osmansagar or Gandipet reservoir. There is no discharge of water from the dam in January and the Musa tributary of the river is a bed of rocks and small scattered puddles.

Stagnant build-up

Following the riverbed, north brings us to the Tipu Khan Bridge and there is sufficient build-up of stagnant water. The waste water from the surrounding colonies finds its way to the river. Further north is the newly built Langar Houz bridge.

An octagonal stone marks the point where the Musa and Esi tributaries of the river merge. The river is now a flowing frothing black stream. A little beyond is the Bapughat where the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed in the river. It was among the 11 places in the country where the ashes were immersed. Now, funeral rites are performed there for commoners. For performing rituals, the workers have created a small bund with sandbags to keep sufficient water in the river.

Further down the river, where it turns east, the floodplains have high-rises on one side and a shanty-town on the other. At the Attapur bridge, the stream looks like a river lapping both the banks as people stop and throw plastic bags filled with trash into it.

A few hundred metres downstream is the 51-MLD sewage treatment plant (STP) that treats water from Bapughat, Bahadurpura and Mughal ka Naka areas. There are vast settlement tanks. “This is new technology, both the aeration and settlement is done in the same tank,” says a staffer at the site. The air near the tanks has the rancid odour of thousands of eggs gone bad. There is one more 23-MLD STP at the same location.

Before the entrance, there is a new schematic diagram for ‘Faecal Sludge and Septage Management Facility’. It will involve treating faecal matter before it enters the grit chamber of STP.

“All these years, the faecal matter was treated along with other waste water. This specialised treatment is better as the generated waste can be used as fertiliser. It has no smell and can be handled normally,” says Srinivasa Chary of Administrative Staff College of India, shaking a glass beaker with dark brown crystalline soil.

ASCI was the knowledge partner for Telangana’s policy on Faecal Sludge and Septage Management.

Slime and stink

At Attapur, the project is yet to go on stream. As the river winds its way past Ganesh Ghat and Puranapul Shamshan Bhoomi, the water gets increasingly darker. A spanking wide concrete road stretches from Toli Masjid to the Purana Pul passing the old abattoir, sheep market and transfer station of GHMC at Ziyaguda. The animal waste from the abattoir finds its way into the river. Near Purana Pul built in 1578, a community of washermen go about their tasks by digging small pits to draw clear water for their washing purpose.

On the other side, under the road in front of the Telangana High Court building is a ramp that leads down to the river front garden. The river is walled up in dressed stone and under a beautiful horseshoe arch flows the untreated sewage from the surrounding areas of Charminar. It fills up a small tank.

“This water is pumped to Amberpet where it is treated and released into the river,” informs a sanitary worker who complains about snakes and mosquitoes.

The sanitary worker’s unenviable job is to stir the water laced with faecal matter to ensure that it doesn’t get clogged. Amberpet is one of the biggest STPs for the city with a capacity of 339 MLD.

“Water from Purana Pul as well as other distant places reaches this plant. We treat the water and frequently test for standard parameters. The water released from the plant meets the river water standards,” says the official in-charge of the STP.

As per a Central Pollution Control Board report on June 28, 2019, only 49% of the sewage generated by the city is treated while 51% untreated sewage from drains and nalas is discharged directly into the river.

Of the 22 STPs in the city, 13 are not operating to full capacity. Out of 20 STPs, five were found to be not complying with discharge norms. The city generates estimated sewage of 1,400 ML per day (180 litres per person norm). Of this, the Pollution Control Board estimates that 592 MLD is treated and rest is untreated sewage turning the river into a foul stinking slurry that flows through the city.

The result? At Nagole, beside the newly-established Shilparamam, the river is broad — it gurgles and roars out of the city. The dark frothing water is nearly 200 metres wide but to call the flowing slime a river would be a travesty.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/zbzn9/article30497406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06-2MUSIRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sea-of-sewage-musi-reduced-to-a-stinking-slurry/article30497395.ece
343,2020/01/07,Nitrate in Musi water at an alarming level,"The groundwater level in the southern part of Hyderabad is much higher, according to the Telangana Groundwater Department officials. But it carries a caveat. The water has higher nitrate content than the surrounding areas of the city. A higher nitrate content is usually a result of improper disposal of animal and human waste.

A 2013 study found that the nitrate (NO3) content is more than permissible limits of BIS drinking water standards in 72% of samples at Moosapet, Alwal, Qutub Shahi tombs, Tarnaka, Amberpet, Moosarambagh, Lalapet, Nallakunta, Secunderabad, Kavadiguda, Ranigunj, Gosha Mahal, Golconda fort, Langar house, Tolichowki, Sanath Nagar, Tadbund and Chandrayangutta.

The key indicator of untreated sewage is coliform count. At Nagole Bridge, the bacteria count indicated by coliform has gone up from 97 MPN/100 ml (most probable number/100 millilitres) in 2014 to 906 in 2015 and to 1,215 in 2016, dropping to 514 in 2017 before reaching 1,214 in 2018.

The stress on water quality can be seen over the past five years from the data analysed by Telangana State Pollution Control Board. The other indicator of health of river water is biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Rivers are expected to have a BOD below 1 mg/L. Moderately polluted rivers have a BOD value in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. Rivers get classified as severely polluted when BOD values exceed 8 mg/L. The BOD of the Musi River ranged between 2 at Osmansagar and in double digits at Bapughat, Moosarambagh and Nagole bridge and beyond.

Another indicator of the health of a river is the presence of dissolved oxygen. Decaying organic matter uses up the dissolved oxygen. The rotting organic matter gives off a foul stench that pervades through the city where the Musi flows.

344,2020/01/07,New Kochi Corporation building in the making for 15 years,"The construction of the new Kochi Corporation building that should have taken a year or two, has taken the civic body a grand total of 15 years and counting. The end is still nowhere in sight.

Work on the six-storey building on 1.5 acres near Marine Drive began in 2005. The contractor halted work in 2008, complaining of some costs being omitted from the estimates. The estimates, prepared by corporation engineers, had left out plastering costs and had underestimated the number of reinforcing steel bars required.

The matter was taken to court, and a Government Order was issued in 2015 to pay the contractor 25% in excess of the 2012 construction rates, after which work resumed. Another revised estimate was prepared in 2018 for the expenses left out of the initial estimate. The total cost had shot up from ₹12.70 crore in 2005 to ₹24.71 crore in 2018, a hefty bill that the corporation has been struggling to foot.

A proposal to apply for a loan of around ₹25 crore from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) to complete work on the building was placed before the corporation council earlier this year, but it was shot down by the Opposition.

“At a time when the corporation was already facing a shortage of funds, particularly for important projects like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, a loan to complete the construction was not apt. Till measures are taken to augment income, the debt burden should not rise,” said an Opposition councillor.

A councillor on the ruling side chalks it up to a political issue—the LDF not wanting to see the building being completed under a UDF-led council.

Structural work on the building is likely to be completed by March next year, said a source at the corporation, after which a fresh tender will have to be called to complete the interiors, plumbing, and electricity.

Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar is confident that the inauguration of at least the ground floor and the council hall will be possible before the current council’s term ends in October next year. He attributes the delay in work, even after revised estimates were drawn up, to a perpetual shortage of funds that had impeded payments to the contractor.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/85sx4i/article30505542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-CORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/new-corpn-building-in-the-making-for-15-years/article30505543.ece

348,2020/01/07,‘Sustainability key to profitability of marine fisheries’,"Marine fisheries will be more profitable if ocean resources are made sustainable. “Even though it is not easy to maintain sustainability it is possible with united efforts and determination,” said Petri Suuronen, director, Blue Economy Natural Resources Institute, Finland.

He was speaking after inaugurating the third international symposium on marine ecosystem: challenges and opportunities (MECOS-3) at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute here on Tuesday.

A renowned researcher in marine fisheries, the scientist said policy makers, government agencies and other stakeholders in the sector should cooperate and work together to achieve sustainability.

The fisheries sector in Europe has done well in sustainability, achieved with hard work and mutual cooperation, he said pointing out that better fisheries management during the last two decades helped decrease fishing pressure and many fish stocks have been recovering. As a result fishing is significantly more profitable than 30 years ago, he said.

India too can emulate such models to address issues in the sector and to intensify attempts for achieving the target. Around 60% of fisheries resources are now sustainable in European countries and hopefully this progress will continue. “I believe many of the important fisheries are not sustainable in many Asian countries, including India,” Dr. Suuronen said.

Threats to ecosystems

A. Gopalakrishnan, director of CMFRI, said that essential fish habitats faced serious anthropogenic as well as natural pressures. Seventy per cent of the corals are degraded and sea grasses are losing 7% of their known area annually. Presence of invasive species, increase in number and extent of dead zones and rising pollution rates also contribute to the collapse of many ecosystems.

Organised by the Marine Biological Association of India, the four-day symposium will be a stage for discussions on a wide range of topics including impact of climate crisis in marine ecosystems and unusual warming of the Arabian Sea.

The third Dr. S. Jones Memorial Prize, instituted by MBAI for outstanding contributions in marine biology and fisheries, was presented to T.

349,2020/01/07,PCB to monitor Maradu situation,"The State-Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management has asked the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) to ensure that the demolition of four apartment buildings at Maradu is carried out without giving room for any complaints related to environment pollution.

Meanwhile, with the four flats set to be pulled down this weekend, the agencies tasked with the implosion have begun loading explosives into Alfa Serene.

A directive issued by the committee, appointed by the National Green Tribunal, said the PCB could proceed against the violators, if necessary.

The board has informed the committee that there will be dust and noise pollution during the implosion and at the time of segregation of debris.

Construction materials from the demolition would be handed over to crushers. The board will closely monitor pollution in the demolition area.

Contracts

The contracts for the demolition of flats were issued and pre-demolition works were almost complete. As per the contract, all salvages, including steel, will be taken by the bidders.

It is the responsibility of the Maradu municipality to dispose of the debris.

The board said conditions had been included in the agreement signed between the Maradu municipality and the agencies involved in the demolition process stating that steps would be taken to mitigate air pollution immediately after blasting and during the period required for separation of steel from concrete.

The technical committee constituted by the government has given instructions to cover the compound up to a height of 10 metres to avoid flying of debris and to control dust pollution during the process of blasting.

The agreement has directions to use sprinklers so as to control the dust pollution during the process of separating steel from concrete blocks.

The contractors had said that they would use jack hammers for the work.

The board pointed out that trenches of 1.5 metres to 3 metres depth would be set up around each plot boundary to reduce the vibration emerging out of the implosion.

The agencies involved expect that the debris of the demolished towers may not reach the nearby Vembanad Lake.

However, the officials involved remain in the dark on how the final impact will be on the lake.

The SLMC was also informed that the municipality had provided insurance coverage for all nearby residents for one year from the date of the demolition.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cvnceq/article30498017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07KIMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-to-monitor-maradu-situation/article30498018.ece
350,2020/01/07,Residents to get air pollution data,"The public will get a detailed analytical data on air pollution following the implosion of the apartment complexes at Maradu within two days.

The State Pollution Control Board will study the particulate matter pollution following the implosion real-time.

The data gathered will be crucial in assessing the environment compensation to be fixed on violators in the wake of air pollution recording levels beyond permissible levels, according to board officials associated with the process.

The process of setting up air monitoring stations at the four apartment buildings to be demolished will be carried out on Tuesday. The size-selective sampling will be done as per the norms prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.

The air pollution levels based on the PM 10 (particles with a diameter of 10 or less) and PM 2.5 (particles of diameter 2.5 or less) levels of particulate matter will be assessed for a duration of eight hours from the time of implosion. The safe permissible limits for PM 10 and PM 2.5 particulate matter are 100 and 60 respectively. The data could be made available to the public within two days, said board officials.

“The wind direction at the time of implosion is expected to be towards the southern side of the apartments. We have identified specific locations near all the four structures to set up the equipment for real-time monitoring. As we have not studied the impact of such large-scale implosion, the process will be approached as if we are tackling a natural calamity,” they said.

The board will initiate action as per the provisions of the Environment Act against those responsible for carrying out the demolition process, if the air pollution levels are beyond permissible limits.

The board has recommended the use of water sprinklers to minimise the impact of air pollution following the implosion. Fire and Rescue Services personnel will be deployed near all the four sites to spray water immediately after the demolition process.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/residents-to-get-air-pollution-data/article30498014.ece
351,2020/01/07,Builder seeks enhanced insurance coverage,"The managing director of Heera Construction Company, which has put up an apartment complex next to Golden Kayaloram, the apartment that will be demolished on Sunday, has approached the Kerala High Court seeking to issue directions to the authorities for providing an insurance coverage of ₹125 crore.

The apartment, Heera Wind Faire, is located hardly six metres away from the building to be demolished.

There are 95 units in the building that was constructed by spending about ₹95 crore and nearly 80% of the housing units have been sold off, the petitioner submitted.

The petitioner contended that the respondents had taken an insurance policy for ₹50 crore to compensate the damage to all the buildings in the area, which may be caused by the demolition. The insurance coverage was grossly insufficient, he submitted.

The petitioner further submitted that the authorities had not taken proper steps to cover the risk of the building. Though the Sub Collector, who was in charge of the demolition job, had inspected the property several times, he had not divulged the steps taken to compensate the petitioner in case of damage due to demolition.

352,2020/01/07,Municipality kept in the dark on developments: chairperson,"With the four flats at Maradu set to be pulled down this weekend, the agencies tasked with the implosion have begun loading explosives into Alfa Serene, while Maradu municipality chairperson T.H. Nadeera alleged that the municipality had not been informed of important developments in the process.

Three floors of the flat, one of the two that will be razed on Saturday, were loaded with explosives on Monday. The entire flat would require 400 kg of emulsion explosives loaded into 3,600 holes, said R. Venugopal, deputy chief controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO).

Explosives will be loaded into all four buildings and the pillars will be wrapped with geotextile fibre by Thursday. Meanwhile, teams of police persons, Maradu municipality staff and revenue officials met residents living within 200 metres of the flat who would have to evacuate during the implosion. “They were told about what they should do before they leave their houses like covering windows and closing doors and switching off electricity,” said Snehil Kumar Singh, Fort Kochi RDO, who is in-charge of the demolition.

Door-to-door campaign

The team went door-to-door around Holy Faith and Alfa Serene flats and a similar exercise will be repeated on Tuesday.

While Mr. Singh maintained that apprehensions of the residents had been resolved, Maradu municipality chairperson T.H. Nadeera said that most residents still lacked confidence in the implosion process.

She alleged that the municipality had been kept in the dark about details like the change in timing of Alfa Serene’s implosion from 11.30 a.m. to 11.05 a.m.

There was still no clarity about the insurance either, she said.

K.A. Shaji, who lives near Alfa Serene, said that the residents continued to remain anxious about the impending implosion and its consequences. They were also unsure about the insurance and had not seen any agreement yet, he said.

A mock drill is scheduled for Friday in which police, fire and ambulance vehicles will be positioned, entries and exits from the area will be marked and a mock control room will be set up.

A team from IIT Madras would arrive on Thursday to set up equipment that would measure vibrations from the implosion, Mr. Singh said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/municipality-kept-in-the-dark-on-developments-chairperson/article30498007.ece

354,2020/01/07,Corpn. shelves mapping project for property tax collection,"Even as the Kozhikode-based Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) takes advantage of the spurt in demand for accurate geospatial data, particularly after the 2018 floods in the State, the Kochi Corporation has cold-shouldered the cooperative’s proposal to map the area for improved property tax collection efficiency.

LSGD order

An order from the Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) from October 2018 issued to local bodies across the State suggested that they implement a Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping project through ULCCS. An agenda with the company’s proposal was placed before the Corporation Council in August last year, but was set aside for further discussion.

Despite being a useful project, it had not been revived since, mostly on the grounds that the ₹5.29-crore figure quoted by ULCCS was too high, said M. B. Muraleedharan, member of finance standing committee. The Opposition argued that the e-governance system should be put in place before such a mapping process was executed.

Merging of projects

Since a mapping project is already being implemented by the District Town Planning Department, the finance committee suggested that the council could consider merging the two projects to save funds, while using ULCCS’s base map, which promised to be more accurate.

The committee also suggested that the satellite images procured for the Town Planning Department could be shared with ULCCS to cut costs.

Deputy Mayor K. R. Premakumar said the agency was not picked through a competitive process that might have been able to lower the prices, but the proposal had not been discarded entirely.

The project, Intelligent Property Management System, being implemented by Uralungal Technology Solutions, the cooperative’s technology arm, aims to facilitate automation of property tax estimation.

According to a source at the cooperative, completion of the project in eight municipalities and panchayats and ongoing work in 20 others across the State had demonstrated that the State continues to lose a large amount of tax revenue because many parameters such floor area, the zone in which the property is located, the kind of roofing, basic amenities available, and width of the road in front of the property were not being mapped clearly.

“In a small municipality of around 30,000 households, there can be an increase of 40% to 50% in tax collected if these parameters are mapped scientifically,” said the source.

Drone technology

Since satellite imagery, which is used for most mapping processes, can offer ground resolution of only around 40 cm, the project deploys drone technology with multiple high resolution cameras for a ground resolution of at least 4 cm. Socio-economic data from the area is also collected to gauge the residents’ development needs and access to basic utilities.

The project was cumbersome to implement, particularly in Kerala where tree cover was dense, which was why multiple mapping projects had been initiated and abandoned, the source said. Within Kochi Corporation limits, the presence of Naval establishments would require additional permissions to fly a drone and that could prolong the process.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corpn-shelves-mapping-project-for-property-tax-collection/article30497751.ece
355,2020/01/07,"NHAI must make optimal use of corridor width, says expert","It is shocking that the four-lane Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass caters to over one lakh passenger car units (PCUs) every day, which require an eight-lane highway for safe and fast commuting, road safety expert Upendra Narayanan has said.

The huge number of vehicles, including container and national-permit lorries, tanker lorries, goods-carrier autorickshaws, intra and inter-district passenger vehicles, which jostle for space on the 16-km corridor where toll is collected, and traffic hold-ups at junctions, have resulted in commuting speed averaging at less than 20 kmph. The high accident rate on the corridor has been attributed to vehicles being unable to keep a safe distance from one another, which often result in pile-ups involving multiple vehicles. The NHAI must make optimal use of available width of the corridor to carve out refuge lanes at U-turns and to widen the main carriageway, he said.

“The plethora of adverse driving conditions on the stretch has been accentuated by unscientific location of many U-turns, road cuttings located in between the NH Bypass and service roads and lack of bus bays. Narrow, ill-maintained, garbage-ridden and heavily-encroached upon service roads make matters worse for both motorists and pedestrians. No wonder that a bulk of the 4,300-odd road-accident deaths occur on the State’s highways,” said Mr. Narayanan.

He further sought proactive patrolling by highway patrol teams of the Kerala Police and clampdown on rule violators. The enforcement personnel must go through refresher courses to upgrade their domain knowledge of road safety issues.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/nhai-must-make-optimal-use-of-corridor-width-says-expert/article30497743.ece
356,2020/01/07,Pedestrian fatalities on bypass leave road users worried,"Frequent accidents involving pedestrians on the Edappally-Aroor National Highway Bypass, the latest being on Thursday when an elderly woman was fatally knocked down by a motorbike at accident-prone Chakkaraparambu Junction while her granddaughter suffered injuries, have set alarm bells ringing among road users.

The 16-km-long, four-lane corridor witnesses movement of approximately one lakh passenger car units (PCUs) every day, most of them from other States and districts. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) installing foot overbridges (FOBs) at five locations on the corridor has not been of much help, since lights have not been installed on the structures. Pedestrians, mostly elderly people and children, continue to cross the busy NH stretch, since climbing the steps of the FOB is a tough proposition for them.

Even worse, pedestrian-crossing lines beneath the FOBs were subsequently erased. This forces pedestrians to risk their life and cross the road, resulting in accidents. Blinkers to warn speeding motorists is available only at U-turns, many of which are located away from junctions. A senior official of City Traffic Police-Edappally expressed concern over the NHAI not repainting pedestrian lines and other road markings and lighting up crossing points, even though they have faded away at many places. “Neither have adequate number of mandatory signboards been erected to warn motorists of pedestrian-dense areas. All these force people to jaywalk, only to lead to accidents.”

Kochi Corporation’s former councillor N.A. Shafeeq, who represented Chakkaraparambu division, said the NHAI and the police had failed to prevent accidents at the junction, despite memoranda submitted by residents’ associations and political parties. “The least that the NHAI can do is to build a well-lit FOB having escalators on either side, do a safety audit and implement remedial measures at the junction where over 10 people have died in accidents during the past 13 years.”

Mr. Shafeeq sought steps to hew out U-turns well before the junction, so that motorists from the NH Bypass can enter service roads at ease, rather than crowd around bus stops which are located right at the junction.

Responding to safety issues along the NH Bypass, NHAI sources said the operation-maintenance-toll (OMT) contractor was duty-bound to ensure upkeep of the corridor and to augment safety measures wherever required. “The NHAI would do any improvement regarding engineering aspects of the road and allied infrastructure.” Safety measures on service roads too will be improved and a proposal to widen their tarred portion from 5.5-m to 7-m is awaiting the sanction of the head office. It will go hand in hand with evicting encroachers from the stretch and clamping down on haphazard parking, they added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/vg6dk2/article30497719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06KIPEDESTRIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pedestrian-fatalities-on-bypass-leave-road-users-worried/article30497721.ece

359,2020/01/07,Embodied processes and discussions help people think over the impact of CAA protests,"We live in difficult times. For weeks together, following the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), there have been pro and anti protests. Twitter and Facebook have been rife with opinions. Even as the protests continue, people are looking to have a dialogue and meaningful discussions, while expressing themselves without being judged or labelled. Bangalore Bridges, in association with kaTTe - The Creative Community, addresses this with their ‘Space to Reflect’ initiative. Whether anti or pro CAA, this reflection session gives you the right to express yourself, without any judgement or the pressure to inform or be informed.

We attended one session on January 3, which was facilitated by Rajesh Mehar, Maitri Gopalakrishna and Shabari Rao. Rajesh is a learning consultant, with experience in theatre and music. Maitri is a drama therapist and counselling psychologist, while Shabari, is a dance maker, educator and researcher.

As we entered kaTTe, where the session was held, a chart paper with the words: ‘Why are you here?’ adorned the wall. While soft music is played, which helped us calm down and relax, we were given time to think over our answers. This enabled us to think over questions we may have overlooked due to being bombarded with tweets and Facebook posts offering different opinions. Most importantly, it gave us the opportunity to consider all aspects of every argument. Following a brief introduction of each participant, the facilitators used embodied processes and discussions to enable us to go within and address our emotions, which ranged from confusion and helplessness to pain and indifference. Even though we were all strangers, by the end of the session we felt a sense of being heard and understood. Shabari adds: “This initiative was started by Maitri and myself. However, we invite different facilitators. The framework within which we work is not to judge, not to look to change someone’s position, and to acknowledge and work with diversity.”

The next session, to be facilitated by creative arts therapist Pallavi Chander and writer Rheea Rodrigues Mukherjee, will be held on January 12, 3 pm to 5 pm at kaTTe, #545, 4th cross, 6th Main Rd, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar.

361,2020/01/07,Bank retirees demand basic pension update,"The All Kerala Bank Retirees Forum has urged the Ministry of Finance to update basic pension and substantially increase family pension in accordance with the Bank Employees Pension Regulation.

Whenever a demand for updating pension and improving family pension was raised , the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the Ministry of Finance argued that any tilt in the pension scheme would adversely affect the pension corpus fund.

However, figures collected relating to retirements from banks during the next five years from March 31, 2019, showed that the cost of pension would be drastically reduced, said K.T. Babu, vice president of the forum.

He said the employees who had joined service from April 1, 2010, were out of the ambit of pension regulations of 1995 as they were covered by the National Pension System (NPS).

On careful consideration relating to 18 public sector banks, the State Bank of India and the Reserve Bank of India, a revision of basic pension and improvement in family pension would not affect the viability of the pension fund, said Mr. Babu.

He said more than one lakh employees and officers in the banking industry had opted for mass voluntary retirement in 2001. One of the main attractions of the scheme then was that they would get pension from the next month onwards, without considering the superannuation age of 60.

362,2020/01/07,Kozhikode lagging behind in implementing Amrut projects,"After drawing flak for delay in the execution of projects under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), the State Mission Management Unit is racing against the clock to implement schemes in Kozhikode city this fiscal.

As of now, 48 out of the 50 projects, including sub projects, have been awarded for the city under the flagship programme of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

Kozhikode is one of the nine cities or municipalities getting the benefits of Amrut in the State. However, the civic authority has secured a low credit rating for executing the projects over the last few years.

As of January 3, only seven projects have been completed, all in the water supply category. The completed works, executed by the Kerala Water Authority, include replacing old pipes and valves and interconnecting them with existing lines in two phases.

Officials said technical sanction had been accorded for all the 50 projects. The total tendered amount is ₹278.66 crore. However, the amount awarded for the works is ₹162.22 crore. Administration sanction has been given for ₹284.64 crore though initially the cost for all projects was pegged at ₹274.76 crore.

The cost escalation of nearly ₹10 crore was solely for implementing three projects under the sewerage component, said officials.

Twenty-eight projects (₹96.32 crore) have been planned for water supply; three for sewerage (₹130.62 crore); 10 for storm water drainage (₹41.43 crore); one for urban transport (₹11.35 crore) and eight for parks (₹4.92 crore).

An analysis of the ongoing works revealed that no projects assigned to the Kozhikode Corporation has been completed so far. In Thiruvananthapuram, 71 out of 121 projects have been completed, and in Kochi, the number of completed projects is 35 out of the 39 awarded. Kozhikode and Kollam corporations are the worst performers while Guruvayur municipality tops the chart in implementing projects in all sectors.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/wby4cc/article30506110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07KI-AMRUTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-lagging-behind-in-implementing-amrut-projects/article30506111.ece
363,2020/01/07,Cultural fete of transgender persons on Friday,"‘Chamayam 2020’, the annual cultural fiesta of the transgender community, will be held at Kozhikode Town Hall on Friday as part of the third anniversary celebrations of Punarjani Cultural Society, an organisation for the welfare of the community.

Society president Sisily George told reporters here on Tuesday that make-up artist Renju Renjimar will open the event at 10 a.m. on Friday, while welfare standing committee chairperson of Kozhikode Corporation Anitha Rajan will preside over.

A seminar on ‘Identity and rights of transgender individuals’ will be held at 11 a.m. Project Officer of State IT Cell Shyama S. Prabha, State Transgender Justice Board member Sheethal Shyam, Queerythm president Prajith P.K., poet Vijayaraja Mallika and social activist Daya Gayathri will take part in the discussions.

District panchayat president Babu Parasseri will open the cultural convention at 5 p.m. M.K. Muneer, MLA, and Sub Collector Priyanka G. will be the guests of honour. The first media award instituted by Punarjani will be presented on the occasion by Thalassery Sub Judge R.L. Baiju. V.S. Ranjith from Malayala Manorama is the winner of the award.

State-wide protest

Meanwhile, transgender activists were planning to launch a State-wide agitation in protest against the delay in nabbing the culprits in the murder cases of five transpersons from Kerala in the past three years, said Ms. Sisily.

The police have been unable to crack the cases despite making headway in some of them. It has been around eight months since Shalu, a transwoman, was murdered in Kozhikode. Though the police had identified the accused from CCTV footage, he had not yet been nabbed. “Though petitions had been forwarded to the Chief Minister and the State Police Chief, there has been no action. The Kerala State Human Rights Commission had registered a complaint, but it was yet to be taken up at its sitting,” added Ms. Sisily.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cultural-fete-of-transgender-persons-on-friday/article30506093.ece
364,2020/01/07,"ABVP seeking to shift blame for JNU attack, says activist","Functionaries of “Young India Against CAA-NRC-NPR”, a coordination committee with over 100 students’ organisations, students’ groups and civil society organisations as its members, have alleged that the Hindu Raksha Dal claiming responsibility for the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students and teachers on Sunday is a “diversionary tactic”.

N. Sai Balaji, president, All-India Students’ Association (AISA), which is part of the committee, alleged on Tuesday that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was afraid that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), its student outfit, had been accused of terrorising teachers and students. Examining social media accounts, the JNU students had proved that ABVP activists were behind the violence and their names had been circulated.

WhatsApp chat

The WhatsApp chat between these people too was put on the public domain. Now, the ABVP was trying to prove that someone else was responsible for the incident. Earlier, the Sangh Parivar had alleged that it was Leftist students who were behind the violence. Then how come new people are claiming responsibility now, he asked.

“The police should check the phone locations of ABVP leaders whose names we have exposed. Check their WhatsApp chats and call records. This includes a student leader from the Delhi University. If the police don’t do this, we know on whose side they are,” Mr. Balaji, a former president of JNU students’ union, said.

VC’s resignation sought

Mr. Balaji sought the resignation of M. Jagadesh Kumar, JNU Vice Chancellor, who had “failed” the students there. The Delhi City Police Commissioner too should face action as he had sided with the attackers, the AISA leader said. T.P. Ashrafali, national president, Muslim Students’ Federation, said that protests would be held in various cities, including Kozhikode, on January 20. As many as 10 lakh signatures would be collected against the CAA and seminars and public meetings would be held, he said",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/abvp-seeking-to-shift-blame-for-jnu-attack-says-activist/article30505473.ece
365,2020/01/07,Plan to do away with internal assessment,"The Left Democratic Front government is planning to do away with the practice of internal assessment for college students in the State.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel announced this at the Chief Minister’s Student Leaders’ Conclave at Farook College, near here, on Monday. The event, an interaction with functionaries of students unions in colleges and universities, was a second of its kind in the State.

Students from Calicut University, Kannur University, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University, Kerala Agricultural University, Kerala Kalamandalam, and Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University were present.

Mr. Vijayan said that steps had been taken to ensure that students did not fail in examination only because of their bad performance during internal assessment.

The practice itself could be done away with soon, he added.

The Chief Minister was responding to the suggestions of students on the issue. The syllabi in universities would be revised next academic year, Mr. Vijayan said.

Dr. Jaleel told mediapersons later that the alleged revengeful actions against students in engineering colleges by managements and teachers were being curbed.

“The Kerala Technological University has already decided that there will be no minimum marks for internal assessment. This will be extended to all other universities in the State next academic year,” Dr. Jaleel said.

Mr. Vijayan said the government was considering 50% reservation for women in college students’ unions. The demand was pertinent in view of the presence of a high number of girl students.

University libraries would remain open 24 hours and there would not be any restriction for girl students, Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister said that reading of the preamble of the Constitution would be made a daily affair in schools in the State.

There are plans to introduce sex education for students. Though a conservative section had always opposed it, there was a need to change with the times, Mr. Vijayan said.

The participants highlighted the need to have proper waste management system in place and environment protection measures in place.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/yhyboj/article30501071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-KI-PINARAYI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/plan-to-do-away-with-internal-assessment/article30501072.ece
366,2020/01/07,Chief Minister launches work on Njeliyanparamba plant,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the construction work for the waste-to-energy plant at the Njeliyanparamba trenching ground here on Monday.

Speaking on the occasion, he said the existing situation at the dumping ground of Kozhikode city would drastically change with the completion of the plant.

The State will also obtain 6MW of power after treating around 300 tonnes of waste daily.

The technologically advanced plant will be a model for the State. Similar projects will be implemented in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kannur districts, Mr. Vijayan said.

The plant, to be established in three phases, will be fully functional in 18 months. It will be set up on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. It will come up on 12. 67 acres handed by the Kozhikode Corporation to the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation.

The Malabar Waste Management will manage the plant for 25 years. As of now, only legacy waste will be subjected to bio-mining. Later, a biomethanisation plant to handle wet waste and a waste-energy plant will be established.

The municipalities of Feroke, Koyilandy, and Ramanattukkara and Olavanna, Kadalundi and Kunnamangalam grama panchayats will also benefit from the project. Earlier, KSIDC officials, secretaries of local bodies, and the company signed an agreement for setting up the project.

368,2020/01/07,NSS volunteers lend a hand of help to landslip survivors,"Compassion was the only asset they had when they initially thought of building two houses for the two hapless landslip-hit families in Karinchola village of Kozhikode.

The dream took wing when around 14,000 National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers from various higher secondary schools stood shoulder-to-shoulder to mobilise nearly ₹16 lakh for the cause. Finally, the two beneficiaries—Sumathi Karinchola and Ananya Anilkumar—walked into their new homes after securing keys from Education Minister C. Ravindranath on Monday.

Apart from mobilising the project fund, the students who initiated the charity move had set a model by joining the construction work under skilled labourers. There were students from all the 139 NSS units in Kozhikode district to strive in a land where landslips had razed 27 houses to ground claiming 14 lives.

“A visit to the grief-stricken spot was an unforgettable experience for many of our volunteers. It prompted them to help their fellow beings tide over the mental trauma. Funds were hardly a problem as sponsors lent a helping hand,” said S. Sreechith, NSS district coordinator. He added that the students could complete the two projects within a year with support from various quarters.

On Monday, as many as 370 NSS volunteers joined the official key handover ceremony, which was chaired by Parakkal Abdulla in Kattippara panchayat.

They also gifted all essential home accessories and appliances to Sumathi and Ananya. To take the team spirit forward, they also announced their decision to construct one more house in the area for another beneficiary.

NSS volunteers said the houses were gifted to those who had been shortlisted earlier by the Revenue Department and grama panchayat authorities. The safe land for the construction of the 500-sq ft houses was identified by the government, they added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ufsiot/article30497709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-KI-RAVINDRANATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/nss-volunteers-lend-a-hand-of-help-to-landslip-survivors/article30497710.ece

373,2020/01/07,‘Lankan Tamil women suffered due to migration to other countries’,"Study of Tamil Diaspora literature should focus on the role of class, caste and gender in migration of people from one country to another, said poet and actor V.I.S. Jayapalan.

Speaking at a seminar on Diaspora Literature: Resuscitation of Forgotten History organised by the Tamil Research Centre of American College here on Monday, Mr. Jayapalan said that the migration of Tamils of Tamil Nadu to outside world happened among the traders first.

And under the colonial rule, the dalits were taken to the tea estates in Malaysia and Sri Lanka as working class.

“Among the poor, while others suffered only economic oppression, the dalits also suffered caste-based oppression. As the English started to treat as equal all people under the colonial jurisdiction, the dalits did not feel the caste-based oppression when they were taken out to other countries,” he said.

In Sri Lanka, while the poor Tamils migrated to Malaysia, Singapore and Australia as working class, the educated due to their English-knowledge went to the English-speaking countries to serve there as postmasters, station masters and teaching faculty in colleges.

“Migration used to happen only among the men during wars at Sri Lanka. While the upper caste men would leave first, men from other communities would follow. After they settle down in far-off countries, they would take their family members,” Mr. Jayapalan said.

“Sri Lankan Tamil women suffered due to the migration to other countries. This was because Sri Lanka Tamils had a matriarchal society where the men after marriage would go to the women’s house and women controlled the assets. But, when women migrated, they had to go to the husband’s house,” he said.

Adding that the men would chose not to help women become independent, they would force women to have children at short intervals so that they could not learn English and remain chained at home under the men’s dominance,” he said.

374,2020/01/07,IRCS to aid injured jallikattu players,"Jallikattu, a popular bull-taming sport, is said to be one of the most dangerous sports. Unpredictability is intrinsic to this sport, during which a large number of tamers get injured.

To provide first aid to the injured players, a group of 10 volunteers belonging to the Indian Red Cross Society is deployed at the venues where the annual event takes place. When a player gets injured, these first responders rush inside the arena and provide timely first aid to arrest blood loss in order to save their lives.

The injured are then taken to the nearest Primary Health Centre for treatment. The players who are severely injured are referred to Government Rajaji Hospital.

A. Rajkumar, the coordinator of the group, said that for the last three years the team has provided first aid to injured players during the jallikattu events at Alanganallur, Palamedu and Avaniapuram.

“After the jallikattu protests, the judiciary gave more emphasis to prevent deaths due to jallikattu. Hence, the then Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao decided to deploy our team at these venues,” he said.

In each of these events, at least 200 injured players were treated, said S. Vimal, another member. “The main aim is to treat the injured as soon as possible. Unlike other accidents, the players suffer severe blood loss due to deep injuries after the attack of the bull,” he said.

On Tuesday, the volunteers were also given the training to ensure their safety while treating the injured. Explaining the difficulty during treatment, Mr. Vimal said, “sometimes the bull might return to the arena. Hence, we need to be extremely cautious to ensure the safety of the injured and the volunteers,” he said.

380,2020/01/07,"Child with muscle paralysis, breathing difficulty recovers at GRH","A two-and-a-half-year-old boy, who was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, the rapid onset of muscle weakness and paralysis caused by affected immune system, and was under artificial ventilation for seven months at Government Rajaji Hospital, had recovered completely, said doctors.

Addressing the media on Tuesday, hospital Dean J. Sangumani said the boy was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome and was admitted to the Department of Paediatrics eight months ago. “A viral infection had weakened the immune system and caused neurological disorder, which resulted in paralysis of muscles. The boy had also developed breathing difficulties because of the syndrome,” he said.

Hence, the child was treated under artificial ventilation for seven months. “During the period, he was treated with antibiotics and it took seven months for the recovery of the muscles,” said Head of the Department of Paediatrics S. Balasankar.

Mr. Sangumani said the syndrome was not a rare condition and that every month around three patients got admitted to the hospital with the condition. “This is one of the rarest cases as the patient had received artificial ventilation for a long period and recovered completely,” he said.

The treatment for the condition might have caused around ₹1.5 crore at private hospitals. But, the patient was treated for free at the GRH under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/child-with-muscle-paralysis-breathing-difficulty-recovers-at-grh-madurai/article30504969.ece
381,2020/01/07,Land for ISRO: review meet held,"Collector Sandeep Nanduri on Tuesday reviewed the ongoing preliminary work to acquire land for the Indian Space Research Organisation’s rocket launching facility at Kulasekarapattinam.

As the ISRO is in need of vast stretch of land situated in a place ideal for rocket launches, it has been decided to acquire 2,233 acres of land for which a Special District Revenue Officer has been appointed. Moreover, eight tahsildars and a good number of surveyors have been deployed to expedite the land acquisition process.

After holding discussion with his subordinates on the progress of land acquisition, Mr. Sandeep visited the site meant for the rocket launch facility at Maadhavakurichi Koodal Nagar.

The Collector said six tahsildars had been deployed at Maadhavakurichi Koodal Nagar in Tiruchendur Taluk and two tahsildars were entrusted with the task of acquiring the land at Pallakurichi and Padukkapaththu in Sattankulam Taluk. Since 25 houses in Maadhavakurichi Koodal Nagar would be acquired for this project, the officials had been instructed to give ration cards to the families which did not have the card so that the affected families could be given due compensation without delay. Moreover, due compensation would be given for coconut, palmyrah and other yielding trees, Mr. Sandeep said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/land-for-isro-review-meet-held/article30504965.ece

383,2020/01/07,A sweet Pongal in the offing for sugarcane farmers,"This Pongal may finally not be bitter if not sweet, for sugarcane farmers, as the yield is comparatively much better this time around.

In the sugarcane belts of Theni and Dindigul districts, the farmers are getting ready for the harvest, which would begin sometime next week. The canes have grown taller, some reaching up to 8 feet height and the girth is also better, as there was abundant water this year. The crop is grown in hundreds of acres across Chinnamanur, Bodi, Devadhanapatti, Kamakkapatti and Genguvarpatti in Theni district and areas such as Sanarpatti, Natham, Chettinayakkanpatti and Batlagundu in Dindigul district.

Water-intensive crop

“The rain gods were kind and there was water released from the dams, as well, augmenting a bountiful growth and yield. The canes will also be juicier and sweeter,” says S. R. Ganesan, a farmer from Chettinayakkanpatti. He alternates between paddy and sugarcane and has been cultivating the crop for the past six decades.

Though it’s a water-intensive and a long-standing crop that takes a full year to yield, sugarcane fetches decent profit unless it’s a drought year, he says.

There are two types of sugarcanes knows as ‘Aalakarumbu’ and ‘Senkarumbu’, of which the former is sent to the sugar mills and the latter is grown only for the Pongal festival.

“The traditional Senkarumbu yields about 25 tonnes per acre usually but seeing the density of the growth this time, we may get few more tonnes. We spend about ₹1.5 lakh per acre in raising the crop and may expect a profit of ₹1 lakh. Last year, we sold one bunch of sugarcane for ₹450. One bunch has 10 canes and a cane is sold for ₹45,” he adds.

Risk of price crash

However the risk of a good yield is that it may lead to a crash in price. “If the production is extremely good such as in the current year, the market price may become less. We are yet to get price quotes from traders. The market area for sugarcane grown in Chinnamanur and Theni has also shrunk,” says Kannan, president of Theni District Farmers’ Association.

He points out that Kerala was once a major market for sugarcane grown in the Theni district but in the recent years, the market there has not been buying the product as enthusiastically as before. The sugarcane grown in Dindigul district reaches Karur, Madurai, Erode and local markets in Oddanchatram and Vedasandur. “Only if price crash is avoided and prices stabilise, the yield may translate into a happy Pongal for the farmers,” he says.

Sugarcane farmers also face threat of pests such as the black naped hare which feeds on tender shoots and a shoot-borer pest. “This year, complaints of shoot-borer attacks have been much lesser. One disadvantage of choosing the Senkarumbu over the mill variety is that much of the crop’s weight goes waste in the form of a dense foliage,” says Suruliappan, AD, Agriculture Department, Dindigul.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/s7wsbd/article30504906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA08SUGARCANEDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-sweet-pongal-in-the-offing-for-sugarcane-farmers/article30504907.ece
384,2020/01/07,Appeal to operate more government-owned mini buses,"With government-owned mini bus services being operated merely in two routes in the city, regular commuters say more such services are needed to ease congestion and provide affordable travel.

Currently, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) runs mini buses to connect the four Masi streets as well as a route between Periyar bus stand and Arapalayam bus stand.

The lack of mini bus services in areas where share autorickshaws monopolise transport is one of the major causes of congestion, according to S.S.A. Basha, a resident of Vandiyur, who has been advocating the need for a government-owned mini bus service in his area for around two years now.

In his area, until about six months ago, private players connected Yagappa Nagar to Mattuthavani and Simakkal.

“However, without enough patronage, they too stopped the operation. Even though private buses were far too big for the narrow roads in our areas, they were an important lifeline for the people who had to come here and go out every day,” he says.

He adds that mini buses which are used by private players often do not meet the infrastructural requirements of travelling through narrow roads as well.

“The roads in Anna Nagar, K.K. Nagar, Melamadai and Yagappa Nagar are all only about 20 feet wide. The private buses usually are 16 feet wide, and so they disallow any other vehicles to freely pass through the area,” he says.

He adds that many private mini bus operators barely get enough training to drive the vehicles. “They have knocked down at least three or four electricity posts in our neighbourhood,” he says. With a government-owned service, regular operation along the route will be assured, he says.

According to S. Sampath, State Joint Secretary, TNSTC Staff Federation, the TNSTC in Madurai should follow the Chennai model where more mini bus services are provided by government-owned transport corporation.

“By providing better service regularly along frequently used routes, we will be able to eliminate the unhealthy dependency on share autorickshaws. Most of the share auto drivers barely follow rules and often overload their vehicles, posing a major threat to other vehicle users and those in the vehicles themselves,” he said.

Mr. Sampath agrees with Mr. Basha and says that the patronage of private mini buses has dropped significantly as well due to lack operation in major routes.

“Some of the major players are barely making a sizeable profit because the standard is not good. From around 50 routes, the number has come down to 25 routes across the district,” he says.

A driver from one of the prominent private bus services, whose bus leaves from Mattuthavani bus stand, says drivers are given hands-on training before they start driving the vehicles and are mentored during their first few trips.

“Once we get used to the routes, it is easy for us to navigate. However, incoming cars or other heavy vehicles can halt traffic for a good period of time, causing a delay in our service,” he says.

He adds that their bus fleet, covered in a splatter of colour but mostly with a green body, is not worse in quality than TNSTC buses.

“Most of their vehicles are old as well and badly maintained. They, however, are allowed to go more regularly for repairs and servicing. We are not allowed just as many,” he says.

Mr. Sampath adds that if the area around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple becomes auto-free, mini buses can take turns to keep services from Ellis Nagar parking lot to the temple regularly and quickly.

S. Rajeswaran, General Manager, TNSTC – Madurai, says they will be considering a new fleet of mini buses if there is a necessity.

“We do have around 16 buses plying from the parking lot to the temple. We also have two routes for mini buses. If there is a demand, we will consider it,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/xit4ey/article30504898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA08CITY-MINIBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/appeal-to-operate-more-government-owned-mini-buses/article30504899.ece

386,2020/01/07,"De-addiction is all about grit and strong resolve, says DSP at AA meet","“Alcohol addiction is a disease that grows inside without one’s knowledge. Hence, an alcoholic must be seen as a person who needs help,” said a member of the Alcoholics Anonymous group in Madurai at its 13th anniversary celebration on Sunday.

It was a day of sharing stories of grit and strong resolve during the process of de-addiction. The most important step in the de-addiction process is the willingness of the alcoholic to quit drinking. “They must accept that they are powerless before liquor and only then will they understand the importance of de-addiction. This usually happens when an alcoholic hits rock bottom. During that time Alcoholic Anonymous group will help them,” said another member, who has last touched a drink 12 years back.

“The main aspect of the group is that I feel positive when I am surrounded by people who can understand what I go through. When others share success stories, I feel inspired to follow suit,” said the first person.

There was a general misconception that drinking in moderation could be accepted in the society, said the chairman of the Madurai group. “If a person cannot resist the temptation and consumes even a small amount, then it is a point of concern. People don’t need to join the group only when the addiction becomes worse,” he said.

A. Elangovan, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tamil Nadu Railway Police (Madurai), lauded the group, which has helped in transforming the lives of many families. “Alcohol addiction creates multi-faceted problems and this group helps during de-addiction process,” he said.

The family members and friends, who are close to alcoholics, also regularly attend Al-Anon meetings to share their grievances.

Unlike other diseases, alcohol addiction affected around 53 people close to the addicted person, said a woman, whose husband is an alcoholic. “By sharing our experience, I realise that I am not alone in this journey. I also started focussing on my needs and happiness,” she said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ryp4ic/article30500041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MACITY-AA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/de-addiction-is-all-about-strong-resolve/article30500042.ece

“Even after the atrocious attack on students, no action has been taken and not a single person has been arrested. This shows that the Union government is in support of the attackers,” said M. Kannan, State vice-president, SFI.

The protesters also raised slogans against ‘goondaism’ on campus. “The government thinks they can use force to disperse peaceful protests of students, being held in a democratic way. But we will continue to fight for our rights,” he said.

A group of advocates also staged a protest in front of Madurai district court complex condemning the attack on students and demanding immediate action against the attackers. “This is a planned attack and it is evident that the government is in support of the protesters,” said S.

Prasad on mrudangam and Alathur T. Rajaganesh on kanjira.

Gurucharan began with 'Evari Bodhana', a varnam in Abhogi ragam composed by Patnam Subramanyaiyer.

This was followed by 'Sri Madadi Tyagaraja', a song in Kalyani ragam composed by Mysore Vasudevachar who is from the Tyagaraja sishya parampara.

Margazhi is a divine month not only for humans but also for devas. To mark this month, Gurucharan sang the pasuram, ‘Kuttu vilakkeriyak,’ in which both Nappinai and Krishna are addressed together and reveal the universal truth that Perumal and Piratti together form the Whole.

His next rendition was Dikshitar’s ‘Somasundareswaram’ in Raga Shuddha Vasantham. He sang in the way as the composer would have thought/prayed before Madurai’s Somasundareswarar.

His raga selection for RTP – Shanmugapriya, Kundalavarali, Panthuvarali and Subapanthuvarali – was well appreciated by the audience as he brought out the real bhava in each raga.

Vittal Rangan on the violin lent excellent support. The listeners enjoyed the participation of Prasad on the mridangam during the tana prasthana. Rajaganesh on kanjira joined him for a satisfying tani.

The final songs included Bharathiar’s ‘Asai mugam maranthu,’ Meera bhajan ‘Mohe’ and a Thillana in Basant Bahar.

Addressing presspersons at the Admar Moola Mutt here, Vishwapriya Tirtha, senior seer of Admar Mutt, said that his predecessor, late Vibudesha Tirtha Swami had ascended the Paryaya Peetha twice — in 1956-58 and 1972-74.

Instead of ascending the Paryaya Peetha the third time, Vibudesha Tirtha had directed him to ascend the Paryaya Peetha. Accordingly, he ascended the Paryaya Peetha twice — in 1988-90 and 2004-2006.

He wanted to continue the same tradition of his predecessor and had decided that his junior, Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, would ascend the Paryaya Peetha on January 18 this year. The junior seer was not ready to ascend the Paryaya Peetha, but he had tried to persuade him.

“When he was unrelenting, I finally told that this is my order and he relented and agreed to ascend the Paryaya Peetha,” Vishwapriya Tirtha said.

Replying to a query, Vishwapriya Tirtha said that he would not participate in the Pura Pravesha procession on January 8. Ishapriya Tirtha would do the Pura Pravesha.

He (Vishwapriya Tirtha) would not participate in the Paryaya procession or the traditional Paryaya Durbar function which would be held at Badagumalige on January 18. “But I may participate in the public Paryaya Durbar in the afternoon of January 18,” he said.

While the seer who ascended the Paryaya Peetha had to compulsorily do the Avasara Sanakadi Puje, Mahapuje and Chamara Seve, he would perform the other pujas whenever he was in Udupi (sixteen pujas have to be performed to Lord Krishna daily).

He would continue supervising the educational institutions run by the Admar Mutt Education Council across the country. He would give religious discourses, whenever he was in Udupi, Vishwapriya Tirtha Swami said.

Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, a BE in Mechanical Engineering, who was initiated into the monastic order in July 2014, said that he would follow the orders of Vishwapriya Tirtha on ascension to the Paryaya Peetha. To a query, he said that the seers of the Ashta Mutts would be carried in palanquins during the Paryaya procession on January 18 as it represented the faith the devotees had in the Lord.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/rnfzei/article30498199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MNUDUPIADMARMUTT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ishapriya-tirtha-will-ascend-paryaya-peetha-vishwapriya-tirtha/article30498200.ece
396,2020/01/07,India must create 70 mn jobs to achieve $5 tn economy by 2024,"The country needs to significantly increase employment and productivity levels to achieve a $5 trillion economy by 2024, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister of Singapore, a renowned economist and a political personality, said on Tuesday.

Pointing out that job growth and productivity improvement are critical, Mr. Shanmugaratnam said, “To achieve a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 and to ensure unemployment does not keep going up, India will have to create something like 140 million jobs over the next decade — half of that in the first half of the decade.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the aim to achieve a $5 trillion dollar economy by 2024. But dwindling economic growth has made the task much tougher than thought earlier.

Productivity growth needed to be in the order of 7-8% per year, he said, while delivering the Third Suresh Tendulkar Memorial Lecture at the Reserve Bank of India.

“India is making a major effort to transform its society and economy. And it is going to take some time because it is starting from a heavy legacy of the past,” he said.

“Job growth and productivity growth are fundamental. “It is critical particularly for India because you have the largest young population in the world... much larger than China’s,” he added.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/6mqlpf/article30506601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBUSINGAPORE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-must-create-70-mn-jobs-to-achieve-5-tn-economy-by-2024/article30506602.ece
397,2020/01/07,‘Mindset to blame for poor response to NPS’,"It’s not the money people must put into it, but a certain mindset of individuals and corporates that makes National Pension System (NPS) a less-preferred saving option, according to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

For instance, some 7,000 corporates in the country are currently registered with PFRDA, but only 10 lakh of employees are covered under NPS.

Supratim Bandopadhyay, whole-time member, PFRDA, said, “We have dozens of individual corporates employ multiple lakhs of employees in our country. However, only 2-4% of employees of these 7,000 registered companies are covered under NPS. This is too low a coverage and has to improve. We see people’s mindset as the major impediment.”

The PFRDA, that is currently in the process of conducting pension awareness campaigns across the country, has a mandate to add five lakh new NPS subscribers and 75 lakh Atal Pension Yojana (APY) subscribers by March 2020.

NPS currently has a total subscriber base of 3.25 crore, (with ₹4 lakh crore under investment as on December 31) which includes Central and State Government employees (66 lakh), employees of Central and State autonomous bodies, corporates, NRIs (6,000) and individuals. APY now has a base of 2 crore subscribers, mostly people from the unorganised sector including labourers, farmers, construction workers, and daily-wage workers.

According to Mr. Bandopadhyay, the pension segment is yet to see quantum growth in the country and NPS currently covers only a tiny number of individuals and corporates, while a large population of small, medium, and micro enterprises and thousands of start-ups are yet to be part of the pension market.

The PFRDA is currently in the process of creating a strategy to approach each of these companies directly through HRs or through public campaigns.

“Most of us don’t think of retirement and old age. But the reality is our income will stop one day. As per studies, on an average, Indians live 17 to 18 years after retirement. But sadly, most of us decide to save only we are in the 45-50 age bracket. This mindset has to change and we have to learn to save before we spend,” he said.

NPS would soon be extended to OCIs (overseas citizenship of India) and to facilitate this PFRDA’s record keeping department was building an online system as per directives from RBI and the Ministry of External Affairs, he further said.

To make NPS more attractive, the central government is considering to double tax benefits to ₹1 lakh, from ₹50,000, under Section 80CCD (1b) and to make the annuity income tax-free. Also, the finance ministry may soon allow PFRDA to become a single regulator for all pension products, to give the entity more validity and standing in the country’s under tapped pension market.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/pb8cnf/article30506495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBUPENSION,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/mindset-to-blame-for-poor-response-to-nps/article30506496.ece
398,2020/01/07,Government projects slower GDP growth,"The government expects the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a slower pace of 5% for the full year 2019-20, as compared to 6.8% in the previous year, according to the first advance estimates released by the Statistics Ministry on Tuesday.

This estimate is in line with projections made by the Reserve Bank of India, which had revised GDP growth downwards to 5% for 2019-20 from 6.1% during its October policy.

As per the data, the manufacturing sector is estimated to grow by 2% as compared to a robust growth of 6.9% in 2018-19. Likewise, the growth in the construction sector for the fiscal is expected to see a sharp decline to 3.2% as against a growth of 8.7% in the previous year.

Economic growth slowed to a six-year low of 5% in the first quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, while slipping further to 4.5% growth in the second quarter (July-September).

The advanced estimates also forecast slower rate of growth for real Gross Value Added (GVA) at 4.9% as against 6.6% in 2018-19.

Experts, however, feel that it may be difficult to achieve the projected 5% growth given the rising oil prices and expected decline in government expenditure.

“The achievement of the annual 5% growth will be challenging given the global tensions, rising oil prices and expectation of a deceleration in government expenditures given stress on the revenue front. These factors will limit the growth rates in Q4 too,” Ranen Banerjee, Leader- Public Finance and Economics, PwC India said.

As per the advance estimates, agriculture, forestry and fishing sector will grow by 2.8% almost at the same pace as in 2018-19 when it grew by 2.9%, while ‘Electricity, Gas, Water Supply and Other Utility Services’ sector is expected to grow by 5.4% as compared to a growth of 7% in 2018-19.

“The key news in the first advanced estimates...is the fall in the nominal GDP growth to 7.5% in FY20 as compared to the previous peak of 13.8% in FY13. This fall translates into a fall in tax revenues and an increase in the fiscal deficit which are both detrimental to growth,” DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India told The Hindu.

He further added that crude prices are expected to go up further, which will put pressure on the fiscal deficit. It “could be difficult for the government to tackle and may lead to strengthening of the slowdown in growth in the economy,” Mr Srivastava said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/dnwx3o/article25387431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-Manufacturing-PMI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gdp-seen-dropping-to-5-in-2019-20-govt-data/article30504392.ece
399,2020/01/07,Govt. plans to cut spending by ₹2 lakh crore to curb deficit,"India's government is likely to cut spending for the current fiscal year by as much as ₹2 lakh crore as it faces one of the biggest tax shortfalls in recent years, three government sources said.

The economy, which is growing at its slowest pace in over six years because of lack of private investment, could be hurt further if the government cuts spending.

But with a revenue shortfall of about ₹2.5 lakh crore, the government has little choice to keep its deficit within “acceptable limits”, the first official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.

The government has spent about 65% of the total expenditure target of ₹27.86 lakh crore till November but reduced the pace of spending in October and November, according to government data. A ₹2 lakh crore reduction would be about a 7% cut in total spending planned for the year.

In October and November, government spending increased by ₹1.6 lakh crore, nearly half the 3.1 lakh crore it spent in September. The fiscal year starts April 1 and ends March 31.

Lack of demand and weak corporate earnings growth in the economy led to lagging tax collections this year. Analysts said growth will be hurt.

“When the private investment has slowed so much, this will definitely drag down growth further,” said Rupa Rege Nitusure, chief economist at L&T Financial.

India's economic growth slowed for six consecutive quarters to 4.5% in July-September, despite a 135-basis-point cut in interest rates by the central bank since February 2019.

Now, even the Reserve Bank of India seems to have become more worried about inflation rising. It kept its key lending rate on hold on December 5, even though it slashed its growth forecast for the current fiscal to 5%, which would be the lowest in a decade.

Even a surprise corporate tax rate cut announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this year failed to spur private investment in the economy.

The government is likely to keep the fiscal deficit under 3.8% of gross domestic product, sources said, while letting it slip from its earlier set target of 3.3% for the year.

The government is likely to announce additional borrowing of ₹30,000 crore to ₹50,000 crores for the current year to match the revised fiscal deficit, two sources in the government said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yxe7fk/article30502267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THFISCALDEFICIT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/govt-plans-to-cut-spending-by-2-lakh-crore-to-curb-deficit/article30502268.ece
400,2020/01/07,"Amid slowdown, Rolls-Royce delivers 25% more cars in 2019","Despite a slowdown in the global economy and trade wars gripping the world, ultra luxury car maker Rolls-Royce Motor Cars delivered 25% more cars in 2019 as compared to the previous year, indicating that the super rich are not impacted by the economic downturn.

In 2019, the company, which is part of the BMW Group, delivered a total of 5,152 cars to customers in over 50 countries, a record in its 116-year history. In 2018, it delivered 4,107 units, which was also a record that year. The company did not disclose the India numbers, but according to industry officials, it is about 25 to 30 units currently.

A few years ago, the company had touched nearly three-digit numbers in annual sales in India.

In India, Rolls-Royce models are priced between ₹6.21 crore and ₹11.35 crore. The company has showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai, where most of its customers are based.

Commenting on the global sales, Torsten Müller-Ötvös, CEO, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said: “This performance is of an altogether different magnitude to any previous year’s sales success. While we celebrate these remarkable results, we are conscious of our key promise to our customers, to keep our brand rare and exclusive.”

“Worldwide demand last year for our Cullinan SUV has driven this success and is expected to stabilise in 2020. It is a ringing testament to the quality and integrity of our products, the faith and passion of our customers and, above all, the skill, dedication and determination of our exceptional team at the Home of Rolls-Royce at Goodwood and around the world and our dedicated global dealer network,” he said.

The company said sales grew across all regions during the year, driven by strong demand for all Rolls-Royce models. It reported significant sales growth in every one of its key global markets. North America retained top status (around a third of global sales), followed by China and Europe including U.K.

Individual countries that achieved record sales results included Russia, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Qatar and Korea, the company said.

Phantom retained the company’s pinnacle product, with Dawn and Wraith continuing to dominate their respective sectors. Strong demand was seen for all these three models during 2019.

Cullinan, the marque’s new SUV, launched recently successfully translated into the largest advance order book and fastest postlaunch sales growth of any Rolls-Royce model in history.

“In its first full year of availability, Cullinan exceeded even the highest expectations raised by its successful launch. The world’s pre-eminent super-luxury SUV has become the fastest-selling new Rolls-Royce model in history,” the company said.

2019 marked the end of Ghost production after 11 years of uninterrupted commercial production. Since its launch at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009, Ghost has established itself as an undisputed modern classic.

Ghost’s successor is due for launch in mid-2020 after five years in development. With market availability from the fourth quarter, the successor will elevate the Ghost name, the company said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/6hnatl/article30506572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBURollsRoyce,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/amid-slowdown-rolls-royce-delivers-25-more-cars-in-2019/article30506573.ece

402,2020/01/07,‘Reaction to Operation Twist as expected’,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Tuesday that the market’s reaction to the simultaneous buy-sell of government bonds was on expected lines.

The simultaneous buy-sell of government bonds, known as Operation Twist, was conducted to bring down long-term interest rate while allowing short term rates to inch up. The move was aimed at addressing liquidity, which is assymetric — abundant at the shorter end but not on the longer end. The move will help in monetary transmission.

The central bank has so far carried out three rounds of simultaneous bond buy-and-sell via open market operations.

To a query from reporters on the sidelines of an event, Mr. Das said that the programme was “on expected lines”.

In the third such open market operation in as many weeks, the RBI had on Monday bought ₹10,000 crore of three long-term securities while selling a similar amount of three short-term bonds.

In his opening remarks at the ‘Third Suresh Tendulkar Memorial Lecture’, Mr. Das emphasised on reform of agricultural markets to improve supply chain management which could result in bringing down the gap between the price paid by end customers and the price received by farmers.

He highlighted a survey conducted by the RBI in 2018 covering farmers, traders and retailers in 85 mandis spread across 16 States, which found that the difference between retail prices that consumers paid and mandi prices that farmers received varied across crops and centres. “The average share of farmers in retail prices of major primary food items varies between 28 and 78%. It is lower for perishables and higher for non-perishable items. Higher share of retail prices going to farmers augurs well for the rural economy, which in turn, could help sustain domestic demand,” he said.

He also said that the mandate given to RBI on maintaining price stability, financial stability and economic growth was not only important from a macroeconomic perspective, but also for the objective of inclusive growth.

“Persistently high inflation adversely impacts the economy’s allocative efﬁciency and impedes growth,” he added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nnqohg/article30506488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reaction-to-operation-twist-as-expectedpersistently-high-inflation-impedes-growth/article30506489.ece
403,2020/01/07,"RBI eyes market for specialised supervision, regulation cadre","The Reserve Bank of India has decided to recruit 35% of the specialised supervisory and regulatory cadre from the market while the remaining 65% will be recruited via internal promotions.

In an internal circular, the central bank said that direct recruitment in the Specialized Supervisory and Regulatory Cadre (SSRC) will be at Grade B level.

“Out of the total vacancies in the grade, 35% of the vacancies will be filled up through market recruitment while 65% of vacancies will be filled up through internal promotions,” RBI said.

The Specialized Supervisory and Regulatory Cadre (SSRC) will comprise officers in Grade B to Executive Director level, the circular said.

RBI said in case there was a shortfall in filling up any vacancy in the specialist groups in Research, Data Analysis, Model Development, Stress Testing and the like, then lateral recruitment will be resorted to in respect of such shortfall.

Lateral recruitment will not be resorted to for filling vacancies which carry out onsite supervision of the regulated entities. According to the norms, lateral induction would normally be at Grade C level and on contract basis. Laterally recruited officers will have a tenure of three years, extendable up to a maximum period of five years.

“The shortfall of officers with specialised skills will be filled up by taking expertise on inward deputation or assigning some of the specialised back office jobs to external experts,” it said.

On November 1, 2019, RBI decided to reorganise its regulation and supervision departments. It merged the three regulatory departments (department of banking, non-banking and cooperative bank) into one and did likewise for the three supervisory departments.

As a result, there is only one supervisory department which looks after supervision of banks, NBFCs and cooperative banks and only one regulatory department for these three.

The move was aimed at dealing more effectively with potential systemic risk that could come about due to possible supervisory arbitrage and information asymmetry.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbf3nc/article30506426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rbi-eyes-market-for-specialised-supervision-regulation-cadre/article30506427.ece

The EoI and the share purchase agreement would be issued in January itself for the bidders, he said.

The last GoM meeting took place in September 2019.

Last year, the Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) approved the re-initiation of the process for the government’s 100 per cent stake sale in Air India along with Air India Express and the carrier’s stake in joint venture AISATS.

While Air India’s net loss in 2018-19 was around Rs 8,556 crore, its current total debt is around Rs 80,000 crore.

A Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) as well as a debt restructuring plan for the airline was also approved by the AISAM, the official said, refusing to divulge any details about the same.

On Saturday, Air India chief Ashwani Lohani had said “rumours” of the disinvestment-bound airline’s shutdown are “all baseless”, weeks after he told the Civil Aviation Ministry that the carrier’s financial situation was “grossly untenable” for sustaining operations.

“Rumours regarding Air India shutting down or closing operations are all baseless. Air India would continue to fly and also expand and there should be no cause for concern whatsoever to travellers, corporates or agents. Air India the national carrier is still the biggest airline of India,” the Air India Chairman and Managing Director had tweeted.

407,2020/01/07,5G technology to get faster adoption than 4G: Qualcomm,"The scepticism about faster adoption of 5G technology across the globe has been put to rest with the new technology expected to surpass the “conservative” target of 200 million 5G devices set prior to 2020, Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon said at a company event at CES in Las Vegas.

He said that now over 340 operators were investing in 5G globally, including over 45 with 5G already deployed, and Qualcomm was expecting over 200 million 5G smartphones “just one category of devices” to be shipped over the year.

Mr. Amon said that the electric growth of the new technology would ensure that by 2022, the number of shipped 5G smartphones will be over 750 million, and 5G connections should beat 1 billion by 2023, two years faster than 4G hit that number.

The company now estimates 2.8 billion 5G connections by 2025. The revolution will be supported by Qualcomm’s snapdragon 8- and 7- series chips.

Qualcomm also co-announced launch of Lenovo’s Yoga 5G, which they billed as the world’s first 5G PC. This has taken the industry by surprise as it would now become the first 5G PC to be in the market ahead of competitors such as Dell, HP and others who also have announced similar products for a launch at a later date.

All of these initial 5G laptops notably appear to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X55 modem, regardless of whether they’re using Intel or Qualcomm CPUs.

Lenovo chose the Snapdragon 8cx chipset for Yoga 5G, which converts from a laptop to a tablet as the user prefers.

408,2020/01/07,"Resolve your differences: SC to Tata, Wadia","The Supreme Court on Monday asked Tata Sons’ chairman emeritus Ratan N. Tata and industrialist Nusli Wadia to amicably settle their differences like “mature leaders of industry”.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde was hearing an appeal filed by Mr. Wadia against a July 2019 Bombay High Court decision quashing criminal defamation proceedings initiated by a local court, based on his complaint, against Mr. Tata, current Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran and eight directors.

Mr. Wadia had alleged that Mr. Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him shortly after the removal of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons’ chairman on October 24, 2016. Mr. Wadia was removed as an independent director from the boards of Tata Group companies between December 2016 and February 2017.

Monday’s hearing saw the Supreme Court attempting to broker peace between Mr. Wadia and Mr. Tata. The court, initially, even recorded an order that it “approved” the Bombay High Court finding that Mr. Tata never had an intention to defame Mr. Wadia.

However, shortly after the dictation of the order, senior advocate C.A. Sundaram appearing for Mr. Wadia, informed the court that there was suit pending on the issue. Mr. Sundaram sought an adjournment to get further instructions from Mr. Wadia after the court made it clear that it wanted both sides to amicably settle the issue as soon as possible rather than let the case drag on in court. The court granted an adjournment till January 13.

During the hearing, the Chief Justice asked Mr. Sundaram how his client had concluded that he was defamed. “The statements may be right or wrong… but how do they become defamation?” Justice Bobde asked.

Mr. Sundaram said the statements included attacks on Mr. Wadia’s “bona fide” as an independent director. The senior advocate argued that his client was not against the company but “certain persons who made the statements and released it to the media”. Mr. Sundaram said his side had even sent a letter asking that the statements be withdrawn.

“Do you want to settle this? If you want, we can ask for a mediator and both of you can talk,” the Chief Justice offered both sides.

At this point, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for Mr. Tata, responded that “it was not our intention to defame him [Wadia]”. He drew the attention of the bench to the high court’s finding that “there was no intention to defame”.

Latching on to this, the bench said they agreed with the high court and suggested that the parties should indeed put an end to the dispute.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/flpvc6/article30497572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt-NKVa,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/resolve-your-differences-sc-to-tata-wadia/article30497564.ece

On December 25, RIL proposed a swap ratio of 4:1, which implied investors could get one share of RIL for every four shares held in Reliance Retail, valuing the retail business at ₹2.4 lakh crore then.

At the current asking price of ₹500 for one Reliance Retail share in the unlisted market, the retail arm of RIL is valued at ₹3,16,904 crore, or about one-third of the total valuation of the company. “The premium that Reliance Retail is quoting in the unlisted market defies logic as its own promoters have valued it at around one-fourth of RIL’s total valuation.

415,2020/01/07,The U.S. is weakened by Soleimani’s killing,"On January 3 , Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the powerful Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, arrived in Baghdad from Damascus. He had been invited to the country by Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who had been asked by the Trump administration to mediate between Iran and the U.S. after the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was nearly overrun. Tensions between the two countries have been at a fever pitch ever since U.S. President Donald Trump’s ‘maximum pressure’ campaign forced Iran to withdraw its ‘strategic patience’ approach. Soleimani was met at the airport by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella organisation of several Iraqi Shia militias formed in 2014. Soleimani and al-Muhandis were partners in the fight against the Islamic State. As they drove out of the airport, a U.S. Reaper drone fired a missile, which killed them instantly.

Escalating tensions

The Trump administration realised quickly that it had made a strategic mistake. Even U.S. allies were shocked to see Mr. Trump brazenly kill a senior Iranian official, who has a diplomatic passport, and an Iraqi political leader who commands a militia which is understood to be part of the Iraqi army. These assassinations were seen in Iraq and Iran as a declaration of war. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei warned that “a harsh retaliation is waiting”, and President Hassan Rouhani told Soleimani’s family that the U.S. would “feel the impact” of its criminal act for “years ahead”. Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi said that the killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis was an “act of aggression against Iraq” that would “light the fuse of war”. He called for an emergency session of the Iraqi parliament, which on January 5th night voted to expel the thousands of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and deny them access to its airspace, land or water. The parliament also called upon the Prime Minister to make a formal complaint to the UN against the U.S. for “serious violations and breaches of Iraqi sovereignty”.

If President Trump thought that this was an attack on Iran, he miscalculated; it was already being seen as an attack on Iraq and on the pro-Iranian movements from Lebanon (Hezbollah) to Afghanistan (Liwa Fatemiyoun). It is not an Iranian retaliation that should scare the U.S., but attacks by pro-Iranian groups across the region where thousands of U.S. troops and official personnel are stationed.

The Iraqi and Iranian governments did not hasten to bury Soleimani and al-Muhandis. Their remains travelled from town to town, memorial services broadcast on TV, tens of thousands of people gathering on the streets to protest the killing and to vow revenge. Soleimani will be buried in his hometown, Kerman, after large funeral mobilisations in Mashhad, Tehran, and Qom. In Iran, officials say that this funeral cavalcade has brought more people to the streets than the funeral of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

Soleimani’s assassination has awakened the deep strain of Iranian patriotism. Last year, Iran was struck by protests over the rise of fuel prices. Now there is a tidal wave of patriotism washing across Iran; people are asking for revenge. In the holy city of Qom, a red flag was flown on the dome of Jamkaran Mosque signifying that Iran is prepared for a long war.

And Iran is not alone. In Beirut, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called Soleimani the “glue that held the Resistance Axis together”. The Resistance Axis is a concept that refers to the pro-Iranian groups in the region. Mr. Nasrallah said Soleimani’s assassination “is a turning point in the history of the region, not just for Iran or Iraq”. It is “the start of a new U.S. war in the region,” he said.

It did not help the U.S.’s cause that its political leaders made dangerous statements after the assassination. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence falsely linked Soleimani to the 9/11 attacks. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a video that showed Iraqis running down the street “thankful that General Soleimani is no more”. The video seemed to be part of an information war — only a handful of people on the street were running away from the tens of thousands protesting the killing. Finally, Mr. Trump tweeted saying that the U.S. would target and strike “52 Iranian sites”, including cultural ones, a flagrant war crime. None of this won the U.S. any support on the international stage.

Even the Europeans, otherwise steadfast with the U.S. in these sorts of adventures, hesitated. Mr. Pompeo criticised France, Germany, and the U.K. for not being “as helpful as I wish that they could be”. It is telling that the Arab League’s Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit expressed concern over the situation and asked for calm. This is the same man who had, only a few weeks ago, accused Iran of sowing chaos in the region, and was forced to adopt a less belligerent position under pressure from the Arab capitals.

A few hours after the assassination, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht Ravanchi, wrote to the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, and the UN Security Council president to condemn the assassination. Mr. Guterres said that he is “deeply concerned” about the U.S. attack but went no further. It is likely that China and Russia will table a resolution at the UN that calls for calm as well as criticises the U.S.; this will certainly be vetoed by the U.S.

Desperate and irrational policy

Till now the U.S. has not been able to extricate itself from its illegal war against Iraq that began in 2003. That war provided a massive advantage to Iran not only in Iraq, but also across the region. This is what terrified two of the U.S.’s allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, both of whom pressured Washington to increase its threats against Iran. Not only did the U.S. create the conditions for the rise of the worst kind of violence in Iraq, and later Syria, but also weakened the strategic position of its allies. No attempt by the U.S. to regain its authority has worked — neither the attempt to overthrow the government in Syria nor the sanctions against Iran. U.S. policy against Iran and Iraq appear desperate and irrational.

As the U.S. edges towards the end of two decades in Iraq, its military appears vulnerable. A handful of rockets fired into a military base in Kirkuk in Iraq killed a military contractor, whose death was avenged through U.S. air strikes against a pro-Iranian militia. This, in turn, saw thousands of Iraqis overrun the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. This attack showed the weakness of the U.S. position, which is why President Trump felt the need to retaliate in a dramatic way. Mr. Trump’s recklessness has isolated the U.S. further and deepened anxieties amongst its increasingly isolated regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

416,2020/01/07,Doing away with ad hoc teachers,"Even as students in JNU were protesting against fee hike, another protest has been going on in Delhi, spearheaded by the Delhi University Teachers’ Association. It began after the university issued a circular, which ad hoc teachers saw as an attempt to hire them as guest teachers instead. According to the university’s guidelines, an ad hoc appointment may be made “in case there is a sudden, unexpected and short vacancy, arising out of sudden sickness or death, on medical grounds (including maternity leave), abrupt leave or any other situation that may disrupt the normal process of teaching learning.” There are an estimated 4,500 ad hoc teachers in Delhi University.

A Damocles’ sword

It is a fact that the Indian higher education system continues to be in a shambles. There are many factors that have pushed the education system to the brink of collapse. Among these is the fact that there is lack of job security among a vast majority of teachers who have been rendering their services on ad hoc or contractual basis in universities, colleges and schools. Development experts say that a healthy and civilised society depends in part on the quality of higher education. However, there is less recognition that while a fulfilled teacher can create a healthy society, a frustrated teacher can be equally destructive. Colleen Wilcox, an educator and administrator, describes teaching as the greatest act of optimism. What hope will teachers instil in students when a Damocles’ sword constantly hangs over their heads?

A regressive culture of ad hocism has unfortunately percolated through India’s education system and engendered a sense of despondency among the temporary and contractual teachers. This class of educators remains on the periphery of the system and is not allowed to mingle with the mainstream segment of teachers, even when they fulfil the rigorous guidelines that the UGC has laid down for the recruitment of teachers to permanent positions. Despite the guidelines, many amongst this cohort are hired only for a fixed number of months, and at the end of every academic session their services are dispensed with.

Without any certainty of future, as no job security act is applicable in their case, they have no choice but to reappear for interviews at different places at the start of each academic session. Add to this the humiliating and exploitative experience of such teachers who do not receive the full salary that they are entitled to in accordance with the guidelines of the UGC and are, instead, often appointed on a consolidated sum considerably lower than stipulated amounts. The problem of underpayment of temporary and contractual teachers is rampant in private universities and colleges, going by recent accounts.

The knock-on effects of these unchecked distortions in the teacher compensation systems can be profound. When a well-qualified teacher is compelled to bear the brunt of financial exploitation, he desperately seeks other measures to enhance his income and make up for the losses. Inevitably this leads to demands that students join private coaching or tuition classes, to augment the meagre official pay. Often, the quality of educational inputs provided in such settings declines considerably.

Revamp the education policy

In this context, it is the broader canvas of higher education as a core ingredient of development that shows a troubling picture. Given the importance of human capital and skill acquisition in emerging economies, how are India’s development prospects impacted by the state of immense material insecurity that is forced upon its educators? No matter how brilliant the mind of educators, if they are operating under the fear of expulsion or some other such threat, they are likely to be incapable of delivering the goods. To restore India’s long-term developmental prospects there is no choice for the government but to revamp its flawed education policy which has created and encouraged the scourge of ad hocism in our paralysed higher education system.

417,2020/01/07,A case for including Tulu in the Eighth Schedule,"According to the 2001 Census, India has 30 languages that are spoken by more than a million people each. Additionally, it has 122 languages that are spoken by at least 10,000 people each. It also has 1,599 languages, most of which are dialects. These are restricted to specific regions and many of them are on the verge of extinction. India must accommodate this plethora of languages in its cultural discourse and administrative apparatus.

Article 29 of the Constitution provides that a section of citizens having a distinct language, script or culture have the right to conserve the same. Whose burden is it to conserve the distinct language, script or culture of such a section of citizens? Does it fall on the state or the citizens concerned? Actually, both the state and the citizens have an equal responsibility to conserve the distinct language, script and culture of a people.

Thousands of speakers

Among the legion of languages in India, the Constitution has 22 blue-eyed languages. They are protected in Schedule VIII of the Constitution. But many languages that are kept out of this favoured position are in some ways more deserving to be included in the Eighth Schedule. For example, Sanskrit, an Eighth Schedule language, has only 24,821 speakers (2011 Census). Manipuri, another scheduled language, has only 17,61,079 speakers. However, many unscheduled languages have a sizeable number of speakers: Bhili/Bhilodi has 1,04,13,637 speakers; Gondi has 29,84,453 speakers; Garo has 11,45,323; Ho has 14,21,418; Khandeshi, 18,60,236; Khasi, 14,31,344; and Oraon, 19,88,350.

Tulu is a textbook example of linguistic discrimination. Tulu is a Dravidian language whose speakers are concentrated in two coastal districts of Karnataka and in Kasaragod district of Kerala. Kasaragod district is called ‘Sapta bhasha Samgama Bhumi (the confluence of seven languages)’, and Tulu is among the seven. The Census reports 18,46,427 native speakers of Tulu in India. The Tulu-speaking people are larger in number than speakers of Manipuri and Sanskrit, which have the Eighth Schedule status. Robert Caldwell (1814-1891), in his book, A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages, called Tulu as “one of the most highly developed languages of the Dravidian family”.

The present-day Tulu linguistic majority area is confined to the region of Tulu Nadu, which comprises the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in Karnataka and the northern part of Kasaragod district of Kerala up to the river Payaswani, or Chandragiri. The cities of Mangaluru, Udupi and Kasaragod are the epicentres of Tulu culture.

Advantages

At present, Tulu is not an official language in India or any other country. Efforts are being made to include Tulu in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. If included in the Eighth Schedule, Tulu would get recognition from the Sahitya Akademi. Tulu books would be translated into other recognised Indian languages. Members of Parliament and MLAs could speak in Tulu in Parliament and State Assemblies, respectively. Candidates could write all-India competitive examinations like the Civil Services exam in Tulu.

The Yuelu Proclamation, made by the UNESCO at Changsha, The People’s Republic of China, in 2018, says: “The protection and promotion of linguistic diversity helps to improve social inclusion and partnerships, helps to reduce the gender and social inequality between different native speakers, guarantee the rights for native speakers of endangered, minority, indigenous languages, as well as non-official languages and dialects to receive education, enhance the social inclusion level and social decision-making ability by encouraging them to participate in a series of actions to promote cultural diversity, endangered language protection, and the protection of intangible cultural heritage...”

India has a lot to learn from the Yuelu Proclamation. Placing of all the deserving languages on equal footing will promote social inclusion and national solidarity. It will reduce the inequalities within the country to a great extent. So, Tulu, along with other deserving languages, should be included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution in order to substantially materialise the promise of equality of status and opportunity mentioned in the Preamble.

418,2020/01/07,Challenges to Hindutva’s new avatar,"For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), most of 2019 was a good year for its Hindutva politics. It won a general election using its majoritarian card; it swiftly enacted the Triple Talaq Act, diluted Article 370 in Kashmir and pushed through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), even as the Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Ram Temple. The stage appeared set for the continued growth of the BJP and its ideology.

And then, countrywide protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) began: young people, women of all ages — and of all religious denominations — gathered on the streets. Even harsh police action failed to deter the protesters: the people had finally decided to fight back.

Disillusionment with BJP

The beginning of disillusionment with the BJP is visible. The party’s performance in successive general elections in 2014 and 2019 were stellar, but its footprint in the States is shrinking, most recently after its defeat in Jharkhand. There are signs that the economic slowdown is hurting people. And, the spectacle on Sunday night of the police standing mute as vandals ransacked Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and attacked students and faculty members, has just added fuel to the fire already raging in universities across the country.

The BJP’s top leadership has been largely silent on these issues. Party spokespersons have distanced Mr. Modi from the reverses in Jharkhand stressing that but for him, the party would have fared even worse.

On the economy, the government has been in denial, with some suggestion that the downturn will be addressed in the Union Budget on February 1. As for the anti-CAA/NRC protests, the government has chosen not to engage the students in a dialogue; instead, the party has sponsored counter-demonstrations, the assessment being that the agitation will fizzle out.

The BJP’s recent poor performance in State elections underscores for the party, the dangers of concentrating power in the hands of one man, and the urgent need to build powerful State leaders. The disinclination to face squarely the economic slowdown, the agricultural crisis and the failure to create jobs received an answer in Jharkhand: charisma, rhetoric and slogans do not work beyond a point. Finally, a government that stops listening to its citizens, as it is doing with the protests, is one that might find, in turn, that it is not being heard.

Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have also ensured that most party functionaries, including Working President J.P. Nadda (to be elevated as president by end-January), are reduced to ciphers.

Most of the post-2014 Assembly elections also point to the marginalisation of State leaders and the browbeating of allies. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani returned to power, but with a considerably reduced majority. In Haryana, the BJP under Manohar Lal Khattar emerged as the single-largest party, but needed the Jannayak Janta Party’s help to form a government; in Maharashtra, the BJP’s failure to accommodate ally Shiv Sena cost it its government.

Plucked out of obscurity and made Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Haryana, Mr. Khattar and Devendra Fadnavis did not have a national profile. Today, five years later, they are still “mere pawns on a chessboard”, as a Sangh insider put it, a far cry from Mr. Modi’s status in the Vajpayee era. In April 2002, Mr. Modi mobilised an influential section of the party at the Goa National Executive meeting, upstaged Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who wanted to sack him for his role in the communal violence in Gujarat earlier that year, and went on to win three consecutive State elections. In 2014, he became Prime Minister.

Others in the BJP’s earlier crop of Chief Ministers, starting in the 1990s, were not as successful as Mr. Modi. But they had spent years working their way up the ladder, and had built reputations of their own. Take Kalyan Singh in Uttar Pradesh; Shanta Kumar in Himachal Pradesh; Sushma Swaraj in Delhi; Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Madhya Pradesh; or B.S. Yediyurappa in Karnataka — they were all important personalities in their own right. Some, like Mr. Kalyan Singh, Mr. Shanta Kumar and Mr. Yediyurappa showed their capacity, when cornered, to even challenge the central leadership.

Compare the leaders created in the Vajpayee-Advani era — when inner-party democracy existed, if not flourished — with the second crop of yes-men Chief Ministers, with only Yogi Adityanath not fitting the pattern.

Today, the BJP is beginning to resemble the Congress of the early 1970s, when Indira Gandhi, after the liberation of Bangladesh, was at the height of her powers. She had no time for dissenters in her party, nor did she brook any challenges. If the Congress power structure depended on regional leaders building their bases, she began the process of weakening them.

Learning from the Congress

The BJP leadership would do well to take a lesson from the Congress story. Weakening inner-party democracy and reducing regional leaders to nonentities can adversely affect the party’s strength on the ground while boosting regional outfits — look at the Shiv Sena and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) today.

Today, the BJP’s efforts to crush democracy in the country is a mirror image of what is happening within the party. Indira Gandhi’s Emergency demonstrated that ultimately, the people will revolt; and party men will abandon you.

That is unless Mr. Modi believes that his majoritarian politics will ensure that 2024 is a shoo-in. But if Hindutva is allowed to have free reign, it will destroy India as we know it. It is time the Opposition got its act together. The people have already shown their willingness to join the fight — they now need leadership.

419,2020/01/07,The mask of anarchy: On JNU violence,"Chilling and brutal, the visuals of the rampage of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on Sunday night by a mob of masked criminals will torment the country’s conscience for a long time to come. The mob ransacked hostels and grievously wounded students, professors and staff, going about it all in methodical madness for several hours. Not a single attacker was detained by the Delhi police, deployed in large numbers outside the campus. The street lights were turned off and the police personnel appeared to have given cover for the mob that leisurely walked away with abusive slogans. This evil will outlive its perpetrators and facilitators; and the night will continue to haunt India’s dreams to mature itself as a democracy and as a society that treasures its institutions. The masks notwithstanding, it is not difficult to see the faces behind this outrageous assault on one of India’s premier institutions where access is not limited by pedigree or purse. The Hindutva dispensation’s extreme intolerance towards intellectualism in general, and institutions in particular, has been on naked display since 2014. JNU has been a special target, and that itself is telling. JNU recruits from India’s vast diversity, and offers its students the best opportunity to develop critical thinking and excel in their chosen paths of life.

This liberating potential and the questioning spirit of JNU has long been reviled by a political project that seeks to erase the distinction between myth and history; faith and fanaticism; and criticism and subversion. The charge that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student outfit of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), led this violence is credible, unless the serious injuries suffered by the students and teachers were self-inflicted. The list is long of those who stood behind the masks, and some of the faces are recognisable. The JNU’s administration and its Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar have not merely failed in their duty as teachers and guardians; they have come across as desecrators of a place whose sanctity they were ordained to protect. The Delhi police, under its current Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, which had shown such alacrity in enforcing order recently that they stormed the library of Jamia Millia Islamia, stood by not as bystanders but as collaborators. Though they did not wear masks, they had their identities concealed by not wearing name badges. The Delhi administration apparently concluded that they had no responsibility whatsoever. There is little credence to the vague words of protest coming from some BJP functionaries and Ministers. The only way the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can prove that this mayhem was not sanctioned is to come down heavily on the police inaction and bring the mobsters to exemplary justice.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-mask-of-anarchy-on-jnu-violence/article30496604.ece
420,2020/01/07,Exit Iraq: On US-Iran tensions,"The vote by Iraqi parliamentarians in favour of a resolution seeking to expel American troops on Sunday was the first blowback the U.S. faced after it assassinated Iranian General Qassem Soleimani inside Iraq on Friday. The outcome of the vote was expected as the lawmakers were under pressure from both the public and militias to act against the U.S. after the killing. The U.S. troops, which are in Iraq on an invitation from the Iraqi government to fight the Islamic State, have carried out air strikes against Iraqi militias in recent weeks, without the approval of the Baghdad government. This triggered public protests and led to the siege of the American Embassy last week. In an already explosive situation, the killing of Soleimani acted as a catalyst. The anger among Iraqi lawmakers towards U.S. actions was on full display inside the Parliament hall on Sunday when they chanted, ‘America out, Baghdad remains free’, before the voting. Parliament itself doesn’t have the authority to expel foreign troops. But a resolution passed in Parliament is a call to the executive branch to act. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who condemned the killing of Soleimani, has stated unambiguously that it is time for the Americans to go home. Government officials have already started working on a memorandum on the legal and procedural formalities to expel U.S. troops, according to him.

Iraq is a crucial ally for the U.S. in the war against terrorism in West Asia, and the Trump administration has nobody to blame but itself for the setback. It pushed the Iraqis to a point where they had to choose between Tehran and Washington. And understandably, they picked their powerful neighbour. But U.S. President Donald Trump still doesn’t seem to be in a mood to listen. He has threatened Iraq with sanctions and a bill for billions of dollars if the U.S. troops are forced to pull back. This approach not only violates Iraq’s sovereignty, it also escalates the situation to a three-cornered crisis involving the U.S., Iraq and Iran. Mr. Trump is primarily responsible for today’s situation. His decision to pull the U.S. out of a functioning Iran nuclear deal was the trigger. When the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran, it was up to the other signatories of the deal — European countries, Russia and China — to save the agreement. Iran waited for a year before taking countermeasures. But they did nothing, barring issuing occasional statements in favour of the agreement. Europe, which has good ties with both the U.S. and Iran, should wake up at least now. It should use its diplomatic channels to rein in Mr. Trump and pacify Iran to prevent an all-out war. As a first step of de-escalation, what Mr. Trump could do is to order his soldiers to pack their bags and leave Iraq.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/exit-iraq-on-us-iran-tensions/article30496634.ece

423,2020/01/07,Micro-composting unit in Pallikaranai now has an organic vegetable farm,"With the Greater Chennai Corporation taking initiatives to promote composting through its micro-composting units across the city, the micro-composting unit at Pallikaranai now has an addition: a vegetable farm.

The organic farm, spread over two grounds, has vegetables including several varieties of spinach and other greens being cultivated.

“The unit in Pallikaranai processes around 10 to 15 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The Corporation Commissioner suggested that we engage with the workers in these micro-composting units and we then started cultivating vegetables near the unit a month ago,” said Alby John, Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), GCC.

While the farming is done on a larger scale in Pallikaranai, several micro-composting units in the south zone now have started maintaining small vegetable gardens. “Several unit offices are also among the places where smaller vegetable gardens have come up. Many of them use up-cyled utensils such as old plastic and steel containers as planters,” he said.

S. Baskaran, zonal officer, Zone 14, said that while they are expecting a harvest of vegetables such as ladiesfinger soon, greens such as spinach have already been harvested once in Pallikaranai. “We are ensuring that the farming is completely organic and only manure from the composting unit is being used,” he said.

The Corporation is yet to decide on what the next step will be, with regard to the sale or distribution of the vegetables grown here.

Meanwhile, the manure from micro-composting centres across the city is being sold at different locations across the city at ₹20 per kg. In the South Zone, the public can buy them at Porur TCG Park, Tirusulam Railway Station, Pazhamudhir Solai in Adambakkam, Phoenix Mall in Velachery, unit office in Adambakkam, Guindy Railway Station, Jeyachandran Textile Shopping Complex, Entrance gate of PDG Radial Road, Eswaran Street in Karapakkam and Pazhathotta Salai in Semmenchery, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7r0nfc/article30503543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH-VegGardenjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/micro-composting-unit-in-pallikaranai-now-has-an-organic-vegetable-farm/article30503544.ece
424,2020/01/07,Director of 'Draupathi' says similarities with popular leader are unintentional,"The Tamil film Draupathi, directed by film-maker Mohan and featuring actor Richard Rishi, has been mired in controversy from various groups after the release of its trailer a few days ago.

The film is believed to be a revenge story about a man who exposes and takes on a ‘fake marriage’ racket. It is supposedly based on a 'fake marriage racket' run by four advocates who oversaw more than 3,500 such weddings in Tamil Nadu.

The film’s trailer has received a lot of flak for featuring a character that resembles Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan as the head of the ‘fake love’ racket and for featuring provocative dialogues against inter-caste marriage.

A supposedly criminal character in the film says that he has been taught by their leader to ‘Adanga Maru, Aththu Meeru’ — a political slogan used by Mr. Thirumavalavan.

Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam founder Kovai Ramakrishnan has called for a ban of the film for similar reasons. “The film appears to speak in favour of killing couples for falling in love with a member of another caste. It instigates violence against those that subscribe to anti-caste thought. The film also speaks against inter-caste marriage. The film is bound to create issues in the society if it releases,” he said.

Filmmaker Mohan, however, said the similarities between the character in the film and real-life politicians are entirely unintentional and that people in social media are making these connections of their own volition.

He said the film is based on an actual case of a ‘fake marriage’ racket unearthed few years ago. “This is based on an actual case of a fake marriage racket unearthed in 2013-2014. Around 3,500 marriages were performed by four lawyers. One of the characters in the film actually looks like one of the real-life lawyers involved in the case. The similarities end there. Those on social media are simply making connections where they do not exist,” he said.

Mr. Mohan also said any resemblance is entirely unintentional. “I cannot control what people say on social media. As far as I know, nobody has said anything about a ban. There is nothing in the film to be banned. The final post production work is underway,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/dft15f/article30503182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/draupathijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/director-of-draupathi-says-similarities-with-popular-leader-are-unintentional/article30503065.ece
425,2020/01/07,"Demand for co-working spaces in Chennai will be high in 2020, say experts","It’s not just start-ups: medium and even large firms in the city are now embracing the concept of co-working spaces.

Founders of five different co-working spaces in Chennai said that earlier, it was predominately the start-up crowd that came hunting for space here but now even retail, manufacturing and logistics firms are knocking on their doors, seeking space. Cost efficiency, diversity, networking and good infrastructure are some of the reasons why various sectors are queuing up at co-working spaces in the city.

According to estimates from analysts who track the real estate market in Chennai, there are over 80 co-working spaces spread across the city. Even tier two towns like Coimbatore and Madurai are slowly embracing the concept and are opening up available spaces for co-working.

“In 2020, small to big corporates in Chennai will look at co-working as office space options. We are also focussing on building a complete ecosystem for the client to grow,” said Gurbinder Rattha, founder and managing director, Workafella. Workafella, which has one of the largest co-working spaces in Chennai, is now looking at adding new centres in the OMR belt.

Vijay Anand, CEO and founder of The Startup Centre, said, “There is a shift in the co-working model -- instead of start-ups being the main focus, co-working spaces are looking at corporates and freelancers as the main target.” Companies look at co-working spaces as the equivalent of serviced apartments, where they pay only for what they use and don’t have to worry about doing up the place and finding new offices as the team expands. “Chennai needs to position itself as a capital of national/international value if it needs to be comparative to Bengaluru, Mumbai or Delhi though,” he suggests.

Sivarajah Ramanathan, founder, Nativelead Foundation in Madurai, which handholds start-ups in the southern region, said that he will soon be opening a small space within his office as a co-working space.

Kanchana Krishnan, Senior Director & Head - Markets, Retail & Data Center, Chennai, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) said that co-working spaces have been one of the most positive radical changes that the commercial office markets have been embracing. “We call it the future of work”, she said. “Chennai during the year 2019 witnessed a 6.2 million sq.ft of office space absorption and year 2020 also promises to be very robust and we expect co-working spaces to be a significant part of the traction,” she added.

According to JLL, cumulative space take-up by the co-working segment from 2017 to Q1 2019 was approximately over 9 million sq.ft. In fact,Chennai has been leading the pack for the last two years in terms of absorption when compared to all other cities. Co-working space absorptions have contributed close to 22% of the city’s absorption which is pegged at 6.2 million sq.ft in 2019.

Srinivas Anikipatti, Senior Director – Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Knight Frank also said that the demand for co-working spaces in the city is increasing.

As per ANAROCK research, office space absorption in the top 7 cities stood at over 40 million sq. ft. in 2019, of which Chennai accounted for nearly 2.6 million sq. ft. office take-up. Of this total office space leased in the city, approximately 20% was in the co-working segment, thereby accounting for nearly 0.5 million sq. ft. take-up. The OMR belt witnessed maximum activity due to the presence of the IT/ITeS companies and easy connectivity with other major areas of the city, including the airport.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aiywhk/article30502901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH-Workafellajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/demand-for-co-working-spaces-in-chennai-will-be-high-in-2020-say-experts/article30502902.ece
426,2020/01/07,Quack involved in sex determination of foetuses held in Chennai,"A team of the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services, Chennai nabbed a quack, who was running a scan centre in Velachery, and had revealed the sex of foetuses for at least 500 women over the last few years.

The team, led by joint director A. Viswanathan and comprising A. Thomas Prabhakar, deputy superintendent of police, DMS, M. Kamalakannan, superintendent of DMS and two others, nabbed the quack, Sivasankaran, aged about 55 years, on Monday.

Based on information from Tiruvannamalai officials, the team conducted an inquiry and had identified the centre nearly 10 days ago. On Monday, they sent a pregnant woman to the scan centre. “Sivasankaran took a scan and revealed the sex of the foetus to the woman. We immediately nabbed him and raided the centre. He confessed to being involved in sex determination of foetuses. We found the records of nearly 500 women at the centre,” an officer said.

Sivasankaran, who has qualified in MSc Botany, had been impersonating a doctor and had been running the scan centre for the last four years. The centre was earlier run by a doctor from whom he had learned how to perform scans and identify the sex of foetuses, he added.

The team lodged a complaint with the police and an FIR has been filed. The team also seized scan machines and documents as evidence and will also take action as per the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, the officer said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/quack-involved-in-sex-determination-of-foetuses-held-in-chennai/article30502795.ece

428,2020/01/07,Light rain for two more days,"The city woke up to an overcast sky and surprise showers on Monday. Coastal districts, including Chennai, are likely to witness light showers for one or two days before the northeast monsoon withdraws from the State from January 9, say meteorologists.

During the 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Monday, Parangipettai in Cuddalore district received 3cm of rainfall, the highest for the day in the State. Poondi, Tiruttani, Ennore and Ponneri in Tiruvallur district recorded 1cm of rain.

Several areas received morning showers. The weather station in Nungambakkam recorded 2cm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Monday. Meenambakkam recorded less than 1cm of rainfall.

N. Puviarasan, Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said the northern districts, including Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Puducherry, may receive light rain till January 8. Easterly wind speed convergence that prevailed over south coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining north coastal Tamil Nadu in the lower atmosphere was cited as the reason for the spell. “We expect dry weather to prevail from January 9. Such showers during early January are normal as NE monsoon may spill over. However, the rainfall would be considered as rain for this year,” he said.

Officials noted that Chennai has already received copious rains for January, which is the highest in a decade. The city has recorded nearly 6.6cm of rainfall so far since January 1. Normally, Chennai receives an average of 2.6 cm of rain during January and the mean number of rainy days during this month is only 1.4.

429,2020/01/07,Attack on JNU students brings protesters back to Valluvar Kottam,"Civil rights activists, senior advocates, trade unionists and students on Monday came together and staged a protest condemning the attack on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University.

At Valluvar Kottam, people from all walks of life gathered to express their solidarity with JNU students. They raised slogans against fascism and demanded the arrest of the masked goons who attacked students in their hostels. They urged the Centre to withdraw the controversial citizenship law.

Senior advocate Sudha Ramalingam said, “Earlier students of Jamia Millia Islamia University were attacked and now JNU students. They may attack students of any other university in future. Academics and students will have to be protected.”

“We are worried about the fact that students in universities have been consistently attacked. At JNU, the police stood as mute spectators. The students have the right to stage protests. Their rights should be protected,” said A.J. Jawad, an advocate.

Former MLA and advocate Bader Sayeed, former vice-chancellor Vasanthi Devi and Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi leader Thamimun Ansari were among prominent people who participated in the protest.

Students of IIT Madras too marched inside the campus, raising slogans against ABVP, and carried placards with messages saying ‘Save JNU’ and ‘Stop turning campuses into war zones’.

According to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) officials, they have called for tenders and the contractor for the stretches will be finalised in about two months. “After preliminary works, the tunnelling work will commence at various locations in the city,” an official said.

In phase II, 52 km will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the 12-km stretch is a part of it. Therefore, CMRL had to obtain the agency’s approval before calling for tenders.

“We recently got the go-ahead from JICA and hence called for the tenders. Now that the work will begin by the middle of this year, we hope to maintain speed and finish it at the earliest,” another official said.

2 TBMs to be deployed

Two TBMs — one for onward and another for the return — will bore the earth simultaneously between Venugopal Nagar and Kellys and between Kellys and Taramani as well. Usually, the TBMs complete 6-10 metres a day but this may vary, depending on soil conditions. “We will make sure that there are no cracks in buildings or any other damage due to the tunnelling work. We have checked soil samples every 25 metres so that we know how to handle the machines and operate accordingly without causing any damage,” an official said.

In a few weeks, CMRL will call for tenders to build stations along the 21-km stretch. It decided not to hand over the tunnelling and station construction work to the same contractor in phase II. “Even if one contractor’s work is slow, it won’t affect the other. Depending on one firm for the whole construction could delay the entire project,” the official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/svzens/article30498185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THTBM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tunnelling-work-for-phase-ii-of-chennai-metro-to-begin-in-june/article30498186.ece
431,2020/01/07,"Vinayaka Chaturthi processions used to reform wayward youth, Hindu Munnani tells Madras HC","Hindu Munnani on Monday told the Madras High Court that it was promoting the annual Vinayaka Chaturthi processions, which was once famous only in Maharashtra, in a big way in the State to streamline wayward youngsters and get them involved in religious activities.

The submission was made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by K. Gopinath, 45, of Tiruppur, seeking a direction to the Collector and Corporation Commissioner for the removal of all unauthorised flag poles erected by the Hindu Munnani in public places.

Objecting to such a plea made by the litigant without including it as a respondent, Hindu Munnani’s State president C. Subramaniam alias Kadaiyeeswara Subramaniam sought to be included.

When questioned on the intent of introducing the practice of taking huge idols of Lord Vinayaka in procession in Tamil Nadu, G. Karthikeyan, counsel for the Hindu Munnani, said, the aim was to discipline the youth, who were spoiling their lives with liquor, tobacco and non-vegetarian food addictions. “We are inculcating the practice of Kaapu Kattu amongst those installing the Vinayaka idols. The team members remove the Kaapu (a thread tied around the wrist) only after the idols are taken out in procession and immersed in sea or water bodies. During these days, they cannot smoke, drink or eat non-vegetarian food.”

“Hindu Munnani undertakes to... removing all its flagpoles. But subsequently, if flagpoles of other parties and organisations remain, then there won’t be equality in implementing the law, resulting in serious injustice,” he stated. To this, Justice Sathyanarayanan said: “You cannot claim equality in illegality.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/i7c65s/article13564696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ChennaiCITYRegional02ART2GEF3BT142105THMARINAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vinayaka-chaturthi-processions-used-to-reform-wayward-youth/article30498179.ece
432,2020/01/07,Heart transplants that changed young lives,"Agalya, 11, and Tushitha, 17, have undergone surgical procedures that dramatically improved their quality of life. Agalya was diagnosed with a heart condition at the age of three. Her parents Devi and Meenakshi Sundaram, who live in Nagercoil, took her to a hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. She lived a severely compromised life until a few months ago, when she suffered bouts of bleeding through the mouth.

She was then referred to chairman, cardiac sciences and director of heart and lung transplant and mechanical circulatory support of MGM Hospital, K.R.Balakrishnan.

Tushitha will now be able to return to school. The commerce stream student has been suffering from breathlessness since she was 30 months old. A resident of OMR, she was referred to Dr. Balakrishnan as she had symptoms suggestive of heart failure.

Since both are from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the families did not have the money for a heart transplant. Aishwarya Trust supported them financially. The transplant surgeries, each costing ₹15 lakh were done during November/December last year.

On December 9, a compatible donor was found for Agalya in a private hospital in Coimbatore. After the transplant she was discharged on December 30, said Suresh Rao K.G., co-director of heart and lung transplant and mechanical circulatory support.

Doctors found a matching donor for Tushitha on November 26 and the heart was transported from a private hospital in a two-hour trip to MGM Healthcare.

Unmoved by her fervent plea, P. Muruganandam, now called Sri Nithya Pranananda, refused to part ways with the ashram.

After recording his submission, a Division Bench of Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan closed a habeas corpus petition filed by P. Angulakshmi, 60, of Kottai in Erode district. The petitioner had sought a direction to Erode police to save her 39-year-old son from the “illegal” custody of Nithyananda, produce him in court and let him go with her.

However, appearing before the court, along with an escort from the ashram, the petitioner’s son told the judges that he was residing in the ashram on his own accord and that he was not detained illegally by anyone. He also said that being a major, he was interested in continuing in the ashram and was not willing to return to his parental home. When the mother had a word with him outside the court hall, she asked him, “You are an educated boy, why are you doing this? Why don’t you come back home?” In reply, he asked her to stop acting at the instigation of others and to meet him at the ashram and discuss domestic issues. “I am not acting at the instigation of anyone.

434,2020/01/07,70.50 lakh children to be immunised,"Tamil Nadu has entered the 16th polio-free year in 2020. This year, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine is aiming at vaccinating 70.50 lakh children in the age group of 0 to 5 years in a single round of the intensified pulse polio immunisation campaign on January 19.

Public health officials said that due to the successful implementation of the pulse polio campaigns, the State has been free of polio cases. It was important to sustain this polio-free status and protect children from any possible transmission of wild polio virus.

“Neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan have reported polio cases. So, we should continue to be on alert and ensure that all children receive the dose on time,” K. Kolandaswamy, director of public health said.

On the day of the campaign, the directorate would administer oral polio drops to children through 43,051 booths. These booths would be established in all primary health centres, government hospitals, ICDS centres, noon meal centres, schools and other important places in the State. To cover children on travel, there would be 1,652 transit booths in major bus stands, railway stations, toll plazas, check posts and airports. The immunisation booths would function from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The directorate has formed 1,000 mobile teams to administer the drops to children living in remote, inaccessible, and migrant areas. At least 5,000 to 6,000 children of migrant labourers would be immunised as part of the campaign, officials said.

Children immunised recently under the routine immunisation schedule and all newborns should get immunised on the day of campaign. To identify missed out children, finger marking would be done for all vaccinated children on the left little finger. Private paediatricians and private hospitals would also administer the drops on the day.

About two lakh personnel from the departments of health, integrated child development scheme, education, other government departments and volunteers are taking part in the intensified pulse polio immunisation campaign.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7050-lakh-children-to-be-immunised/article30498121.ece

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Kannan said that the film, rumoured to be made on a whopping ₹200-crore budget, is also scheduled to release in places where Tamil films have not released yet.

“The film will release in 7,000 screens across the world. We are planning to release it in a few islands to reach out to the maximum number of people,” he said.

“We are spending ₹7-8 crore to promote the film. The marketing investment for this film is one of the highest in Tamil cinema,” he said, adding that the trade is expecting a super hit.

Mr. Kannan said that around 15 brands such as SpiceJet, Cadbury’s, BookMyShow and Airtel have tied up with the film.

With recent films such as Karthi’s Thambi and Sivakarthikeyan’s Hero declared flops, exhibitors are expecting this film to bring audiences back to theatres.

440,2020/01/07,Students in the vanguard of democratic struggle,"The conflict across campuses in the country today is over the concept of a ‘student’ and, correspondingly, over the concept of a ‘university’. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government would like ‘students’ to be no more than self-centred, self-absorbed buyers of education, who do not concern themselves with social issues and who concentrate their energies on becoming successful sellers of labour-power on the job market. The alternative concept of a ‘student’ is of an individual who is socially sensitive, and uses education in the service of building a democratic, secular and egalitarian India, as visualised in our Constitution; one who subjects everything, including government policy, to critical scrutiny. The corresponding differing conceptions of a ‘university’ are: a site where skills (which are not the same as education) are sold; or, alternatively, a site where there is intense and informed critical engagement with the burning issues of our time. The students, especially in the front-ranking institutions of the country, see themselves in the latter role.

It is not surprising that the conflict, before the latest upsurge of protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) where students all over India have played a major role, had expressed itself in some outstanding institutions: Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU); the University of Hyderabad; the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) of Pune; the Fine Arts Department of the Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda, and so on. The BJP government’s effort to convert students into an inert, passive mass of skill-buyers had targeted precisely these institutions where the students had been most socially sensitive; indeed it is this that had contributed to these institutions’ excellence.

Making campuses apolitical

The methods chosen by the government have been many. One is to alter the student composition, by raising fees (as in JNU) so that only rich and career-oriented students come to the university; opening new departments that reduce the weight of critical disciplines like the humanities, social sciences and basic sciences; and doing away with reservations in admissions for students from socially deprived backgrounds, so that campuses cease to have an inclusive character. A second method is to prevent students from participating in demonstrations, and from organising interactions with persons unacceptable to the Sangh Parivar. Yet another method, being increasingly resorted to, is to call the police to the campus to unleash brutality on students or to book ‘inconvenient’ students under one or the other of the draconian laws that exist on our statute books.

All these methods are brought into play by appointing, as heads of institutions, martinets who are Sangh Parivar loyalists. These persons have little sympathy for students, little pride in the institutions they head, and little accessibility to the university community at large. In JNU, for instance, the students’ union has not even been recognised by the authorities despite a government-appointed committee of experts reportedly recommending talks with the union leadership (their report is not made public). Recognition of a students’ union articulating students’ perspective goes against the very conception of a “student” that the BJP government would like to institute.

The question arises: why is the government so keen to populate our universities with apolitical docile students? The answer is: because an authoritarian society and polity requires precisely such students, and the changes being effected in our universities and other institutions are meant to facilitate the transition to authoritarianism.

Confronting unreason

This is especially so at present. The BJP government represents the coming together of two distinct forces, a section of the corporate-financial oligarchy on the one hand and the Hindutva elements on the other whose goal is to push the country towards a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ by overthrowing our secular and democratic Constitution. The entire narrative that is used to justify a Hindu Rashtra is based on unreason, in the sense that it does not accept the role of evidence in establishing its truth-value. We thus have an alliance between corporate interests and unreason, sustaining the current BJP government, as indeed it sustains all fascistic governments.

While resisting this government through class struggle remains the task of the workers, peasants, petty producers, and agricultural labourers, the intelligentsia also has an extremely important role to play in confronting the currency of unreason, which substitutes mythology for history, beliefs for facts, and superstition for science. The students are the most youthful, energetic and hence active elements of the intelligentsia; they are therefore an extremely powerful force fighting against the Hindutva unreason. The BJP government’s aim is to disarm this potentially powerful adversary. Students engaged only in pursuing their careers are no threat to the Hindutva project; but students who are socially sensitive, who are committed to the values of secularism and democracy, are a powerful bulwark against it, for they bring with them not only the energy of youth but also the enlightenment of education.

The desire to privatise and commercialise education is part of this effort to disarm the students. Because of the high fees in private institutions, not only are students from impecunious backgrounds excluded, but even the richer students who fill these institutions remain unaware of social realities to which the proximity of poorer students would have exposed them; they remain socially insensitive. The same fate awaits public institutions if they raise their fees, as JNU proposes to do. The few students from under-privileged backgrounds who join on the basis of student loans are so obsessed with the burden of loan repayment that they scarcely have time for social or political activism. The deadening effect of student loans on political activism is best illustrated by the U.S. where, since the days of the anti-Vietnam war protests, campuses have been relatively quiet; student loans are certainly one reason for this.

In India, fortunately, despite the efforts of the Sangh Parivar martinets, students have not lost their social sensitivity. If anything, they have become even more engaged, going from issues of campus democracy, to broader issues like the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. What is remarkable is that they display among themselves the inclusiveness they would like to see in society. Students from other religious backgrounds fighting alongside Muslim students against the CAA, students from richer backgrounds fighting alongside their impecunious colleagues against fee hike, are excellent examples of camaraderie and solidarity.

But, as the students have refused to be cowed down, the authorities, at the behest of the BJP government, have become more brutal in dealing with them. The brutality at Jamia Millia Islamia was unleashed by the Delhi police which is under the Central Home Ministry. The brutality at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was unleashed by the Uttar Pradesh police under the BJP government of Yogi Adityanath. The brutality at JNU was unleashed by masked goons from outside helped by internal informers to attack their targets, under the benign eyes of the Delhi police, and with the university’s own security staff mysteriously absent from the scene.

Few things have cheered one up as much as the resilience of the students in the face of this brutality in upholding the values of the Constitution, values upon which modern India is founded and which Hindutva is undermining. This makes one confident that whatever the short-term travails, the future of the country is safe.

It is an election year for President Donald Trump, and there are reports that Mr. Trump may have ordered the strike to boost his prospects. The Osama bin Laden operation by Barack Obama could have been uppermost in his mind. But Laden was a non-state actor, a terrorist, while Soleimani was a key ally in the U.S.’s fight against the Islamic State. The attack is also being called a diversionary ploy for Mr. Trump to drive attention away from more pressing domestic issues, like his impeachment. Global crude oil prices have already soared as a result of the ongoing turbulence in the region. The impact will be felt worldwide, including in India. Additionally, New Delhi has the bothersome task of adopting a ‘please all’ attitude not only towards the U.S. and Iran but also other key players (Front page, “Iraqi Parliament votes to expel U.S. troops,” Jan. 6).

443,2020/01/07,Targeting students,"The violence on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)’s campus raises serious questions on the ability of the administration to provide security to students in a premier institution. My first-hand experience, as a student staying in one of the hostels, made me observe a few points. First, the security guards failed to protect us. They need to be held accountable. Two, despite the presence of police on campus, violence continued. This can be verified using the CCTV cameras. It raises questions on the capability, efficiency and intent of police. Further, at around 9 p.m., when journalists and activists were attacked near the main gate and wind-shield of ambulances broken, street-lights were kept off. The perpetrators of this attack must be recognised and punished in a time-bound manner (Front page, “Masked goons strike terror in JNU,” Jan. 6).

Atul Kriti,

New Delhi

The attack by masked men on the JNU campus marks a new low in the ongoing assault against students, academics and institutions that promote progressive thinking. It is rather bizarre that the Delhi police, which was so active in suppressing protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and did not feel qualms in directing its fury even on those in the university’s library, could not protect innocent students and academics from armed goons. The mayhem points to meticulous planning and one cannot but guess that the police must have had an inkling of it. This only confirms that organisations following a fascist ideology have been given a free hand to target their ideological opponents and with an assurance of impunity against prosecution. If this downslide is not arrested, it may result in civic unrest.

444,2020/01/07,"Suspension training, a form of body weight training, provides an extra challenge","Suspension training is an interesting variation to add to your home gym. Popular suspension equipment is the TRX and the Yoga Sling. These come with special features for home use and can be hooked to the door and used. Let’s look at the TRX — Total Body Resistance Exercise — which was developed by a US Navy Seal to stay in shape. While this doesn’t mean you must have a next-level practice, it’s best to have a basic fitness level to use it. Do avoid it if you have musculoskeletal injuries, such as back and neck pain or osteoarthritis.

The TRX can be bought online and comes with an instructional leaflet and video. Follow a progression strictly, as doing too much too soon can be harmful in the long run. It consists of two straps linked to a common suspension strap which can be hooked on to the door at a height of 7 to 9 feet. You will need about 6 to 8 feet of flat, non-slip surface to use this equipment. The straps end in two handles which are used as grips, when exercising. One can grip the handles with the hands for upper body exercises or hook the feet on to the loops for lower body and core work. You can exercise with or without shoes, building strength, flexibility and stability. It is a portable piece of equipment which is easy to store and to carry.

Make sure to warm up. Start the workout with the simplest exercises and progress to the more difficult ones, doing 16 to 20 repetitions or as per your current fitness level.

1 Squats

After setting up the TRX as per instructions, hold the handles, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, and execute the squat. Progress to a single-leg squat.

2 Lats

From the same position as the squats, pull your body towards the TRX using the muscles of the back.

3 Biceps curls

From this same position, execute the biceps curl, using the strength from the biceps to flex the arms.

4 Lunges

Stand with your back to the TRX. Hook one foot into the handles and go into a lunge. Do both sides.

5 Tricep extension

From this position, grip the handles overhead and extend the arms to work the triceps.

6 TRX core

Facing away from the TRX, go down on your knees, and hook the top of the feet into the handles. As you take this position, make sure your knees are comfortably resting on the floor. Place both hands firmly on the floor, and lift your body into a plank. Your body should be flat, as it should be in a regular plank position. You can progress to the mountain climbers and ab exercises from this position. Advanced athletes can also do side planks.

7 Bridging

Lie supine, hook your feet into the TRX and execute the bridge. Start with the arms resting on the floor by the side of the body and progress to lifting both arms towards the ceiling.

445,2020/01/07,Song of resistance at Mumbai’s Occupy Gateway protest: From Bella Ciao to Inquilab ki mashaal jalao,"It’s a catchy beat that’s uniting the peaceful anti-CAA/NRC protests, spearheaded by the young, across India. Ironically, it’s Italian in origin. Bella Ciao, an Italian folk song was adopted as an anti fascist anthem and used by the Italian partisans, 1943-1945, during the Italian Resistance. Since then it has gone through many versions and has been been used in several films, shows as well as protest movements across the world. Ironically, for the Indian millennials who have been singing its bhartiya versions various protest sites, the inspiration has come from the one seen and heard recently in the Spanish Netflix series Money Heist.

A Hindi version of the song played out last week in the Gurugram protests. Another Hindi version written by Ramneek Singh, Gaurav Tripathi, Puneet Sharma and Manish Saxena kept the energy going at the Occupy Gateway protests in Mumbai on January 6. It exhorted the young to keep the flames of revolution burning (Inquilab ki mashaal jalao) with one of the stanzas saying: “Aaya ek Nazi, laaya NRC, Bola pehchaan karwao warna jao jao jao (A Nazi came and brought in NRC, asked us to show identity papers or leave).

In fact the Indian versions go back to various protests, a Bengali one three months back at the Jadavpur University protests, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to get away from West Bengal. Yet another sprung up during JNU fee hike protests. A slow version, dealing with the Kashmir issue, has also been doing the rounds online.

Lyricist Swanand Kikire says he had been hearing it in several protests through the years. He likens it to We shall overcome, a song of eternal hope, courage and strength. Then it disappeared and has now sprung up in popular consciousness again because of Money Heist.

What makes the song work? “The tune itself has the resonance of resistance and rebellion and reaches straight to the heart. Hearing it and singing it together does something to you if you are out there on the streets protesting,” he says, irrespective of the language it is in.

Lyricist Vayu attributes its success to the catchy beat and the embedded messaging —of taking on and speaking out against hardships and authoritarianism.

According to Mr. Sharma, the lyricist who co-wrote the version sung in Mumbai, it’s a classic choir composition: “The more voices sing it, the more beautiful it becomes. It sounds like a rousing marching song when sung by a big group.” Vayu, however, has the last word on its abiding influence and inspiration: “Beauty of art is that it can take any form and meaning.” In other words: “Vive le Bella Ciao, Vive le Resistance”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xuh5tb/article30506769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GATEWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/song-of-resistance-at-mumbais-occupy-gateway-protest-from-bella-ciao-to-inquilab-ki-mashaal-jalao/article30506770.ece
446,2020/01/07,Free Kashmir poster: Protester says she stood for peace as Jayant Patil and Devendra Fadnavis lock horns on Twitter,"Irrigation minister Jayant Patil and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had a spat on Twitter on Tuesday over a ‘Free Kashmir’ poster held by a woman protester during the sit-in at the Gateway of India condemning the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

Mr. Fadnavis fired the first salvo by tweeting, “Protest is for what exactly? Why slogans of “Free Kashmir”? How can we tolerate such separatist elements in Mumbai? ‘Free Kashmir’ slogans by Azadi gang at 2km from CMO? Uddhavji are you going to tolerate this free Kashmir anti India campaign right under your nose???”

In reply, Mr. Patil said the Opposition leader was misinterpreting the message. He said, “Devendraji, it’s ‘free kashmir’ from all discriminations, bans on cellular networks and central control. I can’t believe that responsible leader like you trying to confuse people by decoding words in such a hatred way. Is it losing power or losing self control?”

Mr. Fadnavis responded by saying that the Minister must learn to place the nation first. “Jayantrao, this vote bank politics is not expected from you. Kashmir has already been freed from discrimination and certain curbs have been there since decades for security concerns. Be it in Govt or opposition, for us, the only principle is NATION FIRST!” Mr. Fadnavis tweeted.

Meanwhile, Mehak Prabhu, the woman protester, said in a video message that the controversy had been blown out of proportion. “If by being naive in understanding the impact it would have and in the process have created this stir, I apologise. I am an artist who believes in basic human compassion. Let power of love overcome hate,” she said.

Ms. Prabhu said she was just highlighting the communication curbs imposed on Jammu & Kashmir since August 5. She said, “In the last five months, the basic rights of the people of Jammu & Kashmir have been taken away. If we say they are ‘ours’, then we should treat them accordingly. They should get the basic rights that we are getting.”

She said she was just trying to send a message of peace. “I was quietly standing. Actually, there were flowers in my hand. It was meant to be offering peace. Let’s make peace together. That was my only intention in holding that placard,” she said.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the woman’s background is being verified. He said, “If she is involved in any anti-national activity, action will be taken against her.” Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said he has filed a complaint against Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad for leading an ‘anti-national’ march in south Mumbai without police permission. The Mumbai police is yet to give an official confirmation on the complaint.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/foj20r/article30506642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200106284L-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/free-kashmir-poster-protester-says-she-stood-for-peace-as-jayant-patil-and-devendra-fadnavis-lock-horns-on-twitter/article30506643.ece
447,2020/01/07,"Undertrial slaps advocate at court in Thane, lawyers strike work","An undertrial prisoner allegedly slapped an advocate at a court in Maharashtra’s Thane district, a police official said on Tuesday.

The incident took place at Chopda Court in Ulhasnagar township on Monday following which lawyers went on a day-long strike in protest, he said.

The accused, Rahul Tak, was brought to the court for a case hearing, inspector R.K. Kote said.

While standing in a corner, Tak called advocate Rajendra Bhalerao, who had defended him in earlier cases, towards him to say something, the official said.

As the advocate went to the accused, the latter allegedly used abusive language and slapped him, Kote said.

When a woman lawyer tried to rescue her colleague, the accused threatened both of them with dire consequences, the official said.

The police later caught hold of Tak and took him away, he said, without giving details of the charges against the accused and the prison where he was lodged.

The local bar association took serious note of the incident and submitted a written complaint to the court.

448,2020/01/07,"Court acquits man, 3 aides booked for murdering wife","A court in the State has acquitted a man and his three associates who were accused of killing his wife six years ago and destroying evidence of the crime.

District Judge P.P. Jadhav, in his order last Tuesday, acquitted the woman’s husband, Datta Kisan Jadhav (33) and his three colleagues — Ravidas Rajaram Patil (51), Dayanand Kisan Jadhav (28) and Subash Ramu Bhurkud (44) — saying the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

All four accused and the victim, identified as Pushpa, worked in a brick kiln at Desaigaon in Thane.

According to the prosecution, the victim got married to Datta, a resident of Jamghar in Wada taluka of Palghar district, in 2012. The accused did not allow his wife to visit her parents’ house. He also doubted her character and used to beat her up after coming home heavily drunk, the prosecution said.

On January 5, 2014, the victim’s parents received a message that she had died of snakebite at the brick kiln. When they reached the accused’s house at Jamghar, they noticed wounds on the body, said the prosecution.

Pushpa’s mother then filed a police complaint, saying she suspected that her daughter did not die of snakebite but was beaten to death by her husband.

Based on the complaint, Datta and his three colleagues were arrested.

While Datta was booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code, his colleagues were charged under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 176 (failure to give information to public servant) and 34 (common intention).

The judge noted that after filing complaint, Pushpa’s mother admitted that she had not seen her daughter’s body at Jamghar. She also admitted that her sister and some members of a tribal organisation narrated the incident to police, not her.

The mother had also not asked Datta or his parents how her daughter died, the judge observed. “Thus, the complaint is apparently disproved through the cross-examination. Considering the entire evidence on record, it is clear that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charges levelled against the four accused,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-acquits-man-3-aides-booked-for-murdering-wife/article30501001.ece
449,2020/01/07,HC raps NMMC for failing to protect mangroves,"The Bombay High Court on Monday rapped the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) for failing to take steps to protect mangroves in the city and referred to the environmental crisis being faced by Australia due to massive bushfires.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by the NGO, Save Mangroves and Navi Mumbai Existence, claiming that the NMMC and the city’s planning authority, the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), were permitting cutting of mangroves to make way for development projects without proper application of mind.

The petitioner claimed that the CIDCO, revenue authorities and the NMMC had caused major damage to mangroves and the environment by granting development permissions in various sectors of Navi Mumbai. It claimed that authorities failed to declare coastal land densely covered with mangroves as forest land and had marked them as development zones.

The land has been divided into plots and marked for construction of commercial and residential buildings, Save Mangroves and Navi Mumbai Existence said in its plea. “One of such various projects is the proposed site for the NMMC headquarters near Sector 15A in CBD Belapur,” the plea said.

The court on Monday after hearing brief arguments said the NMMC had failed to protect mangroves in the area. The Bench said, “Look at what is happening in Australia.... the fire is because of absence of mangroves. Here, we have mangroves but you [NMMC] are not doing anything to protect them.” The court said it would pass appropriate orders in the petition later.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-raps-nmmc-for-failing-to-protect-mangroves/article30500964.ece

Police had appealed to the protesters to shift but they didn’t listen, so they were “relocated” to Azad Maidan, the official said.

Hundreds of people, including students, women and senior citizens — who assembled at the iconic Gateway of India since Sunday midnight — demanded action against the culprits and called for Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation.

451,2020/01/07,"Man, family booked for keeping his HIV status a secret from wife","A 26-year-old woman from Kamothe has filed a police complaint against her husband after she found that he was infected with HIV, and he and his family had hidden that at the time of marriage.

A resident of Sector 6, the complainant had got married to a 31-year-old Dombivli resident in May 2017. At the time of fixing the marriage, the man’s family had claimed that he had no addiction or disease. Since the complainant’s husband and her father work in the same department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, her father had believed in the claims made by the man’s family, the woman said in the FIR.

“The complainant had suspected something amiss about his health as he was always seen coughing which he would say was due to pollution and stress. When she would ask his relatives about his health they would not give a proper answer,” an officer from Kamothe police station said.

After noticing that he would frequently take medicines, the woman confronted him to which he said he had tuberculosis and was undergoing treatment, and he would recover soon.

The complainant alleged that her sister-in-law and her husband who also live in Lodha, Dombivli, used to visit their house daily along with an aunt from Kharghar, who would abuse her over her cooking skills and her way of running the family.

In December 2017, the complainant’s husband fell sick and was admitted to a hospital. “Every time she tried talking to the treating doctor, her in-laws would stop her, and she got further suspicious. After his discharge, she asked him again to tell her the truth and he said that he was inflicted with HIV. He also said his family knew about it, and asked her to not tell anyone about it,” the police officer said.

Meanwhile, the complainant’s sister had lost her husband and hence she did not disclose about her husband’s disease to her family.

Later, she fell ill and was hospitalised, but her husband refused to show her the blood reports. After getting discharged, she went to stay with her parents in Kamothe and told her parents about her husband’s medical condition. The family got her checked at two hospitals and both confirmed that she too was infected with HIV. The family then approached court and got a magistrate’s order to have an FIR registered.

On January 3, her husband, in-laws, sister-in-law and her husband along with the aunty were booked under Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), and 498A (violence on woman after marriage) of the Indian Penal Code.

“We will be sending notices to the accused and will conduct a detailed inquiry before making any arrest,” police inspector Vimal Bidave from Kamothe police station said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-family-booked-for-keeping-his-hiv-status-a-secret-from-wife/article30498595.ece
452,2020/01/07,GRP arrests serial robber who killed woman on train in 2018,"A serial offender who murdered a woman on board a mail express train between Borivali and Dadar in December 2018 was arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP). The accused, identified as Mohammad Aslam Shaikh (47), has also been charged with robbing two women in November and December 2019.

Ravindra Sengavkar, Commissioner, Mumbai GRP, said the accused had set a pattern where he would target women’s compartments of long-distance passenger trains where there was only one passenger. “He would climb onto the train just as it was leaving the platform and then rob the woman. He would alight as the train was approaching a platform or if the train slowed down in the middle,” he said.

GRP officials said using the description given by the two victims of the robberies in 2019, they laid a trap near Dadar station. “The accused used to board the train in Borivali, where trains would usually empty out. Since they were mail express trains, the next stop would either be Dadar or Mumbai Central,” a GRP official said.

The accused was taken into custody on January 1 and questioned. He confessed to the robberies in November and December 2019 and then on further questioning, he confessed to the murder of Deriya Devi Chowdhary (40) in December 2018. “According to his statement, the victim slapped him while resisting his attempt to rob her, after which he stabbed her with his knife,” a GRP official said.

Mr. Sengavkar said since his arrest they have recovered nearly 95% of the goods he had stolen from victims, which include mobile phones and gold chains. He said they were planning to also arrest his friend Shakeel Khan and his mother Salma Shaikh in connection with the crimes.

A resident of Kalwa, Mr. Shaikh used to live with his mother and had been sent to jail for targeting women in long-distance passenger trains. “He was charged with robbing women by the Dadar GRP and was sent to jail for nine years in 2010. The sentence was later commuted and he was released in August 2018 from Kolhapur jail,” a GRP official said.

While there was CCTV footage of the accused, GRP officials said, in most of them he wore a cap making it difficult to recognise the person. “We found that he was also carrying a bag in a particular fashion. He used to portray himself as a ragpicker to evade suspicion,” a GRP official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/f9rej8/article30498588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMMudered-Revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/grp-arrests-serial-robber-who-killed-woman-on-train-in-2018/article30498589.ece
453,2020/01/07,"‘Sports can give focus, confidence to talented teenagers’","In an age when the young have multiple options laid out for them, taking up a sport can give them a sense of focus, besides building character and confidence, according to Arjuna award winner Suma Shirur.

“The youth today have a lot of distractions. They are very confused souls. All of them need a direction and sport can teach them a way of life,” said Ms. Shirur, who held the women’s 10m air rifle world record in 2004. “A sport has many aspects that cannot be learnt from books; it is not theory to be learnt by memorising, but imparts practical ways of handling tough situations in life. From my experience in shooting, I can confidently state that one shooting match is a miniature experience of life itself.”

Ms. Shirur was speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the 11th RR Lakshya Cup 2019 at Panvel. The invitation event featuring the top 20 rifle shooters from the country was held at Karnala Sports Academy. The 45-year-old Olympian and founder of Lakshya Shooting Club is familiar with moulding youngsters as part of her role as high performance Coach of the Indian junior rifle shooting squad since 2018.

Giving an insight into how success in any competitive sport can transform people, she said, “The first step we shooters take — just standing there (at the range), picking up the rifle and showing our skills — requires courage.” Speaking in front of 10 people can make most people uncomfortable, while in a sport like shooting, the whole country is watching the performer’s every move. “A million eyes are on you (at the venue and on live television) and it is the time to perform. Being able to deliver at that moment as a nation’s representative requires immense courage. Sports teach you to dig into your inner reserves; an inner power comes to the fore in a competition.”

Competing at the highest level internationally is familiar territory for Ms. Shirur. She shot 400/400 at the 2014 Asian Championships in Kuala Lumpur for the world mark. The same year, competing for the first time in the Olympic Games at Athens, she qualified for the final on a debut appearance with 396/400 and finished eighth in the 10m air rifle contest. Her training partner Abhinav Bindra struck the first-ever individual Olympic gold four years later, at the 2008 Beijing Games. Both were trained by Heinz Renkemeir and Gaby Buehlmann from Germany.

Ms. Shirur said the confidence that success brings with it was reflected in the performance of Aishwary Tomar (18), from Madhya Pradesh, at the Lakshaya Cup. He was last year’s juniors category runner-up, and on December 29, 2019, topped the seniors category at the Karnala Sports Academy. Ms. Shirur saw the same spark in the eyes of Divyansh Panwar, who at 17 years of age, is the youngest Indian to earn a qualifying place for the forthcoming Tokyo Olympic Games.

As a 16-year-old last year, Panwar, a shooting sensation from Rajasthan, had chosen to match his skills with those of his seniors in the Lakshya Cup and emerged champion. This year, he finished four places behind Tomar in the fifth position. Both teenagers are probables for a first-time Olympic appearance alongside the world’s best senior sharp-shooters at the Tokyo Games 2020. Other Indian probables for Tokyo include Saurabh Chaudhary, Manu Bhaker (both air pistol shooters are 17 years old).

On the teenage talent focused on shooting for India on the Olympic stage, Ms. Shirur said, “Gone are the days when we completed graduation and then took up a sport. The youth today start early and by the time they graduate, their sporting career is done with. When we have really young kids coming into shooting, it is not easy for them to understand the trials and tribulations of a sportsperson, the sacrifices required. They find success easily, and need to be grounded to handle the pressures, money and media attention.”

Ms. Shirur launched the Lakshya Cup to give rifle shooters a taste of competition, recognition among peers and prize money (₹1 lakh for senior winners, ₹50,000 for junior champions). As the sport enters an Olympic year, she is optimistic of shooters making India proud again.

Rajyavardhan Rathore was 34 when he stepped on the podium to receive a double trap silver medal at 2004 in Athens. Mr. Bindra grabbed the gold in 10m air rifle at 25 years of age in Beijing. Teenagers hungry for success are at the right age to hit the bullseye.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fuli5i/article30498552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMSUMASHIRUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sports-can-give-focus-confidence-to-talented-teenagers/article30498553.ece
454,2020/01/07,Mumbai occupies Gateway against JNU attack,"What started as a silent vigil at the Gateway of India in Mumbai at midnight on Sunday against the assault on students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, turned into a chain protest on Monday.

Around 1,000 people joined the protest, held across the street from the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, which was still on at the time of going to press on Monday.

On Sunday evening, as pictures and reports of the attack on JNU students started coming in, public sentiment against the incident intensified. Around 10 p.m., the Joint Action Committee — which has been at the forefront of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Mumbai — announced a flash protest at Gateway at midnight.

Staying true to the city’s much-lauded spirit, Mumbaikars abandoned their plans and reached Gateway. The initially silent crowd started raising slogans against the government as more joined in. Songs like Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge, Hum Honge Kaamyab and Itni Shakti Humein De Na Daata soon filled the air.

Protesters continued to chant, “Shiksha virodhi yeh sarkar, nahi chalegi ab ki baar (This anti-education government will not be accepted this time),” and, “Zulmi jab jab zulm karega satta ke galiyaaron se, chappa chappa goonj uthega inquilab ke naaron se (Whenever the oppressor commits atrocities from the corridors of power, every nook and cranny will resonate with the cries of the revolution).”

“We are leaving no stone unturned in spreading love and maintaining brotherhood. And these people [behind the attack] are leaving no stone unturned in spreading hatred and lies,” N. Sai Balaji, former JNU student union president, said.

A large part of the 400-strong crowd that had gathered on Sunday, including youngsters and working professionals, stayed all through the night and most of Monday, despite it being the start of the working week. Hashtags like #OccupyGateway and #MumbaiWithJNU were trending through the day.

Several protesters said the JNU attack was orchestrated by the BJP to divert attention from issues like the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. “Now is the time to show up. What is happening in JNU is a smokescreen for the elections in February. It is just that the party is panicking,” said Pooja Sinha Roy, a cultural guide.

The city opened its hearts and pockets to the protesters, responding to social media posts and rushing to the scene with essentials like food, water, clothes and sanitary napkins. One post said the Taj Mahal Palace hotel was not allowing people to use its washrooms. A representative for the hotel refused to comment. Soon, Colaba Social put out a post welcoming any and all protesters to use its facilities.

By Monday evening, hundreds of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai residents marched from Hutatma Chowk to Gateway, bringing the number of the protesters to 1,000. Also seen were several actors, including Sushant Singh and Kumud Mishra. Mr. Singh has been actively involved in the anti-CAA protests. “I am in touch with friends in Delhi, and everyone is in shock and fear. I’m receiving videos that show a BJP leader openly telling his followers to attack Muslims,” Mr. Singh said.

Mr Mishra said this was the first time he has come out to protest. He said, “I have always been an informed citizen … But this is the first time I am unable to understand where we as a country are headed. People I have known for 20 years are coming out as bigots of such intensity that I can’t be in the same room with them. My former teachers are sending me WhatsApp messages filled with hate.

455,2020/01/07,$5 billion Foxconn plant deal scrapped: Industries Minister,"Maharashtra Industries Minister Subhash Desai announced on Monday that the deal with Foxconn Technology Group to build an electronics manufacturing plant has been cancelled.

Mr. Desai said Foxconn, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of consumer electronics, has decided not to go ahead with its commitment to invest around $5 billion (over ₹35,000 crore) in the State as proposed in an MoU signed with the government in 2015. He said the deal would not be carried out owing to Foxconn’s internal dispute with Apple Inc. “The investment commitment made by Foxconn is not coming through. It will not happen in the future as well. While they had taken up land near Navi Mumbai to set up initial facilities, it seems like multiple factors have led to their exit from Maharashtra,” he said.

Mr. Desai said the MoU with Foxconn did not have any loopholes and the State government had made all possible efforts to make sure the deal would be implemented. He said, “Prevailing global economic conditions, better performance by its competitors and internal disagreements with Apple, ensured the company could not get a head start.” Mr. Desai added, “We left no stone unturned to ensure that this MoU came through. But it was all in vain.”

The deal was inked by the previous government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena to set up an electronics manufacturing plant on a 13-acre plot in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).

Joint approval

Earlier, the Taiwan-based manufacturer had forwarded the proposal to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who spoke to the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis about the land requirement and approved the move.

The deal was finalised after the company’s proposed plant to manufacture mobiles at a land in Turbhe in Navi Mumbai got stuck due to encumbrance issues. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation said the plot was to be sublet from a major developer, but the company had already set up its corporate offices in south Mumbai.

The State was able to lease only two sheds at the land, while the rest remained encumbered. The total area was over 2 lakh square feet, but the company needed more land. The firm even looked for large tracts of land in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/laislz/article30498408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMFOXCONN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5-billion-foxconn-plant-deal-scrapped-industries-minister/article30498410.ece

The deceased, Sharmila Paushe, a resident of Ambernath, married Satish Paushe of Taloja in May last year. As per the complaint filed by Sharmila’s brother, Mahesh Bhagyawant, Mr. Paushe had created a ruckus at their wedding as there was no non-vegetarian food. His relatives had to calm him down.

Mr. Bhagyawant also said his sister started facing abuse and harassment two months later. “The complainant has said the victim was being asked to bring a gold chain from her parents. When Mr. Bhagyawant confronted Sharmila’s in-laws about this, they abused him and said his sister was a liar,” an officer from Taloja police station said.

The officer said Mr. Bhagyawant had then asked his sister to give the relationship some time. “As the mental harassment increased, Sharmila even hinted to her brother that she might end up doing something to herself,” he said.

On December 26, Sharmila consumed poison and was taken to MGM Hospital in Kamothe. She died while undergoing treatment on December 29 and her body was taken to Ambernath for the last rites. The complaint said her in-laws and husband did not attend the funeral.

Last week, her brother approached the Taloja police and registered a case of abetment against her husband Satish, in-laws Jaywanta, Shaman, Jagdish Paushe and Deeplata Patil.

458,2020/01/07,Heroin racket: one more arrested,"The anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Crime Branch on Sunday made one more arrest in connection with the heroin supply racket busted last week.

The ANC had on Saturday arrested two accused, identified as Rajesh Joshi (52) and Krushnamurti Kawander (46), with six kg of heroine worth ₹12 crore. The duo are alleged to be the top members of a cartel that was responsible for 80% of the city’s heroin supply, with a wide network of distributors.

The third accused has been identified as Shivkumar Kawander (41), who was arrested from Charkop in Kandivali based on the interrogation of the first two accused.

“Inquiries so far indicate that he was a distributor and reported to Ms. Kawander. However, he is only one of the several distributors working for the gang and also had a lot of others working under him. The speed with which the heroin was distributed across the city after being received from Mr. Joshi could not have been achieved without considerable manpower,” an ANC officer said.

The officer said efforts are under way to trace and apprehend the kingpin of the cartel, who is believed to be based in south India. “The kingpin seems to be very cautious, as he took considerable effort in always distancing himself from the actual action, coordinating on the phone all the time. We suspect that he was also supplying heroin to other States and cities, and the arrested accused are being interrogated to confirm this,” the officer said.

The ANC has sent samples of the seized heroin to the Forensic Sciences Laboratory in Kalina, and are awaiting reports on its quality.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/heroin-racket-one-more-arrested/article30498386.ece
459,2020/01/07,Eminent industry captains to attend CM’s interaction,"The State’s new industrial policy, which promises jobs for the local youth, will be at the centre of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s first interaction with India Inc. on Tuesday.

The interaction, which will be held at Sahyadri Guest House, will be attended by industry captains such as chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ratan Tata, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Anand Mahindra, Adi Godrej, Sajjan Jindal, Uday Kotak, Deepak Parekh, Gautam Singhania and Baba Kalyani, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) confirmed.

Mr. Thackeray will also discuss the investment possibilities and an impending ‘Magnetic Maharastra’ investment summit, scheduled in the city in November. State Industries Minister Subhash Desai confirmed that investment commitments made at the previous summit in 2018 would also be reviewed when the CEOs meet the CM. “We also want to take their feedback, not only on policy issues but also on the broader economic situation of the country. The informal interaction is being organised in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry,” he said.

Mr. Desai said Maharashtra occupies a leading position in the country’s economy. The State, through its well-developed economy, aims to remain among the largest contributors to the country’s GDP with a strong presence in almost all sectors, he said. The vision for Maharashtra is to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2025, contributing about one-fifth to the Indian economy, and the CEOs will be taken into confidence on this, the minister said.

The CM is likely to discuss the roadmap for industrial growth of the State, and the role of the government and measures to be taken to provide impetus to this growth, officials from the CMO said.

The State’s industrial policy was unveiled by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Mr. Thackeray days before the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls had kicked in, and it came into effect from April 1, 2019.

Mr. Desai, who was the minister of industries and mining in the previous government too, had then said the aim of the policy was to attract investments of over ₹10 lakh crore and create around 40 lakh jobs by 2023-24. He had also reiterated the goal to turn Maharashtra into a trillion-dollar (₹1 lakh crore) economy.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nrdvkh/article30498367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMSUBHASHDESAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/eminent-industry-captains-to-attend-cms-interaction/article30498368.ece
460,2020/01/07,"BJP loses Jalna, Amravati to MVA in zilla parishad polls","The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government’s unity saw the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lose its grip on the Jalna zilla parishad on Monday as the alliance of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress reigned supreme.

However, the BJP’s loss in the Jalna zilla parishad election was compensated by its successes in the Latur and the Wardha zilla parishads.

Despite the BJP being the single-largest party in the Jalna zilla parishad, the party did not field any candidate owing to the MVA coalition stitched up by the Sena with backing from the NCP and the Congress.

With the BJP backing out of the poll arena, the path was cleared for the Sena’s Uttam Wankhede to be elected president, while the NCP’s Mahendra Pawar was elected vice president of the Jalna zilla parishad.

Earlier, the BJP had similarly lost the Beed zilla parishad in the Marathwada region to the MVA coalition.

Friends and foes

Yet, while the BJP’s bitter estrangement with the Sena at the Central and State levels has certainly harmed the party in the zilla parishad polls in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, the acrimony with the Sena has not been a consistent factor.

In the Wardha zilla parishad, the BJP, with help from a divided Sena, managed to win the local body. The BJP’s Sarita Gakhare was elected president, winning 34 votes in the 52-seat Wardha zilla parishad, while the Congress’s Ujjwala Deshmukh won the remaining 18 votes in the poll.

Similarly, the BJP won both president and vice president posts in the Latur zilla parishad, with the party’s Rahul Kendre and Bharatbhai Solunkhe respectively bagging the two positions.

However, the BJP also suffered a loss in the Amravati zilla parishad, where the MVA formula saw the Congress’s Babloo Deshmukh and the Sena’s Vitthal Chavan being elected unopposed as president and vice-president respectively.

The Congress had a majority of 26 seats in the 57-seat Amravati zilla parishad, while the BJP, with only 13 seats, could not secure any backing from other parties.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-loses-jalna-amravati-to-mva-in-zilla-parishad-polls/article30498361.ece
461,2020/01/07,"Water supply: BMC to spend ₹3,105 crore on Gargai dam","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will pay ₹3,105 crore for construction of the Gargai dam that will augment Mumbai’s water supply by 440 million litres a day. The project has been pending for more than a decade. The dam will displace people in six villages.

Mumbai receives approximately 3,800 million litres of water every day and engineers expect the demand to increase to 5,940 million litres a day by 2041. Considering this, the State government and BMC had planned two dams, Gargai and Pinjal, and a river-linking project called Damanganga-Pinjal. The three projects have been pending for more than a decade.

Pinjal dam is supposed to add 880 million litres, while the river link will add 1,586 million litres, thus covering the deficit. The civic administration has finally brought a comprehensive note on the Gargai dam project before the civic standing committee, which shows that the total project cost stands at ₹3,105 crore.

The dam will be constructed in Palghar district and will submerge about 840 hectares of land. Of this, 670 hectares is forest land, while in the remaining, some parts are private land. In all, the project will displace residents of six villages in Palghar district: Ogada, Khodade, Tilmala, Pachghar, Fanasgaon and Aamle. The first two will be completely submerged, while the other four will be partially submerged. The 185 families that will be displaced by the project will displace be rehabilitated in the same district.

Apart from the actual construction of the dam, the project will include construction of a tunnel from this dam to Modak Sagar dam. The necessary studies will be conducted, permissions secured, rehabilitation and compensation to the project-affected as well as for forest land will be paid, and consultants will be appointed for expertise, officials said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3hixwo/article30498319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMGargai-Damcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/water-supply-bmc-to-spend-3105-crore-on-gargai-dam/article30498321.ece
462,2020/01/07,A wunderkind’s battle to trounce terrorism by unleashing a love for science,"“How can I solve math problems when Taliban terrorists kill 130 school children in Peshawar? How can I solve physics problems when Islamic State militants kill 29 at the Holey Artisan bakery [in Dhaka]? How can I solve chemistry problems when Jaish-e-Muhammad terrorists kill 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama?” says Bangladeshi-American child prodigy Soborno ‘Isaac’ Bari, all of seven years and already famous for his precocious ability in solving complex mathematics and physics problems.

The U.S.-based Soborno, who has penned a 70-page book, simply titled The Love, spoke of his dream at the Savitribai Phule Pune University on Monday of trouncing terrorism by inspiring young people to fall in love with mathematics and science.

“Let’s unleash love to create a world without terrorism,” said this wunderkind, enthralling the packed audience with his trenchant views on the scourge of Islamic terrorism.

The son of Bangladeshi immigrants Rashidul and Shaheda Bari, Soborno, whose EQ is as formidably developed as his IQ, displays astonishing wit, sangfroid and humanism in his talk that could give any eminent public intellectual a run for his money.

His message to parents across the world is to stop giving them ‘Taliban training’ and instead start training them to become scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.

“On my second birthday in 2014, my father took me to Liberty Plaza, where he worked as a security guard between 2001 and 2014. There, he recounted to me the events of the most tragic morning in American history… the horrific events of 9/11 instilled a sense of patriotism in my blood,” said Soborno.

To imbibe harmony and religious tolerance, he urges that children across the world must be allowed to celebrate whichever religious holidays they want, irrespective of their faith.

At six months old, Soborno could talk in full sentences. In 2016, he received a letter of recognition from former U.S. President Barack Obama for his precocity in solving PhD level math, physics and chemistry problems. Two years later, more recognition came from Harvard University for his problem-solving abilities.

While the president of City College of New York gave Soborno the affectionate moniker of the “Einstein of our time”, a friend of his father called him the new “Isaac Newton”, which explains the ‘Isaac’ of his middle name.

What sets him apart from other child prodigies is that besides surmounting complex physics equations like Schrodinger’s wave equation, Soborno has always displayed an astonishing awareness of the global political turmoil.

What prompted him to write a book at this tender age? “I had no such plan… but one day in July 2016 I was praying at a mosque and I asked the imam to pray for America because it was the eve of Fourth of July [U.S. Independence Day], but the imam ignored me. So, I wrote a letter to [U.S. Founding Father] George Washington… As the imam would never apologise, I thought I would do so on his behalf and that of the Muslim community across the world,” says Soborno, who presented his views on religious prejudice and intolerance in a way worthy of a celebrated liberal crusader fighting for world peace.

But his sweetness of manner and innocence belie his maturity, his wisdom and astonishing conception of current events. “You all might be wondering why I am promoting The Love, a campaign based on creating enduring global peace throughout the world instead of solving math problems,” quipped Soborno, drawing hearty laughter from the audience.

“It was the terror of the Taliban, the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and the Jaish-e-Muhammad that forced me on my campaign for world peace,” he says, displaying a remarkable empathy for global turmoil and an astonishing sensitivity to the ravages of Islamic terrorism.

In his book, Soborno, already a mascot in Bangladesh against extremism and Islamic terrorism, relates 10 stories which are a child’s clarion call for communal harmony, religious tolerance and world peace.

“Hate drove these people [terrorists] to chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ while shooting Malala! Hate motivated them to chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ while killing 130 schoolchildren in Peshawar… How can we remove hate from the minds of the people who commit such inhumane acts?” he asks in his book.

He even details a poignant episode of conflict with his mother when he questions why, being a Muslim, he can’t celebrate Christmas.

When his mother says she doesn’t know, Soborno’s reply is: “I’m a Muslim and I love my religion. However, I’m also a Hindu, a Buddhist, a Jew, a Christian. I know we love Eid, but we should also love Yom Kippur, Saraswati Puja and Christmas.”

That is the philosophy behind his little, yet immensely wise book, which rubs shoulders with academic tomes on history and sociology in bookshops across Bangladesh.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1dhtkv/article30498315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMSOBORNOISSACBARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-wunderkinds-battle-to-trounce-terrorism-by-unleashing-a-love-for-science/article30498316.ece

464,2020/01/07,Toyota Vellfire review: Room enough to spare,"What you see here is the big daddy of Toyota MPVs. It’s called the Vellfire and — at nearly 5m long, 1.85m wide and 1.9m tall — it is an MPV so large it makes the Innova Crysta look positively mid-sized. The Vellfire is a mountain of an MPV, but you can make what you want of the way it looks. As with all other MPVs, what really matters is what it is like on the inside.

The moment the powered sliding rear doors open, you are greeted by corridor levels of space between the front and middle-row seats — and that is with the seats in their regular settings. It is a bit of a step up into the Vellfire, but the journey in is well worth it. The middle row is made up of two XXL-sized captain seats that seem more like La-Z-Boy recliners than regular seats. Finished in cushy, high-grade leather, they offer excellent support all around and get a huge range of adjustments. A section of the armrest flips open to reveal a control panel for all manner of seat settings, from backrest angle to the angle and length of the powered leg rests to seat heating and cooling; there is no massage function though. Those seated on the left can even move the co-driver seat forward (via buttons on said seat) for more space. At full extension, the middle seats make for a great place to unwind after a long day at the office.

The large windows add to the feeling of space, and what is good is that they come with full-length sun blinds. Other features of note include a second-row sunroof, 16-colour mood lighting and dedicated climate control for the rear cabin. However, there are some curious omissions in our test car, like the lack of any charging points at the back, as well as a rear-seat entertainment unit, which is something you would just expect to be there. And not to be picky, but the retractable trays for the middle-row seats are quite small, though the fold-out cupholders do work well.

Moving to the third row, the seating position is comfy, and given the abundance of cabin room, it is immensely easy to reach a knee-room compromise with the middle-row passengers. There is no shortage of head and shoulder room either, and the seats are wide enough for three, though the centre split — they are split folding seats — can be bothersome to a middle occupant. Reclining backrests, fold-down armrests, dedicated AC vents and sun-blinds for the rear windows just make it more welcoming. Access though isn’t the easiest — the aperture is quite small despite the MPV’s size — but even so the third-row experience is among the best in the business. Luggage room too isn’t an issue. The third row seats can be slid forward, or dropped forward and flipped to the sides — Innova style — to make more room. A low loading lip and powered tailgate make it easy to load luggage.

Those seated up front have it rather good too. The seats are big on comfort, get heating and cooling, and, as an added plus, the front passenger seat comes with a powered leg rest too. Seat memory, an easy access system (it automatically moves the seat backwards for ease of entry) and a heated steering help make the driver’s life easier. There is also lots of space for small items.

But for all its gizmos and practicality, the Vellfire’s interior still feels like a Toyota interior. The dashboard is easy to navigate and there is generous use of soft-touch materials, but many of the buttons feel plasticky and some even look dated. The after-market touchscreen infotainment system doesn’t do it any favours either.

For an MPV as large as the Vellfire is, it is surprisingly easy to drive. The high seating and large glass area provide a great view, and what also helps break the ice is the surprisingly light steering. It is easy to place the Vellfire and even U-turns don’t require any special effort.

The powertrain’s easygoing nature also helps. The Vellfire makes use of a hybrid powertrain that comprises a 150hp, 2.5-litre petrol engine and a pair of electric motors — one paired with the engine and the second to the rear axle, adding in power when required — making it an all-wheel-drive MPV. Combined power is rated at 197hp. The large Toyota builds speed with grace and manages to mask its two-tonne-plus bulk well. It is quite at ease with a full house and it is also possible to drive the Vellfire in pure EV mode for short distances; this, however, requires gentle inputs on the accelerator or the engine will kick in.

Of the other things, the Vellfire rides a bit firmer than you would like and noise insulation isn’t at par with, say, a German luxury car either. The question is, would you consider the Vellfire over a like-priced luxury SUV or sedan? You see, the Vellfire will come to India as a full import this year, which means prices will be in the range of ₹85-90 lakh (estimated, ex-showroom).

Image-conscious buyers will scoff at the idea of spending big on an MPV (let alone one from Toyota), and broadly speaking, the Vellfire is not the sort of vehicle that fits the typical description of a luxury vehicle. However, those who want space and comfort above all else, and also value the peace of mind that comes with buying a Toyota, will actually find a great match in the Vellfire. If anything, it is at least worth a good look. For all you know, it could just be the luxury car you did not know you wanted.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/vfnih4/article30504354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08bgmtoyotavellfire2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/room-enoughto-spare/article30504358.ece
465,2020/01/07,Challenging the seas,"In 2016 Australian sea kayaker Sandy Robson successful retraced Oskar Speck’s 1932 expedition from Germany to Australia, covering 14,000 miles in five years and traversing 20 countries.

For her extraordinary feat and dedication to the sport Sandy was declared Australian Geographic Adventurer of the Year in 2017.

Sandy is participating in the two-day Kochi Muziris Paddle that kicks off today. In an email interview she talks about her adventures.

Edited excerpts:

Your Germany to Australia kayaking trip (Retracing Oskar Speck) is an amazing story. What is your driving force?

I wanted to recreate the historic expedition of Oscar Speck who paddled Germany to Australia in the 1930s. It is the longest kayak expedition ever made but is little known as unfortunately it was completed at the same time as World War 11 began.

Your association with Kayaking on India

I was supported by India’s water sports communities right around the coast from Gujarat to Kolkata. This included tour operators, surfers, sea kayakers, whitewater kayakers, lifeguards, stand up paddlers, yacht clubs, kite surfers, turtle conservation groups, coastguard and many more.

I am keen to encourage more people in India to get involved in sea kayaking and other non-motorised water sports as these activities build a connection to the waterways and marine environment and encourage people to make positive changes in their lives for their own health and that of the the natural environment.

I found the groups in Kerala organising ‘Green Paddles’ and spreading their eco-message about cleaning up the waterways really inspiring. They were getting out there as ambassadors for the waterways in the community and in schools, Jellyfish Watersports is continuing this good work .

Sea kayaking is a relatively new sport in India and I have kept in touch with the enthusiasts here and maintaining that connection has allowed me to come back and support their initiatives.

This year I am going to be in Kerala's backwaters reconnecting with friends that I made on my expedition here and promoting kayaking, I feel pretty lucky to have these kind of life experiences.

How popular is the sport worldwide? Why are there fewer women in this field?

Sea Kayaking has a great deal of popularity overseas and is well established in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, UK and US.

I have also paddled with people from small kayaking clubs in Turkey and Indonesia where like India, Sea Kayaking is just getting started.

It’d be great to see more women getting involved in the sport, which started out quite male dominated, but that is slowly changing and I am noticing women coming out more over the last five years. Women tend to have busy lives and are taking care of children and their families.

Kayaking is a sport that you can do as a family and it helps get the kids away from all of the electronic devices they are so hooked on these days.

Your 2020 begins with the Kochi MuzirisPaddle. What other adventures are planned?

In 2020 I am training to paddle longer distances so that I can eventually do some challenging sea kayaking trips in Australia, I'm keen to paddle across Bass Strait to Tasmania at some stage, it does require weather gods to align with time off from work, so I don't have a date set yet. I'm also interested to do some more paddling in Indonesia. I paddled on my expedition for 13 months across the Indonesian archipelago and I was learning the language along the way, so I'm keen to go back there and explore more.

There used to be Makassan traders who paddled and sailed from Makassar to Darwin in Australia, so this is a route I am interested in examining for a kayaking expedition journey.

Do you see kayaking getting more popular in India?

It would be fantastic for all school students in India to have the chance to experience camping in nature and adventure sports such as kayaking as a part of their school curriculum. It would also be fantastic for students to engage with the history of your waterways and to try paddling historical craft if they have these in their local areas.

Parents can encourage their children by bringing them on school holiday activities and camps that include water sports. Getting the skills early will promote the sport as people can fall back on it for fitness, relaxation, stress relief and fun and balance out their work life.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/cds3oz/article30501715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpportraitsandyrobsoncourtesyIanTaylorPhotographycopyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/australian-sea-kayaker-sandy-robson-on-promoting-the-sport-and-her-time-in-kerala/article30501718.ece
466,2020/01/07,All For a Game,"It was difficult for Karim to fit in. They wouldn’t let him bat or bowl. “You’re too small and skinny to be on our team,” said Abdul and Tariq, captains of the two cricket teams. There were no kids of Karim’s age in the new neighbourhood.

For nearly a week, Karim sat on the boundary wall and watched the older boys play. It took another week for him to enter the playground and field. And, yet another to muster up courage and ask for a more active role in their teams. “Please…” he pleaded. “I can bat really well. Let me play an over!”

Out of the park

Abdul handed him a bat. “You have been a patient boy. Let’s see what you can do!”

Karim smiled and stood at the crease. When Abdul bowled, Karim slammed the ball so hard that it flew over the playground, past the main road and landed into Mamatoe’s yard.

“You hit the ball. Now go and fetch it!” said Abdul.

Karim hesitated. Mamatoe’s yard was not a place that children frequented. Mamatoe was a quiet, stout lady. She had never left the house since she moved in. People never saw her face, which was always under the shadow of the big hat she wore when she was outside.

“Don’t go to Mamatoe’s yard!” warned Tariq. “Haven’t you heard? Mamatoe is a witch.”

“He’s lying!” said Abdul.

“I am telling the truth. A delivery boy once told me that Mamatoe feasts on young boys. Her yard is always littered with severed arms and limbs.”

“Rubbish!” said Abdul.

“Oh yeah! Why don’t you get the ball yourself, Abdul?” asked Tariq.

Abdul put his arm around Karim. “If you fetch the ball, you will have a permanent place in my team.”

Tempted, Karim ran across the road and jumped over Mamatoe’s tall fence only to slip and fall over a hedge. He winced looking at his bruised right knee. He limped and started looking for the ball in the well-manicured lawn. That’s when he spotted a dozen eyeballs lying on a tray. He also spotted bones and mutilated legs drying in the sun. A shiver went down his spine.

A few minutes later, he found the ball wedged between two branches of a mango tree. He shook the lowest branch vigorously. The ball rolled to the ground. Just as he picked the ball, he heard the main door open and saw the tall imposing figure of Mamatoe.

“No!” Karim cried as Mamatoe walked towards him to take a closer look at his wound.

“Let go of me!” he shouted. “Help! Help!”

Mamatoe lifted him and plonked him on a cane chair in the middle of the garden, cleaned his wound and applied some stinging ointment on it. “Are you thirsty? Would you like to have some sherbet?”

“I know you want to eat me.”

Mamatoe laughed. “Do you really think I am going to eat you?”

The gate opened at that very moment and a young man entered, clutching a heavy bag over his shoulder. “Mamatoe, I have brought the paints you needed.” He spotted the eyeballs drying in the sun. “Aha! I see you have made some new eyeballs. Can I have one?”

“Go ahead! Take what you want,” said Mamatoe.

Karim’s heart thumped harder. The young man tapped his left eye and out popped his entire eyeball. Then he picked up an eyeball with a blue pupil lying on the ground and slid it into his empty eye socket.

“How do I look?” he asked Karim.

Mamatoe laughed, looking at his face. “I design body parts for those who have lost them,” she said. “I also supply wax statues to museums and movie production houses.”

Karim hopped, picked an eyeball and examined it. It was as good as the real one, only hard and heavy. Then he picked up one of the legs and saw it was made of wood.

Karim thanked Mamatoe and hobbled out of the gate only to be greeted by a thundering applause in the playground. With his newly found respect, Karim found a permanent place in Abdul’s team.

“Did you see the witch? How did you escape from her?” they asked.

“Mamatoe is not a witch. She’s an artist,” said Karim. But they wouldn’t listen. All they had to say was, “Mamatoe has bewitched you!”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/jl56l1/article30440735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03YTcricket001jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/all-for-a-game/article30440737.ece
467,2020/01/07,All-seeing Argus,"Have you heard of the idiom, Argus-eyed? It means someone who is keen sighted, observant and vigilant. Let me tell you how this expression came to be.

Argus Panoptes is a character in Greek mythology. He was a giant with 100 eyes on his body. Panoptes means all-seeing.

Argus was a servant of the goddess Hera and he made an excellent watchman because he never fell asleep. When some of his eyes closed for a nap, others were open; so, Argus knew what was going on around him.

Argus was sent to kill the Echidna, a fearsome creature that was half human and half serpent. She lived in a cave and would kill travellers for food.

She was also the mother of some of the most scary and fiercest monsters in Greek mythology like Cereberus and the Learnean Hydra. Argus crept into her cave and killed her while she slept.

He also killed a savage bull that was running loose in Arcadia, and made a cloak from its skin. He came to the rescue of the Arcadians once more to kill a cattle-stealing satyr.

One of his tasks from goddess Hera led to his death. Zeus, Hera’s husband, was in love with a woman called Io. Hera was always on the lookout to catch Zeus with Io. Once, Hera was too close for the lovers to escape. So, Zeus turned Io into a beautiful white cow. When Hera arrived, she knew what had happened and asked for the cow as a gift. Not knowing what to do, Zeus agreed. Hera then handed the cow over to Argus and ordered him to guard her. Argus chained her to a tree.

All eyes

Knowing of Argus’ 100 eyes, Zeus wondered what to do. Finally, he sent Hermes, the messenger of the gods, to rescue Io. Hermes went to the garden where the cow was chained. Argus sat there with at least one eye on the cow at all times. This made Hermes’s task all the more difficult, even though he was a thief par excellence. So, he disguised himself as a herdsman and began chatting with Argus. Slowly he began to tell him stories and played music on his reed pipes. One by one, Argus’ eyes began to close. Hermes stuck to his task and continued to play softly on his pipes till Argus fell asleep. Once he was sure that all of Argus’ eyes were shut, Hermes cut off his head. Quickly he untied Io and set her free.

Hera was upset about the death of her guard. She removed his eyes and set them on the tail of the peacock. From this, the peacock became a symbol of the goddess Hera as she recognised Argus for his service to her.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/gglk3s/article30501193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10YTMYTHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/all-seeing-argus/article30501194.ece
468,2020/01/07,Not fair!,"So apparently, I need to work on pushing my grades up in a few subjects. Okay, okay, I need to push my grades up in all my subjects, but there are some subjects that need a bigger push than others. And no, pushing my grades and subjects off the sides of a cliff into dark, angry waters is not an option. Believe me. I asked.

So, since the grown ups decided that Grade VI Maths, Physics and Chemistry were too hard for them to teach, they decided I needed a tutor. I’d just like to point out here that my super old parents who have white hair and what they keep calling ‘life experiences’ can’t manage chem and algebra, but I, an 11-year-old who isn’t allowed to have his own phone, am expected to be acing it? Does anyone else see the unfairness here?

Extra help

First of all, since we live so far away from civilisation, no one wanted to come and take classes for me! My joy was short-lived when K Sir, my math tutor from Grade IV called the parents up and asked how I was doing. Amma believes that it’s divine destiny or something, that he somehow sensed I needed help and that’s why he called. Like he’s some Jedi Math Whiz. Great. I just ruined Star Wars for myself. Anyway, it was decided that K Sir would come for ‘extra help’, ‘doubt clearing’ and ‘homework assistance’. AKA TUITION! Cue screaming.

Now, I don’t hate tuition. But I don’t love it either. I mean after seven hours in school, I don’t think anyone would want to come home and do more ‘sit in a chair, write and listen’. It’s like asking grown ups to come home after a long day at work and do more work. Okay, okay, I know our parents are always saying that they’re on a ‘work call’ and need to ‘check their email’, but is it fair I have to suffer too?

When I used this argument on my parents, do you know what they did? DO YOU? They organised my tuitions… FOR THE WEEKEND! What new form of torture was this? Are these people even my parents or are they evil alien parent doppelgängers conducting mind experiments on me?

If after school hours are for brain rest and relaxation, weekend hours are for TV, cricket, swimming and more TV. Not algebra, simple machines and the periodic table. As if a Sunday tuition wasn’t bad enough, they fixed it from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.! That’s peak playground time. Who does that? Evil alien parent doppelgängers that’s who!

To make this entire situation even worse — if that were possible — the Pesky Brother, academic superstar that he is, gets to go down and play! Smiling, singing and SMUG!

Well, I took care of that smug smile thanks to an accident between my compass and his favourite football. Maybe geometry isn’t that useless after all.

Now, I’ve to go and find my real parents. They’ve got to be out there somewhere!",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/fv9ukc/article30501173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10YTBUGBOYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/not-fair/article30501176.ece
469,2020/01/07,AIADMK flays Kiran Bedi for disrespecting Assembly resolution,"Flaying Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for going against the decision of Assembly to bestow power upon the Cabinet in the appointment of the State Election Commissioner, AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan said Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy should tender his resignation as Ms. Bedi has shown disrespect to the Assembly resolution.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, the AIADMK leader said Ms. Bedi, by insisting on inviting application for a new SEC, had shown disrespect to the Assembly. The government had appointed former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan as SEC following an Assembly resolution.

“Now, by inviting application for appointing new SEC, Ms. Bedi has challenged the power of the legislature. It is the best example of parallel governance. The Chief Minister should resign rather than facing the insult. Ms. Bedi should be recalled,” he said.

The Ministry of Home Affairs should intervene because the administration had completely collapsed due to the power struggle between the Lt Governor and the Chief Minister. The Lt Governor and Chief Minister were not serious in conducting the local body elections. Both are enacting drama, he added.

He also questioned the silence of Ms. Bedi in not providing salary to hundreds of employees working in societies and public sector undertakings",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/j9mybc/article30502403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH-ANBALAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/aiadmk-flays-kiran-bedi-for-disrespecting-assembly-resolution/article30502404.ece
470,2020/01/07,"Despite Chief Minister’s objection, advertisement for new SEC appointment floated in Puducherry","Ignoring an order issued by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, the Local Administration Department (LAD) on Tuesday floated an advertisement inviting application for the post of State Election Commissioner.

The Chief Minister, two days ago, had quashed the direction of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi to Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar to initiate the process to appoint a new SEC.

As per the criteria mentioned in the advertisement, persons who have served under the Central Government, State Governments or Union Territories for not less than 25 years, having knowledge and experience in conducting elections, can apply for the post. The advertisement was floated by Under Secretary, LAD, Giddi Balaram.

In his order the Chief Minister declared as “illegal” and “null and void” the order of Ms. Bedi annulling the appointment of T. M Balakrishnan as SEC in July last year, following an Assembly resolution. The government made Mr. Balakrishnan the SEC after Speaker V. P Sivakolandhu gave a ruling bestowing the power to appoint the poll officer with the elected government.

The Speaker, while giving his ruling, had also cancelled a similar advertisement floated allegedly at the behest of Ms. Bedi for the SEC post. Taking objection to the appointment, the Lt Governor had referred the issue to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs which in turn last month directed the Chief Secretary to start afresh the process to appoint SEC.

According to a government source, the latest advertisement was “counter” to the Assembly decision giving the power to the Cabinet to appoint the SEC. “The advertisement was published clearly under the instruction of Ms. Bedi. The move is to appoint an officer close to Ms Bedi. We will challenge it legally and through powers vested with the Legislative Assembly,” the source said. A decision willould be taken after Mr Narayanamy returns after his day’s visit to Yanam on Tuesday evening, the source said.

In the past too, the SEC has been appointed on the recommendations of the cabinet in the UT and for that matter in all the States. “Calling applications for appointing an SEC is unheard of. The new advertisement comes at a time when Mr. Balakrishnan’s name is published in the gazette. He has already started the preliminary work for the local body polls,” the source said.

The SEC had notified the post of district election officers, regional electoral officers and electoral registration officers. He had also directed the LAD to bring necessary amendments into the Panchayat and Municipality Acts to provide concessions for the deposits of candidates belonging to Backward Classes and Scheduled Tribes, following the government decision to provide reservation for both the communities in the civic body elections.

A notification was also issued making corrections in the name of wards following the delimitation exercise. He had also invited the Electronic Corporation of India to conduct first-level checking of the Electronic Voting Machines, the source added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/qyfanr/article30501422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07JANTH-PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/despite-chief-ministers-objection-advertisement-for-new-sec-appointment-floated-in-puducherry/article30501424.ece

472,2020/01/07,Road makeover likely to begin after Pongal,"After a delay of two months, bus route roads and damaged interior roads are likely to get a makeover after Pongal. The Chennai Corporation floated bids in October for more than 180 bus route roads and for appointment of a consultant for the road makeover project on damaged stretches of interior roads.

At least 1,700 interior roads have been damaged in the 15 zones of the city. More damaged roads will also be identified after the monsoon.

The project to give a makeover to damaged bus route roads, interior roads and footpaths in all the zones is estimated to cost around ₹250 crore.

Officials said the agreement has not been signed with the contractors in the past two months because of the monsoon. The work is expected to begin after Pongal, when the workers will return from their native villages.

The civic body will also develop footpaths along 60 bus route roads, connecting Metro stations and bus stops with major institutions in the city. Pedestrian facilities to improve connectivity to commercial areas will also be included in the project.

According to data compiled by the Chennai Corporation, complaints on damaged roads have increased in the past few weeks. Most of the 471 bus routes roads and 33,000 interior roads have been damaged, leading to the development of 25,000 potholes.

Chennai Corporation has started repair work of potholes during the monsoon, using wet mix. “We have completed 80% of the work. All the potholes will be repaired by this month,” said an official.

Motorists have reported many accidents on the damaged stretches. The civic body is planning to identify spots where frequent accidents have been reported. “We will also redesign the roads, after identifying the cause of the road accidents,” said an official.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/road-makeover-likely-to-begin-after-pongal/article30498152.ece

Independent candidates, Jayalakshmi Rajabaskaran and Vijayalakshmi contested in the recently concluded rural local body elections. Of the 4,139 votes in the ward, 2,860 were polled.

Ms. Jayalakshmi bagged 1,710 votes while her opponent got the remaining. However, Returning Officer Subramanian allegedly declared Ms. Vijayalakshmi as the winner due to a mix-up with the names and handed over the certificate to her.

While arrangements were under way at the panchayat office, a large number of residents carrying pamphlets laid siege to the office extending solidarity to Ms. Jayalakshmi. D. Kalaivanan, a resident said a majority of the people in 10 villages in the panchayat had overwhelmingly voted in favour of Ms. Jayalakshmi and would never allow the losing candidate to be sworn in.

477,2020/01/07,International Yoga Festivalkicks off in Puducherry,"Puducherry is an ideal location for hosting international yoga events by virtue of its peaceful and pious ambience, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has said.

Inaugurating the 26th International Yoga Festival hosted by the Department of Tourism at the Gandhi Thidal, the Chief Minister said the city had attracted spiritual minds such as Sri Aurobindo and The Mother who had propagated the integral yoga concept globally. Even in the universal township of Auroville, yoga is an integral part of life for its community, which includes about 50 nationalities.

Crediting the Government of India, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for efforts at the United Nations for a global celebration of yoga, Mr. Narayanasamy said the Puducherry government was promoting wellness centres across hospitals.

The government was committed to develop tourism, yoga, art and culture and handicrafts. “We would like to focus on promoting traditional Tamil culture so that they can not only entertain visitors but also inspire the younger generation,” he said.

On a lighter note, Mr. Narayanasamy said yoga was particularly ideal for politicians and those in public life as it would equip them with patience.

479,2020/01/07,Govt. accused of protecting CSI bishop in admission case,"The long-running rift in the South Kerala diocese of the Church of South India (CSI) appears to have reared its head yet again with a section voicing its criticism over the purported hesitance of the government in expediting legal action against bishop A. Dharmaraj Rasalam and a few others for allegedly collecting huge sums of money from medical aspirants after promising admission to Dr. Somerwell Memorial CSI Medical College, Karakkonam.

Last August, the R. Rajendrababu-led Admission and Supervisory Committee for Medical Education in Kerala had recommended that the government initiate criminal proceedings against the Bishop, college director Bennet Abraham, and former administrator officer P. Thankaraj after considering a batch of complaints submitted by 24 medical aspirants, many from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

Six cases

Subsequently, the Vellarada police had registered six cases but were yet to proceed further with the investigations. Around the same time, the Neyyattinkara police had also registered a case against bishop Rasalam and two others for allegedly forging documents to gain admission for a medical aspirant to the college through unlawful means. Curiously, the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police have not even recorded the statements of those accused in the cases.

Church secretary P.K. Rose Bist alleged that there were reasons to suspect that the government had come under intense pressure from those who scuttled the investigations. He claimed that while those accused were suspected to have collected around ₹6.5 crore from ineligible candidates, around ₹28 crore of accounted fees collected during 2013-18 were found to be missing from the accounts maintained by the SKMM.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/govt-accused-of-protecting-csi-bishop-in-admission-case/article30506278.ece
480,2020/01/07,Audit report flags revenue loss,"The audit report of the city Corporation for the financial year 2017-18 has flagged revenue loss to the civic body owing to not following the norms in regularisation of unauthorised constructions as well as in wrongly classifying commercial buildings as residential.

The auditing team found that several multistoreyed buildings and telecommunication towers in the city have not been regularised, and are still having the UA (Unauthorised) numbers, with taxes remaining unpaid. One such telecommunication company’s tower located at Rishimangalam has outstanding tax dues of ₹1.69 lakh while another one at Poojappura owes the Corporation ₹1.65 lakh.

The report says that a seven-storied commercial complex at Chenthitta ward owes the Corporation ₹3.81 crore in tax dues, since 2006-07. In reply to the audit query, the Corporation officials had informed that this building had now been provided a TC number, but the tax was paid under the old rates under Section 380 of the Municipality Act, causing the remaining amount to be reflected as outstanding dues.

Wrong permit

In Vattiyoorkavu ward, permit was provided for a residential building spread over 286 sq m in 17 cents of land. The owner later re-submitted the application for a residential-cum-commercial building in 996.36 sq m. However, the permit was approved as residential, at a reduced rate of ₹10 per sq m. In some cases under the Fort and Kudappanakkunnu zonal offices, permit fee was not collected in accordance with the floor area. In such cases, the audit proposes that the remaining amount be collected from the official responsible for it.

Incomplete building

In another serious lapse, an incomplete three-storied building at Sreevaraham ward was given an occupancy certificate from the engineering section of the Corporation. The audit team conducted a site inspection in the presence of the revenue inspector, in which it was found that the building did not have doors or windows, while the plumbing, wiring and flooring work was incomplete. The audit report says that the administration should take serious note of such instances of providing occupancy certificates to a building having only a mere structure.

The report also finds that lesser amounts than stipulated in the norms were charged as compounding fee in regularisation of unauthorised constructions in some cases. The unauthorised constructions below areas of 300 sq m are regularised by the assistant engineers, whom the report holds responsible for the lapses. In some zonal offices, the records of regularisation were found to be not properly maintained.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/audit-report-flags-revenue-loss/article30506225.ece
481,2020/01/07,Measles: A children’s disease now affecting adults,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) calls this highly contagious viral disease an “important cause of death among young children” globally. But, measles of late is being reported from among adults in Kerala, posing a new public health challenge as the severity of the disease is reportedly higher among grown-ups.

According to doctors, the number of patients seeking treatment for measles in the 1-5 age group is not very high. There are, however, many in the 19-40 age group and those aged below nine months. According to sources, around 600 measles cases are reported in Kerala every year. In 2019, as many cases were reported between January and April itself, a majority of them in Thiruvananthapuram district.

K. Mohandas Nair of the Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, says that there can be three reasons for this phenomenon.

Vaccination

The protection supposed to be provided by maternal antibodies, transferred to the child in the womb, is the reason for fixing the first vaccination age for measles at nine months, he says. If the vaccination is given earlier, there is a chance of these antibodies interfering with the immune response to the vaccine, making it ineffective. However, if the child is exposed to the virus present in the community between the age of six and nine months, there is a chance of infection, Dr. Nair says.

“Until recently, only one dose of measles vaccine was being given to children, which ensures an immunity coverage of 90% to 95%. The remaining 5% to 10% people are at risk even after being immunised,” he points out. Also, there are others who deliberately choose not to be vaccinated and get infected.

Immunity loss

Doctors believe that when universal immunisation in childhood is improving, the disease is now moving to an un-immunised older age group or people whose vaccine-acquired immunity is on the wane as the virus is still present in the society. They are also concerned about the increased severity of the disease among adults, with many requiring in-patient treatment and some even being admitted to intensive care units. There have been a few deaths too. Immuno-compromised patients such as organ transplant recipients on immuno-suppressants, patients inflicted with HIV, pregnant women, and cancer patients can be at risk as they might have lost their immunity even if they had been vaccinated.

The motive behind giving the vaccination in two doses, initially at the age of nine months and later between 15 and 18 months, is to address some of the above-mentioned issues, Dr. Nair says. This ensures around 99% of immunity. Also, if there is any measles outbreak in any place, children should be vaccinated even if they are aged six months. Another two doses will have to be given again later. If a sufficient number of people are immune to a particular disease through vaccination, other un-immunised people may get a herd immunity too, Dr. Nair says.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kgccl2/article30506191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/measles,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-childrens-disease-now-affecting-adults/article30506193.ece
482,2020/01/07,Powering of street lights a hurdle,"Commissioning the 1.6-km-long four-lane ₹142-crore Chakka flyover along the National Highway 66 Bypass in front of Thiruvananthapuram airport’s international terminal has been held up over a row on powering the street lights.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that has executed the flyover is delaying the commissioning of the flyover and the four-laned 26.7-km Reach I of Kazhakuttam-Mukkola corridor of the bypass that extends up to Karode on Kerala-Tamil Nadu border following the issue of powering the 176 street lights.

“The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is demanding ₹1.75 crore for powering street lights installed by us at a cost of ₹1,14,40,000. we have laid the cables for the lights installed on both sides at a distance of 25 to 35 m along the flyover. Throwing open the flyover and commissioning of the Reach I have been held up solely because of this as all other work has been completed,” a top NHAI official told The Hindu.

The KSEB’s demand for ₹1.75 crore for powering the street lights has surprised the NHAI project officials and the EPC contractor. It has been pointed out that other electricity boards such as Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board does not seek such hefty amount from the NHAI. For powering street lights in the 550 m-flyover constructed by the NHAI in Nagercoil district of Tamil Nadu, the local body had sought only ₹25,000.

A necessity

A well-lit flyover is necessary in view of the anticipated heavy traffic along the flyover corridor and hundreds of vehicles bringing in flyers to the airport daily during the night and early hours of the day when a majority of the international flights from the Middle East land.

The NHAI is cash-strapped and is not in a position to provide the hefty amount sought by the KSEB for providing power.

“In case the KSEB sticks to the adamant stand, the flyover will be commissioned without powering the street lights,” the official said.

Traffic affected

With the delay in commissioning the flyover, seamless vehicular movement along the Pettah-Chakka-Veli-Shanghumughom stretch and those proceeding to the airport’s domestic terminal and Shanghumughom continue to be affected.

484,2020/01/07,Turning to new turfs as playgrounds vanish,"Till around the turn of the millennium, almost every other locality in the city used to have a playground, which would either be an unused plot of land or paddy land lying fallow.

Come evening, kids and adults used to gather in these grounds for fiercely contested football or cricket matches. Then, slowly, each of these grounds began disappearing, making way for apartment complexes and high rises.

The cricket and football matches shifted to the narrow streets and bylanes, or even to mobile screens. The story of disappearing playgrounds even got the attention of the Malayalam film industry, which came out with the film Rakshadhikari Baiju Oppu, tackling the issue sensitively.

An opportunity

But, some saw an opportunity in this crisis. In November 2018, a group of four football fans, working in diverse fields, came together to set up the first-ever artificial football turf in the city, at Chanthavila. Known as Friday Football Club (FFC) arena, the floodlit turf is equipped with an effective rainwater draining system, which makes playing possible virtually round-the-clock in almost all weather conditions.

“The reason we started this was of course due to our passion for football. Turf culture has been popular for some years in cities overseas, as well as outside Kerala. We used to play on these while travelling, and during my stint in Bengaluru. Six years ago, when I shifted to Thiruvananthapuram, I realised that the city lacks such facilities. Even the normal grounds were not easily available. So, four of us got together, pooled in the money and set up the turf in Chanthavila. Though the location is slightly remote, a lot of football players began coming here,” says S. Balagopal, one of the founders of FFC arena. Two of the founders work in the IT field, while one is a doctor and another works in the telecommunication industry.

Ample bookings

Soon, professional as well as amateur football players began flocking to the arena, with bookings getting filled for weeks. But, the FFC team did not stop at this. On Saturday, adjacent to the football arena, they opened an artificial cricket turf, the first of its kind in Kerala.

“Though cricket is hugely popular here, we did not have a facility like this here. We only have net practice facilities in stadiums. This is a huge risk that we have taken, pooling in the revenue from the football turf,” says Mr. Balagopal.

The success of the FFC brought in more players. In the past one and a half years, the number of football turfs in the city has gone up to around 20, with most of them concentrated around the Kazhakuttam region, with an eye on the football fans in the IT industry. But, turfs have come up in areas like Vattiyoorkavu and Ambalathara too.

The Diego Football Park in Akkulam is one of the few turfs that are open for 24 hours. With its location in an isolated area without any houses nearby, there is no concern of causing trouble to neighbours. One of the frequent visitors here are a group of migrant workers working in restaurants nearby. They arrive here on weekends, to play their matches from 2 a.m., when almost the entire city would be sleeping.

“We opened this turf exactly one year ago. Though my initial plan was to set it up in Kochi, my cousin convinced me to come here. Most of the visitors are people from the 14-40 age group, with everyone from students to IT employees to teams from the coastal areas being part of it. Teams comprising only of women, from the IT companies too come for matches once in a while,” says Hari Xavier, one of the owners of Diego Football Park.

According to Aneez, an IT employee, the comfort as well as the flexible timings made him shift from playing in grounds to turfs.

“In the normal grounds, you can play only in the morning or evening. For working professionals like me, this does not allow much flexibility, while in turfs, we can play even late at night. The comfort as well as playing under the floodlights on the artificial grass, which gives one the feeling of playing in a real football ground, are the highlights of turf matches. But, we have to book at least one week in advance to ensure that we get a space to play,” he says.

Rajeev Krishnan, another IT employee, says that the boom in football turfs has led to creation of exclusive turf tournaments.

“I have set aside the Mondays and Wednesdays for turf matches. I frequent the Khel turf opposite Infosys, as well as the turf near the Mall of Travancore. Since we have formed teams for this, we go together at the specified time,” he says.

Most of those who have opened turfs have taken land on lease for the purpose. The initial investment for this is anywhere between ₹50 and 75 lakh, depending on the quality of the turf material, most of which is imported. The length of the artificial grass blades, in the range of 50-60 mm, decides the quality of the playing surface. The hourly rates for the turf range from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500, depending on the quality of the turf as well as the time of the day.

“Since it is a match of fives or sevens, we will have 10 to 14 people, who can easily pool in the money, making it only around ₹100 per head, which is not too much for a quality football turf,” says Mr. Aneez.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/j6dqmt/article30497870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/diegofootballpark,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/turning-tonew-turfsas-playgrounds-vanish/article30497871.ece

He placed the onus on the heads of laboratories to ensure that scientists were insulated from bureaucracy and political interference.

The acclaimed biophysicist visited the University of Kerala on Monday and delivered a lecture at the Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics on the Karyavattom campus.

Prof. Levitt traced the evolution of his work on proteins at a time when computers where 10,000 times less powerful that those available now.

He added that translational research required patience. Many scientific discoveries that were considered unworthy of patents later turned out to be money-spinners, he said.

487,2020/01/07,"Over 35,000 take literacy exam","From just a little over 10,000 candidates last year, the literacy examination conducted by the Kerala State Literacy Mission has witnessed a massive jump in participation this year.

In all, 35,621 candidates sat for the exam compared to 10,076 persons last year. As much as 82% of the candidates this time, at 29,397 were women.

Thankappan, 95, who sat for the examination at Nedunukunnam grama panchayat, Kottayam, was the oldest candidate. Babu, 14, of Shambhuveli colony, Kollam, was the youngest.

The exam was conducted as part of the Mikavutsavam campaign of the mission. Among the districts, Thiruvananthapuram accounted for the highest number of candidates at 5,137.

Mission director P.S. Sreekala attributed the increase to a special literacy campaign conducted in 2,000 colonies from April 1, 2019, as part of the celebrations marking the LDF government’s 1,000 days in office.

Part of the campaign

As many as 31,653 of the candidates who sat for the exam were part of this campaign, and 1,762 candidates were part of the Navachetana literacy programme for Scheduled Caste colonies while 2,206 examinees were part of the Aksharasagaram campaign for colonies in the coastal belt.

The mission had selected tribal, SC and coastal colonies for its 2,000-colony special literacy programme.

According to the literacy mission, majority of the continuing education centres started in 1998 under the literacy programme was concentrated in the cities and towns.

This resulted in a situation where colonies and marginalised sections got sidelined.

The mission, as part of the campaign launched in April last year, had extended the services of 2,000 preraks to the selected colonies.

Since the effort had borne fruit, the mission intended to extend their activities to nearby colonies also, Ms. Sreekala said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/over-35000-take-literacy-exam/article30497765.ece
488,2020/01/07,Ronaldo scores second-half hat-trick as Juventus thump Cagliari,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a second-half hat-trick to lead Serie A champions Juventus to a 4-0 win at home to Cagliari on Monday, taking his tally to eight goals in his last five league games.

The Portuguese pounced on a mistake in the Cagliari defence to break the deadlock four minutes after halftime before adding the second from a penalty as he scored for the fifth league game in the row.

After setting up Gonzalo Higuain for the third in the 81st minute, he completed the rout by finishing off a counter-attack one minute later.

The win left Juventus top of Serie A with 45 points from 18 games, at least until Inter Milan, who are three points behind, visit Napoli in the evening match.

Ronaldo, who completed the 36th league hat-trick of his career, two more than Lionel Messi, took his tally this season to 15 goals, including 13 in Serie A.

Sixth-placed Cagliari defended stubbornly in the first half, restricting Juventus to one real chance when defender Merih Demiral's header thumped against the crossbar from a corner.

But it began to unravel for the Sardinians when Ragnar Klavan's pass across the face of the Cagliari area was intercepted by Ronaldo who glided past goalkeeper Robin Olsen and scored into the empty net.

Giovanni Simeone headed against the crossbar for Cagliari but they were undone by more careless defending when Marko Rog tripped Paulo Dybala as he weaved his way into the area and Ronaldo sent Olsen the wrong way from the spot.

With nine minutes left, Ronaldo sent substitute Higuain free down the left and the Argentine cut inside before scoring with a deflected shot.

One minute later, Douglas Costa burst forward and slipped the ball to an unmarked Ronaldo who placed his shot between Olsen and the near post.

Cagliari then hit the woodwork for a second time as Joao Pedro struck the post.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ifwk0f/article30501350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-ITALY-JUV-CAGREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ronaldo-scores-second-half-hat-trick-as-juventus-thump-cagliari/article30501351.ece

Lautaro Martinez was also on target for Inter who lead the standings on goal difference from Juventus, who beat Cagliari 4-0 earlier on Monday, with both teams on 45 points. The head-to-head record will be used once the two sides have met twice.

Napoli also had chances before Lukaku put Inter ahead after 13 minutes. The Belgian, who now has 14 league goals this term, intercepted a pass just inside his own half, charged forward and scored with a shot which went in off the post.

His second in the 33rd minute came with a helping hand from Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret, who seemed to have Lukaku's shot covered but allowed it to slip through his legs into the goal.

Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik tapped in Jose Callejon's low cross to pull one back in the 39th but, after the visitors survived heavy pressure early in the second half, Martinez pounced on a slip by Kostas Manolas to score Inter's third in the 61st.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/y2ccw9/article30500343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITALYSOCCERSERIEA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/lukaku-double-gives-inter-impressive-win-at-napoli/article30500344.ece
490,2020/01/07,FA Cup: Arsenal beats Leeds 1-0 to reach fourth round,"Reiss Nelson secured Arsenal’s passage to the FA Cup fourth round by sealing a 1-0 victory over Leeds after the English Premier League side was initially outplayed by the second-tier opponent on Monday.

Nelson’s close-range finish from Alexandre Lacazette’s cross came 10 minutes into the second half. It was the 20-year-old striker’s second goal on his 29th appearance for Arsenal after being among four changes from the side that beat Manchester United last week.

Leeds out-shot Arsenal 15-3 and dominated possession in the first half and demonstrated why Marcelo Bielsa’s side is well placed to end a 16-year exile from the Premier League.

""The way they play they make it very difficult, they play man-to-man around the pitch,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. “If you are not ready for that game you get exposed.”

Arteta told players he has managed for only a couple of weeks that they weren’t reaching the standards expected of them. ""I cannot be happy and I have to let them know,” Arteta said. “We had to react and we changed some things. But the biggest change was how we approached the second half, the mentality, how aggressive we were, how we played in their half, won every duel, making runs forward. It was different.”

The draw for the fourth round was made before the game at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal goes to Bournemouth next on the weekend of Jan. 25-26. Arsenal is enduring a lackluster Premier League, sitting in 10th place after struggles that prompted the firing of Unai Emery as coach.

496,2020/01/07,Operation Muskaan: 22 ‘rescued’ children not produced before CWC,"The ‘Operation Muskaan’ carried out jointly by police and some Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), became a controversy with 22 children rescued during the operation not being produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC).

The NGO home caretakers, in which the children were kept for about 24 hours, said the rescued victims and their parents staged protests, damaged doors, windows and furniture of the shelter and a few managed to escape in the melee.

According to Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, 128 children, including six girls, were rescued during the drive by the police and Childline, on Saturday. The children were provided shelter at Nava Jeevan Bala Bhavan (NJBB), SKCV Children’s Trust and another girls shelter home in the city.

On Saturday night, parents of some children reached the NGO homes and asked that their children be sent home with them. When police said that children could be handed over only after being produced before the CWC, the angered parents and children damaged the furniture and glass panes in NJBB. The parents staged a protest in front of the SKCV Trust, located at Gandhi Nagar.

Speaking to The Hindu, CWC Chairman B.V.S. Kumar said that police and the Childline representatives produced only 106 children, including five girls, on Sunday and they were referred to three homes.

NJBB director N. Ratna Kumar said the parents and the rescued children created ruckus in the home and damaged some furniture. A few youth escaped same night, he said.

SKCV chairman A. Sridhar Reddy said parents of some children, rescued during ‘Operation Muskaan’, staged a protest at the home, and the situation went out of control for sometime.

“My son is 18 years. Police picked him up and branded him as child labour. We produced the Aadhaar and ration cards and family photographs. But, the police refused to release him,” said the mother of a youth.

“Police put my son who is 16 years in police station and shifted him to the Police Commissioner’s office. He is not a criminal. Police detained him and did not allow us to see or speak with him,” bemoaned the mother of another boy displaying the ID and other proofs of his son.

Satyanarayanapuram Circle Inspector (CI) B. Bala Murali Krishna said the organisers of NJBB did not lodge any complaint on misbehaving of the children or their parents. Governorpet CI M.V.S. Nagaraju said the department officials pacified the parents, when they argued with home organisers and demanded that their children be released.

“As there was no CWC hearing on Saturday, we waited for just one additional day,” the Circle Inspector said.

Childline city coordinator A. Ramesh said it was a fact that the family members of some children staged protest and create tension at the homes late in the night on Saturday. The police and the Childline representatives explained to the parents the legal procedure for release of the children and pacified them, he said.

However, representatives of various child rights organisations criticise police for detaining the children and shifting them to different places and demanded that they be given details of the 22 missing children.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/vo69ax/article30497897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-VJ-MUSKAANPARENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/operation-muskaan-22-rescued-children-not-produced-before-cwc/article30497898.ece
497,2020/01/07,‘Pending pleas pertaining to 22A land will be cleared soon’,"The district administration is working hard to clear all the pending files pertaining to the land falling under Section-22A category and all the petitions received so far will be cleared by the middle of this year, district Collector V. Vinay Chand has said.

After a High Court order was passed in 2014, the then government had passed a GO citing that all government land that have been encroached upon be listed under the Section-22A, prohibiting the sale and fresh registration of the listed land.

However, this has been creating a problem for many, especially the owners of individual houses and apartments as their land has been listed under the Section-22A.

Petitioners’ plights

They say that they had purchased the land or apartment investing their life’s saving and at the time of purchase, the properties in question were registered. But now, if they want to sell the land to meet the emergency needs or obtain a bank loan, their applications are being rejected for the pieces of land are listed under Section-22A.

In many cases, it is seen that the land has changed hands at least three to four times, since the ULC Act came into force in 1976. The present owners say that they have become victims for no fault of theirs.

Speaking to The Hindu, the Collector acknowledged that there is an issue and several pieces of government land were sold or encroached upon by land grabbers in collusion with revenue officials.

“It is time to set the things right and we are processing the applications. Based on the strength of the case of the petitioner, we will consider and take a call case wise,” said Mr. Vinay Chand.

What procedures say

About 850 cases have been identified till date and applications have been received. Of the total, 160 cases have been processed. There was some delay owing to the general elections and the work has begun now. “We intend to clear all the files in the next three to four months,” said the Collector.

As per the procedure pertaining to Section-22A land, one needs to first apply through the Mee Seva, then the tehsildhar concerned will conduct a survey and give a report which will then be examined by the RDO concerned. Finally, the order will be issued by the District Collector.

Typology

Under Section-22A, there are several categories: 22 A 1(a)— all assigned land or land given to individual for a purpose and which cannot be sold or transferred; 22A 1(b)— land belonging to the Union and the State governments; 22A 1(c)—land belonging to Endowments Department, Wakf board or any religious institution; 22A 1(d)— land notified under ULC (urban land ceiling), and 22A 1(e)— land allotted by the government to institutions or private establishments for a purpose.

Any land that fall under these categories and have been encroached or sold fraudulently, will come under this list and there will be no further registration, unless the case is considered by the revenue authorities and a NOC (no objection certificate) is obtained.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/ewmieq/article30498240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VZ3SECTION22AACITYVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/pending-pleas-pertaining-to-22a-land-will-be-cleared-soon/article30498241.ece

Holding banners and placards, they raised slogans alleging that the members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had beaten up the JNU Students Union president Aishe Ghosh, some professors and students with iron rods. They sought stringent punishment against the culprits.

Speaking on the occasion, CPI(M) leader Ch. Narasinga Rao alleged that the ABVP leaders, with the backing of the BJP, had entered the campus and resorted to attacking students. He said that protests were being held against the attack at universities and educational institutions across the country.

North Andhra Development Forum convener Aja Sarma, CPI(M) leader K. Lokanadham and AIDWA State president Prabhavathi were among those who addressed the students. SFI city secretary L.J.

500,2020/01/07,"Jagan playing dual game on NRC, CAA: TDP leader","The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is opposing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and it will not allow the acts to be implemented in the State, party’s minority cell leader Nazeer Md. said here on Monday.

Fight to continue

“The Telugu Desam will strive hard to protect the interests of Muslims in the State. Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu is against the implementation of NRC and CAA in the State,” he told the media here.

Accusing Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of playing a double game on the issue, Mr. Nazeer said that the Chief Minister had said that the government would not allow implementation of the NRC in the State, and on the other hand, his government had issued notification on the NPR.

“If Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy wants to show its commitment towards the Muslims in the State, he should cancel the notification on the NPR which can be used as a tool for NRC. The questionnaire prepared for NPR is akin to NCR guidelines,” he said, adding that he was not opposed to population census.

In the name of census, the government should not single out people if they fail to produce the details of their origin, said Mr. Nazeer.

‘Religious persecution’

He discussed the Act and advised to take precautions. He also suggested to follow the guidelines while examining and treating the victims approaching the Disha office. “Stringent action will be taken for any violation of the guidelines as the government is according a priority to the implementation of the Disha Act,” said Dr. Arjuna.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/office-at-kgh-to-deal-with-cases-booked-under-disha-act/article30498000.ece
502,2020/01/07,This is the rhythm of romance,"Following The Love Asana, India’s first Mills and Boon novel, and Tick-tock we’re 30, Milan Vohra’s latest offering (six years after her second book) is Our Song (HarperCollins). Though a romance, Our Song weaves in various themes including Hindustani Classical music, child sexual abuse and consent. The story is peppered with quintessential Milan Vohra wit, but there is intensity too without overstating emotions.

Music of the spheres

Our Song revolves around Ragini, a struggling, yet talented musician who pushes her boundaries of creativity; and cool, suave, logical, head honcho of a pharma company Andrew, aka Andy Zot, who cannot understand all the fuss around love. Ragini is a foil to Andrew’s character. Ragini’s creativity knows no bounds while Andrew reigns in his feelings behind a steely reserve. Ragini turns out to be a voice of courage in the novel.

“Andrew and Ragini meet at a point when Ragini has dealt with her challenges. And she has managed to figure out what is important to her,” says Milan, when we meet her for a chat over coffee in Langford Town.

She points out that romance novels is not just about love stories. The author, who has worked with some of India’s leading ad agencies says: “What bothers me is when people say the book is ‘a light and breezy read’.

“It bothers me that they assume romance is frivolous. When you say ‘light, breezy read’, it is what you think is publicly acceptable. On the other hand, I have received sincere feedback that touched me.

“I went for a Kalinga Fellowship, where I was put in a group which was discussing trafficking and women. When I introduced myself, suddenly a girl in the group recognised me.

“She had read Our Song. And later, the conversation turned to the challenges we face as women... Our Song also has within it issues of child sexual abuse and patriarchy in classical music. She held my hand and thanked me for writing the book. It made me feel good. I realised, through her the role romance plays. The book also gives you a sense of joy.”

Started with a song

The idea for the novel came to Milan when she created a song for Kiran Mazumdar Shaw’s Biocon. A little known fact is that Milan has consulted in the development of communication campaigns across government, UN, and private ad agencies in the area of social communication such as the HIV/ aids initiative. Our Song is set in Bengaluru.

“This is the first time I had the courage to write about Bengaluru. I have desisted till now out of fear of getting it wrong,” says Milan frankly.

You can visualise the characters, and Milan says she puts in a lot of work to it. “I work on the characters till I get a good sense of them. I need to form the physicality and their back stories, and the moment you start writing, it flows, then your imagination takes over. Also, it is important to figure out each character’s relationship with each other. ”

Milan still writes on paper, in long hand. “I have all my manuscripts all piled up,” she laughs and adds: “Once I finish writing, I key it into the computer.”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/pp4luo/article30503917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGMVOHRA2,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/this-is-the-rhythm-of-romance/article30503918.ece

504,2020/01/07,Warning issued on reactions to epilepsy drug,"Aimed at ensuring safety of patients using Lamotrigine, prescribed for treating bipolar disorder and epilepsy, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has directed all State drug regulators to ask drug makers to insert warnings about the possible ‘immune system reaction’.

In an alert issued recently, the CDSCO has noted that ‘hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)’ reaction should be as part of their information leaflets for patients. HLH is a rare condition in which the body makes too many cells to fight infection, leading to symptoms of fever, enlarged liver or spleen and neurological abnormalities.

Drug Controller General of India V.G. Somani noted that the safety issue on Lamotrigine was deliberated in the subject expert committee on neurology and psychiatry, on November 27.

“After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the warning of immune system reaction called HLH should be mentioned in the package insert of the drug marketed across the country.”

Lamotrigine is sold in India under more than 20 brand names and the direction comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) flagged some concerns about the drug in 2018.

The CDSCO, India’s apex drug regulator, had started an investigation into the side-effects of Lamotrigine immediately after this alert.

The U.S. FDA had released a drug safety communication which said the drug Lamotrigine for seizures and bipolar disorder, can cause a rare but very serious reaction. This can cause severe inflammation throughout the body and lead to hospitalisation and death, especially if the reaction is not diagnosed and treated quickly.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5frri5/article30504541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-drugs-tablets-pills,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/warning-issued-on-reactions-to-epilepsy-drug/article30504515.ece
505,2020/01/07,Caring for your eyes,"Does every headache have to be related to some eye problem? My daughter is in Class XII and of late has been complaining of a headache. She has her Board exams coming up and I feel she’s stressed and anxious. Could that be the reason? Do I need to get her eyes examined immediately or can it wait for a few more months?

It is possible the stress associated with a very demanding examination system is the cause of such ‘stress’-related headaches, not uncommon in this age group. Rarely does intense reading and work strain the ocular accommodation tissues, aggravating or manifesting a latent refractive error, causing a headache. Migraine, or vascular headache is also common in girls of this age. The lack of proper rest, an imbalanced diet, the poor intake of fluids, can all exaggerate the headache.

Though very uncommon, some brain-related conditions can be a cause. Although your daughter is unlikely to have any serious eye disease, we recommend seeing an eye doctor, who will be able to exclude these possibilities and suggest simple remedies. Since it does not take long for a complete eye examination, do prioritise an immediate visit to the eye doctor, so that the entire family is stress-free to face the examination.

Please discourage analgesic tablets and caffeine-containing beverages, which is treatment worse than the disease itself.

Does the prolonged use of eye drops for tired or dry eyes cause any side effects I should know of?

Most mild to moderate dry eyes are treated by tear substitutes. When these drugs are used without preservatives even for prolonged periods, they do not cause adverse effects. Your eye doctor may prescribe cyclosporine or mild topical steroids if dry eyes are associated with inflammation. These drugs need to be discontinued once inflammation subsides and are not to be used for a long period of time without medical supervision.

I had a baby two months ago. My husband works abroad and has not visited us yet. I live with my in-laws, am stressed out and have been terribly sleep deprived. I experience pain on my upper eyelids a lot. Does it indicate bad health of the eye?

Sleep deprivation and stress are probably contributing factors and upper lid pain need not necessarily indicate bad health. However, sleep deprivation can contribute to dryness or eye surface abnormalities due to the lack of lubricating function of the eye lids. This causes roughness of the eyes and pain or discomfort.

You could undergo a routine eye evaluation by an eye doctor when time permits and have him prescribe preservative-free tear substitutes for relief. Until then, gentle massaging over closed lids or cold compresses over closed eye lids can provide comfort. Though rare inflammation of the lids, styes, could also be a cause of upper lid pain.

506,2020/01/07,Genome of Indian cobra sequenced,"A consortium of scientists, including some from India, have mapped the genome of the Indian Cobra, among the most poisonous snakes in the country. Knowing the sequence of genes could aid in understanding the chemical constituents of the venom and contribute to development of new anti-venom therapies, which have remained practically unchanged for over a century.

Every year, approximately five million people worldwide are bitten by venomous snakes resulting in about 400,000 amputations and more than 100,000 deaths. Each year, about 46,000 people die and 140,000 people are disabled in India from snakebites by the ‘Big 4’ — the Indian cobra, the common krait, Russell’s viper, and the saw-scaled viper.

“High-quality genomes of venomous snakes... will enable generation of a comprehensive catalogue of venom-gland-specific toxin genes that can be used for the development of synthetic anti-venom of defined composition,” the scientists said in the paper which appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Genetics this week.

19 toxin genes

Somasekar Seshagiri, of the SciGenome Research Foundation, Bengaluru, and among the authors of the study, used the genome and gene expression data from 14 different cobra tissues. They annotated venom-gland-relevant genes and analysed the genomic organisation of gene families encoding toxin proteins involved in venom-gland function. The authors found that 19 toxin genes are expressed exclusively in the venom gland and verified the presence of protein for 16 of these genes.

“Targeting these 19 specific toxins using synthetic human antibodies should lead to a safe and effective anti-venom for treating Indian cobra bites,” Mr. Seshagiri said in a statement.

Currently, anti-venom is produced by immunising horses with extracted snake venom and is based on a process developed more than 100 years ago. “This process is laborious and suffers from a lack of consistency leading to varying efficacy and serious side effects.”

Beyond ‘Big 4’

Sequencing a genome is an important step to making anti-venom but wouldn't on its own solve the problem of making and supplying enough of the product to address the huge volume — and variety — of snakebites in India, according to independent scientists.

“India is the snakebite capital of the world,” says Kartik Sunagar, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc.

Prof Sunagar and his colleagues reported last month that though bites from 60 of 270 species of Indian snakes are known to kill or maim, anti-venom now available is only effective against the 'Big 4.'

“These 4 species are not found in northeastern India but the region reports a significant number of snake bites. That implies we need new kinds of anti-venom against species here. The krait in Punjab produces a venom chemically different from the krait in South India,” he explained to The Hindu.

The Sind krait from western India is over 40 times more potent than that of the Spectacled cobra, making it the most toxic Indian snake. “Unfortunately, the polyvalent anti-venom fails to effectively neutralise the venom of this species as well,” Prof. Sunagar said.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/34wtvm/article30505209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIANCOBRAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/genome-of-indian-cobra-sequenced/article30505210.ece
507,2020/01/07,"Serum’s pneumococcal vaccine, once approved, could be cheaper option in the private market","The pneumococcal vaccine developed by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India is expected to become available in the private market in June this year. The vaccine has already been pre-qualified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in December 2019.

Serum Institute had already submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) the data of a phase-3 trial carried out on 2,250 infants in Gambia. It has recently submitted the data of a smaller phase-3 trial carried out at multiple sites in India. Serum expects the approval from the DCGI to come soon.

Serum has already patented the vaccine in India and other countries. In 2018, India granted patent to Pfizer’s Prevenar13, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

While GSK’s vaccine, which contains 10 serotypes, is available for ₹1,600 per dose in the private market, Pfizer’s vaccine, which has 13 serotypes, is priced at ₹3,600 per dose. Each child has to be given four doses (6, 10 and 14 weeks and a booster dose at nine months) of the vaccine for full protection. The entry of Serum’s vaccine is likely to change the market dynamics. Serum’s vaccine has only 10 serotypes, with two serotypes found in the 13-valent vaccine included in the vaccine.

Substantially lower price

“The price of our vaccine in the private market will be substantially lower than the existing vaccines in India,” says Dr. Rajeev Dhere, Executive Director of Serum Institute. He had earlier told The Hindu that it will make the vaccine available to low- and middle-income countries for just $2 a dose, which is 30% cheaper than the GAVI price. Countries that get the vaccine through GAVI shell out nearly $3 per dose, while GAVI puts in an equal amount. Hence, the $2 per dose will be far cheaper for countries that do not get the vaccines through GAVI.

Despite the lower price, it might take some time for Serum’s pneumococcal vaccine to out sell its competitors in the private market. But Serum sees combined uptake of its vaccine in the private and public market to reach appreciable levels soon. “We expect to sell 100 million doses each year within the next three years. Of this, 40-50 million doses per year will be in India alone. The private market for the vaccine will be miniscule compared with the public market,” says Dr. Dhere.

But there are a few hurdles to cross before Serum can ever think of selling 40-50 million doses per year in India in the public market. The first hurdle will be the approval from the DCGI. But given that the phase-3 trial data from Gambia has already been submitted and the DCGI has already looked into the data, and Indian trial data of phase-3 has just been submitted, approval from DCGI might not take long. That probably is the reason why Serum is hopeful of making the vaccine available in the private Indian market by June 2020.

But it must be borne in mind that certain drugs manufactured in India were exported but patients in India did not have access to them as the drugs were not approved by the DCGI.

Inclusion in India’s immunisation programme

Since 2017, Pfizer’s 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been used in India’s Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). The vaccine is being introduced in a phased manner; it has been introduced in Himachal Pradesh, and parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

A vaccine can be used in the national immunisation programme only after the National Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) approves it. “The WHO pre-qualification is the first welcome step but it’s a long way off before UIP adopts it and tender specifications allow for procurement of PCV 10 instead of PCV13,” says Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head of Médecins Sans Frontières’s Access Campaign, Delhi, says in an email to The Hindu. “From the immunisation programme perspective there is a time lag between pre-qualification [by WHO] and a price being announced, the vaccine being registered, NITAG’s approving their substitution and tender specifications being worked out in a manner that cover two different PCV vaccines.”

GAVI support to end in 2020

The pneumococcal vaccine provided through India’s national immunisation progarmme has been supported by GAVI. However, India will stop receiving support from GAVI this year. The only way for India to continue providing pneumococcal vaccine in the immunisation programme and to roll it out in other States is by using an inexpensive vaccine.

The low-cost vaccine from Serum has come at the most appropriate time for millions of children in India. Pneumonia is one of leading causes of deaths in children under five years. In 2018, 1,27,000 deaths due to pneumonia were reported from India, the second highest in the world.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/f7sb3h/article26946211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-MEASLES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/serums-pneumococcal-vaccine-once-approved-could-be-cheaper-option-in-the-private-market/article30502005.ece
