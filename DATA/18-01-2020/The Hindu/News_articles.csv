7,2020/01/18,Xi voices firm support for Myanmar,"China’s Xi Jinping doubled down on his support for fallen rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday, signing dozens of infrastructure and trade deals and meeting with the Myanmar Army chief accused of overseeing a genocide against Rohingya Muslims. The Chinese President’s state visit to Myanmar’s purpose-built capital came as Western investors give a wide berth to the country due to the Rohingya crisis.

A 2017 military crackdown on the minority, which UN investigators called genocide, forced around 7,40,000 people from western Rakhine state over the border into Bangladesh. Beijing has stood by the increasingly isolated nation and reaffirmed its position in a joint statement in Chinese state media as Mr. Xi’s plane left the capital after two days, escorted by fighter jets.

China “firmly supports Myanmar’s efforts to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and national dignity in the international arena” and for it to advance “peace, stability and development in Rakhine State”.

Largest investor

The Asian giant is now Myanmar’s largest investor even as distrust of its ambitions lingers among the public.

More than 30 agreements were signed Saturday on Mr. Xi’s final day of his visit — with Ms. Suu Kyi and Mr. Xi seated across from each other on long tables alongside related Ministers.

Details were scant but among the 33 deals was a concession and shareholders agreement on the $1.3 billion Kyaukhphyu deep-sea port and economic zone, located in a part of Rakhine state left largely unscathed by the 2017 violence.

There was also a letter of intent for “new urban development” in Myanmar’s biggest city Yangon and feasibility studies for rail links.

China-Myanmar corridor

The aim is to carve out a so-called “China-Myanmar Economic Corridor” — a path of infrastructure from China’s landlocked south to Myanmar’s western Rakhine state which would serve as Beijing’s long-awaited gateway to the Indian Ocean.

The signing ceremony came between sit-down meetings with Ms. Suu Kyi and powerful Army chief Min Aung Hlaing, who was put under sanctions by the U.S. after being accused of masterminding the Rohingya crackdown.

Myanmar says it was defending itself against attacks by militants.

After his arrival Friday Mr. Xi called the visit a “historical moment” for China-Myanmar relations, according to state-run newspaper the Global New Light of Myanmar. He also touched on the “unfairness and inequality in international relations” in what could be seen as a slight against the United States.

Myanmar leader Ms. Suu Kyi — whose reputation lies in tatters in the West’s eyes due to her defence of the army over the Rohingya crisis — said the country would always be at China’s side. “It goes without saying that a neighbouring country has no other choice, but to stand together till the end of the world,” she said during a celebration late Friday.

The stakes are heightening as the UN’s top court prepares to rule next week on whether “emergency measures” should be taken against Myanmar as part of a genocide complaint in The Hague.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tyeqbj/article30595892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-MYANMAR-VISITBYXI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xi-voices-firm-support-for-myanmar/article30595893.ece

9,2020/01/18,Iran to send black boxes to Ukraine,"Iran is sending to Ukraine the black boxes of the Ukrainian passenger plane that its military accidentally shot down this month, Tasnim news agency reported on Saturday. The Iranian authorities are also prepared for experts from France, Canada and the United States to examine the data from the boxes, the semi-official news agency said.

All 176 people aboard the plane were killed when the Ukrainian International Airlines flight was shot down on January 8 shortly after take-off from Tehran en route to the Ukrainian capital Kiev.

“With the use of the expertise of the countries of France, Canada and America we will try to read the (flight data recorder) in Kiev,” Hassan Rezaifar, a director in charge of accident investigations at Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation was quoted as saying by Tasnim. “If this effort is unsuccessful then the black box will be sent to France.” The black boxes will not be read in Iran, Mr. Rezaifar said, according to Tasnim.

Fifty seven of the dead were Canadian. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been pressing for a full investigation into the plane downing, said on Friday that Iran should send the black boxes to France for analysis. France was one of the few countries with the ability to read the flight and cockpit data recorders from the jet, which he said were badly damaged, Mr. Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa.

10,2020/01/18,China reports 4 new cases caused by coronavirus strain,"China reported four more cases of pneumonia believed to be caused by a new coronavirus strain, causing rising concern globally that a disease health officials do not yet fully understand could spread during a key holiday period.

The new virus, which was discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, belongs in the same large family of coronaviruses that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.

Though experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little known about its origins and how easily it can spread. Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week.

Authorities around the world including in the United States, Thailand and South Korea have stepped up monitoring of travellers from Wuhan as part of their efforts to prevent the disease from spreading.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that a wider outbreak is possible, though it has advised against any travel restrictions for China.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) said on Saturday the four new individuals diagnosed with the new virus are in stable condition, adding it has confirmed 45 cases in the city as of Thursday. A day earlier, the commission confirmed the death of a second patient.

Nearly 50 people are now known to have been infected globally, but all of them either live in Wuhan or have travelled to the city.

A report published by the London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely “substantially more cases” of the new coronavirus than currently announced by Wuhan authorities: its base scenario estimate is that there would be 1,723 cases showing onset of related symptoms by Jan. 12.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eqyylo/article30595729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-CHINA-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-reports-4-new-cases-caused-by-coronavirus-strain/article30595730.ece
11,2020/01/18,"Amidst a bitter battle for Dhaka’s top post, a curious sideshow","A tide of emotions marked the beginning of the year in Dhaka as political rivals geared up for the mayoral election. And, amidst the heat of campaigning, a fight over the voting date turned into a curious sideshow, leading ultimately to postponement of the poll.

The bone of contention here was the fact that the original voting day, January 30, was coinciding with Saraswati Puja, a Hindu festival dedicated to the goddess of knowledge. This issue first found its way into the nation’s judiciary when a lawyer, Ashok Kumar Ghosh, filed a writ petition in the High Court seeking a deferral. Dismissal of the petition galvanised a group of students to occupy Shahbagh, a popular rallying point that had served as a staging ground for intense demonstrations in 2013, with calls for the election to be rescheduled.

As these demonstrations progressed, on January 15, a man, later identified as Alif Rusdi Hasan, wanted to drive through the area with his family. When the protesters refused to disperse to give way, Mr. Hasan allegedly pointed his licensed pistol on one of the demonstrators, leading to a street fight after which he was detained for a brief period. The episode succeeded in bringing more attention to the protests over the polling date.

Appealing the verdict

For his part, Mr. Ghosh sought a remedy from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. In the meantime, Atiqul Islam, the mayoral candidate fielded by the ruling Awami League for Dhaka North, backed the protesters and sought a deferral of the election. “No-one should be barred from performing their religious duties. I urge the Election Commission to defer the voting day, if possible,” Mr. Islam said as he rallied for votes. The local mayoral election of Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities, became doubly interesting after the government split the city into two in 2011, creating two corporations.

The city of Dhaka, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country’s GDP and half of its formal employment, has an important role to play if the country is to achieve the government’s vision of upper-middle income country. But the capital is also considered notoriously unlivable, with residents facing many difficulties in their everyday lives due to inadequate infrastructure, lack of public amenities and severe traffic congestion.

The metropolitan area has been the city’s engine of job creation, drawing unemployed youth from rural areas. However, its role as an economic hub has also led to rapid population growth and brought new challenges to the two Mayors and their teams.

The Mayors were especially criticised for their failure to control mosquitoes after a colossal outbreak of dengue in 2019. The disease has now morphed into a full-year worry for urban residents. In the aftermath of the outbreak, Dhaka South Mayor Sayeed Khokon fell from grace and failed to secure an Awami League ticket to this year’s race.

Corruption charges

Amid the election fever sweeping the city, Ishraque Hossain, the mayoral candidate for Dhaka South who is backed by the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, faces his own set of woes as he has been charged by the Anti-Corruption Commission. A Dhaka court will open proceedings against him on February 9 for witnesses to testify in a case that accuses him of hiding his wealth.

Mr. Hossain, son of Sadeque Hossain, the last Mayor of the undivided Dhaka City Corporation, has pleaded not guilty. “There’s no bar to his election campaign. He is allowed to continue his campaign as he did before. And he is allowed to participate in the election,” Md. Alamgir, senior secretary at the Election Commission, said at a media briefing. However, the court decision on January 15 had come as a huge distraction for Mr. Hossain’s campaign, whose legal battle mirrors the difficulties faced in the past by his father on similar corruption charges. A Bangladesh court had sentenced Sadeque Hossain, popularly known as Khoka, to 10 years in jail in 2014. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader died in New York in November last year after a long battle with cancer.

As these themes took shape, both the protesters and the candidates kept an eye on the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission for a possible change in the voting date.

With candidates ratcheting up door-to-door campaigns, the Election Commission rushed into a meeting on Saturday amid a mix of excitement and anxiety and rescheduled the polls to February 1.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v3v5l3/article30595524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th19-Despatch-Arun-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/amidst-a-bitter-battle-for-dhakas-top-post-a-curious-sideshow/article30595525.ece
12,2020/01/18,Legislating in a hurry after judicial order,"Earlier this month, both Houses of Pakistan’s Parliament passed three Amendment Bills pertaining to the appointment and tenure of the service chiefs and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. The Bills raised the retirement age of the service chiefs and also enabled the Prime Minister to extend their terms.

Some commentators said they had never witnessed Bills getting passed so quickly — with only a handful of ‘Nos’ from smaller Opposition parties. The two main Opposition parties — the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) supported the Bills and voted in favour of them. The PML-N’s unconditional support even led the PPP to withdraw its suggested amendments to the Bills. President Arif Alvi later signed the Bills into Act.

Earlier, in November 2019, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had taken up a petition related to the Army chief’s extension. A three-year extension to the chief had earlier been notified by the Prime Minister’s Office in August. The Supreme Court found procedural issues with the notification and gave a six-month conditional extension, also directing Parliament to legislate on it. The new Bills bar the judiciary from challenging extensions granted by the executive to the military chiefs.

Blackmailed into submission

Both the PPP and the PML-N have been severely criticised by their supporters for backing the Bills. Some commentators believe these parties were pressured or blackmailed into submission while others believe they were promised their share of the pie in return.

“The Opposition is in quite a disarray, especially the PML-N. They are in a state of despair because the decisions taken by their leadership are either being contradicted or disputed. It goes totally against the narrative that they had developed successfully. It will take some time for them to recover from this loss,” said Senator Shibli Faraz of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar of the PPP told The Hindu that in a visibly constricted space, the PPP pushed for the law to be debated and was principally opposed to legislation being rushed through the Parliament but found no support for its stance among other Opposition parties. ”The PML-N’s unconditional support to the government rendered the effort meaningless.”

Senior PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah told The Hindu that in his opinion, the PML-N was unable to resolve this issue democratically and in a parliamentary way. He said the government was in such haste that an emergency session was called, which made the other parties to behave in a cautious and careful way.

While he couldn’t go to the PML-N’s parliamentary party meeting, Mr. Sanaullah feels that they should have had a debate on this within the party and also with other Opposition parties. The PML-N’s unconditional support to the Bill without taking Opposition parties into confidence has upset the PPP and JUI-F.

‘Climate of uncertainty’

PTI Senator Shibli Faraz said the Bill was presented quickly because of the sensitive nature of the post. “This couldn’t be dragged on in a climate of uncertainty. That is why it was important to settle this issue as soon as possible.”

Rana Sanaullah said he understood the reasons for the PML-N’s resentment. “Our party took this decision without taking our voters into confidence but I feel that this is good in a way. Public outrage over our decision to vote this way demonstrates that this is indeed a democracy and the voters want the politicians to be accountable for their decisions. This is actually the manifestation of ‘vote ko izzat do’ (honour the vote), as the public is showing their concern so this gives me hope.“ Mr. Sanaullah said that in the past, voters wouldn’t have reacted to such a decision by a party but now they want answers as the party has deviated from its narrative. “The PML-N has learnt its lesson — that the public should be consulted and party decisions should be conveyed to the public in a proper and better way instead of being taken unilaterally.” He said that when the Prime Minister gave an extension to the Army chief in August 2019, no party opposed this decision. It was only when the Supreme Court took up the issue and it was sent to Parliament to legislate did the public react.

However, the repudiation of Mr. Khan’s decision by the Supreme Court is being seen by many as a searing indictment of his own government. “The Imran Khan government — already a baggage — is of no use to the masters anymore. Period,” said a senior politician.

13,2020/01/18,Using art to assert their neighbourhood’s identity,"Back in his school days, Firi Rahman, 29, used to feel embarrassed to bring his friends home. Having heard people refer to his neighbourhood as a “slum” or “a den of drug dealers”, he wasn’t sure how his friends would react. “Those of us who belonged to this area felt stigmatised,” recalls the artist, a fifth-generation resident of Slave Island in Colombo. Growing up, it bothered him that the locality, a busy commercial and trading hub in the capital, had to live with an image that hardly reflected the place and its people.

Located near some of Colombo’s most famous tourist spots — the Beira lake, Gangaramaya [Buddhist] Temple, or more recently, the Colombo City Centre — Slave Island is often considered an avoidable “suburb”, one that is associated with its narrow alleyways, congested streets and parking hassles.

Lack of awareness

Not just tourists, even locals don’t know enough about the locality, in Mr. Rahman’s view. “It’s not like we’re tucked away in some corner, this is very much at the heart of the city but still mostly invisible to those in the Colombo bubble... we are like everyone else,” he says. It was this “bubble” that pushed him to think of using his art, in his own neighbourhood, to tell its story and break the stigma that troubled him.

Teaming up with artist Vicky Shahjahan, a fellow resident, he began drawing portraits of those living in the neighbourhood on the walls lining its alleys. Parilojithan Ramanathan, an artist from Batticaloa, joined them. A place, they all agreed, is its people. They decided to call their project ‘We are from here’.

Slave Island, known as one of the oldest settlements of Malay Muslims in Sri Lanka, draws its name from the time Dutch colonists brought down slaves to Sri Lanka. The name bothers some, but not Mr. Rahman. “It is a reminder of our troubled history here. It is something we shouldn’t forget.”

A history of harmony

Today, Slave Island has a distinct, busy vibe, taking in centuries of history, cultural diversity and commercial activity and is home to several hundred families from the working class and trading community, across ethnicities. Well before “coexistence” became a buzz word in Sri Lanka, following cycles of ethnic tensions and consequent violence, Slave Island had been practising just that, although without a fancy name. “Many of our families have a mixed-ethnic lineage, you get a church, mosque, Buddhist temple and Hindu kovil here barely a few yards from each other,” says Mr. Rahman, who is comfortably tri-lingual.

Taking visitors, students and tourists on “art walks” through the neighbourhood, Mr. Rahman talks about the wall portraits — the people in them and their stories. In the bright images dominated by tones of yellow and orange, you meet residents, including a local entrepreneur, a rugby star and a dancer. The artists worked with each of their ‘subjects’, talking to them for hours, recording their stories — of growing up, of their work, beer parties and friendships. “We do a rough sketch on the ipad and show it to the person and proceed with the wall art only if they approve,” says Mr. Rahman.

The portraits stand out against backgrounds ranging from bare, brick walls to newly painted colourful ones. There are no muted yellow lights shining from above, or neat black lines framing them like in a gallery. The portraits share space with a line of faded clothes, tiny plants peeping out of the grooves in the walls and electric meters waiting to be read. A Tamil film song of Ilaiyaraja blares out from a nearby home, as does an evening prayer from the neighbourhood mosque. A woman shreds a coconut at a stall, a group of small boys are playing football and two cats are chasing each other.

The walk takes you along many alleys, across busy junctions and old shop-houses that are now facing growing pressure from developers. High-rise apartments are rapidly displacing heritage structures. Hundreds of residents have already been forced to part with their old homes and land. They obtained alternative housing only after a struggle.

“Our neighbourhood is changing every day, in front of our eyes. Through these portraits and the stories of people in them, we hope to document what is left of our area before it is bulldozed by development,” says the artist, who has so far worked with his personal funds. Wary of external funding, particularly from NGOs, he says: “We won’t have control over what they do with our work. It won’t be about our neighbourhood anymore. It won’t be our stories then.”

14,2020/01/18,"A very Brazilian ‘coup’, captured on celluloid and sent for Oscars","In June 2013, after U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden escaped to Hong Kong, stories about how the Americans were spying on the world began to appear in global media. In Brazil, one of the biggest targets of U.S. spying, the NSA documents revealed that everything was under surveillance: from oil giant Petrobras to mining firms to the then-President Dilma Rousseff’s phone. Ms. Rousseff was furious: she snubbed President Barack Obama by cancelling a White House visit and junked a multi-million-dollar fighter jet deal.

In 2013, Brazil was all set to announce its arrival on the world stage with two mega events — FIFA World Cup 2014 and Rio Olympics 2016 — under its first woman President who had stood against U.S. surveillance. But within months, the streets exploded with protests and violence, setting off a chain of events that led to Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016. Despite having won a re-election in 2014 and not facing any corruption charges, she was removed from office on charges of “budgetary indiscipline”— a move seen by most political observers as a coup against the centre-left government. The country’s right — and the U.S. — maintained that the impeachment followed the “right procedure”. The debate has remained unsettled.

Rise of Bolsonaro

Last year, Brazilian filmmaker Petra Costa released a documentary The Edge of Democracy to show how Brazil’s ruling elite orchestrated a coup against Ms. Rousseff in 2016 and paved the way for far-right Jair Bolsonaro’s rise to power two years later. With a brilliant mix of her personal life story with the country’s political trajectory, Ms. Costa showed how 14 years of Workers Party rule, which brought fundamental social change in the country, made the Opposition plot its demise. In 2014, the documentary shows, the main Opposition candidate who lost to Ms. Rousseff refused to accept the result. “Immediately after Rousseff’s second inauguration, the Opposition candidate started talking about her impeachment. That was the beginning of the process that resulted in the coup against Rousseff,” says Valeriano Costa, a professor of political science at Campinas University.

This month, The Edge of Democracy was nominated in the best documentary section of the Academy Awards, sparking a huge debate in this country. “The nomination of this documentary is really important because during the 2016 coup process, the mainstream big media acted as if everything was working normally in Brazil. The movie puts to rest any doubts over the fact that what happened in 2016 in Brazil was a coup against the Brazilian democratic system and (former President) Lula’s imprisonment was a continuation of that process,” says Brian Mier, a Sao Paulo-based commentator. “The documentary also shows how the rise of Jair Bolsonaro was directly linked to the illegal removal of Dilma from power.”

Few people would disagree that Mr. Bolsonaro hugely benefited from the vacuum created by Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment and the imprisonment of her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. A day after the Brazilian movie got the Oscar nomination, Mr. Bolsonaro dismissed it as “fiction”. “Am I going to waste time with garbage like that?” the President told reporters, when asked to comment on the nomination. As other right-wing politicians dismissed the film as “fiction and fantasy”, Ms. Costa took it as a compliment. “It’s like being nominated a second time in less than 24 hours,” Ms. Costa quipped on Twitter. “At a time when the far right is spreading like an epidemic, we hope this film can help us understand how crucial it is to protect our democracies,” she added.

The most significant part of the documentary is how Ms. Costa links the 2013 protests with the elections in 2014 and the impeachment process in 2016. In a major revelation, the documentary shows that Ms. Rousseff’s confrontation with Brazil’s all-powerful banks over the issue of lowering interest rates was the beginning of her end as the country’s elites decided Ms. Rousseff had to go. Ms. Rousseff, who has always maintained her innocence — and dignity — said what happened was a scam. “The film shows my removal from power and how the venal media, the Brazilian political and economic elite attacked democracy in the country, resulting in the rise of a right-wing candidate in 2018,” she said, adding that the documentary shows “the history of the 2016 coup”.

The film may or may not win an Oscar, but with the Brazilian coup story now going to a global audience, the political debate in this country will certainly become more heated.

15,2020/01/18,U.K. plans Brexit celebrations but warns businesses may suffer,"The British government has announced plans for special events on the night of January 31 when the country officially leaves the European Union but the country’s Treasury Chief has admitted that some U.K. business sectors will suffer as a result.

Sajid Javid told the Financial Times in an interview Saturday that Britain’s regulations will not be aligned with the E.U. in the future and that those changes may hurt some businesses. Currently, the E.U. is Britain’s largest trading partner.

“There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union — and we will do this by the end of the year,” he said, referring to a deadline at the end of 2020 for conclusion of what are expected to be contentious trade talks with the then-27 member E.U.

Britain will officially leave the E.U. bloc on the night of January 31, even though it will keep following E.U. rules for an 11-month transition period. It will be the first nation ever to leave the bloc. The British government plans to mark the occasion with a series of upbeat events.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to make a speech to the nation that night after holding a rare Cabinet session in the north of England to emphasize his government’s plan to spread opportunity to the economically beleaguered region. The government also plans to mark Brexit by projecting a clock onto the prime minister’s official residence at 10 Downing Street in London that will count down until 11 p.m., when the break takes place.

The entire government neighbourhood of Whitehall will be illuminated for the occasion as part of a light show, with Union flags flown on all the poles in Parliament Square. The government will also create a commemorative coin that will enter circulation that day.

But Mr. Johnson’s Conservative government is no longer actively pushing a plan to have the familiar chimes of the Big Ben clock tower at Parliament sound at 11 p.m. despite a private fundraising push in support of activating the chimes, which are under repair.

Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to become the first nation to leave the 28-nation E.U., but the process has moved more slowly than expected. A stalemate last year kept a Withdrawal Bill from passing, leading to a rare December election that gave Mr. Johnson’s pro-Brexit Conservative Party a strong majority in Parliament.

The Brexit Divorce Bill quickly passed when the new Parliament convened. A transition period will last until the end of 2020 as negotiators try to forge a trade arrangement between Britain and the remaining E.U. nations. Prime Minister Johnson, who is also seeking a trade deal with the United States, has ruled out seeking an extension of the deadline for the E.U. talks.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/jniomb/article30594044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16thandrew-whiGIN6RQ3MB3jpgjpg-18jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-plans-brexit-celebrations-but-warns-businesses-may-suffer/article30594028.ece
16,2020/01/18,"Regional stability, situation in Iran, Afghanistan tops the talks between Qureshi and Pompeo","Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has stressed on Islamabad’s commitment toward “security and stability” in South Asia as he met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington and held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues, the situation in Afghanistan and the Middle East.

Mr. Qureshi called on Mr. Pompeo on January 17 during his two-day visit to the U.S. He is scheduled to meet U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien. On January 16, he met lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol.

“In my meeting today with U.S. Secretary of State @SecPompeo, discussed engagement between Pakistan and U.S., its mutual benefit, along with it being a factor for stability in South Asia. Exchanged how stronger trade & investment is imp for an enduring partnership,” Mr. Qureshi said in a tweet after the meeting.

Mr. Qureshi also expressed his “deep concerns” over the situation in Kashmir and said that “peace in South Asia is elusive until this is resolved in accordance with U.N. resolutions & wishes of Kashmiris.”

Mr. Qureshi, while addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think-tank in Washington on January 16, reiterated Pakistan’s demand that U.S. President Donald Trump should mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories on August 5, evoking strong reactions from Islamabad.

Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue. However, India has maintained that the move was “entirely an internal matter”.

On the Afghan peace process, the two leaders termed it as a “shared responsibility” and spoke about the importance of U.S.-Pakistan cooperation to bring peace in the region.

“The convergence between Pakistan & U.S. stands as a unique opp for peace in Afghanistan, ultimately a shared responsibility,” he said in another tweet.

They also discussed about the latest developments in the Middle East arising out of the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by a U.S. drone strike and the Gulf country reiterating with hitting the U.S. air bases in Iraq.

“Discussed recent developments in ME and reiterated Pakistan will continue to play part for peace in entire region. We are committed to security & stability,” Mr. Qureshi said.

State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that “Iran’s malign activities in the region” and bilateral economic ties were also discussed.

Mr. Pompeo, in a tweet, said they “discussed countering Iranian aggression, the Afghan peace process, trade ties, and regional stability”.

According to the Dawn newspaper, Mr. Qureshi also briefed Mr. Pompeo about discussions held during his recent visits to Iran and Saudi Arabia.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/le2j2/article30593729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-QURESHI-POMPEO-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/regional-stability-situation-in-iran-afghanistan-tops-the-talks-between-qureshi-and-pompeo/article30593730.ece
17,2020/01/18,Sri Lanka lifts ban on drones imposed after Easter attacks,"Sri Lankan authorities have lifted a ban on drones that was imposed after the Easter Sunday attacks that left 263 people dead in the Indian Ocean island nation.

The lifting of the ban comes amid a growing demand for flying drones from media institutions, foreigners, wedding videographers and photographers, and commercial advertising companies.

However, drone operations will continue to be restricted in dangerous and restricted flying zones. All civil drone operators will be required to obtain approval from the Defense Ministry to fly drones, the ministry said on its website on January 18.

The ministry said the ban was lifted on the instructions of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Authorities imposed the ban last May, citing security concerns a month after seven suicide bombers from a local Muslim group, National Thowheed Jammath, blew themselves up at three churches and three luxury hotels in the deadliest violence by Islamic State group-linked militants in South Asia. The attacks wounded about 500 people.

Sri Lankan leaders and the security establishment have been under fire for not acting ahead of the attacks on near-specific intelligence information on possible attacks on churches. Government leaders have acknowledged that some intelligence units were aware of possible attacks weeks before the bombings.

Following the attacks, national police chief Pujith Jayasundara was suspended and former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando resigned. Both were later arrested and are being detained after the presidential commission found grounds to charge them with dereliction of duty and criminal negligence.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o987tt/article30593066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18EASTERSUNDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-lifts-ban-on-drones-imposed-after-easter-attacks/article30593067.ece
18,2020/01/18,Taliban prepared to “scale down” military operations: spokesperson,"The Taliban are aiming to reach a withdrawal agreement with the U.S. by the end of January and are prepared to “scale down” military operations ahead of signing the deal, according to their chief spokesman.

The statement by Suhail Shaheen to Pakistani daily Dawn comes as the group and the U.S. held discussions in Doha this week, after insurgent sources told AFP they had offered to initiate a brief ceasefire.

“We have agreed to scale down military operations in days leading up to the signing of the peace agreement with the United States,” Mr. Shaheen told Dawn in a report published on January 18.

He added that the Taliban were “optimistic” a deal with Washington could be signed before the end of the month and that the reduction in fighting across the country would also include the targeting of Afghan forces.

“It’s now a matter of days,” said the spokesman.

Washington has for weeks been calling on the militants to reduce violence, posing it as a condition for resuming formal negotiations on an agreement that would see U.S. troops begin to leave the country in return for security guarantees, after a near two-decade fight.

The Taliban and the U.S. had been negotiating the deal for a year and were on the brink of an announcement in September 2019 when President Donald Trump abruptly declared the process “dead”, citing Taliban violence.

Talks were later restarted between the two sides in December in Qatar, but were paused again following an attack near the Bagram military base in Afghanistan, which is run by the U.S.

Any agreement with the Taliban is expected to have two main pillars — an American withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a commitment by the insurgents not to offer sanctuary to jihadists — and would ultimately have to be given final approval by Mr. Trump.

The Taliban’s relationship with Al-Qaeda was the main reason cited for the U.S. invasion more than 18 years ago.

A deal would hopefully pave the way for intra-Afghan talks.

Many observers agree that the war can no longer be won militarily, and that the only route to a lasting peace in Afghanistan is for an agreement between the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.

The Taliban have until now refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate regime, raising fears that fighting will continue regardless of any deal ironed out with the Americans.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sh2c0l/article30592991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SUHAILSHAHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-prepared-to-scale-down-military-operations-spokesperson/article30592992.ece
19,2020/01/18,Virus outbreak casts a shadow over China's new year festival,"Health authorities are concerned that a virus originating in central China could spread when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during next week's lunar new year festival.

However, residents said there was little anxiety in the city at the epicentre.

Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online, some people said.

As of Friday, two people in the city of Wuhan had died following an outbreak of pneumonia linked to a new strain of coronavirus that authorities suspect originated in a seafood market.

Wuhan's health authority said on Saturday that a further four people were confirmed to have the virus, bringing the total number of known cases to almost 50.

Two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all people who had travelled from Wuhan recently.

A report published by London's Imperial College said there could be as many as 1,723 infections in Wuhan city alone.

“It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,” said the report.

“Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission should not be ruled out.”

Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Currently the World Health Organisation and Wuhan health authorities have not concluded that the virus can be passed from person to person.

According to official statistics released on Saturday, 763 people who came in contact with victims were identified by authorities, and 98 remain under observation.

The United States and most Asian countries have stepped up screenings of travellers from Wuhan and the WHO has warned hospitals worldwide that a wider outbreak is possible.

In 2002/03, the SARS virus which originated in China killed nearly 800 people worldwide. People in Wuhan who spoke to Reuters said that while many are reviewing travel plans as a precaution, general anxiety over the virus is low.

Businesses are operating normally in the city, which has a population of over 8 million, they said.

More than 400 million Chinese people, mostly migrant workers returning to their home towns, are expected to make 3 billion trips over the new year beginning on January 24.

A person who works for China's official train ticketing service told Reuters on Friday that there were no additional health screening measures or temperature checks in place at Wuhan train stations.

Since Wednesday, people travelling from Wuhan's Tianhe International airport have been subject to temperature tests before boarding flights, according to an official notice.

Two flight attendants staffing separate domestic flights in and out of the city said they had not received additional training or warnings about the virus.

But people who have been affected are worried.

“I look at a public handrail or food or people standing close together and it makes me feel anxious,” said a 33-year-old woman surnamed Peng, who lives roughly one km (a half-mile) from the seafood market where the virus is suspected to have originated and says her elderly aunt was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms late last week.

As the number of new cases continues to rise, locals say authorities are cracking down on people who post online information on the virus or sick relatives.

Earlier this month, State media said eight people had been ”dealt with according to law” in cases related to sharing information about the virus on social media.

Two people told Reuters they had been ordered by police to remove social media posts. They declined to share their names.

Several source said admittance departments at hospitals in Wuhan were unusually busy and many people with flu symptoms were told to return home.

“People are scared,” said Peng. “Most people maybe have a regular flu or cold but where is the person who takes that chance?”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ep54e/article30592814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/virus-casts-a-shadow-over-chinas-new-year-festival/article30592815.ece
20,2020/01/18,Pakistan SC to entertain Musharraf’s plea only after he surrenders to the law: Report,"Pakistan’s Supreme Court has returned the petition of self-exiled former dictator Pervez Musharraf against his conviction and sentencing by a special tribunal with objection that he is not allowed to appeal without surrendering to the law, according to a media report.

On Thursday, the 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, approached the court to challenge the ruling of the special tribunal that had handed him death sentence on charges of high treason.

Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for Mr. Musharraf, submitted the 90-page petition in the top court. In the petition, the former president urged the Supreme Court to declare the special court ruling null and void.

The registrar office of the top court on Friday returned the appeal with the observation that it was settled principle of law that the convict should first surrender before filing appeal, The Express Tribune reported.

The court gave one month time to remove the objection which meant that Musharraf should surrender within one month, otherwise he would lose the right to file appeal, the report said.

The three-member court in its judgment on December 17 found him guilty and handed down the death penalty after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him. He was punished despite not appearing to record his statement.

Musharraf who has been living in Dubai since March 2016 stated in his petition that the former president’s absence from the special court was not intentional as he was unable to appear due to health issue.

He said that the special court had accepted his pleas of ailment but convicted the former president in absentia.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

It is the first time in Pakistan’s history that a former army chief was tried and sentenced under Article 6 of the Constitution.

Separately, the Lahore High Court declared that the formation of the special court was “unconstitutional” and that the treason case against the former President was not prepared in accordance with the law. It let some experts to believe that its verdict had become null and void.

Others, however, assert that the judgment would stay as it was according to the law, though the Court’s formation was declared as against the law.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qxvowp/article30561885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Musharraf,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-sc-to-entertain-musharrafs-plea-only-after-he-surrenders-to-the-law-report/article30592575.ece
21,2020/01/18,"Trump adds legal heavyweights Starr, Dershowitz to defence team in impeachment trial","President Donald Trump turned to some legal heavyweights to help defend him in his Senate impeachment trial with the addition on Friday of former independent counsel Ken Starr, who paved the way for former President Bill Clinton's 1998 impeachment, and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

The team defending the Republican President will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Mr. Trump’s private attorney Jay Sekulow, the White House said.

Mr. Trump’s adviser and former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi and former independent counsel Robert Ray will also be on the team, according to the source familiar with the team's composition.

The White House also said Jane Raskin, one of Mr. Trump's private lawyers, and Eric Herschmann, another former independent counsel, would be on the President's legal team.

The trial in the Republican-led Senate formally got underway on Thursday, though it will start in earnest on Tuesday with opening statements. The trial will determine whether Trump is removed from office.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted on Dec. 18 to impeach Mr. Trump on two charges arising from his dealings with Ukraine - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress - after an investigation that centered on his request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, the president's possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election.

The Senate is expected to acquit him, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two-thirds majority. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.

Mr. Starr is a former federal judge who held a senior Justice Department post under Republican President George H.W. Bush. Starr's voluminous investigative report on Clinton's sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky served as the basis for his impeachment in the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate in 1999 acquitted Clinton, a Democrat. Starr had recommended impeachment on 11 grounds.

In 2016, Mr. Starr was ousted as President of Baylor University, a private Baptist institution in Texas, after an investigation by an outside law firm determined that university leaders had mishandled accusations of sexual assault by football players. Critics of Mr. Starr at the time accused him of turning a blind eye to sexual violence on his campus after pursuing Clinton for a sexual relationship.

Both Mr. Starr and Mr. Dershowitz also served as lawyers for financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell last year where he was being held on new sex trafficking charges.

In 1999, Mr. Trump made unflattering comments about Mr. Starr, saying in an interview on NBC's “Today” show after Clinton's acquittal: “I think Ken Starr's a lunatic.” In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Mr. Trump said, “Starr's a freak. I bet he's got something in his closet.”

'Dream Team'

Mr. Dershowitz has been a well-known figure in U.S. legal circles for decades. He was a long-time Harvard Law School professor and was part of the so-called “Dream Team” of lawyers who won a 1995 acquittal of former National Football League star and actor O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering his wife and a friend of hers. Dershowitz's past clients also have included boxer Mike Tyson and televangelist Jim Bakker.

Both Mr. Starr and Mr. Dershowitz were defenders of Trump in media interviews during the impeachment process. Sources working with the Trump legal team said the president wanted Dershowitz because of his background as a constitutional scholar.

A statement provided by Mr. Dershowitz from Mr. Trump's legal team said he will present oral arguments at the trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal from office.

“While Professor Dershowitz is non-partisan when it comes to the constitution - he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton - he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution,” the statement said.

Ray succeeded Mr. Starr as independent counsel during the Clinton investigation. On the day before Clinton left office, Ray announced that he would not criminally prosecute him in connection with perjury and obstruction.

One person who was not added to the team that will defend Mr. Trump at the trial is his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who played a key role in the Ukraine matter.

Democrat Adam Schiff heads a team of seven House members who will serve as prosecutors. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles.

Still to be determined is whether the Senate will allow witness testimony and new evidence or whether senators will decide the case as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has suggested using only the material amassed by House investigators.

Mr. Trump involved the national collegiate champion Louisiana State University football team in the impeachment drama during its celebratory visit to the White House.

“A lot of presidents, some good, some not so good,” Trump told the team. “But you've got a good one now, even though they're trying to impeach the son of a bitch. Can you believe that?” Citing themes he has raised in his bid to win re-election on Nov. 3, Trump then touted the economy and the U.S. military, adding, “We took out those terrorists like your football team would have taken out those terrorists, right?”

A pivotal event in the Ukraine matter was Mr. Trump's firing of Marie Yovanovitch last year as U.S. ambassador in Kiev, a move encouraged by Mr. Giuliani, who was pressing Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke his silence on Friday on documents released this week that suggested that Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate, was involved in monitoring Yovanovitch's movements before Trump removed her, raising questions about her security.

“We will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,” Pompeo, who refused to cooperate in the House impeachment inquiry, told conservative radio host Tony Katz.

“I suspect that much of what's been reported will ultimately prove wrong, but our obligation, my obligation as secretary of state, is to make sure that we evaluate, investigate,” Mr. Pompeo said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v6kdf1/article30530951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-adds-legal-heavyweights-starr-dershowitz-to-defence-team-in-impeachment-trial/article30591992.ece
22,2020/01/18,Hundreds likely affected by Chinese virus: researchers,"The number of people infected by a mystery SARS-like virus that has killed two people in China is likely hundreds more than officially reported, researchers have said.

Chinese authorities have said pneumonia linked to the virus has hit at least 41 people in the country, with the outbreak centred around a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan.

But a paper published Friday by scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London said the number of those affected in the city was likely to be well over a thousand.

The scientists at the Centre, which advises bodies including the World Health Organization, said they estimated a “total of 1,723 cases” in Wuhan would have been infected as of January 12.

The researchers took the number of cases reported outside China so far –– two in Thailand and one in Japan –– to infer how many were likely infected in the city, based on international flight traffic data from Wuhan’s airport.

“For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,” Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the authors of the report, told the BBC.

“I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago,” adding, however, that it was “too early to be alarmist“.

“People should be considering the possibility of substantial human-to-human transmission more seriously than they have so far,” he added, saying it was “unlikely” that animal exposure was the main source of infection.

Two people are known to have been killed by the virus, a pathogen from the same family as the deadly SARS virus –– even as health authorities around the world sought to assure the public that the overall risk of infection remained low.

Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland.

Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, states hit badly by the bushfires that have so far killed 29 people, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and scorched millions of acres of land, are now dealing with rain bucketing down.

Major highways were closed in Queensland early on Saturday, with the state getting some of the heaviest rain Australia has seen for months, while power was cut in parts of New South Wales after a stormy night.

“Heavy, intense rainfall has eased, but showers and thunderstorms still possible through the weekend,” the Bureau of Meteorology in Queensland said on Twitter on Saturday.

“Take care on the roads - if it's flooded, forget it.”

Parts of Queensland's south saw triple the monthly rainfall overnight. No major damage has been reported, although some residential areas were flooded and many of the state's parks and tourist attractions were closed.

New South Wales fire services welcomed the rain, which they said on Twitter would help to control the 75 fires burning in the state, of which 25 are yet to be contained. But, they also said that some firegrounds have not seen any rain yet.

More benign storms were forecast for Victoria, which has been hit this week already by severe storms and unhealthy smoke from the bushfires.

Fears the smoke would return on Saturday for the final round of the Australian Open qualifying matches eased after environmental officials said air quality forecast in the Melbourne area would be “moderate” rather than “very poor”.

There were more than a dozen of fires burning in Victoria on Saturday, but an evacuation order for a fire in the mountain region was lifted.

New Zealand Defence Force said on Friday it was sending more reinforcements to Australia, including from Fiji, to join contingents and specialists sent also by other countries, such as Japan and the United States.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/azfbex/article30582699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17REUAUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/floods-road-closures-in-australia-as-storms-lash-some-bushfire-hit-regions/article30591873.ece

The deaths follow weeks of calm.

Riot police fired tear gas and hurled sound bombs to disperse crowds on the strategic Sinak Bridge after protesters attempted to breach cement barriers previously erected by security forces, causing the casualties, activists and medical and security officials said.

Two protesters were killed and at least 20 wounded, three activists and a security official said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Protesters are demanding sweeping reforms, new leadership and snap elections.

Friday’s violence breaks a period of calm after tensions soared between Tehran and Washington following a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general. Both countries showed signs of de-escalation after Iran retaliated by attacking two military Iraqi bases hosting American troops without causing fatalities.

In an effort to bring back focus to the goals of the protest movement, anti-government protesters in the southern city of Nasiriyah gave the government a week’s deadline to take serious steps to implement changes. The deadline runs out early next week.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9d294/article30591815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/officials-activists-say-2-iraqi-protesters-killed-in-baghdad/article30591791.ece
25,2020/01/18,U.S. Supreme Court takes up presidential Electoral College dispute,"As the 2020 presidential race heats up, the Supreme Court agreed on January 17 to hear a dispute involving the complex U.S. presidential election system focusing on whether Electoral College electors are free to break their pledges to back the candidate who wins their state's popular vote, an act that could upend an election.

The Supreme Court will take up appeals in two cases - from Washington state and Colorado - involving electors who decided to vote in the Electoral College process for someone other than Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she won the popular vote in their States.

The justices will determine if such so-called faithless electors have the discretion to cast Electoral College votes as they see fit or whether states can impose restrictions including with penalties. The case is expected to be argued in April and decided by the end of June.

President Donald Trump is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, with a field of Democrats seeking their party's nomination to challenge him. His administration did not take a side in either case.

“We are glad the Supreme Court has recognized the paramount importance of clearly determining the rules of the road for presidential electors for the upcoming election and all future elections,” said Lawrence Lessig, a lawyer for the faithless electors sanctioned in Washington and Colorado.

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said she hopes the justices will let states enforce their laws.

“Unelected and unaccountable presidential electors should not be allowed to decide the presidential election without regard to voters' choices and state law,” Griswold said.

The dispute involves the U.S. presidential election system set out in the U.S. Constitution in which the winner is determined not by amassing a majority of the national popular vote but by securing a majority of the electoral votes that are allotted to the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Individuals who serve as Electoral College electors - typically party loyalists - cast these votes. All states, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, have a winner-takes-all system awarding all electors to the presidential candidate who wins the state's popular vote.

The number of electors in each state is the sum of its two U.S. senators and its number of members in the House of Representatives, based on population size. The District of Columbia, which is not a state, is allotted three electors.

Typically an overlooked formality, the Electoral College took on greater importance after the 2016 election, when 10 electors cast ballots for someone other than their party's candidate. That was an unusually high number of faithless electors and could have changed the outcome in five of the 58 prior U.S. presidential elections, according to legal papers in one of the appeals filed at the Supreme Court.

LOSING THE POPULAR VOTE

Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by a margin of 304 to 227 Electoral College votes despite losing the popular vote nationally by about 3 million votes. Faithless electors could change the outcome of presidential elections with thinner Electoral College margins.

Electors pledge to vote for their party's candidate if that person wins the state's popular vote. At issue in the cases are laws requiring that electors follow through on those pledges.

While 32 states and the District of Columbia have such laws, a handful enforce them by removing and replacing faithless electors, or in some cases, imposing fines.

The plaintiffs challenged the sanctions, saying they were deprived of their rights under the Constitution's Article II as well as its 12th Amendment, which spell out the Electoral College process.

In Colorado, one elector, Micheal Baca, was replaced and his vote canceled when he sought to vote for Republican John Kasich, Ohio's former governor. A federal judge dismissed Baca's challenge, but the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year revived the suit, concluding that Baca's constitutional rights were violated.

The Washington state case arose after three faithless electors voted for former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, a moderate Republican, instead of Clinton. They each were fined $1,000 for their defiance, which they called the first such penalty in U.S. history. The Washington Supreme Court in 2019 upheld the fines.

26,2020/01/18,"Jury of 7 men, 5 women selected for Weinstein rape trial","A jury of seven men and five women was selected on January 17 for Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial after an arduous, two-week process in which scores of people were dismissed because they had already made up their minds about the disgraced Hollywood mogul.

Opening statements are expected on January 22 in the case against the 67-year-old executive who has come to be seen as the archvillain of the #MeToo era.

The once powerful and feared studio boss behind such Oscar winners as “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love” is charged with raping a woman in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing a sex act on another at his apartment in 2006. He has said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could get life in prison.

During jury selection, prosecutors accused Weinstein’s lawyers of systematically trying to keep young women off the panel, though the final gender makeup of the jury turned out to be more closely balanced.

For its part, the defense raised an outcry and demanded a mistrial because one of the jurors is the author of an upcoming novel involving young women dealing with predatory older men. The request was denied, but Weinstein’s lawyers continued to claim outside court that the juror had withheld the information on her questionnaire.

""We got the best jury we could get under the circumstances,” defense attorney Donna Rotunno told reporters. “I’m obviously not happy with what happened in the end there. I think that was an absolutely ridiculous decision.”

The defense said it wasn’t specifically trying to exclude young women but didn’t want jurors too young to understand the way men and women interacted in the early 1990s.

""That was a different time in New York and on planet Earth,” said another Weinstein attorney, Arthur Aidala,

A stooped Weinstein, shuffling out of the courthouse with the use of a walker because of recent back surgery, had no comment when asked his thoughts on jury selection. “Ask Donna!” he said, referring to Rotunno.

Three alternates - one man and two women - were also seated and will sit through the trial and take the place of any jurors who can’t make it through to deliberations.

On Day One of jury selection last week, one-third of the first 120 prospective jurors were promptly sent home after Judge James Burke asked if there was anyone who could not be impartial and about 40 hands went up. Each day for nearly a week afterward, dozens of people raised their hands whenever the question was asked of a new batch of potential jurors.

Of the more than 600 people summoned for the case, some marked themselves for disqualification by admitting they knew one of Weinstein’s many accusers, had personal experience with sexual abuse or read “Catch and Kill,” a book by Ronan Farrow, one of the first reporters to expose the allegations against Weinstein.

Weinstein’s lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that heavy publicity has turned the case into a “carnival” and that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can’t possibly give their client a fair trial. The request is now before a state appeals court.

Cognizant of the media attention and the weight some people are attaching to the case, the judge cautioned potential jurors- “This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement.”

Supermodel Gigi Hadid was summoned for jury duty and briefly remained in the running even though she said she had met the defendant. A man whose wife starred on a show that Weinstein’s studio produced said he couldn’t be impartial. A woman said she couldn’t be impartial because she has a “close friend who had an encounter with the defendant in his hotel room.”

Another man was scratched for saying he couldn’t be fair-minded because he had often spotted Weinstein in Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood. “On several occasions I’ve seen him on the phone screaming at someone,” he said.

There was at least one instance of what jury consultants call “stealth jurors” - people eager to serve, especially on a high-profile case, because they hope to make a point or a profit.

On January 16, the judge threatened to hold a potential juror in contempt of court for asking his followers on Twitter “how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gv8bpt/article30590262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WEINSTEIN-THNAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jury-of-7-men-5-women-selected-for-weinstein-rape-trial/article30590263.ece
27,2020/01/18,"Conor McGregor: ‘I’m grateful to be back, UFC 246 will end in a KO!’","UFC superstar Conor ‘The Notorious’ McGregor will face Donald Cerrone in the main event of UFC 246 this weekend in Las Vegas, in a much-hyped bout that fans across the globe are waiting to see. This will be the comeback of McGregor, who returns to the Octagon for the first time since he took on and lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov (current Lightweight Champion) back in October 2018 at UFC 229.

The 38-year-old McGregor (21-4-0) is the headliner for the main event against 36-year-old Donald ‘Cowboy’ Cerrone (36-13-0, 1 no contest). After suddenly retiring in March, McGregor, who is an UFC former lightweight and featherweight champion, will be hoping to reclaim his former glory against Cerrone (UFC’s all-time leader with 23 wins) in a welterweight fight.

McGregor is known for his controversial pre-match hustle, raising the stakes and promoting his MMA matches to the brim — and true to form — has stated that the bout will end in a knockout. Ahead of his return to fighting, the Irishman talks to The Hindu on how he’s prepared for the main event, his fitness routine leading upto his comeback, and if the break has changed him. Excerpts:

You’re returning to the ring after more than a year-long layoff: how important has it been to mentally prepare for this?

I am very grateful and honored to be back on US soil and fighting for this wonderful organisation. I am so glad that I get to return to Las Vegas; this is the place I have many wonderful memories and fights. I am a fighter and an entertainer, and the thought of entertaining these wonderful people is something which makes me wake up in the morning.

It’s been challenging to prepare for this, but it irritated me the way narratives were spread and words were twisted, and I just had to disengage. When I commit to a game, it can happen and I will laugh it off. But I saw it went on and on and I reacted... I reacted to disrespect, but now no more. I am just focused on myself my inner thoughts and that’s where I am. 2019 was a learning period: a year of figuring out myself and my situation. 2020 will be the year of perfect vision.

Has the break changed your perspective towards fighting?

I haven’t changed too much to be honest. I am who I have always been. I have been granted different opponents in different circumstances but I am in a position right now where I am just excited to be here and very eager to perform for the fight this weekend against a solid opponent who is a veteran in the game. I am just more committed and focused than what I used to be but change…. nah!

Donald and I have had a history and that’s an exciting. I have fought with him so many times, and both of us look forward to it going to be a good night. I can beat him at any weight, and I feel good at 170!

What do you think of your opponent? And what does ‘Mystic Mac’ predict for the UFC 246 main-event?

I have had a fair share of back-and-forth with Donald over the years but the last time we spoke together, so much has changed since then. I was the Interim Featherweight champion back then and Donald predicted that I won’t get through, but I got through Jose Aldo. Then he predicted that I was too small for the 155 pounds division, but I conquered that division as well! As time has gone on, he has become a family man and we have seen him compete so many times that it’s hard to not respect a man like Donald. He has my respect. Although there will be blood spilled on the weekend, it won’t be bad blood spilled. And as for the Mystic Mac prediction, IT WILL BE A KO!

What’s the next goal for you in your career after the Cerrone match?

I am in a good spot here. I am ready to fight as I am setting out for big goals in 2020. I am going to kick-start UFC 2020 year big and I intend to continue it. It’s going to be a mega year at UFC and at McGregor Sports and Entertainment. I have many exciting things in the pipeline and its damn good to be back… damn good.

Recent photos of you show that your fitness levels have gone up — has your routine evolved in any way during the time off?

Fight week, cutting that weight is a very tough experience. I’ve gone through it all throughout the years. Five days before the fight I used to just have one chicken fillet, with a scoop of almond butter on it, three times a day leading up to the fight. And eight litres of water. Obviously, now I have brought on nutritionists and the diet plan is more structured. My last fight, there were a few miscalculations and it caused the weight cut to be very, very intense and extreme. Currently; just fats, protein, carbohydrates and just trying to keep my nutrients up while also bringing the weight down. I’m after learning an awful lot and watching an awful lot of videos on wrestling in the last year and working on punches as well.

My footwork, my skill sets are all coming back to where they were. I am enjoying myself on this return. I feel good, I feel energetic, I feel fast, and precise.

What has been the toughest fight you’ve ever been in during your professional career?

Each fighter is different in its own way. Each fight requires different preparations and different version of me.

28,2020/01/18,Hank Azaria will no longer voice Apu on 'The Simpsons',"Actor Hank Azaria has said that he will no longer be voicing Apu Nahasapeemapetilon on The Simpsons in the wake of a controversy over the character’s portrayal in the show.

The long-running animated series came under intense scrutiny in recent years after Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu highlighted the stereotypical depiction of Indian immigrants in Hollywood.

Talking to Slash Film, Azaria said he has decided to part ways with the character.

“I won’t be doing the voice any more, unless there’s some way to transition it or something... What they’re going to do with the character is their call.”

“It’s up to them and they haven’t sorted it out yet. All we’ve agreed on is I won’t do the voice any more,” the 55-year-old actor said.

Last year, The Simpsons had addressed the criticism over Apu’s characterisation in the episode No Good Read Goes Unpunished. However, the show failed to pacify the viewers and was slammed on social media for its tone-deaf response to the controversy.

Later, Azaria also opened up about the controversy during his appearance on the The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The actor said he is willing to step aside from the part as it would be the right thing to do.

“I think the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it. I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers room including how (Apu) is voiced or not voiced. I’m perfectly willing to step aside. It just feels like the right thing to do to me,” he had said.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/nhed86/article30592824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SIMPSONS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hank-azaria-will-no-longer-voice-apu-on-the-simpsons/article30592825.ece
29,2020/01/18,Why Odisha is a State without a stereotype,"Language — specifically, accents — and food are perhaps the two easiest ways to stereotype a people. We’ve all heard jokes about Biharis, Punjabis and ‘South Indians’. Now, think Odia. Nothing. How did 4.6 crore Odias manage to slip under everyone’s radar for so long?

For most of my life, whenever I have declared to a stranger that I am an Odia, the response has been a thoughtful ‘hmm’. I can see their faces scanning a mental database for jokes or a major point of reference — and coming up with nothing.

However, that was not always the case. When I landed in a Delhi University hostel back in 2001, I was frequently asked if I wanted mango kernels for lunch.

Hunger deaths from eating untreated mango kernels had occurred recently and it was all over the news. I learned only recently that mango kernel was regular food for some tribes in north Odisha. They are split open, left in a running stream for two or three days to get rid of excess alkaline, and then dried and pounded into flour. But if not treated properly, they can be poisonous. I didn’t know that then.

Plumbing capital

Since then, it has been a relatively silent one-and-a-half decades. Only Bengalis knew enough to taunt you about being a cook or plumber. In fact, while I was dating a Bengali, who is now my wife, she joked that Odia men always had unfettered access to Bengali households because of those occupations. I come from a region that has been called the ‘plumbing capital of India’ — Kendrapara. Even though the epithet is an understatement, and Odia plumbers dominate Southeast Asia and West Asia as well, the information is not very well known and the joke has not caught on.

As for language, though I do a reasonable parody of Odia Hindi and English via my ‘Professor Mahapatra’ act, popular culture is yet to mock us. The standup comic, Biswa Kalyan Rath, tried to turn us into laugh-worthy jokes but it didn’t catch on.

In my eight years of writing about food, I have come across two Odia food festivals in starred hotels. One, by a very famous chef, who served an ‘Odia biryani’ — Odisha has none. The other was put together by a Bengali lady. And the manager of one of the first dedicated Odia restaurants in Delhi now runs a catering service for Bengali food.

Most people from other States have serious misgivings about food from the Northeast. When it comes to Odia food, even less is known. Beyond the rasagulla, about which there is a border skirmish on, few can identify any other dish.

Coast is all

For a State whose population is close to a quarter tribal, Odias themselves need to learn what’s Odia and what’s not.

Food and language differ so dramatically in the four corners of the State that everyone has taken the convenient stand that coastal Odisha is all that is Odia.

In all this obscurity, one thing most outsiders agree upon is that Odia men make great husbands. Most of them can cook, they are good handymen, they seem meek, and if there is any toxic masculinity, it is still a secret. Odisha Tourism came up with a new tagline last year — India’s best kept secret. And that is so true I wonder if it applies to Odia men too.

30,2020/01/18,It has to be x-ray vision,"American expert Marshall Lewis was South in today’s deal. His threespade bid was not covered by a partnership agreement, but he was trying to show a good hand with a long suit. North got the message, but the game contract is dicey with three top losers and a trump problem.

West’s king of diamonds lead asked for a count signal from partner, by agreement. East played a low diamond to show an odd number, and West continued with the queen — a revealing play. West shifted to the jack of hearts at trick three and Lewis won in hand with the ace to lead the king of clubs. West won with his ace and led another heart, won in dummy with the king.

Backing his judgment with his play, Lewis led a spade to dummy’s king and then ran the jack of spades when East played low! This successfully pinned the 10 of spades in the West hand.

31,2020/01/18,Web of resistance: the online machinery behind the street protests,"At first, the memes came into sharp focus at the pan-India protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the interlinked but supposedly not interlinked NRC, around a month ago. It was a sign that the privileged millennials and Gen Z-ers were showing up en masse, and bringing their Internet A-game. “Modi, what is this behaviour?” asked one poster, a reference to the preposterous Bigg Boss clip that became an Internet sensation a while ago.

“It’s so bad, even the cynics are here,” declared another catchphrase-turned-meme. Soon, that line mutated into all sorts of shapes and forms online (specific news channels, Bollywood stars, passive uncles, parents, IITs), the most recent of which went: “It’s so bad that even [the famously, or notoriously, apolitical college] St. Stephen’s is here.”

At first, the memes were just a temporary and welcome respite from the heaviness of the situation, but not much more. Not long after, though, I noticed something more substantial going on. The revolution, any revolution, can only ever happen on the streets, our own independence struggle being a glorious example. There are lakhs of people today who, at great personal risk, are willing to go out and voice their dissent. They’re leading the resistance. But behind them lies an entire machinery enabling, supporting, encouraging, mobilising, amplifying. And it’s all happening, drip by drip, on the Internet.

People against the Act aren’t just sitting and moaning. Instead, they’re contributing. They’re reclaiming patriotism, which has for so long been harboured by the jingoist. The Constitution, the national flag, and the national anthem, for instance. The flag had been co-opted for the past several years by supporters of the current government on Twitter, as they’d add a small emoji of it to their profile names to signal their allegiances. Today, people on both sides of the political divide have staked ownership to the national flag, both sides have it in their display names — tokenistic, perhaps, but a reminder that the tricolour belongs to us all.

Cumulative effect

Every morning, a notice detailing the time, venue, and nature of protests happening across India circulates on Instagram and Twitter for users to seek and spread. Just about anyone who attends makes it a point to post a photo of it on those platforms, preferably with a caption. This might seem like an empty gesture, but it has a cumulative effect.

I know plenty of people who are scared to go (a problem I fully understand because it is intimidating when you read reports of detentions and lathi charges). But every photo, every update posted by People Like Them pushes them a step closer to showing up in solidarity. FOMO, the fear of missing out, is in itself a great motivator.

And you have good samaritans offering to babysit first-time protesters or anyone going alone, or just handing out useful advice — from what to carry with you to how to deal with a police detention. It’s reached a point where even Facebook has sparked to life. People are returning to Facebook, posting diatribes, personal stories and anecdotes, their opinions, hoping to reach out to the silent fence-sitters.

Another recent trend is WhatsApp-wapsi. Thanks to manufactured forwards about imaginary events and aggressive family members, WhatsApp has become a cesspool of hate and bigotry. Young people have, in the past, made a big show of quitting their family groups with a highfalutin goodbye message, which they then post on their social media.

Today, the reverse is happening. They’re rejoining conversations with chachas and mamas, and posting detailed, fact-checked comebacks to them, with screenshots of it on their social media, which in turn empowers others to do the same.

Fighting disinformation

Fact-checking individuals and websites, AltNews primary among them, are helping fight disinformation through meticulous investigations of every casual or malicious rumour that pops up. As when the phone number circulated by BJP for people to register support for CAA morphed into a sex hotline, free Netflix account number (a rumour Netflix itself had to debunk), massage parlour number and more, getting it some well-earned ridicule.

Songs are being written, art created, poetry shared — anyone who can contribute in whatever way is doing it,even if it means having an exhausting conversation with the extended family.

On a more practical level, updates are posted and amplified on social media. Citizen videos have helped bring to light many details that could easily have been suppressed otherwise. SOS calls are routinely made by people to lawyers and doctors in case of medical emergencies or police detentions. Venue changes, police permissions, curfew impositions, all this information is accessible to anyone (as long as there’s Internet). Whether this effects any meaningful change remains uncertain, but hope, as ever, springs eternal — it’s a much-needed reminder that every voice matters, and long may it continue.

32,2020/01/18,Where the pigeons home: The chabutros of Ahmedabad,"If you ever drive through Gujarat, you will not miss the tall tower-like structures buzzing with birds — largely pigeons, but also sparrows and parakeets. You find them at the entrance to almost every cluster of homes, or pol; and they are adorned with intricate jaali work. These are bird feeders or bird shelters — chabutros as they are called here — and are an intrinsic part of Gujarat’s culture and architectural heritage, something that reflects a generous tradition of co-existence between man and nature.

The saint and the grocer

One of the earliest examples of bird-shelters on buildings and cave walls is at the rock-cut stepwell at Uparkot, the Junagadh fort. “It is believed to date back to the 2nd century B.C. caves there,” says Ashish Trambadia, director of the World Heritage City Trust, Ahmedabad. The walled city of Ahmedebad has at least 120 chabutros, many of which have now been restored. Some of the most striking ones, with the most exquisite designs, are carved in wood.

The Karanj chabutro — one of the oldest in Ahmedabad— is one such. The story goes that about 140 years ago, a saint was travelling from Dakor to Dwarka, when he felt very thirsty. He stopped at Karanj (near Ahmedabad), near the

Bhadra Fort gate. The saint noticed that there were very few trees around, and wished there was a chabutro where birds would come, feed, and rest. A local grocer, Bapalal Modi, heard the saint and decided to build a chabutro before the saint returned. The Karanj Chabutro is a wooden structure with copper cladding at the top, and it was restored not too long ago. The whole structure is intricately designed, making it an exquisite piece of heritage.

Unused wood

But why wood? According to Trambadia, this was a time when towns in central Gujarat were the centre for wood imports. “Ahmedabad was known for its expertise in timber roofing joinery. It had the tradition of building many timber temples,” says Trambadia. “The timber work left behind several logs of unused wood that could be used for smaller structures. These became apt for bird shelters.” Timber also did not heat up fast — an important factor, considering the harsh summers in this area.

Shared responsibility

The design is simple — a central post and projecting brackets to support a platform. Several things were factored in while planning the chabutro. “It had to be a wide canopied platform that was high enough for the birds to be safe from predators like cats and dogs, but accessible enough for people to fill it with grain,” says Trambadia.

Ahmedabad-based author and artist Esther David says that the chabutro’s height was planned such that birds of every size could access it with ease. “So even a peacock’s long train of feathers can hang out easily,” she says.

A number of old chabutros were also made of stone. These single-column, top-heavy structures with intricate work are architecturally impressive — and challenging to restore. David connects these structures with the Jain concept of jeev daya, the belief that every life is sacred and should be nurtured.

Recalling the chabutro in her own ‘haveli-style’ home in the old city, the septuagenarian author says that it was built on the terrace of the house and surfaced with mosaic tiles. The old city, she adds, had many such chabutros. Over time, they moved from the backyards or terraces of mansions to the centre of a neighbourhood. This also signified a shared responsibility.

Special place

“Chabutros were hardly meant to be just an iconic element of a building,” says Trambadia. “It was always a binding factor for a neighbourhood.” As a concept, bird-feeders are extremely relevant today, as many species become endangered in the face of urbanisation. In the U.K., research by the British Trust for Ornithology has found how garden feeders have helped the numbers of many bird species to be revived. In the Indian context, entomologist Bertrand Horne of the Corbett Foundation says that although bird-feeders do not necessarily help increase diversity, they do help increase the populations of birds — “particularly of sparrows and muniyas.”

In today’s growing concrete jungles, chabutros have a special place. Happily, in Ahmedabad, the municipal corporation has restored more than 20 old chabutros even as newer ones continue to be built — near roads, at junctions, in neighbourhoods — a sign that the belief in the coexistence of man and fauna still holds strong here.

33,2020/01/18,Keep calm and carry on: The neutral Indian journalist,"If your biological survival depended on news consumption instead of food consumption, most Indians would be happily dead by now, lying in a hammock somewhere in Prime Time heaven, listening to Muttagoswami in an infinite loop in a sound-proof auditorium constructed by Poda-Ni Enterprises. I wouldn’t blame them though, for electing to die. Their choices were limited, and unleashed on them with unequal power.

True, they could have restricted themselves to the handful of brave journalists who continue to behave as if the spine is not a vestigial but an integral part of the human body. But all said and done, it is the invertebrates who are the loudest, and the largest in number. Regular readers of my column would know that I belong to neither of these categories.

Not taking sides

Not only am I one of India’s few surviving neutral journalists, I am also its most neutral, neutral journalist. In fact, I can’t think of any other journalist in India, Asia, earth, solar system or galaxy who doesn’t take sides as scrupulously as I don’t. I am so neutral that I don’t even take sides between neutrality and non-neutrality. I am constantly shocked by how some of India’s most celebrated journalists dare to claim that they are ‘neutral’ and ‘objective’ when they clearly lack the courage to openly not take sides. So while they pretend to not take sides, they indirectly end up taking one side, and further eroding the zero percent credibility of Indian media.

Take, for example, the media coverage of the JNU violence. Ideally, no journalist should have any business taking sides. And yet, quite a few were openly siding with facts and against lies. I ask you: is that neutral journalism? Some journalists went so far as to take the side of a girl who had been badly beaten up, and were speaking against the poor faceless men who had beaten her. Some were openly ranting against the police for just standing by while masked goons ran riot. Can you beat that?!

It’s a trap

If the police act, you have a problem — you complain that they are doing brutality, doing encounter killing, doing torture and what not. So, to make you happy, this time in JNU, the police consciously chose to do nothing. And again you have a problem?! And this time you accuse them of — wait for this — doing nothing! Clearly, in the eyes of these neutrally biased journalists, the police can do nothing right — damned if they lathi-charge and damned if they don’t lathi-charge. If this is the level of anti-police bias even among India’s self-proclaimed neutral journalists, one shudders to think what our cops are up against with the non-neutral ones.

A small piece of advice to all Indian journalists: instead of rushing to attack the police, please take lessons from them on what is real neutrality. If the police at JNU could stay neutral between masked goons and unarmed girl students, is it too much to expect Indian journalists to stay neutral between fact and fiction, truth and propaganda, official lies and actual reality? Or, for that matter, between fascism and anti-fascism?

Today, when the streets of Indian cities are echoing with the cries of ‘Azaadi’ and ‘Inquilab zindaabad’, it takes a great deal of journalistic discipline not to get carried away. Sadly, not many succeed, for it is easy to fall into the trap of sympathising with the hundreds of thousands taking part in protest marches and singing ‘Hum kagaz nahin dikhayenge’.

Indeed, it is all too easy, when there is a great leader on one side, and the Indian Constitution on the other, to give in to the temptation of siding with the Indian Constitution. Only the truly, utterly and absolutely ultra-super-hyper-neutral journalist would have the guts to resist that temptation, for he would remember what lesser mortals tend to forget: the Indian Constitution itself is not a neutral document.

You see?

It is, in fact, one of the most one-sided and biased texts humanity has ever produced. It is heavily biased in favour of pluralism and against Hindutva; it supports democracy and opposes dictatorship, even a benevolent one; it is biased in favour of equality and opposes giving or withholding anything, including citizenship, on the basis of religion; and lastly, it supports the right to peaceful dissent and discourages the practice of getting the police to bash up students for demanding lower fees.

So you see what I mean? Indian journalism today faces a grave responsibility — of staying neutral between the anti-nationals who want to force the Indian Constitution on the Indian state, and those who want to give every Indian the opportunity to be robbed of their citizenship rights so that they can experience the true freedom that comes only with slavery. If we can’t be neutral now, then when?

34,2020/01/18,Row breaks out over Sai Baba’s birthplace,"The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust has said the temple dedicated to 19th-century saint Sai Baba in Shirdi, Maharashtra, will remain open despite a call for an indefinite bandh from January 19 by a section of local citizens.

The temple town is in the news following objections raised by the local citizens against a reported statement by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Pathri village in Parbhani was Sai Baba’s actual birthplace.

Open for darshan

“On behalf of the trust, I would like to inform devotees that despite the call for bandh from local citizens, the temple will be open for darshan. Even accommodation and other facilities will remain open,” said chairman of the Saibaba Sansthan Trust Shirdi, Suresh Haware.

Deepak Muglikar, chief executive officer of the trust, said the daily aarti and rituals would continue even on January 19. “Thereafter the facilities extended from the Sansthan, including Prasadalaya, Bhakt Niwas and hospital would function regularly.”

Earlier this week, the Chief Minister announced a ₹100 crore grant for the development of Pathri to attract pilgrims and tourists.

The BJP has hit back at the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government saying the Chief Minister should immediately withdraw the statement made that is not historically substantiated. Former Minister and senior BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said the claims over Sai Baba’s birthplace had been made in the past as well. But why was the statement being made now with the intention of hurting the sentiments of lakhs of devotees, he wondered.

‘False claims’

Mr. Vikhe-Patil’s son Sujay, BJP MP, said he would go to court to prove the claims were false. “By raking up the issue of Sai Baba’s birthplace again and again the feelings of lakhs of people of Shirdi and devotees the world over are being hurt. Earlier, a former President too had made a similar statement. There is no document available about Sai Baba’s birthplace. Sai Baba himself never shared any information about his birthplace or religion during his stay in Shirdi,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/44sgmf/article30595992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHIRDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/row-breaks-out-over-sai-babas-birthplace/article30595993.ece
35,2020/01/18,Union Ministers begin J&K outreach,"From inaugurating water supply schemes, classrooms and heritage lights, 36 Union Ministers on Saturday started a six-day tour to attend outreach camps in J&K, the first such visit since the special status of the erstwhile state came to an end more than six months ago on August 5.

The public interface programme has been launched on directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Ministers will “educate locals on benefits of the abrogation of Article 370” and “development schemes for the region”.

The first batch of Ministers arrived in Jammu on Saturday, including Minister of State (MoS) in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh; MoS for Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources Arjun Ram Meghwal and MoS for Health Ashwini Choubey.

Mr. Meghwal, who inaugurated a tubewell and drain protection wall at Birpur in Mandana of Samba, interacted with people and “listened to their development needs”.

“The BJP government does not believe in discrimination on the basis of caste and colour,” Dr. Choubey said.

On dilution of Article 370, Mr. Singh said, “People had to wait for this long because it had to happen under the aegis of a personality like Modi.” He later inaugurated a smart classroom and laid foundation stone of a sports stadium at Gole Gujral, Marh, in Jammu.

Of 36 Union Ministers, 21 will tour Jammu and over five will visit the Kashmir valley up to January 24.

Those likely to visit Kashmir include Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, MoS Home G. Krishan Reddy, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports Kiren Rijiju, and Minister Social Justice Tawar Chand Gehlot

Mr. Naqvi will lay the foundation stone of a high school at Srinagar's Dara area and a beautification work of a water conservation at Harwan. Several ministers, including Mr. Prasad, will hold public darbar in Srinagar and north Kashmir.

The outreach programme will also take stock of 55 beneficiary-oriented schemes, rapid infrastructure development including implementation of Prime Minister’s Development Programme (PMDP).

A central control room has been established to ensure seamless coordination, an official said.

Chief of the J&K National Panthers Party Harshdev Singh said, “The visit is nothing but a publicity stunt.”

Earlier, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said the BJP can’t change J&K situation by “air dropping ministers”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c4y4kb/article30597211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jitendra-Singhjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ministers-begin-outreach-in-jk/article30595802.ece
36,2020/01/18,All parties must come together to oppose Citizenship Amendment Act : Chidambaram,"Dubbing the National Population Register (NPR) as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) “in disguise” Congress leader and former Union minister P. Chidambaram on Saturday urged all parties opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC to come together as they should not miss larger picture, that of saving the Constitution.

“For the sake of the country, all parties which are opposing the CAA and NPR should come together…What is at stake are far more important issues. In Bengal or another State there can be domestic factors or intrastate factors, but one shouldn’t miss the larger picture,” the Congress Working Committee member said at a press conference here.

“We are fighting to save the Constitution of India, we are fighting to save the enduring values embodied in the constitution,” he added.

Referring to the meeting called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he said representatives of 20 political parties had participated. “Some did not. That doesn’t mean that is the final word. May be there well be another meeting, may be they will attend,” Mr. Chidambaram, said when asked about the absence of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. On whether the Congress would again invite leaders like Ms. Banerjee who stayed away, he said, “If somebody asks my view, I’ll say, of course, we send an invitation.”

On the emergency powers granted on Friday to the Delhi Police Commissioner under the National Security Act (NSA), 1980, for almost three months, Mr Chidambaram said it was a “retrograde provision like the British’s Rowlatt Act”.

“Every day the Government of India, the BJP government, resorts to such repressive measures. It is driving a wedge between the government and people. It is also striking at democracy. This is completely unacceptable, completely unnecessary,” he said. Mr. Chidambaram said the development indicates that the Centre wants to put people in prison without any charges.

On the nationwide anti-CAA protests, Mr. Chidambaram said the movement had become a people’s movement and the Congress wants to stand with the people. “In recent public memory we have not come across any movement where people have risen above caste, religion and State.. This is a unique movement where students union are raising demand for intangible things like liberalism, humanism,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3uz62s/article30595736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-CONGRESS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/all-parties-must-come-together-to-oppose-citizenship-amendment-act-chidambaram/article30595737.ece

He was arrested by the police from Hansol area of the city. He is likely to be produced in court on Monday.

Earlier, during the court proceedings, the prosecution argued that Mr. Patel was breaching the bail condition that mandated his presence in the court for a speedy trial. His lawyer had sought exemption from appearance citing personal reasons. The plea was opposed by the prosecution on the ground that Mr. Patel was trying to delay the trial.

38,2020/01/18,"Swedish tourist found in possession of demonetised notes at Kochi airport, fined over ₹2.5 lakh","An unsuspecting 56-year-old Swedish woman tourist was fined over ₹2.5 lakh after she was found in possession of over ₹50,000 in demonetised currency notes at the Cochin International Airport Limited on Tuesday.

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at the airport, which had beefed up the security and tightened baggage screening ahead of the Republic Day, detected 49 demonetised notes of ₹1,000 and another five notes of ₹500 in the woman’s luggage. The invalid and now illegal currency was later handed over to the Customs authorities.

According to the CISF, the tourist claimed to have “last travelled to India in 2014 and said the currency notes were from that trip. She said she wasn’t aware of demonetisation and neither was she told about it by anyone on arrival.”

The passenger who was due to board a flight to Colombo missed her flight and had to pay the fine at the Angamaly First Class Judicial Magistrate court. She left for the Sri Lankan capital on Saturday.

As per the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, possession of more than 10 pieces of invalidated currency notes by individuals and more than 25 for study, research or numismatics is deemed a criminal offence attracting a minimum fine of ₹10,000 or five times the cash held, whichever is higher.

The Act was passed with the aim of eliminating the possibility of a parallel economy using the demonetised currency notes. The law also stipulates a minimum fine of ₹50,000 for false declarations by those who were abroad during the demonetisation period but were given time to deposit the scrapped notes with the Reserve Bank of India.

Customs authorities, however, said they had very rarely come across instances of possession of demonetised notes at the Kochi airport.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/article19593396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANNEDNOTES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/note-ban-returns-to-trip-swedish-tourist/article30595335.ece
39,2020/01/18,"NSA Ajit Doval, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa discuss economic development, strategic cooperation","National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Saturday met Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Colombo and discussed key bilateral issues including economic development and strategic cooperation.

“A very cordial discussion was held with National Security Advisor of #India, Ajit Doval today. Strengthening of bilateral cooperation on national security, intelligence sharing, maritime security & fostering of regional collaboration, were some of the key points of discussion,” President Rajapaksa said in tweet soon after the meeting. A statement from his office said the two countries discussed strengthening military ties.

The visit, which was not announced in advance, comes as part of the high-level engagement since the November presidential elections that Mr. Gotabaya had won with a huge mandate.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar was in Colombo on the day Mr. Rajapaksa assumed charge. Newly elected President Rajapaksa visited New Delhi on his first state visit abroad late November. More recently, Foreign Relations Minister Dinesh Gunawardena was in India for bilateral meetings. Early February, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is scheduled to visit New Delhi.

The meeting comes less than a week after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit when he pledged that China would stand by Sri Lanka and not allow “outside influences” to ‘interfere’ in its internal matters.

Among the issues discussed by the visiting NSA and President Rajapaksa, who hosted Mr. Doval for lunch following the meeting, was “countering and preventing debt traps”, Colombo-based sources told The Hindu.

In Sri Lanka, “debt trap” is commonly used in references to the outstanding debt to China, borrowed for a host of massive infrastructure projects including the southern Hambantota Port, for which China holds a 99-year lease. According to the Finance Ministry, the external debt stood at $32.6 billion at the end of 2018, of which Chinese loans amount to 12 %.

Prime Minister Rajapaksa had in the past denied being ‘trapped’ in debt to China. He told the Chinese news agency Xinhua in December his government “will never forget” China’s long-standing support. According to a report published by the agency, he said he did not believe that engagement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative amounted to a “debt-trap”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ex2txa/article30595295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200118-WA0008-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/doval-gotabaya-discuss-economic-development-strategic-cooperation/article30595296.ece
40,2020/01/18,More Assam farmers donate paddy for battle against Citizenship Amendment Act,"The auction of paddy for a cause — the legal fight against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) — at Sasoni-Merbil in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh district was deferred on Saturday even as more farmers from other areas joined in the “rice revolution”.

According to the organisers, thousands of protesters turned up for an anti-CAA rally at the local playground as did the merchants and rice mill owners to purchase the paddy sacks stacked in a makeshift shed. The proceeds of the paddy auction were to be used for the legal campaign against the law.

However, the sale had to be put on hold as farmers from neighbouring areas kept arriving with more sacks of paddy.

From 85 villages

Most households of the 85 villages under Sasoni-Merbil had donated four kg of paddy, equivalent to the traditional measure of a doon, toward funding the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) to challenge the CAA in the Supreme Court on January 22.

“By the start of the rally today (Saturday), we collected a total of 645 sacks, each containing 49 kg of paddy. The buyers had also arrived, but some villagers said they had more paddy to spare. More people from villages beyond Sasoni-Merbil said they would like to contribute too,” local leader Rakesh Bora said.

Anjan Neog, leader of the local unit of AASU said the word about the “rice revolution” — started by the villagers of Sasoni-Merbil — spread in the Naharkatiya Assembly constituency within which the area falls under. Villagers from the adjoining Tingkhang Assembly seat also pledged paddy from their fields.

“We decided to let all the paddy sacks be collected for the sale at one go. We expect to sell at the minimum market rate of ₹1,200 per quintal,” Mr Bora said.

AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi, who addressed the anti-CAA rally during the day, said it was touching to see farmers come forward to fight the “injustice meted out by New Delhi” on the people of Assam via an unconstitutional citizenship law.

‘Priceless gesture’

“The villagers symbolically handed over one doon of paddy to us. It does not matter how much paddy is collected and how much they will fetch. What matters is their gesture, which is priceless,” Mr Gogoi told The Hindu.

41,2020/01/18,Opposition slams Nitish govt. over human chain,"Opposition parties in Bihar slammed the Nitish Kumar-led coalition government on Saturday over the potential “huge waste of money” on a human chain to be organised on January 19. The event aims to spread awareness about climate change, prohibition and social ills including dowry and child marriage.

The State government has planned for the world’s longest human chain of 16, 298 kms across all districts from 11:30 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Earlier in 2017 and 2018 also, the State government had organised such human chains and claimed that crores of people had participated.

“This year, too, we’re going to organize a human chain to be spread in over 16,000 kms and with participation of over four crore people…no human chain in the world has been so long,” said R.K. Mahajan, principal secretary of the State Education Department, which has been designated as the nodal department to organise the event.

Though the Department had issued instructions to all District Magistrates to ensure participation of school students and teachers in the proposed human chain, it issued a fresh directive saying “participation of students or teachers are not mandatory” after a group of teachers approached court.

Meanwhile, an Education Department official Vinodanand Jha told journalists that the human chain will be covered with the help of as many as 15 helicopters and professional photographers from Mumbai.

Pvt. firm hired

Sources in the government also told The Hindu that a considerable some of money is being spent to make ensure the event is a “mega success”.

“A private event management firm is said to have been hired from outside the State to organise it successfully and get its place in Guinness Book of World Records,” said a senior official involved in the planning.

When asked how much money has been earmarked, he said, “about ₹200 crore”.

During his Jal, Jeevan, Hariyali (water, life and greenery) campaign on climate change, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has, recently appealed to people to participate in the human chain in large numbers. School students, government officials, Jeevika members, Asha workers, Aanganwadi workers and party workers of NDA are to participate in the human chain. Patna’s historic Gandhi Maidan will be the origin of the chain from where it will move out in four directions.

The government has made elaborate security arrangements , with all District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police asked to maintain vigil; the special branch police have also been put on alert. Movement of heavy vehicles on the notified routes has been banned from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

‘Sheer drama’

However, the Opposition parties have slammed Nitish Kumar government for “huge waste of public money” in organizing human chain. “This is the climax of waste of public money and sheer drama…18 helicopters were not used even in flood relief but now they’re used for the photography of the human chain spending crores,” RJD chief Lalu Prasad said in a series of tweets.

Another senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said, “Its all waste of huge public money for the publicity of Nitish Kumar and nothing else”.

42,2020/01/18,"No State can deny implementation of CAA, says Kapil Sibal","There is no way a State can deny the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) when it is already passed by the Parliament, said Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday. He also said that doing so would be “unconstitutional“.

“If the CAA is passed no State can say ‘I will not implement it’. It is not possible and is unconstitutional. You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution in the Assembly and ask the central government to withdraw it. But constitutionally saying that I won’t implement it is going to be problematic and going to create more difficulties,” said the former Minister of Law and Justice on the third day of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF).

The Kerala government earlier this week moved the Supreme Court against the CAA, seeking to declare it “violative of the principles of equality, freedom and secularism enshrined in the Constitution”.

It was the first State government to challenge the Act and the Kerala Assembly was the first to pass a resolution against the law. Following in the southern State’s footsteps, the Punjab Assembly on Friday passed a resolution demanding to scrap the contentious law.

Several State governments including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra have voiced their disagreement with the CAA as well as National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

The senior lawyer-politician explained what States mean when they say “they won’t implement it” and how they wish to do that.

“...The NRC is based on the NPR, and the NPR is to be implemented by the local registrar. Now the local registrar has to be appointed at the level of the community in which that enumerations is to take place and those have to be the State level officers.”

“So what is being said is that we would not allow a State level officer to cooperate with the Union of India. That is what is being said. Practically if this is possible or not, I am not sure. But constitutionally it would be very difficult for the State government to say that I will not follow a law passed by the Parliament,” he explained.

Describing the ongoing nationwide agitation against the CAA as a battle between “leader” and the “people of India”, the 71-year-old leader said “thank god” it was the “students, poor, and middle-class” of the country that are leading the movement and not any political party.

“... It is making an impact because globally and within the country the people are realising that this is not politics, this is real. These are students, ordinary and poor middle-class people coming out. They are not connected to any political party.”

“People in India are showing their angst, their concerns, their worries about the future of India. Everybody wants development, what has PM Modi done? He has done his own development rather than development of the country,” he added.

Historians such as Ramachandra Guha, William Dalrymple, novelists like Benyamin, Namita Gokhale, Chetan Bhagat and journalists Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai are among the many other writers who will be attending the four-day festival.

Of the 1,336 samples tested, 1,286 were declared of standard quality, 49 “not of standard quality’’ and one spurious.

Of the drugs that ‘failed’, samples were tested in labs in Kolkata, Chennai, Chandigarh, Guwahati and Mumbai. The samples were drawn by CDSCO in Chennai, Ghazaibad, Kolkata, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.

The drugs `failed’ the quality test because of the presence of foreign matter, description, particulate matter, extractable volume & assay, sterility, disintegration, dissolution and others parameters.

“Drugs manufactured by the licensed manufacturers found not of standard quality because of defects arising out of minor variations in quality. Such defects may arise because of inadequate pre-formulation development studies, lack of in-process controls exercised by the manufacturer or unsuitable conditions under which drugs are stored or transported,’’ noted a senior health official.

According to CDSCO, drugs can be found not of standard quality if broken or chipped, have presence of spot/discolouration/uneven coating, cracking of emulsions, clear liquid preparations showing sedimentation, change in colour of the formulation, small variation in net content, weight and formulations failing to respond to the colour test.

“There can be isolated cases of presences of foreign matter, labelling error including nomenclature mistake, Rx, NRx, XRx, Red Line, Schedule H. Caution, colour etc.

The CDSCO has noted that spurious or imitation drug products are formulations manufactured concealing the true identity of the product and made to resemble another drug, especially any popular brand, to deceive the buyer and cash in on the popularity of the original. The product may or may not contain the active ingredients. “Spurious drugs are usually manufactured by unlicensed anti-social elements but sometimes licensed manufacturers may also be involved. The adulterated drugs are those drugs which are found to contain an adulterant/substituted product or contaminated with filth rendering it injurious to health,’’ it added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5frri5/article30504541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-drugs-tablets-pills,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/regulator-flags-49-out-of-1336-drug-samples-as-not-of-standard-quality-and-one-spurious/article30594609.ece

The firing and shelling from across the border started in Mendhar sector of Poonch and Lam in Nowshera sector of Rajouri in the afternoon, prompting befitting retaliating by the Indian Army, he said.

The spokesman said Pakistan resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation in Mendhar sector from 12.30 p.m. to 1.15 p.m., but there was no report of any casualty on the Indian side.

In Lam area of Nowshera, Pakistani troops resorted to small arms firing and mortar shelling around noon, he said, adding the Indian army retaliated befittingly.

46,2020/01/18,India-Pakistan trade freeze hits thousands: report,"At least 9,354 families, roughly 50,000 people, in Punjab and about 900 families in Kashmir have been directly impacted by the shutdown of trade between India and Pakistan across the Wagah-Attari border and the Line of Control (LoC) Salamabad-Chakhan da Bagh routes in 2019, says a report.

The cancellation of MFN (most favoured nation) status to Pakistan and the trade routes’ closure following the February 14 last Pulwama terror attack, as well as Pakistan’s counter-measures, including an airspace ban and suspension of trade relations, have resulted in losses in billions of dollars and hundreds of job days. All these have brought thousands “down to their knees”, according to testimonials from the affected groups comprising traders, custom house agents, truck drivers and helpers, those working at tyre and mechanic stores, local dhabas and motels.

“Better to have killed us in one go than to have finished off our livelihood. After the MFN decision was taken, there were homes where the stove couldn’t be lit for four days,” said 72-year-old Kulwinder Singh Sandhu, Attari Truckers Union chief. He was in tears during the launch on January 16 of the report called “Unilateral Decisions, Bilateral Losses” as he recounted the impact of the events of 2019 on families engaged in the business near the Wagah-Attari border.

Tough message for Pak

Officials said the decisions on trade were meant to be a tough message for Pakistan and would impact Pakistan’s economy even more than India’s.

Former Ambassador to the United States Arun Kumar Singh said, “Even though ties have been much worse in the past like after the Parliament attack, trade had never been touched.""

Mr. Singh, who had handled the Pakistan desk at the Ministry of External Affairs, said: “These unprecedented measures against Pakistan were taken by the government to show its frustration over Pakistan’s continued support to terrorism.”

According to the report, authored by researchers at the Bureau of Research on Industry and Economic Fundamentals (BRIEF), the measures that led to a 200% duty increase on imports from Pakistan at Punjab saw even the relatively meagre bilateral trade of $2.56 billion in 2018-2019 dropping to $547.22 million (April-August 2019) - imports dropping from about $500 million to just $11.45 million. Exports to Pakistan “mainly” go through the sea route (about 80%), while imports, including rock salt, dry dates, cement and gypsum, come largely through the land route in Punjab.

As a result, members of the Attari Truckers Union, who had invested an estimated 350 crore ($49 million) in the business, have lost all hope of recovering their losses.

In Kashmir

Similarly, the closure of LoC trading points in Jammu and Kashmir has put small trade, handicrafts sellers, truckers, labourers, and hotel owners near the LoC in Baramulla and Poonch out of business, said trader Mohammad Iqbal Lone. The losses don’t account for the much larger impact of restrictions on trade and tourism imposed after the August 5 decision on Article 370, which the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry had estimated at approximately Rs 10,000 crore ($1.4 billion) by October 2019.

“We have all just come to zero,” Mr. Lone told the audience of academics, economists, journalists, former diplomats and officials at the launch in Delhi of the report, authored by Afaq Hussain and Nikita Singla.

Cross-LoC trade before the suspension order in April 2019 was about $95 million for the year. In the suspension order, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said trade would be resumed after “putting into place a stricter regulatory regime” in order to block misuse of the route for “weapons, narcotics and currency,” but nine months later, there are no signs of resumption of LoC trade.

“When you put names and faces to these numbers, the picture is clearer,” said Pradeep Sehgal, a trader from Amritsar, who has been engaged in India-Pakistan trade for decades. “Think of the porter who has had to take his children out of school or the weigh-bridge worker whose wedding was called off because his lost his job, and you will realise the real cost,” he added.

Traders from Amritsar said another decision taken by the Centre last year, which had affected local traders, was the move to cancel oil imports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions. According to them, Iran had cut its reciprocal imports of Basmati rice, which has led to a 30% drop in its prices. This had added to the other losses over trade with Pakistan, said Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association Director Ashok Sethi.

The traders and truckers said they hoped the governments at the Centre and in Punjab and Jammu Kashmir would consider compensating them for the losses and finding alternative trading markets internally so that those affected were not put out of business permanently. “Trade can be switched off with one stroke of a pen, but it cannot be switched on again easily if the government wants to in the future as trust takes time,” said Mr. Sehgal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/f1ht88/article30593870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ATTARI-TRADE-AKHILESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-pakistan-trade-shutdown-hits-thousands-report/article30593871.ece
47,2020/01/18,Adityanath’s former aide joins SP; Akhilesh says BJP’s days numbered,"Once seen as the right hand man of Yogi Adityanath, at least till he became the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister three years ago, former chief of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) Sunil Singh on Saturday joined the Samajwadi Party.

Mr. Singh was inducted into the SP in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Some Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders also joined the SP at the party headquarters here.

Mr. Singh along with some others were expelled from the HYV, formed by Adityanath in 2002, on charges of indiscipline in 2017. He had then created a splinter outfit and declared himself as its national president.

Welcoming Mr. Singh and others to the SP fold, Akhilesh Yadav said, “The days of the Adityanath government are numbered and the countdown has already begun.”

He said the BJP government has slapped cases against opposition leaders for protesting against its policies.

“The government is doing injustice from day one and false cases are being lodged for protesting,” said the former chief minister, adding the BJP is only promoting communalism and creating a Hindu-Muslim divide.

Mr. Yadav said he was happy that HYV workers were with the SP now and hoped that they would unmask the real intentions of the BJP.

On the occasion, Mulayam Singh Yadav termed the youth as the future of the SP and said that farmers, youth and traders have to be strengthened to make India a developed country.

Mr. Singh’s shift of loyalty assumes significance as the HYV was founded to promote “Hindutva and nationalism” and went on to play a significant role in shaping Adityanath’s political rise in Uttar Pradesh.

But signs of early strains were noticed when some ambitious HYV members sought to contest the State Assembly polls, a demand rejected by the BJP, triggering massive resentment within the outfit.

Mr. Singh was removed from the HYV in January 2017 ahead of the Assembly elections after he threatened to field HYV candidates against BJP nominees to protest the denial of tickets.

In March, Mr. Adityanath became the chief minister after the BJP’s spectacular performance in the polls. Within a year, the HYV split as the conflict between the duo intensified and Singh formed the Hindu Yuva Vahini (Bharat) along with several other HYV rebels.

Mr. Singh was also slapped with the National Security Act in 2018 and jailed for his alleged involvement in violence at Gorakhpur.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iyemui/article30593777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/akhileshjfif,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/adityanaths-former-aide-joins-sp-akhilesh-says-bjps-days-numbered/article30593772.ece

49,2020/01/18,Former Principal Secretary to PM Nripendra Mishra to head Nehru Memorial Museum and Library,"As part of a full revamp of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library’s executive council, Nripendra Misra, former Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, has been appointed as the new chairperson. This comes at a time when the institution is finalising plans to set up a Museum of Prime Ministers.

In another significant move, former Union Minister M.J. Akbar — who resigned from his position after allegations of rape and sexual harassment by multiple women —— has been removed from his position as vice chairman of the NMML executive council.

According to an order from the Culture Ministry issued last week, the eight-member Council has been reconstituted. The new vice chairperson will be Prasar Bharati chair A. Surya Prakash. Other members include Indian Council for Cultural Relations chairperson Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, journalist and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and Indian Institute of Advanced Study chairperson Kapil Kapoor. Two Culture Ministry bureaucrats and the NMML director will be ex-officio members.

The reconstitution comes after the revamp of the wider NMML Society last November when Congress leaders Karan Singh, Mallikarjun Kharge and Jairam Ramesh were removed. The Congress has been opposed to the proposal for NMML to set up a Museum of Prime Ministers, alleging that it is an attempt to erase and undermine the legacy of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Unemployed persons (12,936) were slightly behind those self-employed (13,149) who took their own lives, while both categories outnumbered the suicide figures of those working in the farming sector — 10,349 — in 2018.

Overall, 1,34,516 suicides were reported in the country during 2018, showing an increase of 3.6% in comparison to 2017. The rate of suicides, which means deaths per one lakh population, also increased by 0.3% during 2018 over 2017, the NCRB stated.

“Housewives accounted for 54.1% of the total female victims (22,937 out of 42,391) and constitute nearly 17.1% of total victims who committed suicides during 2018,” the NRCB said in its report released recently.

“Government servants accounted for 1.3% (1,707) of the total suicide victims as compared to 6.1% (8,246) of total victims from private sector enterprises. Employees from public sector undertakings formed 1.5% (2,022) of the total suicide victims, whereas students and un-employed victims accounted for 7.6% (10,159) and 9.6% (12,936) of total suicides respectively,” it said.

“Self-employed category accounted for 9.8% of total suicide victims (13,149),” it added.

According to the NCRB, 10,349 persons involved in farming sector (consisting of 5,763 farmers or cultivators and 4,586 agricultural labourers) committed suicides during 2018, accounting for 7.7% of total suicides victims.

“Out of 5,763 farmer or cultivator suicides, 5,457 were male and 306 were female during 2018. Out of 4,586 suicides committed by agricultural labourers during 2018, 4,071 were male and 515 were female, the report stated.

Overall, the majority of suicides were reported in Maharashtra (17,972) followed by 13,896 suicides in Tamil Nadu, 13,255 in West Bengal, 11,775 in Madhya Pradesh and 11,561 in Karnataka, accounting for 13.4, 10.3, 9.9, 8.8 and 8.6% of total suicides, respectively, the NRCB said.

51,2020/01/18,SC to hear on January 20 Nirbhaya convict’s plea against dismissal of his juvenility claim,"The Supreme Court will hear on January 20 a plea of a death row convict in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case against a Delhi High Court order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence.

A bench of Justices R. Banumathi, Ashok Bushan and A.S. Bopanna will hear the plea of Pawan Kumar Gupta.

Gupta moved the apex court on Friday challenging the High Court’s order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile in December 2012.

Besides, the convict has sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, which has been scheduled for February 1.

He has challenged the high court’s December 19 order by which had also deprecated the conduct of his advocate for filing forged documents and not appearing in the court.

A Delhi court on Friday issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts —Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan (25) — in the case.

Earlier in the day, President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh. The other three condemned convicts have not yet availed of the constitutional remedy of filing the mercy petitions.

The apex court had on January 14 dismissed the curative petitions of Vinay and Mukesh against their conviction and capital punishment.

The two other convicts — Akshay and Pawan — have not yet filed curative petitions in the top court.

In his appeal filed through advocate A.P. Singh, Pawan has claimed that he was a juvenile at the time of the commission of offence on December 16, 2012.

While dismissing his plea, the HC had noted that Pawan had earlier raised the juvenility claim in his review petition against the death penalty awarded to him in the case before the apex court which had dismissed his plea on July 9 last year.

In his plea before the HC, he had claimed that as per his school certificate his date of birth was October 8, 1996.

Pawan had earlier moved a trial court with a plea claiming to be juvenile at the time of the offence and it was dismissed on December 21 last year.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before she was thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at a hospital in Singapore.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail here.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

“Voice and short messaging service (SMS) facility on all local prepaid SIM cards across J&K shall be restored on Saturday. 2G mobile data services on the post-paid mobiles for accessing whitelisted sites shall be allowed in all 10 districts of Jammu division, besides Kupwara and Bandipora districts of the Kashmir Valley,” Principal Secretary, Planning, and J&K government spokesman, Rohit Kansal, said in Jammu.

The Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) would initiate the process for verification of credentials of prepaid subscribers “as per the norms applicable for post-paid connections,” he said.

However, Internet will remain suspended in Srinagar and seven other districts of the Valley.

Mr. Kansal said the information technology (IT) companies would also be provided with fixed line Net connectivity with the precautions directed by the Home department.

According to a department order issued on Friday, there have been a number of reports on the use of Internet in cross-border terrorism, incitement, rumour-mongering, etc. and also misuse of the prepaid connections by anti-national elements.

The department has invoked Sub-Section (2) of Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 2 of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, and decided to make “only 153 websites whitelist” available to the users. It called the action necessary “in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India” and “for maintaining public order in J&K”.

The 153 websites include limited access to mailing services, banking, education, travel, employment, entertainment, banks, automobile sites and utility sites. However, no news portal is among the list. All the social media platforms are barred from any access, as per the order.

“The overall effort of the government shall be to facilitate and to keep restrictions to the bare minimum based on the ground situation,” said Mr. Kansal.

Jammu struggles for access

The Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Reasi districts of Jammu division, where 2G was restored on January 15, 2020, are struggling to access the listed websites.

He also demanded an apology from Ms. Jaising, who is known for her stand against capital punishment.

In a tweet on Friday, Jaising said while she fully identifies with the pain of Nirbhaya’s mother, she urges her “to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn’t not (did not) want the death penalty for her“.

Nirbhaya’s father said this is a “wrong message.”

“She (Indira Jaising) is a woman herself. She should be ashamed of her comments and apologise to Nirbhaya’s mother,” he told PTI.

“We have been fighting the case for seven years. We are common people and not politicians. Humara dil Sonia Gandhi ji jitna bada nahi hai (We are not as large-hearted as Sonia Gandhi),” he said.

The four convicts are scheduled to be hanged at 6 a.m. on February 1 in the gangrape and murder case.

Ms. Jaising, in a tweet on Friday, said while she fully identifies with the pain of Nirbhaya’s mother, she urges her “to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn’t not (did not) want the death penalty for her.”

“We are with you but against death penalty,” she said.

Nalini Sriharan was sentenced to death in former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case. Her death penalty was commuted to life term after the intervention of his wife Sonia Gandhi, who urged for clemency on account of the fact that Nalini had a young daughter who was born in jail.

'Family's views irrelevant'

However, legal experts say the views of victim’s family on whether to forgive or not the convicts in a criminal offence like the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case have no “legal value” as such offences are against the State.

Senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Vikas Singh said the views of family members of a victim in a criminal case on grant or denial of pardon to convicts cannot be considered in a court of law.

“No. No. They (views of family member ) have no value actually and the courts have to go by the law. The prosecution is always done by the State and that is why it is always the State versus so and so. The criminal offence is always against the State,” Mr. Dwivedi said.

Mr. Dwivedi said moreover “the fact is that the complainant (Nirbhaya’s mother) is not agreeing to Indira Jaising’s view that she should pardon the convicts like Sonia Gandhi.""

Mr. Singh, a former Supreme Court Bar Association President, said, “Such views of the family members have no value. Absolutely no legal value. It cannot be used in any court of law.”

He, however, said the convicts may use the favourable views, if any, in their mercy pleas before the president.

On January 17, a Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts — Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan (25) -- in the Nirbhaya case.

Earlier in the day, President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh.

55,2020/01/18,"U.K. preparing govt-to-govt framework for defence deals, says official","The U.K. government is working on a government-to-government framework for defence deals in future, given India’s preference for such deals, Brig. Gavin Thompson, U.K. Defence Adviser in India, said on Friday.

“We have worked very hard since April last year to get all departments in U.K. to get this mechanism. We are at a point where we can send this proposal to the Indian government,” Brig. Thompson said. The mechanism needed to be agreed by both sides, he stated.

However, unlike the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route of the U.S. government where the government charges a small service charge, Brig. Thompson said there were no overheads built into the contract. “It is a lighter model,” he stated, adding the U.K. presently did not have such a mechanism.

In the last few years, India had concluded multi-billion dollar deals through the inter-governmental route for Rafale jets, S-400 air defence systems and stealth frigates, among others.

During Aero India at Bengaluru last year, the U.K. made a pitch to India for collaboration in the areas of aircraft carriers and development of sixth-generation fighter aircraft technologies.

Thompson said that the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers were 30% of the cost of the U.S. carriers, provided 60% of the sortie rate and required only 25% of the manning compared to U.S. carriers.

57,2020/01/18,JNUTA demands judicial inquiry into JNU violence,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers Association (JNUTA) on January 18 demanded a judicial inquiry into the January 5 violence on the campus. The teachers of JNU cannot cooperate with the “efforts of JNU administration for restoration of normalcy in the campus and resumption of academic activities” because there is no such effort to be seen, it said.

“Restoration of normalcy requires the sacking of this VC and this is the necessary, though not sufficient, condition for teachers to feel secure,” the JNUTA said.

The general body meeting of the teachers’ body reiterated its demand for the removal of the vice chancellor.

The JNUTA also insisted that the Cyclops Security Agency must be held accountable for its “gross failure” on January 5 and be replaced immediately.

They also demanded an urgent thorough review of security arrangements, which must include the participation of teachers, students, staff and residents.

“The GBM makes it clear that no teaching for the winter semester can commence before the academic activities of the Monsoon Semester are completed, and completed in a manner consistent with statutory provisions and the maintenance of academic standards,” the JNUTA said.

Teachers will assert their autonomy in such academic matters and find ways to engage with their students towards the end, it said.

To press for its demands, the JNUTA said the teachers will not commence winter semester classes examination and also refrain from undertaking other regular activities of the semester like preparing timetables organising presentations of research students.

The general body meeting (GBM) will review this decision after two weeks.

The JNUTA said it will continue its pursuit of the objective of initiating an appropriate judicial inquiry into the January 5 incident.

58,2020/01/18,Pakistan condemns CDS Rawat’s remarks on deradicalisation camps in Kashmir,"Pakistan on January 18 condemned the statements of Indian Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat where he suggested deradicalisation camps for radicalised youths in the Kashmir Valley and a concerted effort to tackle terrorism globally.

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue 2020 in New Delhi, Gen. Rawat, in a clear reference to Pakistan, sought diplomatic isolation and blacklisting by anti-terror watchdog FATF of countries sponsoring terrorism.

The Chief of Defence Staff also said girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 years were being radicalised in Kashmir.

Condemning Gen. Rawat’s statements, the Pakistan Foreign Office said, “These remarks are reflective of the extremist mindset and bankrupt thinking that have evidently also permeated the state institutions of India.”

The FO said Gen. Rawat’s remarks on FATF were further proof of India’s repeated attempts to politicise FATF’s technical proceedings.

“Pakistan has consistently sensitised the world community about India’s malicious campaign in this regard.

62,2020/01/18,Infant deaths: A bleak winter for Kota’s children,"When four-month-old Tejas had a constant cough, ran a high fever and experienced shortness of breath in November 2019, his worried parents rushed him to a neighbourhood doctor. Suspecting pneumonia, the doctor advised the parents to hospitalise Tejas immediately. Sanjay and Padma Rawal took the infant to J.K. Lon Mother and Child Hospital, a government-run children’s healthcare centre. With 307 beds, it is the largest hospital in Kota, Rajasthan.

Though Tejas showed some improvement, Rawal, 30, who works at the Krishi Upaj Mandi, the local agricultural marketing hub, was not satisfied. Tejas’ fever had not subsided and Rawal felt that the doctors were not giving him sufficient attention. The family shifted the infant to a private hospital after three days though they knew that in all probability they could ill afford treatment there.

Rawal sold his wife’s jewellery for ₹80,000 to meet the cost of treatment for 10 days. Extensive tests, including a chest X-ray, blood tests and sonography, were conducted. Medicines and injections were given. Tejas was discharged after the doctors assured his parents that he had fully recovered.

However, on December 22, Tejas experienced sudden breathlessness again. Accompanied by his wife and parents, Rawal, who had no money left to take his son to a private hospital again, rushed him once more to J.K. Lon Hospital’s emergency ward. Though the infant was stable on the first day, his condition deteriorated the next day. His stomach swelled up and he was taken to the intensive care unit.

Tejas died of pneumonia on the evening of December 23. A pall of gloom descended on the modest house of the Rawals in the Chhatrapura locality of Kota, where the joint family has been living for two decades. Rawal had already lost his eldest son, Devesh, in 2012, when the child was only one-and-a-half-months old. Rawal has two daughters: one aged six years and the other, four.

In one month, a hundred children

Tejas was among the 10 infants who died in J.K. Lon Hospital on December 23 and 24. News of the children’s deaths and the abysmal state of the government hospital sparked a nationwide furore. The deaths of 100 children in the hospital in December alone followed by more deaths in the first week of 2020 has brought a renewed focus on the country’s maternal and child health care system.

Tejas’ mother Padma says her son died due to the negligence of the doctors and nursing staff in the hospital. “He developed mouth ulcers after being admitted and would not drink milk. The nurses put the drip but forgot to take it out. Once there was blood in the drip. The doctors only attended to my son when his stomach swelled up, but it was too late by then,” she says, barely controlling her tears.

Asim Hussain and his wife Rukhsar Bano of Satish Vihar locality in Kota lost their first-born three days before their marriage anniversary. Their daughter was put on a ventilator when she developed fever and faced difficulty in breathing just 14 days after her birth on December 15. When she lost her life, the doctors were unable to explain why the artificial respiration system did not work for her, the parents say.

Shubham Hada, who brought his infant of two days with a respiratory disorder to the hospital’s ICU in mid-December, says there were no window panes near the child’s bed. The infant was exposed to the biting cold at night and died of hypothermia two days later.

On January 6, the relatives of a couple from Bhilwara district’s Mandalgarh town staged a dharna at the gate of J.K. Lon Hospital, carrying the body of a three-day-old girl who was born via C-section. The child had been shifted to the ICU after the nose drops given to her when she was crying apparently caused breathlessness. The relatives allege that the doctors did not treat her properly and that the paramedical staff were mostly busy on their mobile phones.

The hospital’s Medical Superintendent, Suresh Chand Dulara, met the agitators and assured them of prompt action. He said the hospital would ensure regular visits of paediatricians to the maternity ward and plug the loopholes in the ICU. The baby’s father, Shakir Mohammed, who was earlier demanding police intervention in the matter, handed over a written complaint to the hospital administration about the appalling facilities.

Poor facilities, overworked staff

When the shockingly high number of infant deaths in Kota came to light, the Congress government in Rajasthan swung into action. It sent a team of paediatricians from Jaipur to look into the causes of mortality. The team found that the five boys and five girls who died on December 23 and 24 had been suffering from birth asphyxia, septicaemia, aspiration pneumonia and convulsions.

The J.K. Lon Hospital, which also ordered an investigation into the children’s deaths, initially maintained that the infant mortality rate had been gradually coming down over the years in the institution. The hospital’s neonatal ICU ranking, issued by the National Health Mission on a monthly basis by assessing the quality of services, also consistently showed a low infant mortality rate.

However, patients and others visiting the hospital say that it is extremely unhygienic and filthy, with even pigs straying into the premises sometimes.

Ever since news of the deaths hit the headlines and Ministers started visiting the hospital, J.K. Lon has taken up renovation work on a large scale. It has placed fibre sheets and curtains on open windows, painted the walls, repaired the gates, and replaced the broken furniture. A proposal has been moved for the construction of three new wards with a capacity of 156 beds. A new neonatal ICU with 12 beds is expected to start functioning within a fortnight.

Dr. Amrit Lal Bairwa, who heads the Paediatrics Department at J.K. Lon Hospital, says it would be wrong to attribute the deaths of the infants to the negligence of doctors or the paramedical staff. “As the biggest hospital in the region, this is a tertiary care medical facility. The children are mostly referred to us by private hospitals in the nearby districts and many of them come when they are at the terminal stage of their illness,” he says. Bairwa says infants who come from private hospitals develop hypothermia, hypoglycemia and hypoxia during transit. “By the time they get here, they are in a serious condition. We get only 24-48 hours to save them. Often we are helpless.”

While admitting that there is a shortage of staff, Bairwa says the overworked resident doctors, paediatricians and nurses all work to provide the best medical care to children. He points out that about 60% of the children dying during treatment are male, as boys are more susceptible to septicaemia and other infections.

According to data of the hospital administration, against the death of 100 children in December 2019 and 101 in November 2019, 77 infants lost their lives in December 2018 and 76 in November 2018. By the end of the first week of 2020, a dozen more children had lost their lives following health complications.

An internal study by J.K. Lon Hospital has found that it needs at least 300 more beds to cater to the child population of the Hadoti region, comprising Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar districts. Medical Superintendent Dulara says the existing resources and infrastructure are being strengthened. The Public Works Department estimates an expenditure of ₹1.35 crore for repairing the hospital building and undertaking other works.

A major shortcoming in the hospital is the absence of a centralised oxygen system, as the oxygen cylinders are supplied by carts. Besides, Chinese medical equipment of inferior quality is being used for treatment, putting the children’s health at risk. Minister of Health and Family Welfare Raghu Sharma has since ordered a probe to find out why Chinese equipment was purchased in Kota.

A report by the Paediatrics Department has also stated that 13 out of the 19 ventilators in the hospital were defunct, 81 of the 111 infusion pumps were useless, and 44 of the 71 warmers were not working. Most of the nebulisers, which are required especially during winter, were also defunct. Against the 12 sanctioned posts of professors and associate professors, only seven are working.

In the midst of the outrage caused by the death of infants in Kota, disturbing figures of similar deaths emerged from Jodhpur and Bikaner as well as Gujarat’s Rajkot and Ahmedabad. A joint report on infant deaths in Jodhpur’s Umaid Hospital and M.D.M. Hospital revealed that 146 deaths were recorded at their neonatal ICU and paediatric ICU in December 2019. The number of deaths in Bikaner’s P.B.M. Hospital surpassed those in Kota, with 162 deaths reported in December alone.

Political blame game

The Kota episode, followed by deaths reported from elsewhere, has not only put the focus on the public health scenario in the State, but also unleashed a political blame game between the ruling Congress government and the Opposition. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was criticised for his remarks that some “mischievous elements” were highlighting the issue to divert attention from other subjects. Gehlot claimed that his government had brought down the number of casualties compared to those reported in the previous years. “Despite consistent improvement in survival numbers, we still have a thousand deaths every year, with many other hospitals having a similar rate. This is because of the overall high mortality rate for newborns in Rajasthan,” he said.

The BJP took up the issue at the Central level, with Kota MP and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla holding a review meeting with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on the matter. Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath questioned the silence of senior Congress leaders over the deaths.

The Union Health Ministry sent a high-level team comprising experts from AIIMS, Jodhpur, and health economists to Kota to assess the infrastructural gaps and decide on the measures to be taken to prevent further deaths. The team carried out an analysis of clinical protocols, service delivery and availability of manpower and equipment at the hospital.

Gehlot asked Harsh Vardhan to visit J.K. Lon Hospital and see the “best of facilities and proper management” in order to get himself apprised of the facts. “Harsh Vardhan Ji is himself a doctor and if he visits the hospital in #Kota, it will also clarify the situation for people, who are giving [their] reaction mischievously, knowingly, unknowingly and also innocently,” he tweeted.

Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who is also the Pradesh Congress Committee president, created a flutter by describing the deaths as “a heart-wrenching matter” and called for fixing accountability for the episode. He said it would serve no purpose to blame the previous BJP regime given that the Congress has been in power in the State for the last 13 months.

After visiting the hospital, Pilot told reporters in Kota that the State government’s response to the continuing deaths should have been “more sensitive”. “Our response was not satisfactory to some extent. We should have been more compassionate... Since we are in power, we have to be responsible and face consequences,” said Pilot, who also met some of the families who had lost their children.

Pressure on tertiary health care

With the emphasis on public health and nutrition infrastructure, activists working in the field of health care and the right to health feel that the issue of infant deaths in Kota should not be seen in isolation. “It is a sheer manifestation of the collapse of the public health system at all levels. Unless our outreach maternal health services, child health services and primary health care facilities are strengthened, we cannot expect lives to be saved only through treatment at the tertiary level,” health activist Chhaya Pachauli says.

Pachauli, senior programme coordinator with Prayas and affiliated to the Rajasthan Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, says there is an urgent need to increase health and nutrition budgets, which are abysmally low, in order to get the mandated outcome from healthcare facilities. “We need to reduce the patient load at the tertiary level. Tertiary health care is catering to a much higher number of patients than what it is meant to cater to, while primary care facilities are grossly underutilised... It is a matter of revamping the entire public health system from bottom to up.”

Low budget, unutilised funds

Figures from the National Family Health Survey depict a gradual decline in both infant and maternal mortality, but the pace has not been satisfactory. Against the national average of 33 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate in Rajasthan is 38, as per the latest Sample Registration System Bulletin. The infant mortality rate in the State was 41 in the previous Sample Registration System.

Nesar Ahmad, Director of the Jaipur-based Budget Analysis amd Research Centre Trust, says infant mortality is a consequence of poor budgetary allocation for medical and public health combined with the problem of unspent capital funds. The capital expenditure budget has not only declined from ₹1,073 crore in 2014-15 to ₹789 crore in 2019-20, only about half of it has been utilised over the years.

“Even in 2017-18, when the utilisation rate of the health budget was 100% in Rajasthan, the capital account budget was underutilised by 50%,” Ahmad says. He adds that this obviously impacts infrastructure and maintenance of medical equipment in government-run hospitals.

The State budget estimate data show that allocation for health and family welfare increased by an abysmal 1.76% between 2018-19 and 2019-20, against a 9.61% increase in the total budget. Ahmad says the previous government had laid undue focus on privatisation of health services and promoted the Bhamashah health insurance scheme, which entailed cashless treatment at empanelled private hospitals, at the cost of other schemes to provide primary health care to all.

The health budget in the State hovers at about 6% of the total Budget. Besides, the budget for the centrally sponsored National Health Mission has been declining since 2015-16. The National Health Mission budget in the current year is ₹2,101 crore, which is still lower than the ₹2,120 crore sanctioned in 2014-15.

All these figures mean little to the families who have lost their babies. Lala Ram, whose five-month-old daughter, referred from Bundi, died a day after the visit of the State’s Health Minister, says the infant could not survive because of the “collective failure” of the hospital’s staff and infrastructure. “Very little will change unless an element of empathy is brought in here. They too have children, they should feel our pain,” Lala Ram says.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egqha7/article30589435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THKOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/infant-deaths-a-bleak-winter-for-kotas-children/article30589438.ece

Mr. Jagan conducted a review meeting on implementation of the mid-day meal scheme at his camp office on Saturday.

According to a release, he said that the menu announced recently should be duly followed and the quality and taste of the food anywhere across the State should be the same — be it in Pulivendula or Amaravati.

The Chief Minister asked officials to make payment of ₹3,000 to mid-day meal workers and provisions through the green channel and establish a four-phase system to supervise the implementation of the scheme besides appointing three mothers to parents committee at the school level. The mothers should eat the food along with the children to check the quality of the food, he added. The government would spend ₹1,300 crore for the scheme every year, he said.

Addressing the media in New Delhi on Saturday, Mr. Chowdary warned of the repercussions of moving a ‘Money Bill’ in the Legislature, saying that it would not be easy and might also not pass legal scrutiny.

Advice to bureaucrats

He maintained that there were certain checks and balances in the Constitution against such arbitrary decisions, and advised the bureaucrats to be cautious while following the instructions from the government lest they should land in trouble like it happened in some scandals in the unified State in 2004-09.

Mr. Chowdary said it was clearly mentioned in the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014, that the successor State of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) would have a new capital.

The Central government had every right to question States when they tend to act on their own on issues that were sensitive and might trigger financial problems.

Mr. Chowdary further stated that the YSRCP, the TDP and the BJP had unanimously supported Amaravati in the Assembly, and it could not be changed whatever be the circumstances.

65,2020/01/18,MSME Parks: govt. striving to attract anchor investors,"As part of its focus on promotion of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), the State government is striving to attract large enterprises, whose investment in plant and machinery is higher than ₹50 crore, as anchor investors in the MSME Parks (M-Parks) being developed in all the Assembly constituencies as per the M-Parks (MSME Parks) Policy-2018-23.

Besides, the government has operationalised the MSME Development Corporation (M-Corp), which has been designated as the nodal agency, and tasked the A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) with the execution part.

The objective of the policy is to set up M-Parks in all the Assembly constituencies spanning 25 to 100 acres to realise their potential.

The government has planned to allocate a maximum of 10% of the area in each park to large enterprises, and they can enter into business relationships with the MSMEs in the parks.

Incentives

The M-Corp has been mandated to tie-up funds for administering the M-Parks scheme and provide investment-based incentives to the executing agencies.

Besides, a State-level project steering committee has been constituted to approve the M-Park development and withdrawal proposals, fix applicable infrastructure development cost and subsidies under the policy, sanction all subsidies and incentives, approve permitted changes in compliance procedures and levy penalties either for project delays or withdrawal of executing agencies or misrepresentation of information or other reasons.

Land allotment

To ensure that the allotment of lands by the APIIC does not become an impediment, the government has made it online and stipulated that the applications are processed within 21 days to make doing business easy.

Director of Industries J.V.N. Subramanyam, who is also the CEO of A.P. Economic Development Board, told The Hindu that 31 MSME parks were being built by the APIIC and clusters were under progress. Eight common facility projects have also been approved.

The M-Parks Policy targeted creation of 200 parks by 2023 with around 30,000 MSMEs employing 3,00,000 people and a total investment of ₹45,000 crore.

The four youth, identified as Siva, Brahmaiah, Sambaiah and Phani, are residents of the village. As soon as they climbed the cellphone tower, people raised slogans that the local MLA Undavalli Sridevi should come to the place. The incident took place even as Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was holding a meeting on the proposal to have three Capitals. The special Aassembly session is scheduled to be held on Monday.

Even after two hours, the youth refused to climb down the tower and police had to intervene. The local youth relented only after the Police Inspector assured them that their issues would be resolved.

In Guntur, candle light rallies were taken out in support of the agitation. TDP youth wing president Sai Krishna led the rally from Donka Road to Lodge Centre.

“Mr. Naidu had shown Amaravati in graphics and tried to hoodwink the people. Why couldn’t he build permanent structures in Amaravati? Why did he cause losses to the farmers in Guntur and Krishna districts in the name of green belt? He is raising a hue and cry now because he, his friends and business partners had invested money in Amaravati,” said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy.

Ministers M. Sucharitha and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao, MLAs Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, Bolla Brahma Naidu, Ambati Rambabu, and Vidadala Rajani took part in the rally organised in support of the proposed move of to decentralise administration by having three capitals.

‘Insider trading’

Mr. Ramana Rao said the TDP government had indulged in insider trading while zeroing in on Amaravati as the capital, and the state government would reveal the entire data of those who bought lands at a cheaper price in Amaravati.

Ms. Rajani said the village secretariat system would ensure decentralisation of administration as people need not go to the Secretariat nor do the rounds at the district headquarters.

Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that Mr. Naidu and his benamis had earned crores of rupees by resorting to insider trading, and added that all these leaders would have to face an inquiry in the future.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-batting-for-amaravati-as-he-invested-there-ysrcp/article30596279.ece
68,2020/01/18,Boat operations resume at select water bodies in State,"After a gap of four months, the government relaunch boat operations at select water bodies in the State on Saturday.

“Boat operations will resume at all the tourist spots soon,” said Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivas after flagging off the A.P. Tourism boat in the Krishna at Berm Park here.

New guidelines

“Boat accidents had been witnessed due to certain lapses and negligence of the previous government. The YSRCP government has come up with new guidelines for safe water transport,” the Minister said.

The government had suspended boat operations, both passenger and tourist, at all the water bodies on September 15 last after a private tourist boat, Royal Vasista, capsized in the Godavari at Kachluru village of Devipatnam mandal in Rampachodavaram Agency in East Godavari district.

While 51 persons had lost their lives in the accident, 26 tourists survived, thanks to the timely help rendered by the tribal people.

On September 16, the government had constituted a high-power committee headed by Special Chief Secretary Adityanath Das, besides ordering a magisterial inquiry by the district Joint Collector.

Safety measures

“The two committees had suggested several measures for safe water transport, which included registration, licensing system, maintaining safety gadgets, training for boat drivers, fire-fighting equipment, and checking at Command and Control Centres,” the Minister said, and added that a G.O. in this regard had been issued on Friday.

Bhavani Island, which was not in use after suspension of boating in the Krishna, would be developed with ₹1.70 crore. Work on the project would be completed in one week, the Minister added.

In all, 109 boats would start operations once the owners obtained the registration certificate and NOC, said Endowments Minister Vellampalli Srinivas.

Inaugurating the event, the Collector said that the road safety awareness week would be celebrated from January 18 to 24. “It is alarming that casualties due to road accidents are on the increase each year. In most accidents, it is observed that violation of road safety norms such as ignoring wearing of seat belt and helmet remains the prime cause. Apart from this, road users should concentrate on road safety signals and duly follow the rules and regulations,” he said.

The youth should be in the forefront in observing the road safety norms, he added.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said that road accidents would devastate families robbing them of their loved ones and happiness. “Wearing the seat belt and helmet would go a long way in reducing the number of casualties. Over-speeding, reckless driving and overloading should completely be avoided,” the SP said. People should think of starting out a little bit early so that the element of hurry could be avoided, which in turn would reduce road accidents.

Road crash fatalities

Deputy Transport Commissioner M. Basi Reddy said in 2019 1,693 road accidents occurred, with 840 casualties mostly involving two-wheeler riders without wearing a helmet. The APSRTC drivers should compulsorily follow the guidelines and stop the buses on the left side at the railway crossings.

88,2020/01/18,Nip in the air as night temperatures drop in Vizag,"The city has been experiencing a sudden nip in the air, as there has been a sharp decline in temperature, especially during night, in the last couple of days.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) records, on January 15 the lowest temperature recorded in Visakhapatnam (airport) was 15° Celsius with a deviation of -3.4° C from normal temperature. On the same day, Waltair recorded a low of 19.4° C with a deviation of -1.3° C from normal.

On January 16, airport region recorded the lowest of 18° C and Waltair 21.9° C. The temperature on January 15 is said to be the lowest this season. Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail for some more days, officials say.

Residents in several areas like Madhurawada, Bheemili, Sagar Nagar, Visalakshi Nagar, MVP Colony, Simhachalam and Adavivaram are experiencing cold wave conditions at night, with temperature dipping two to three degrees below Waltair. Thick fog could be seen at many places in the city. In many areas, especially in the rural parts and coastal stretches, people are lighting campfires to keep themselves warm. Sweater and blanket vendors are doing brisk business.

“We have been experiencing cold winds after 6 p.m for about a week now. We are lighting a campfire near our shop to escape the chill. Most of the shops are being closed by 8.30 p.m,” said Ganga Rao, a fruit vendor from Hanumanthuwaka.

A Raju, an RTC bus driver, said that driving had now become tough due to thick fog on the city outskirts. “The ongoing road works add to the visibility problem between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.,” he added.

Confined to homes

Agency areas too have been witnessing a sudden decline in temperatures since the last week, disrupting public life. Elderly persons and children are the worst hit due to the cold winds.

According to the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Chintapalle, on January 16, the lowest temperature recorded was 7° C and on Friday, the minimum temperature observed was 8° C.

“Seven degrees Celsius was the lowest this season in the agency. On November 16, 7.5° C was recorded,” said an official.

Lambasingi, Paderu, Araku, Ananthagiri and Dumbriguda have been experiencing cold weather conditions.

“We are able to witness proper sunlight only after 9 a.m. From 3 p.m., one can feel the cold winds. During the early hours, the weather is so cold that we are unable to come out of houses. These days, campfire is a must every morning,” said Durru Upendra, a resident of Paderu.

According to V. Raju, an auto-rickshaw driver from Chintapalle, driving has become very tough due to severe fog on the ghat roads.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1rfcbe/article30589861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJVZCOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nip-in-the-air-as-night-temperatures-drop-in-vizag/article30589862.ece
89,2020/01/18,Students to highlight failure of Union govt.,"Several students’ organisations will jointly organise a convention in Kalaburagi on Sunday to highlight the Narendra Modi-led Union government’s failure that includes rising unemployment, farmer’s crisis, inflation and failure to provide safety to women. It will be held at National Ground from 11.00 a.m. to 2 a.m.

Student activist Syed Aleem Illahi addressing a press conference here on Saturday said students from different universities would dance to patriotic songs. They would put up rap and qawwali performances. The convention will highlight the promises the Modi government could not keep. The Centre has failed to give employment to two crore youth every year; it has failed to control the prices of daily commodities and petroleum products, they said.

The convention would also discuss the CAA and NRC.

Lubna Siraj, vice-president, National Women’s Front; Prof. Sadiya Jalal, Aligarh Muslim University; and speakers from various universities and organisation including Campus Front of India, Popular Front of India, Student’s Federation of India, All India Democratic Students Organisation and Bahujan Vidyarthi Sangha would participate in the convention at National Ground from 11.00 a.m. to 2 a.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/students-to-highlight-failure-of-union-govt/article30596441.ece
90,2020/01/18,Samiti seeks study of Kalyana Karnataka,"The Hyderabad Karnataka Janapara Sangharsh Samiti (HKJSS) has demanded that the State government undertake a comprehensive study of Kalyana Karnataka for an objective picture of development to identify underdeveloped areas.

At a press conference here on Friday, Laxman Dasti, HKJSSpresident, demanded that the government constitute a committee of experts, under the chairmanship of the Regional Commissioner, to undertake the study. “The committee should take gram panchayats as a unit for assessing the development and complete the study within a stipulated time. Based on its report, future plans could be chalked out. Funds allocated to the Hyderabad Karnataka Regional Development Board should be used more on under-developed areas,” he said.

Expressing discontentment over the implementation of the special status accorded under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, Mr. Dasti said that a separate Secretariat should be established as promised by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. “The secretariat should function from Kalaburagi as envisaged. All other offices related to the implementation of the special status, including the special cell, should be shifted to Kalaburagi,” he said.

Accusing the government of improper implementation of reservations to candidates of Kalyana Karnataka, he said that many recruitment notifications issued by departments did not offer reservations to Kalyana Karnataka candidates to posts in non-Kalyana Karnataka regions.

Attributing the rising temperature in the region to the increasing loss of green cover, Sangeeta Kattimani, economist, stressed on the need for long-term forestation plans. “High temperature is one of the major reasons, along with the backwardness, for the poor performance of the students in SSLC and PU examinations as it physiologically affects the brain,” she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/samiti-seeks-study-of-kalyana-karnataka/article30596423.ece
91,2020/01/18,All should abide by SC decision on Karnataka-Maharashtra border issue: Raut,"All parties will have to abide by whatever decision the Supreme Court takes on the Karnataka-Maharashtra border issue, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Saturday.

He was here to speak at the Barrister Nath Pai Vyakhyan Mala lecture. “Rule of law is an accepted principle in this country. The Constitution is above all of us and we respect it. Let the Supreme Court hear both sides and pronounce its judgment,” he said.

To a question on some Maharashtra leaders making provocative statements in Belagavi, he only said the party’s stand was “let the court decide” and the Maharashtra Chief Minister had clarified his stand on several occasions in the past.

About some people opposing the involvement of the Shiv Sena in the Marathi issue in Belagavi, he said issue-based opposition was common in politics and that was not to be taken personally. He did not react to a question on the city police not allowing Maharashtra Minister Rajendra Patil Yadravkar to speak at an MES event on Friday. There were some protests in Kolhapur against the police action.

The city police earlier planned to stop Mr. Raut as well, but they allowed him to attend his meeting as it was not directly connected to the border issue, an officer told The Hindu. Several MES leaders received him at the Sambra airport. Some youth shouted slogans that Belagavi, Karwar, and Nippani should be merged with Maharashtra.

Bus services disrupted

92,2020/01/18,"Delay in Ministry expansion affecting people, says Krishna Byre Gowda","Congress leader Krishna Byre Gowda on Saturday said the people were suffering on account of the delay in constitution of a full-fledged Ministry in the State.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Gowda said the BJP had failed to constitute a full-fledged Ministry in the State even after almost six months of the B.S. Yediyurappa government coming to power.

The BJP government is making do with half the full strength of the Ministry. “How will they attend to the problems of the people without a full-fledged Ministry? You are not able to provide a Minister in charge of the districts. You are unable to take up flood relief work,” he said, accusing the BJP of committing gross injustice to the 6.5 crore people of the State, whose well-being rests on their shoulders.

While the State BJP is dogged by groupism, there are differences between the State leadership and central leadership in the party. “Because of these internal differences in the BJP, the people of the State are suffering”, he said, before adding that the Chief Minister had not been given a free hand by the central leadership in the administration of the State.

Fielding queries on the selection of a new President for KPCC, Mr. Gowda said the party leadership was holding consultations and an appropriate decision would be taken in the regard.

The MLA has been swearing by “political neutrality” and staying away from functions and programmes organised by the party. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Gowda said he had stayed away from the process of candidate selection, but had decided to cast his vote. He said party leader S.R. Mahesh had called him over phone and asked him to participate in the election.

Mr. Gowda, who is suspected to be resenting Mr. Mahesh’s proximity to H.D. Kumaraswamy and H.D. Deve Gowda, remarked, rather sarcastically, that Mr. Mahesh was the senior leader of the party in Mysuru. “There is no senior or junior in politics. He is our senior leader in Mysuru,” he said.

Mr. Mahesh, in response, said Mr. Gowda’s suggestions had been taken into consideration while finalising the party’s candidate. “In his absence, I took the lead in talks with the Congress over the alliance,” he said, before expressing hope that Mr. Gowda would become active in the party soon.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gt-deve-gowda-attends-mayoral-polls-in-mysuru/article30595996.ece
94,2020/01/18,Cleanliness among new Mysuru Mayor’s priorities,"The newly elected Mayor has named cleanliness among her top priorities.

Speaking to reporters soon after her election as the 22nd Mayor of the city, JD(S) leader Tasneem promised to pay attention to cleanliness issues. Her comment assumes significance in light of the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2020 and the Mysuru City Corporation’s efforts to regain the coveted Clean City tag.

Ms. Tasneem, 34, is the first Muslim woman Mayor of Mysuru. She thanked the JD(S) leadership, including former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, for showing faith in her abilities.

Former Mayor R. Lingappa said the party leadership preferred Tasneem over other aspirants because of her “dynamism and loyalty” to the party, among other things. “She is also quite articulate and active,” he said.

Social and Democratic Party of India leader Abdul Majeed complimented former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for choosing Ms. Tasneem for the post.

Deputy Mayor C. Sridhar said he would strive for better amenities to pourakarmikas. He promised to take up with the government a proposal to regularise services of pourakarmikas in the city.

The 18 JD(S) corporators who had been taken away to a resort on the outskirts of the city arrived on the MCC premises on Sayyaji Rao Road. The party leadership, which had issued a whip, had taken them away to the resort on Thursday to prevent any division in its ranks or poaching by rival parties.

Ms. Tasneem polled 47 votes, against Ms. Yoganand’s 23. Mr. Sridhar also defeated his BJP rival by 24 votes. Curiously, the BJP members did not raise their hands to oppose the candidature of Ms. Tasneem and Mr. Sridhar. The Congress and JD(S) members also reciprocated by not opposing the corporators fielded by the BJP.

The government had reserved the post of Mayor for BCA woman and Deputy Mayor for SC. Ms. Tasneem, a two-time corporator, represents ward number 26 in MCC while Mr. Sridhar represents ward number 38.

Ms. Tasneem, 34, is a graduate and a mother of two. Her husband, Syed Samiulla, is a social activist.

The announcement was made by Pradeep Singh Kharola, Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, at an industry meet held on Saturday ahead of ‘Wings India-2020’, which is scheduled to be held in Hyderabad from March 12 to 15.

“We have operationalised nearly 40 airports in the last five years and the target in the next five years is to double the number of operational airports and helipads in the country,” he said. He added that catering to growth in future was a challenge as airport infrastructure was getting constrained.

He also said that Bengaluru had the potential of becoming the aviation capital of the country. “We have airports in all directions of the State now. A couple of months ago, the Gulbarga (Kalaburagi) airport was made operational. Aviation has become an engine of economic growth,” he said.

Registration of drones

Speaking about the recent move of the Centre to get drones registered to facilitate their identification, he said it was a step towards framing a regulatory framework for drones. “This enlistment of drones will be converted into licences, and we assure everyone that as far as drones are concerned, our regulatory framework will be congenial to everyone,” he said.

Kapil Mohan, Principal Secretary, Infrastructure Development, said the government was considering setting up a Gulbarga Airport Development Authority. “We launched the Kalaburagi airport with the Airports Authority of India, and the response has been very good.

99,2020/01/18,No district hospital is under PPP model in Karnataka,"No district hospital in Karnataka runs on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model at present and there is a history of “failed PPP arrangements” in running Primary Health Centres (PHCs), according to health activists and doctors.

The ‘Arogya Bandhu’ scheme, under which the Health Department in 2011-12 partnered with non-governmental organisations, charitable trusts and private medical colleges to run 52 of its PHCs, was scrapped in 2016. This was following a series of complaints of non-compliance with rules, misuse of funds, lack of accountability, and failure to provide quality service to patients.

This apart, a study conducted by the Institute of Health Management and Research (IHMR) had noted that there is little difference between the services provided by the NGOs and the government in running PHCs. The expenses of running the PHCs, including building maintenance and staff salary, were given by the government anyway.

However, two years ago, the scheme was reintroduced. Currently, the department has handed over 20 PHCs in nine districts — Bengaluru Rural, Belagavi, Davangere, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, Tumakuru, Chickballapur, Chamarajanagar and Bidar — to NGOs and charitable trusts. Apart from this, diagnostic and dialysis services have also been outsourced under PPP arrangements. CT scan services in 14 district hospitals and MRI services in five are provided this way.

According to data from the Health Department, while 1,91,186 CT scans were done from October 2017 (when the PPP began) till January 6, 2020, as many as 42,102 MRI scans were done from March 2018. These services are free of cost for patients as they are being provided under the National Free Diagnostic Services. The government pays the private entity for the service, officials said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-district-hospital-is-under-ppp-model-in-karnataka/article30595927.ece
100,2020/01/18,Health activists in Karnataka oppose NITI Aayog proposal on district hospitals,"The NITI Aayog proposal to hand over district hospitals with 750 beds to private medical colleges, citing the public-private-partnership (PPP) arrangements in Karnataka and Gujarat, has come under severe criticism from health activists and doctors, who feel it will further compromise quality and access to healthcare, mainly for the poor. They have demanded that the move be dropped without further consultation.

The Centre’s top think tank recently released for feedback from stakeholders a 250-page document on “scheme to link new and/or existing private medical colleges with functional district hospitals through PPP”. A stakeholders’ meet to discuss this is slated to be held on Tuesday. Such district hospitals need to have at least 750 beds, of which nearly half will be “market beds” and the rest will be “regulated beds” for free patients.

Citing a dire shortage of qualified doctors, the NITI Aayog document states that it was practically not possible for the Union and State governments to bridge the gaps in medical education with their limited resources and finances. “This necessitates formulating a PPP model by combining the strengths of public and private sectors. Such a model will augment medical seats and also rationalise the costs of medical education,” the document states.

However, health activists and doctors are worried that such a model could transform district hospitals from public service-oriented healthcare centres into profit-oriented ones. The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) has demanded that the proposal be dropped immediately without any further consultation.

“District hospitals are the final port of call for the poor. This policy will further compromise quality and access to healthcare, mainly for poor patients. With only half of the beds made available for the poor, there will be a huge demand for free beds. The management will be only interested in giving care to paying patients and their primary motive will be making a profit. Instead [of this move], district hospitals should be converted into public medical colleges or attached to new such colleges,” said Abhay Shukla, national convener of JSA.

‘A disastrous move’

Sundararaman T., global coordinator of People’s Health Movement, termed the move disastrous. “Patients will need an authorisation certificate to avail free services, while the private entity managing the district hospital will be entitled to demand and charge appropriate hospital charges based on the market competitive rates from other patients. This will mean allowing the private entities to turn our district hospitals into revenue-generating enterprises,” he said. Dr. Sundaraman is the former executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre.

M. Madan Gopal, former Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Karnataka, during whose tenure the ‘Arogya Bandu’ scheme was initially scrapped, said the State’s PPP arrangements have not been successful in the past. “Going by past experience, I do not think the NITI Aayog proposal will be cleared. There are a lot of practical issues. What will happen to the existing government staff in district hospitals? Will they come under the private entity? Who will handle medico-legal cases? Many such things will arise,” he said.

Sylvia Karpagam, a public health expert who has extensively studied the PPP healthcare model in the State, questioned why policy-making does not use the basis of evidence. “The Karnataka model for both primary and tertiary care has been critiqued many times and yet, it is constantly projected as a good model. The contract signed by the government for a tertiary care PPP in Raichur was terminated two years later, in May 2012, because of poor governance and the lack of accountability and a grievance redressal mechanism at the hospital,” she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/b2hcyz/article30595918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/health-activists-in-karnataka-oppose-niti-aayog-proposal-on-district-hospitals/article30595919.ece

102,2020/01/18,MCC to take to social media route to promote green weddings,"In its bid to promote ‘green’ weddings and encourage more people go for events that generate less or zero waste, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is eyeing a top Swachh rank this time, has made a documentary film on eco-friendly weddings to circulate on social media.

The four-minute film that shows images of the weddings that were certified ‘green’ and the benefits of such initiatives is set to launch soon.

So far, Mysuru has witnessed six green weddings, a green house warming and a green thread ceremony (upanayanam) that were by and large plastic-free.

The concept has gained popularity with people volunteering to tie the knot the green way. Whoever conducts a green wedding, shunning plastic use, and reducing bulk waste generation, is awarded a ‘Green Wedding Certificate’, certifying their environment-friendly initiative. The certificate is handed over to the newly-married couple acknowledging their concern.

“The first green wedding that attracted around 4,000 guests produced only 48 kgs of waste unlike regular weddings which on an average produce about one tonne of waste. This could be possible with the use of steel cutlery and stakeholders including caterers and decorators joining the initiative,” said MCC Environment Engineer Mythri.

She told The Hindu that the video on green weddings was a step to endorse more such events since they were among the largest bulk waste generators. “One catering contractor came forward and bought over 3,000 steel plates and cups to be used at large events instead of plantain leaves and paper or bottled water. If more such people in the food industry and event organisers come forward, it will turn most weddings eco-friendly,” she argued.

Plantain leaves

Used plantain leaves take at least 45 days to decompose. If they are disposed of after shredding, the process is faster. Some flowers used in decorations also take longer to decompose. If locally available flowers are used, the process is faster, she explained. Flower decorators cannot use any plastic material in their decorations, laying emphasis on biodegradable and organic materials.

The MCC is promoting the concept with the support of the district administration. It has constituted a core team of consultants to assist families in putting up green weddings right from the planning stages till the execution.

As each wedding generates tonnes of waste, the quantum of waste generated in wedding halls can be radically reduced by way of green weddings, according to the MCC.

Also, a green wedding need not be a simple one as families can celebrate the occasion as per their choice, following some guidelines. Leftover food is distributed among orphanages here by an NGO who has tied-up with the MCC for the purpose.

Two such shops will take shape in the MCC-owned shopping complex near Gandhi Square.

Cloth bags with messages written on them will be sold prominently at these shops to end the menace of plastic bags that are still in circulation despite the blanket ban.

Promoted by Mysuru Green Foundation, the MCC has provided two stalls for shops that sell eco-friendly recyclable material.

MCC’s Environment Officer Mythri said the shops would be launched shortly. They will be run by members of NGOs as the MCC’s motto is to end the plastic menace. It has taken the initiative to ask people to fully shun the use of plastics. “Once users discourage items like plastic bags, people selling and manufacturing them will also stop their sale. The first step should come from the public,” she stated. Traders who were selling plastic items before the ban have now switched over to trade of recyclable stuff.

104,2020/01/18,"BSY discusses Cabinet expansion with Shah, but no clearance yet","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has reportedly discussed with Union Home Minister and BJP national president Amit Shah the issue of Cabinet expansion in Karnataka, which has been pending for over a month. However, Mr. Shah has not cleared the list and the impasse over expansion is likely to continue, sources close to the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Shah and Mr. Yediyurappa are said to have deliberated on the matter in the hour-long flight from Bengaluru to Hubballi on Saturday. Mr. Yediyurappa was accompanied by son B.Y. Vijayendra and State Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on the special flight.

No second meeting

Though there was supposed to be another round of meeting in Hubballi on Saturday night, the Chief Minister left for Bengaluru in the evening, even as Mr. Shah stayed back in town.

The Chief Minister is scheduled to leave for Davos, Switzerland, to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum on Sunday morning and is expected to be back on January 24.

Mr. Yediyurappa may have to make another trip to New Delhi once he returns to get the final clearance on the proposed list and on allotment of portfolios, sources said, pushing the exercise further away. The trip to the capital may happen only after the Delhi Assembly polls that are scheduled for February 8, as Mr. Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be busy campaigning, party sources said.

Mr. Yediyurappa has not been able to meet the party high command over the last one month, as he did not get an appointment. He had announced a trip to New Delhi but had to cancel it, reportedly upsetting him.

Newly-elected MLAs

Meanwhile, a group of newly-elected MLAs led by Ramesh Jarkiholi of those in line to join the Cabinet during the expansion exercise, were at the hotel where Mr. Shah was staying and were trying to meet him. While C.C. Patil said he was able to meet Mr. Shah but did not discuss the issue of ministerial berths, Mr. Jarkiholi said that he was not given time for a meeting.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bsy-discusses-cabinet-expansion-with-shah-but-no-clearance-yet/article30595870.ece

He visited Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha and paid his respects at the Brindavan of the recently-deceased Vishwesha Teertha Swami of Pejawar Mutt. The seer was closely associated with the BJP and the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Shah participated in another religious event organised by Vedanta Bharati at Palace Grounds and released translations of Viveka Deepini, a compilation of slokas from Prashnottara Ratna Malika of Adi Shankara. At the event, he described Shankaracharya as someone who fought for Hindu Dharma against conversions during the time and successfully united Hindus.

Mr. Shah also said that “secularism” had led to not respecting the nation’s traditions and icons. “In Narendra Modi, we have a leader who did “Ganga aarti” at Varanasi before taking oath as Prime Minister and we should be proud of it,” he said.

Mr. Shah also opened the office of Bengaluru South BJP MP Tejasvi Surya in Jayanagar. This raised eyebrows in the party, as Mr. Surya was the youngest member of Parliament and this was the first time the national president of the party had opened the office of an MP, senior workers in the party said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/imjvo/article30595854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGSHAHSEER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/adi-shankara-united-hindus-shah/article30595855.ece
106,2020/01/18,"CAA is about granting citizenship, not snatching it away, says Amit Shah","Defending the Citizen (Amendment) Act, Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that the population of Hindus residing in Pakistan had drastically reduced from 30% to 3%.

Addressing a pro-CAA rally in Hubballi, he said that 70% of the people who were forced to flee their countries after religious persecution and sought shelter in India belonged to the lower classes and those opposing giving them citizenship were “anti-Dalits”. He sought answers from “champions of human rights” on the plight of people who were subjected to religious persecution.

Accusing the Congress and other Opposition parties of misleading the Muslims in the country and for violence during anti-CAA protests, Mr. Shah said that CAA would not snatch away citizenship from anyone. “CAA will not snatch away citizenship of my Muslim brothers. There is no clause in CAA to do so. You will have equal rights like all Indians. It is an Act for giving citizenship,” he said.

Mr. Shah called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for a debate on CAA. “I will first ask Rahul Baba to read CAA fully and challenge him for a debate on it. Pralhad Joshi [MP and Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs] will debate with you on the issue,” he said.

He said the Congress had always opposed steps taken in the interest of the nation. Comparing Mr. Rahul with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Mr. Shah said as the stands of both were similar, he was compelled to seek answer on the relationship between the Congress and Mr. Khan.

Mr. Shah, who began his speech by remembering Kittur queen Chennamma, Gangubai Hangal and the seer of Moorusavir Mutt, took only few minutes to explain CAA and then continued with criticism of the Congress and Mr. Rahul.

In a short speech, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa urged the crowd to strengthen the party and ensure victory in 150 constituencies in the next Assembly elections. Mr. Joshi showered praises on Mr. Shah. Prominent Ministers of the State Cabinet, BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel and others were present.

Plea for missed call

Mr. Shah engaged the crowd by asking them questions on whether they accepted the abolition of Article 370 and triple talaq, approved the surgical strikes and wanted the Ram Mandir.

The protesters urged Mr. Shah to go back as he had failed to meet the rightful demands of the people of north Karnataka, particularly with regard to the Mahadayi river, and alleged that the Union government was trying to divide people in the name of religion.

Under the aegis of ‘Samvidhana Rakshana Samiti’ (constitution protection committee), a group of protesters had gathered at the court circle in Hubballi wearing black jackets. They alleged that unwarranted laws were being brought in to divert the attention of the people of the country from issues like unemployment, economic slowdown and others. After the police failed to convince them to withdraw, they were taken into custody.

In another protest staged at Sangolli Rayanna statue, around 20 members were taken into preventive custody after they raised ‘Go Back Shah’ slogans.

108,2020/01/18,Release flood relief before brainwashing people on CAA: Siddaramaiah to Shah,"Former Chief Minister and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah on Saturday questioned Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s priorities for Karnataka.

Soon after Mr. Shah’s arrival in Bengaluru, Mr. Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets hit out at the Union Minister and the BJP Government demanding answers on various issues pertaining to the State — especially inadequate flood relief from the Centre, unresolved Mahadayi dispute, and recent police firing in Mangaluru that killed two people during an anti-CAA protest. Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had tweeted on similar lines on Friday.

Under #AnswerMadiShah hashtag, Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted: “Mr. Shah, before investing time to brainwash people to accept your divisive policies, why don’t you visit flood-affected areas again and assess if the Central government funds given are sufficient or not?”

The Congress leader pointed out that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had claimed that Karnataka suffered losses of over ₹35,000 crore due to the floods. “But the Central aid is just ₹ 1,870 crore. When are you planning to give the remaining amount? Will there be any funds left after the implementation of CAA, NPR & NRC?” he tweeted.

Shifting stands

Referring to the Mahadayi water-sharing dispute, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked: “Mr. Shah, your colleagues give contradictory statements on the initiation of Mahadayi project. Why is there a change in stance after elections? What is your stand on the issue?”

Mr Shah, in the run-up to the Karnataka Assembly elections in 2018, had promised a resolution to the dispute within six months if the BJP was voted to power here.

On police firing in Mangaluru, Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted: “Two innocent victims were killed in Mangaluru. Don’t you think adequate investigation has to be initiated when people cry foul about the incident?”

The Congress, in a series of tweets, asked why the Central government was behaving in a “dictatorial manner”, despite countrywide public opinion against the CAA and NRC.

Kumaraswamy tweets

Meanwhile, Mr. Kumaraswamy tweeted stating that it was ironical that Mr. Shah was arriving in the State to create public awareness campaign when flood victims were in the hope getting flood relief. “Your awareness campaign on CAA and NRC is only to cover up your blunders,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/release-flood-relief-before-brainwashing-people-on-caa-siddaramaiah-to-shah/article30594816.ece

The Minister commended NIC as the “backbone of digital governance in India” and said he was particularly optimistic about applications of blockchain technology in primary education. He appealed to NIC to explore the potential of the new technology in improving the quality of government schools across the country.

Mr. Prasad defended NIC over criticism and feedback from the top bureaucrats of the State at the event. T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, Chief Secretary of the State, said there was a need to fasten the response by NIC to help cater to changing needs. The processes need to be made simpler, he said. Mr. Prasad responded during his address and said NIC need not be “nimble” and listed out its achievements.

Mr. Vijay Bhaskar also said NIC usually straight-jacketed its software solutions across the country and argued for customisation to suit the needs of the State. “The websites are available only in a few languages. These portals need to be available in all Indian languages,” he said.

Gopalakrishnan S, Additional Secretary, Department of Electronics and Information Technology, said the websites would be available in multiple languages and the department was working on text to speech function to be made available in multiple languages.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-gets-centre-of-excellence-for-e-governance-solutions/article30594741.ece
110,2020/01/18,Krishi mela begins at UAS-D campus,"The three=day annual krishi mela began on a colourful note on the University of Agricutural Sciences- Dharwad (UAS-D) campus here on Saturday.

Inaugurating the event, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said that the farming sector is facing a crisis and the Union government has launched several schemes to empower the farmers.

“Today, nearly 58% of the workforce is engaged in the farm sector for livelihood even as the farm sectors share in GDP stands at 16-18%.”

The government intends to bring down the number of people engaged in the agriculture by creating alternative employment opportunities in the allied sectors in the rural areas. In last five years the investment for rural development has been increased by 400% in the last five years, he said.

Mr. Joshi pointed out that the Union government has taken steps to implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee.

The government has set the target of doubling farmers income by 2022-23. To achive this goal the government would launch more schemes in the upcoming budget, he said.

Taking a dig at those allegedly spreading lies over the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, he said ₹17, 210 crore was distributed among 5 crore farmers and Dharwad district alone has received ₹150 crore under this scheme this year.

Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has said there is a seminar for announcing the support price for groundnut. A decision to this affect will be taken at the meeting of the Cabinet Sub=Committee within four days.

He further stated that the blueprint of a mega project to raise the groundwater table was ready and it will be implemented soon. The Union government has promised ₹800 crore for this purpose.

The loss of soil fertility is a major challenge owing to excessive use of chemicals. This is causing serious health problems in society owing to presence of poisonous contents in the vegitables. Agricultural scientists should help find solutions and the farmers too need to think seriously over this issue. Farmers should not compromise with their social responsibility in the wake of earning more money, he said.

Mr. Savadi also released books brought out by the UAS- D on this occasion. Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, Mines and Geology Minister C.C. Patil, Large and Medium industries Minister Jagadish Shettar spoke. UAS-D Vice-Chancellor M.B.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told a press conference here that a few other organisations were also likely to face a ban along with PFI and SDPI.

“There are a set of procedures to be followed before seeking a ban on any organisation such as collecting evidence regarding their unlawful activities. We have directed all the authorities concerned to submit such evidence and materials. Once this process is complete, we will forward them to the Centre for suitable action. We will also hold consultations with the Law Department on the procedures to be followed depending upon the nature of evidence that we get,” Mr. Bommai said. Describing PFI and SDPI as “political faces” of banned terrorist organisations like SIMI, the Home Minister alleged that they were trying to re-emerge by changing their names.

He alleged that these organisations were carrying out their activities in Karnataka for the last seven to eight years. However, the last few episodes including the busting of a suspected terror module in Bengaluru by the Tamil Nadu police along with the Central Crime Branch (CCB) had brought the focus on the need for banning these organisations, he maintained.

The Mysuru protest got embroiled in controversy as one of the participants — Nalini Balakumar — carried a ‘Free Kashmir’ placard following which the jurisdictional police booked a sedition case against her and the those who had organised the protest.

The meeting, chaired by G. Hemantha Kumar, Vice-Chancellor of the university, spent a considerable amount of time discussing the issue and its fallouts and some of the members.

The pump will come in 0.1255 hectare area attached to the Viyyur Central Jail and Correctional Home on the Thrissur -Shoranur State Highway. The Jail Department will have the dealership of the IOC pump. Selected inmates of the jail, with good behaviour, will be employed as workers in the pump.

Mayor Ajitha Vijayan presided over the function. Director General of Police, Jail, Rishiraj Singh, Deputy Collector M.B. Gireesh Kumar, and others participated.

Kerala is in the number one position in the case of jail development, Mr. Rishiraj Singh said.

Library opened

He was speaking after inaugurating a library contributed by T.N. Prathapan, MP, to the Viyyur jail on Saturday.

“Irrespective of the status of convicts or remand prisoners, all are getting vocational training at prisons. Kerala must be the only State that sold products worth ₹35 crore from the jail. The inmates get parole in 60 days in the State,” he noted.

T.N. Prathapan, MP, has donated around 2,000 books to the prison.

Books, not bouquets

After taking charge as MP, Mr. Prathapan had requested those who invited him for functions to give him books instead of bouquets. He donated the books he thus received. He also donated shelves and reading tables.

Kerala Sahitya Akademi president Vaisakhan and writers K. Venu and Balachandran Vadakkedath were present.

120,2020/01/18,The latest victim of demonetisation,"An unsuspecting 56-year-old Swedish woman was the latest victim of demonetisation when she ended up coughing up over ₹2.5 lakh in fine and missed her flight to Colombo from the Cochin international airport after she was found in possession of over ₹50,000 in demonetised currency notes.

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had strengthened the security and tightened the baggage screening at the airport ahead of Republic Day, which led to the detection on Tuesday of 49 pieces of ₹1,000 notes and another five ₹500 notes, which had been rendered invalid since demonetisation came to effect on November 2016.

The currency notes were later handed over to the Customs authorities.

‘Not aware’

“She had last travelled to India in 2014 and claimed that the currency notes were from that trip. She said she was not aware of the demonetisation and neither was she told about it by anyone on arrival,” CISF authorities said.

The passenger finally had to pay the fine at the First Class Judicial Magistrate court at Angamaly before she left for Colombo on Saturday.

Criminal offence

As per the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, possession of more than 10 pieces of invalidated currency notes by individuals and more than 25 for study, research, or numismatics is deemed a criminal offence attracting a minimum fine of ₹10,000 or five times the cash held, whichever is higher.

The Act was passed with the aim of eliminating the possibility of a parallel economy using the demonetised currency notes.

The law also stipulates a minimum fine of ₹50,000 for false declarations by those who were abroad during the demonetisation period but were given time to deposit the scrapped notes with the Reserve Bank of India.

Customs authorities, however, said that they had very rarely come across instances of possession of demonetised notes at the Kochi airport.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-latest-victim-of-demonetisation/article30596216.ece

The shocking tale came to light when the youngest girl revealed the abuse to her teacher during a personal counselling. Aghast at the revelation, the school authorities spoke to her elder sisters with the help of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC).

Counselling

During the counselling, the four siblings revealed that their father continued to abuse them sexually whenever they were alone in their rented quarters.

They said that he would often rape them under the influence of alcohol. The man also used to bring home his friends. However, further counselling will be needed to ascertain if the children were abused by anyone else.

On the basis of a complaint by the school authorities, the police arrested the man, slapping various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, including aggravated sexual offences. Sub-inspector T. Manoharan said that four cases were registered against the man. He was produced before a court on Saturday, and was remanded in judicial custody.

124,2020/01/18,Window to women’s role in social reformation,"The role of women in the social reformation movement in Kerala in the late 19th century and early 20th century has largely gone unacknowledged and undocumented. Their contribution to ensuring access to social spaces for people of all religions and castes is significant.

To make the younger generation aware of the social reformation movement and document the yesteryear women who paved the way for the achievements of women today, the Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation (KSWDC), the Women and Child Development Department, and Information and Public Relations Department are bringing out a docu-fiction Vimochanathinte Pattukar.

Reformation

Directed by filmmaker Vidhu Vincent, Vimochanathinte Pattukar is an initiative under the Sadhairyam Munnottu programme of the State government for women’s empowerment. Vidhu says the 45-minute docu-fiction is about how the reformation values led to realisation of the idea of a modern women and gave it strength.

As hinted by the title, music links a woman and her granddaughter in Vimochanathinte Pattukar. Both are musicians, with the youngster having her own band. The elderly woman is shown to have been an active participant in the workers’ movement in Alappuzha and political and social activities there.

Though not close to her initially, the young woman gradually comes to understand her grandmother’s world through her stories and photographs of the past. The grandmother tells her there are many strong women still alive and to go and meet them. The journeys and stories of these women in turn influence the band’s music, in search of a new identity. Their new songs speak of how women then and today have helped shape the idea of a modern woman. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the first screening of Vimochanathinte Pattukar at a function at Tagore Theatre at 6 p.m. on Tuesday. The function will be followed by a discussion on ‘Kerala women: yesterday, today, and tomorrow.’ It will be moderated by Gender AdviserT.K.

126,2020/01/18,"Aerosol, improper managementof water led to floods, says Gadgil","Accumulation of aerosol particles in the air and improper management of water resources were the reasons for the floods and landslips that ravaged Kerala in recent years, Madhav Gadgil, who led the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, has said.

Speaking to journalist Nithin Sethi at a session on ‘Fragile Ecology of Kerala’ at the fifth edition of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) here on Saturday, he said India as a land mass had the largest accumulation of aerosol particles in the air, which was the reason for the changing pattern of rainfall resulting in landslips and floods. Aerosol, he said, was formed from manmade sand and automobile exhaust.

He said that if the water level in reservoirs was maintained at an appropriate level, substantial damage could have been avoided.

Mr. Gadgil, whose predictions regarding the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats had come true in the case of Kerala, cited Norway as the best model for balancing development and environment protection. In a later session on ‘Saving God’s Own Country’, he said the contradiction between development and environment was being posed by vested interests who were using natural resources to make some quick bucks.

People’s planning

“The State is a coercive agency and it always works in favour of the rich and the powerful,” he said, highlighting the role of people’s planning at the Grama Sabha level in balancing development and environment conservation.

His co-speaker and wildlife conservationist Prerna Bindra batted for a rethink on the implementation of the Gadgil commission report that was shelved by the Centre following protests. “Economy rests on ecology,” she said, adding the issue of reopening the National Highway through the Bandipur forests was equivalent to suicide. “If you do not give animals their space, they take yours,” she added.

Journalist Viju B., known for his book Flood and Fury, said Kerala had not even taken an initiative to study why natural disasters were happening again and again. The Western Ghats, to which every disaster was somehow related, needed to be considered a spiritual entity, rather than as a commercial entity in order to conserve it.

133,2020/01/18,No State can say it won’t implement CAA: Sibal,"Kozhikode: Congress leader Kapil Sibal thinks it is unconstitutional for any State to say that it will not implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). It is going to be problematic, he said while attending a session on ‘The Idea of India’ at the Kerala Literature Festival on Saturday.

“This is a national legislation, we should not be scoring political points,” Mr. Sibal told senior journalist John Brittas.

“You must know that if the CAA is passed, no State can say that I will not implement it. That is not possible... You can oppose it. You can pass a resolution in the Assembly and ask the Central government to say please withdraw it,” he pointed out. But, a State saying that it would not implement the legislation was going to “create more difficulties”. Asked about the ongoing tug-of-war between Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the State government, Mr. Sibal said Mr. Khan should read the Indian Constitution.

“So what we need to do is to politically get together. Fight this battle and let the Congress lead the charge,” Mr. Sibal said. He also admitted that the Opposition need to get its act together, and it had not been able to do that. “Some body will emerge from the people of this country to lead the movement,” he said. The senior Congress leader, however, claimed that regional parties with national ambitions was one of the major problems that such a movement would face.

Mr. Sibal said that the young people who were part of the anti-CAA campaign did not have any political agenda. They were there because of the lack of future they see here for themselves, he said.

The Congress leader compared the country to a car, whose three tyres, executive, legislature and the media, were dysfunctional. The fourth tyre, the judiciary, he said, functions occasionally. Mr. Sibal also suggested that a better model should be brought in for media to dismantle its link with the industry. This, because, the industry was dependent on the government, which can control it, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-state-can-say-it-wont-implement-caa-sibal/article30595365.ece
134,2020/01/18,24.5 lakh children to be given OPV today,"Kerala will go along with the national policy and participate in a round of Pulse Polio immunisation drive on Sunday, when 24.5 lakh children below the age of five years in the State will be given oral polio vaccine (OPV) on the same day.

Last year, it was after much deliberations on the polio threat perception particular to the Kerala that the State Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (STAGI), recommended that Kerala need not join the routine Pulse Polio drive.

Migrant workers

Thus last year’s Pulse Polio drive only involved OPV administration to some 25,000 children of migrant labourers in the State.

This year too, STAGI does not believe that the situation has changed. However, it has advised the Health Department to go along with the national policy and to participate in the Pulse Polio drive on Sunday.

“Routine immunisation (RI) continues to be poor across India and even in Kerala, the status of RI is not as good as what we would like it to be. In such circumstances, we cannot discount the fact that our polio-free status could be really under threat because of the circulation of wild polio virus in the neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have thus recommended that we follow the Union Health Ministry’s policy this year year and participate in Pulse Polio campaign. However, we have also reiterated that this PP drive should be used as an opportunity to assess the actual routine immunisation status of our children,” a senior STAGI member told The Hindu.

“Ideally, an intensive campaign is needed to identify all the pockets in the State where the RI is poor and provide injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) to all children. But the distribution and reach of IPV continues to be a problem and even when we are on the verge of polio eradication, we still have a susceptible population,” said K.K. Purushothaman, Head of Paediatrics, Thrissur Government Medical College.

Worrying facts

The flaring up of cases of wild polio virus (Type 1) in Pakistan, the increased circulation of the mutated circulating vaccine-derived polio virus Type 2 in African nations and the reporting of a case of “rare strain of circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV) Type 1” in Malaysia in December 2019 — that too , after a gap of 27 years — are facts which the Union Health Ministry has flagged.

RI status

The current status of RI in Kerala — proportion of fully immunised children — is put at 90.8% .

For the State to confidently decide to do away with Pulse Polio, the RI status has to be at least 95% so that there is absolutely no threat of polio virus (the circulating vaccine-derived polio virus, which is a mutated virus from the OPV itself, appears whenever the immunisation status in the community goes down).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/245-lakh-children-to-be-given-opv-today/article30594830.ece

K-RERA has now come out with detailed guidelines regarding the disclosure of information for registering projects under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. Although more than 30 developers have applied for registration, insufficient data in the applications had prompted the real estate watchdog to issue a simplified check-list of documents required, a senior official said.

Under the law, all real estate projects and real estate agents need to be registered with the State-level RERA concerned. So far, only three projects have been successfully registered with the Kerala authority. Formally launched on January 1, K-RERA has given promoters time till March 31 to register projects that are underway in the State.

As per the checklist, developers are expected to disclose information about projects launched during the past five years, cases and pending payments. Other data required include detailed description of the land to be developed, copies of building permit, sanctioned plan/layout approvals and facilities proposed as part of the project such as provision for firefighting, drinking water and renewable energy use and detailed floor plans and site plan.

136,2020/01/18,Cong. may be forced to takeover Kuttanad seat,"Notwithstanding a temporary freeze on the ‘two leaves’ symbol imposed by the Election Commission of India, the fight within the Kerala Congress (M) over Kuttanad is now entering a crucial phase with both factions kick starting their pre-election works in the Assembly constituency.

While the group led by Jose K. Mani has already constituted a committee to finalise the list of probable candidates, the rival camp has begun works by organising a farmers’ protest at Mankombu the other day.

The Mani faction maintains that the seat was given to it in 2011 following deliberations within the UDF when the Congress wanted to contest from Punalur. The Joseph group, on the other hand, holds that the seat belonged to it since the Assembly election of 1980.

Interestingly, both groups assert the support of the Congress, the leading partner in the UDF, in their respective claims over the seat.

A two-day leadership meeting of the Jose faction, which concluded at Charalkunnu the other day, decided to move ahead with campaign activities in connection with the Kuttanad byelection.

The meeting constituted a five-member sub-committee to take a decision on the byelection, including finding a suitable candidate. The committee headed by Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, will have senior leaders Joseph M. Puthusseri, V.C. Francis, V.T. Joseph and Jacob Thomas Arikupuram as its members.

Mr. Joseph, on the other hand, appears determined not to give up this time and has taken off with a protest meet of farmers, which sought to raise the minimum support price for paddy. The event, attended by senior KC(M) leaders, including Mons Joseph, MLA, and Joy Abraham, also drew participation of District Congress Committee president M. Liju.

“We have been holding the seat ever since the formation of the Joseph group in 1979 and it was the KC(M) founder K.M. Mani, who issued a whip for me to contest in the Assembly election of 2016,” said Joseph Abraham, a front runner of the seat from the Joseph group.

Meanwhile, a demand by the Kerala Congress (Jacob) to field Johnny Nellore as a consensus candidate has given more headaches to the Congress, which is striving hard to bring in consensus among the warring KC(M) factions.

The observers pointed out that a win for the KC(M) candidate under the ‘two leaves’ symbol would change the parliamentary position of the warring factions. “Both camps will not like themselves to be in such a situation and hence the fight this time is going to be as intense as in Pala. In such a situation, it is highly likely for the Congress to intervene and settle the issue by taking over the seat as a temporary measure,’’ they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/983kpw/article30596307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kuttanad-map-revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cong-may-be-forced-to-takeover-kuttanad-seat/article30594585.ece
137,2020/01/18,CPI(M) mouthpiece slams Kerala Governor for “anti-government” stand,"As the war of words between Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the Left government intensified, the CPI(M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani on Saturday slammed him for making “political statements” and alleged he was “threatening” the State in a “tough language“.

In a hard-hitting editorial, it said the governor who spoke to the media here and in Delhi without understanding the stature of the position being held by him, was making “political statements.”

In a lengthy report titled “Governor’s political game”, it said the Governor is a person who should act in accordance with the Constitution and above personal preferences.

Enraged over the mass participation of people in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Kerala, Mr. Khan was “threatening” the state in a “tough language”, it alleged.

The editorial attacked Mr. Khan for coming out in public against the LDF government and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for not informing him before moving the apex court against the CAA and for not signing the ordinance regarding the local self government ward delimitation.

“The attempt is to establish a precedence that the State has no independent power and it should await the Governor’s permission even for constitutionally guaranteed rights,” it said.

The Constitution does not mandate the State government to inform every decision to the Governor. This is evident in Article 167 of the Constitution, the editorial pointed out.

The Chief Minister has only the constitutional obligation to inform the decisions of the State cabinet, and not the daily decisions of the government, the daily stated.

Justifying the anti-CAA resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly, the newspaper said it was “legal” and “passed in accordance with the rules and regulations.”

“There is no need to inform the governor in advance before the resolution is passed,” it added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/t6uo2x/article30590940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvgad01-guverGJQ708E643jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-mouthpiece-slams-kerala-governor-for-anti-government-stand/article30592651.ece
138,2020/01/18,"CAA appeal: Governor’s ‘apprehension’ misplaced, says Kerala Minister","Kerala Law Minister A.K. Balan on Saturday said Governor Arif Muhammad Khan’s “apprehension” that the government had flouted rules of governance by keeping him in the dark about its decision to appeal the citizenship law in the Supreme Court appeared misplaced.

Speaking to reporters at the venue of the CPM central secretariat here, Mr. Balan said the government had sought legal opinion to allay Mr. Khan’s concerns.

This government has a legal obligation to answer his questions. It has in no way infringed on the rights of the gubernatorial office or attempted to lower its esteem in the public eye.

(The Governor said on Friday that he would seek a report from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as to why he was not informed about the appeal as per the rules of business of administration.)

Mr. Balan said the rules specified that the government should “inform” the Governor only on measures adopted in matters that involve a “confrontation” between the State and the Centre. Even on such issues, the State government did not require the “assent” of the Governor to act.

Mr. Balan said the Kerala government was not in conflict with the Centre.

It had invoked the provisions of Article 131 of the Constitution to file a civil suit in the SC against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act enacted by Parliament and signed into law by the President.

(The CAA seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslim religious minorities facing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.)

Kerala had argued the law violated Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution.

The provisions guaranteed equality before the law, protection of life and personal liberty, freedom of conscience and freedom of profession and freedom to practise and propagate the religion of an individual’s choice. Kerala was the first State in the Union to do so.

Mr. Balan said the SC was considering the State’s petition. The apex court had not rejected the lawsuit on the ground that the State had not taken the prior sanction of the Governor to invoke Article 131.

The Law Minister appeared to have struck a placatory tone in the government’s ongoing and politically volatile dispute with the Governor on the CAA issue.

Mr .Balan’s reply was in stark contrast to an editorial in the CPM mouthpiece Deshabhimani, which accused Mr. Khan of overstepping his constitutional bounds.

Mr. Khan on Friday held Mr Vijayan responsible for the “lapse”, and said he had a legal obligation to ensure that the “constitutional machinery in the State did not collapse”.

Mr. Khan appeared to have had ratcheted up his dispute with the government over the CAA in the run-up to his Republic Day address and the opening of the budget session of the Legislative Assembly on January 31. He had also apparently taken the fight to the Chief Minister’s doorstep.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/b5trau/article28239655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-KI-BALAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caa-appeal-governors-apprehension-misplaced-says-kerala-minister/article30592184.ece

The two, hailing from Thiruvithancode near Nagercoil, had shot at Special Sub Inspector Wilson using a pistol and stabbed him when he was on duty at the Kaliyakavilai checkpoint on the border with Kerala on January 8.

141,2020/01/18,Beef delicacy tweet by Kerala Tourism kicks up a row,"After a storm erupted over a “beef fry” tweet by Kerala Tourism on Makarasankranti day, the CPI(M)-led LDF government on Friday clarified its aim was not to hurt anyone’s religious beliefs.

Slamming the State, BJP MP from Udupi Shobha Karandlaje tweeted, “Kerala communist govt have declared a war against Hindus of the state!”

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran criticised those who were trying to give a communal colour to the Tourism department tweet on the Kerala delicacy — “Beef Ularthiyathu” and said in the southern State none links food with religion.

“Tender chunks of beef, slow-roasted with aromatic spices, coconut pieces, and curry leaves. A recipe for the most classic dish, Beef Ularthiyathu, the stuff of legends, from the land of spices, Kerala,” the tweet read along with a recipe link.

Some Twitter users had showed their displeasure as the tweet had appeared on January 15 on Makarsankranti day, a Hindu festival celebrated as Pongal, Bihu and Lohri in other parts of the country.

Mr. Surendran said those trying to communalise the matter were the ones who were creating a controversy by saying that pictures of pork dishes should also be uploaded by the department. Various dishes made of pork are already on the website, he pointed out.

Another Twitter user wrote: “Are you out of your mind? on Pongal and Sankranti when we revere Cows, Oxen, and Cattle for their contribution to mankind’s easy existence and culture... on one hand we have Gangireddula meLam in Telugu states, Jallikattu in TN, and Kambala races in Karnataka and you showcase this.”

The licences of driver Vijeesh and conductor Latheesh were suspended by RTO Biju James as per the FIR.

According to the Meenangadi police, the incident occurred on Thursday evening when Joseph, 54, of Morkalayil in Kariyampadi and his daughter Neethu, 22, were travelling from Sulthan Bathery to Anpathinalam Mile near Meenangady in a private bus heading to Kalpetta from Sultan Bathery.

While Mr. Joseph alighted from the bus at Anpathinalam Mile, Neethu fell down as the driver reportedly moved the bus even before she got down. However, the girl escaped with minor injuries on her arm.

Later, when Mr. Joseph boarded the bus to question the reckless action of the driver, the conductor pushed him off the vehicle. His legs came under the rear wheels of the bus resulting in multiple fractures.

His knee cap was also crushed in the incident, the police said.

144,2020/01/18,Thrissur gears up to become first digital district,"Thrissur will soon become the first district in the State that adopts digital platform for all economic transactions.

The Reserve Bank of India has directed to choose one district in each State to facilitate total digital transactions as part of the Digital India programme of the Union government.

To be replicated

All economic transactions in the district will be shifted to the digital platform within eight months. The programme will be extended to other districts in the future.

The objective is to discourage the use of paper currency. Thrissur will become total digital currency district by September 30, according to District Collector S. Shanawas.

Many benefits

All transactions in government institutions will become digital. Welfare pensions and other assistance given by government departments will also become digital. The public can start zero-balance accounts in banks.

A committee led by the District Collector and manager of the district lead bank will monitor the developments. Canara Bank has the responsibility to implement the programme.

An initial survey will be held to find how many people are currently making digital transactions. Separate surveys will be held for individuals and business establishments.

The survey will be completed in two months. Training for volunteers has already stared.

Awareness programmes will held for the public. Economic literacy counsellors have been functioning in various blocks in the district. They will conduct classes for the public with the support of digital departments of banks. Awareness programmes will be held at colleges and schools too.

Card-swiping machines will be set up at government and private institutions. The digitalisation programme will be implemented first at the Collectorate itself.

145,2020/01/18,Chennithala sees govt.doublespeak on NPR,"Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Friday alleged that the government was indulging in doublespeak on updating of the National Population Register (NPR), despite promising that the State will not participate in the process being carried out as part of the 2021 census operations.

Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Chennithala said tahsildars across the State were in the process of taking steps for updating the NPR on the basis of a government circular.

He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had retracted from an earlier circular on the NPR in July-August after the UDF created a hue and cry over this. The government issued another order annulling its earlier diktat on December 20.

However, it did not withdraw another order issued by its secret section on November 12 last year on the basis of the Census Department’s proposal that the NPR updating will be carried out along with the census operations. The tahsildars were now taking steps on the basis of this order.

Mr. Chennithala saw red in the government’s action and alleged that Mr. Vijayan, who had made tall claims that the State will not budge an inch on the NPR, was trying be a “gentleman before Prime Minister Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah by quietly permitting it”.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chennithala-sees-govtdoublespeak-on-npr/article30589989.ece
146,2020/01/18,Governor to seek report from Chief Minister,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said he would seek a report from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as to why the State government had kept him in the dark about its decision to challenge the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court (SC).

Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Mr. Khan held Mr. Vijayan responsible for the “lapse” and said he had a legal obligation to ensure that the “Constitutional machinery in the State did not collapse”.

Mr. Khan appeared to have ratcheted up his dispute with the government over the CAA in the run-up to his Republic Day address and the opening of the budget session of the Assembly on January 31. He has also apparently taken the fight to the doorstep of Mr. Vijayan.

The Chief Minister was “duty-bound” under the Rules of Business of the government to submit specified category of cases that concerned Centre-State relations or involved the Supreme Court to the Governor before he took any decision on the matter.

“I am the Constitutional head of the government. The buck has to stop somewhere,” he said.

Some might argue that the State merely required to keep the Governor involved. “Even if we accepted that argument, I was not even informed that the government is going to the Supreme Court to challenge a Central law, which is none of the concern of the State,” he said.

‘Nobody is supreme’

The Chief Minister should decide who was responsible for the breach. “He should realise that we are not living in the colonial period. Nobody is supreme. Be you ever so high, the law is still higher than thee,” he said. Mr. Vijayan had on Thursday taken an oblique dig at Mr. Khan by stating that the era of British Residency and Regent were over.

Mr. Khan said the business of the government should not be held ransom to the whims and fancies of an individual or a political party. The Chief Minister should not think he has the “right to distort rules simply because he is in that position.” He hoped the government would reform itself.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-to-seek-report-from-chief-minister/article30589983.ece
147,2020/01/18,Winners of the Karnataka State Film Awards share what it means to receive the honour,"The Karnataka State Film Awards have been announced. And it comes as no surprise to see director P Shehsadri’s name again on the winning list. He won the Puttanna Kanagal Award for Lifetime Achievement as director.

A postgraduate in Kannada literature, Sheshadri did a short stint as a journalist before venturing into cinema and has made umpteen serials, documentaries and tele-films.

Sheshadri makes films on contemporary issues and received national and international acclaim for most of his films.

Sheshadri had earlier received the Puttanna Kanagal Award from the Karnataka Film Directors’ Association in 1993, when he worked as an associate director for TS Nagabharana’s Chinnari Mutta.

Sheshadri followed in Kanagal’s footsteps — his films were mostly based on literary works. Five of Sheshadri’s films, including Munnudi, Bettada Jeeva, Mohanadasa Bheti, are also based on literary works.

About winning the award an elated Sheshadri said, “It is a moment of mixed feelings. I am both happy and embarrassed in a way and humbly accept the honour bestowed on me. I dedicate this award to all the artistes and technicians who have worked with me and helped me to grow as a filmmaker.”

He has another reason to celebrate as his latest film, Mookajjiya Kanasugalu not only crossed 50 days in theatres, but also won the Best Screenplay Award.

Srinivasa Murthy in the spotlight

After 45 years of working in the Kannada film industry as an actor, television serial director, producer, J Krishnappa Srinivasa Murthy, won the prestigious Dr Rajkumar Award. He has carved a niche for himself in Kannada cinema by essaying historical and emotional characters and is one of the most sought-after artistes in the industry.

Who can forget his debut in Hemavathi, directed by the legendary Siddalingaiah in 1977? The film was an inter-caste love story. The actor has in the past received laurels for his acting prowess in Kavirathna Kalidasa and Hosa Belaku, both with Rajkumar.

Rajkumar and Sreenivasa Murthy not only shared the screen but also a close friendship off it too.

Srinivasa Murthy also produced movies with his friend Jai Jagadish and has produced serials on the life of poets and saints of Karnataka.

About being conferred with the award, he said, “I should have got this award long ago. I am happy that I did get it after 43 years. It is a huge moment for me.”

Winning despite odds

Raghavendra Rajkumar is all smiles after he won the Best Actor award for his role in Ammana Mane, directed by Nikhil Manjoo. The film was the actor’s first after a 15 year break from the industry.

After Pakkadamane Hudugi, directed by MS Rajashekar in 2004, he did not act due to health issues. One can say that Ammana Mane gave the actor a new lease of life in films.

Raaganna, as he is popularly known, dedicated this award to Nikhil. “Winning an award is a different thing. I was apprehensive of returning to films, dues to my health issues. Returning to the screen is just like a player playing his second innings. This award heightens my responsibility as an actor,” says Raaganna who also wished that his parents were around to share his joy. Raganna will next be seen with Dhruva Sarja in Pogaru.

Stunning visuals

Cinematographer BS Basavaraj is the winner of the Dr Vishnuvardhan Award.

A product of Karnataka’s première film institute of the 60s, Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic, Basavaraj has worked with cinematographers such as VK Murthy, Rajendra Malone and DV Rajaram. He has also worked as a DOP with Puttanna Kanagal, Siddalingiah, TS Nagabharana, V Somashekar and Phani Ramachandra.

Basavaraj did not restrict himself to Kannada films, but has worked in other language films.

He is known for his picturesque visuals in Kanagals’ Manasa Sarovara, and for capturing the essence of Malnad in Amrutha Ghalige.

He has assisted his teacher-mentor, DV Rajaram in Bhootayyana Maga Ayyu.

Basavaraj is also a documentary filmmaker and has made documetaries on cinematographers including RNK Prasad, DV Rajaram and filmmaker N Lakshminarayan. Now he is planning make a documentary on Govind Nihalani.

A look at the list of Karnataka State Film Awards shows a domination of offbeat films. Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale Kasargod, Koduge Ramanna Rai, Ondalla Eradalla, Ammachiyemba Nenapu, Aa Karala Rathri, Santa Kavi Kanakadasara Ramadhanya, Ondalla Eradalla, Bayalatada Bheemanna, Choorikatte are among the films that have bagged awards in various sections.

On the other hand Nathicharami directed by Manjunatha Somakeshava Reddy (Mansore), which bagged five National Awards, did not figure in any category in the State awards.

148,2020/01/18,Everyone is doing the ‘Dinga Dance’ from viral Kannada song,"Suddho Roy was born in Kolkata, studied in Darjeeling and works in Bengaluru. The Bengali film composer has now forayed into Kannada films and his title track for Dinga, directed by Abhishek Jain, has gone viral. Not only has the song garnered over 1 million views on YouTube, it also has over 1.9 million TikTok videos as the “Dinga Dance”.

Suddho is all smiles. “I am thrilled to bits. TikTok is normally known for comedy and re-enacting old film songs but it has drawn enough attention to my work. The response has been amazing,” he says. Ask him what is special about this song and he says, “For one, it has a Western beat throughout and only in the end it has this thapaang Indian beat. It is this end part that has gone viral,” laughs Suddho, who credits singer-composer Arjun Janya for “rendering this quirky song so beautifully for me”.

Dinga is Suddho’s third Kannada venture. The first two being Murkal Estate and a yet-to-release Kannada film. He has also composed music for a web series titled Loose Connections by RJ Pradeepa and Sakkat Studios, and for Pradeepa and Shivarajkumar’s web series Hate You Romeo featuring actor Arvind Iyer.

About his association with Pradeepa, Suddho says, “I was working on creating spoof videos for an online platform. That was when Pradeepa connected with me asked me to compose the music.” Coming back to Dinga, Suddho says, “Even I have sung a song in this film and having Arjun sing a song was a great experience. He heard the entire album (all the songs were sung by me initially) and was impressed. He was so busy and yet made time to sing this song for Dinga. He even made time to be present at the film’s audio launch,” beams the composer, who has earlier worked with singers such as Shaan and Sonu Nigam who have sung his songs for Bengali films, most of which feature actor Jeet.

On the very beginning — his days of struggle, he says, “I would create music and randomly tag film production teams online. One day, I tagged Jeet. Among the many I had tagged, he was the only one who got back. He had liked one of my demos,” says Suddho, who is today a regular in almost all of Jeet’s productions. About tagging producers and directors online, Suddho explains, “It was unusual route as I wanted to take a shortcut and not go through the grind of working as an assistant, associate and all that...”.

The first film with Jeet was for Badshah. Then came Abhimaan and Panther. One song titled ‘Selfie’ sung by Sonu Nigam topped the charts in Kolkata.

Yet, the struggle continues and to keep himself financial afloat, Suddho works in an international insurance company at Manyata Tech Park. Doesn’t film music pay well? “The music industry has evolved but the economics of it has changed. Earlier, we had cassette sales, which brought in huge remuneration. Today, everything is free online. So financially, it gets a bit stagnant. But, our usual source of income is from stage shows. Once in a way I open shows for Jeet too.”

He also adds that his upbringing in different cities has helped him understand the culture and given him exposure to various genres of music. Yet he states that he avoids listening to too much music. “I spend most of my time creating music and am learning to play the flute now,” says the BBM graduate, who has also created jingles for radio station Red FM.

Is he open to working in other language films apart from Bengali and Kannada? “Of course. But before that I need to learn to speak the language. I speak fluent Kannada and learning the language makes a difference as you understand the words and the emotions associated with them.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3rp4zm/article30593665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMROY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/everyone-is-doing-the-dinga-dance/article30593672.ece
149,2020/01/18,"Ravi Teja-starrer ‘Disco Raja’ is a cocktail of ideas, says director Vi Anand","Disco Raja is releasing on the January 24 by which time the storm created by Sankranti biggies would have settle down. However, director Vi Anand says Disco Raja is an extended festival film.

The story is set in the 80s. Ravi Teja plays a gangster who loves disco music, is a fan of Mithun Chakraborty, and is full of attitude and swag. The crazy character gels with Ravi Teja’s body language and the energetic roles that he usually plays. “When I told him I have a script called ‘Disco Raja’, he let me narrate it. After Tiger released, he was one of the first actors who appreciated me. I always went for concept stories which are not his cup of tea. For this film which is a science fiction drama, he understood the balance between commerce and concept. He was looking for something different and I was at the right time and place,” says Anand.

Says Anand, “At the end of the day the film has to entertain. I tried a cocktail of different ideas and it tasted well, I thought people would enjoy it too. You won’t get stuck with the concept, you just move on. Yet, without the concept the film cannot exist, it won’t be exciting.”

Vi Anand

There are three heroines in the story. Tanya Hope plays a scientist in a ‘re-live’ lab, a neurologist and scientist along with Sishir Sharma and Vennela Kishore. Nabha Natesh plays the hero’s current lover, a typical Delhi girl, vibrant and energetic. Payal Rajput plays Helen, she is the retro interest; the director made sure all had an arc and play a sensible part when they come at various stages in his life.

Bobby Simha also plays a powerful role that has a proper graph. The director describes him as a perfect choice. “Be it his appearance and subtlety, he suited the script to the hilt. Born and brought up in Chennai, he speaks Telugu but not like we speak in Hyderabad.”

Even Vennela Kishore’s presence has a logic, says Anand . “If I tell you the synopsis, I’d have to reveal everything so I can’t say anything.”

Ravi Teja loved being Disco Raja and enjoyed every moment on the sets, says Anand who also reveals that on Thaman’s suggestion, Ravi Teja even sang in the film. Art director Nagendran who had worked on Anand’s Okka Kshanam earlier delivered a good output, despite budget constraints. Apart from colour and sensibilities, he pleased the director with his logical explanations. For the retro shots, Anand who is an architect, gave him inputs about the flooring and other interiors. A good amount of research went into creating visuals that will transport people to an era and cinematographer Kartik Ghattamaneni added value. Anand’s last films have been good but this one got bigger budget wise and gave him more scope to express himself. The shoot took place in Goa, Iceland, Manali, Delhi and Hyderabad.

The retro number ‘Nuvvu natho yemannavo’ has already become popular. The film is basically not a love story, it is just a part but the director had a challenge to squeeze in the love element. He recalls, “I had to squeeze the part that the lead pair fall in love by the time the song ends. We recreated Ilayaraja’s retro magic and Thaman was in full form..Seetarama Sastry on his part, took it seriously and took a lot of time to understand the story and write. The butterfly on the poster indicates something important in the film.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yejciq/article30593330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/disco-raja,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ravi-teja-starrer-disco-raja-is-a-cocktail-of-ideas-says-director-vi-anand/article30593331.ece
150,2020/01/18,Imtiaz Ali’s ‘Love Aaj Kal’ could become a franchise series,"Director Imtiaz Ali on Friday teased that he could turn his upcoming film Love Aaj Kal into a franchise if he finds a new story to tell in the future.

The film is a follow-up to Imtiaz’s 2009 movie, featuring Saif Ali Khan. The new film with Kartik Aaryan and Saif’s daughter Sara Ali Khan also explores two stories set in different time periods. The follow-up, which also features Randeep Hooda and debutante Arushi Sharma, is set in 1990 and 2020.

At the trailer launch of the film, Imtiaz explained the rationale behind keeping the title of the new film same as its predecessor.

“I feel this is franchisable idea. I have made two films with the same title because after ten years, the basis on which I made the earlier film has changed. I am getting the opportunity to say it in a newer way.

“If we think we can maybe take it ahead in the future after a few years, if the process of the relationship (has evolved) and if there is something new to tell, a new story, then we will try to say it,” Imtiaz told reporters here.

Imtiaz said he maybe still searching for answers about the relevance of love, he is aware of its power.

“I don’t know what the relevance of love is but everything in universe moves because of it. Love turns the universe around. I am at a certain age or when I was younger, I feel everybody goes through the same cycle. They have the same questions in their minds and you have knowledge of when and how it was when you were at that age. But it is not easy to say it and for somebody to follow it and correct your life.

“In some sort, it is my way of saying it to the younger generation what I understand about this question that you asked me at this age. Not that I can tell them what to do but I can show them who I am,” the filmmaker said.

Imtiaz also believes that the definition of love has certainly changed a lot in recent years.

“The relationship that now happens is different from what it used to be. So Love Aaj Kal comes. Things are fast moving. But the reason why a boy and girl come together hasn’t changed,” he added.

The director, who originally hails from Jamshedpur, said it makes him extremely happy to be able to tell the stories that he wants to.

“I come from a place where my tastes are common. What you call commercial, I don’t have to work towards it, it is there within me. I am here to tell a good story,” he adds.

Love Aaj Kal is scheduled to be released on February 14.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/haqpkq/article30593291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/loveaaj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/imtiaz-alis-love-aaj-kal-could-become-a-franchise-series/article30593292.ece
151,2020/01/18,Jinu Joseph on finding his space in ‘Anchaam Pathira’,"When producer Aashiq Usman and director Midhun Manuel Thomas approached Jinu Joseph to discuss his role in the whoddunit Anchaam Paathira, which is running to packed theatres, it wasn’t for the character he eventually landed up essaying — a cop — instead, it was for the role of a priest. “They met me, we discussed the film and I agreed. Some time later Aashiq, who is also a friend, called and told me they wanted me to do a larger, full length role. I have no idea why they chose me, must be my personality,” the actor jokes.

Jinu’s performance as the laid-back policeman, one of his first full length roles, has been getting encouraging feedback. But there is also criticism on his dialogue delivery, which he believes is necessary. “I can’t be hearing all good things.” His Malayalam diction, he confesses, is not what he would like it to be, but he is working on it and, for this film, he made an effort to get it right. A reason is that a large part of his schooling was outside Kerala, “Usually I get the transliterated version (of the script) and I speak colloquial Malayalam. Not the Malayalam spoken in films. For this film, I got the script in Malayalam, and read it in the language. I have put in a lot of effort for the film. It works when the director has confidence in me. Midhun threw me into the deep end as actor.”

The character is not black and white. As homework, he met a deputy superintendent of police, “To figure out how to salute and to get the body language right. And the rest I worked based on what one has seen of policemen.”

Jinu, who started his career with Amal Neerad, has been part of films such Virus, Varathan, Anwar, Chaapa Kurishu, Neelakaasham Pachakadal Chuvannabhumi, Iyyobinte Pusthakam, Rani Padmini, Usthad Hotel and some others. His friendship with actor Vinayakan led him to his first film, Big B and to this career. Even after the first film, he wasn’t entirely convinced if he wanted to act. It all changed after Sagar Alias Jackkyy, “Vinayan (Vinyakan) and I went for the film — first day, first show. When we got out, we were mobbed, my shirt was ripped off me.” That is when he decided he wanted to be part of films, to have his name etched in pop culture.

Jinu’s top three Chappa Kurishu : I dubbed for my character, Tony Sebastian, myself. It was one of my first films.

Iyyobinte Pusthakam : A lot of work went into it, it was three months of continuous work. On a lighter note, I still have a leech bite mark from its filming.

Rani Padmini : I was working with Manju Warrier, who has acted with all the top people. But after that film I became her fan. She is a wonderful person and puts people at ease.

With this film, he literally moves out of his comfort zone of working with friends. In his 12 plus years as actor, barring a couple of films such as Vikadakumaran, the 45-year-old has acted in films directed by friends such as Amal Neerad, Shyju Khalid, Aashiq Abu and others. “I have started to do films where there are not too many people I know. Initially I was not comfortable on a film set where I didn’t know people, but now I am doing different things, meeting different people.” Choosing to work with other directors is a sign of gaining confidence and it has paid off as Anchaam Paathira shows. There are insecurities, some which have kept him away from films by senior directors but not any more, now he is willing to explore those opportunities too.

Among his future releases is Anwar Rasheed’s Trance, which hits theatres next month.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mmqtik/article30592726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPJINUJOSEPH1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/as-anil-madhavan-the-cop-in-anchaam-pathira-anil-madhavan-actor-jinu-joseph-comes-into-his-own-as-actor/article30592729.ece
152,2020/01/18,Bong Joon-ho: ‘Marvel and I aren’t suitable for each other’,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, one of the most sought-after filmmakers in Hollywood right now, has once again ruled out a plunge into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as he believes the studio and him are not “suitable for each other“.

The director, whose filmmography boasts of movies such as Memories of Murder, Parasite and Snowpiercer, is currently in the centre of attention in Hollywood owing to the smash-hit success of his class satire Parasite. The film is finally is all set to release in India on January 31.

Parasite, which won the coveted Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, is currently vying for six Oscars at the 2020 Academy Awards.

Marvel has a history of being able to seduce indie filmmaker to come into its fold and direct superhero films.

But it seems getting Joon-ho will be a tough cookie to crack for the studio.

“I don’t think Marvel would ever want a director like me. I don’t expect any offers from them anytime soon,” the filmmaker told Variety during the latest episode of its The Big Ticket podcast.

Joon-ho said he liked the works of James Gunn and James Mangold on Guardians of the Galaxy series and Logan respectively, but he is not so inclined to go their way.

“I think there are great directors who can handle great projects like that. The film industry seems complicated, but I think it’s quite simple for directors.

“It’s just best to do what you’re good at. And so I don’t really think Marvel and I are suitable for each other. That’s something I just intuitively feel,” the filmmaker added.

The filmmaker had previously said he hoped to maintain a distance from superhero movies as he was averse to people in tight-fitting clothes.

“I have a personal problem. I respect the creativity that goes into superhero films, but in real life and in movies, I can’t stand people wearing tight-fitting clothes. I’ll never wear something like that, and just seeing someone in tight clothes is mentally difficult.""

“I don’t know where to look, and I feel suffocated. Most superheroes wear tight suits, so I can never direct one. I don’t think anyone will offer the project to me either. If there is a superhero who has a very boxy costume, maybe I can try,” Joon-Ho had said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dtunc4/article30592568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2020FILMINDEPENDENTSPIRITAWARDSNOMINEEBRUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bong-joon-ho-marvel-and-i-arent-suitable-for-each-other/article30592569.ece
153,2020/01/18,‘Sex Education’ Season 2 review: Teen life lessons in the fast lane,"The charming Sex Education brings to mind Richard Curtis movies, if they were set in a high school instead of a bookstore on Notting Hill and Hugh Grant was a high-schooler. All that is expected from the gospel according to Curtis are present and correct. There are the sexual misadventures, the love, the tears and the witty comebacks in proper British accents with wall-to-wall pop music providing a rousing background score.

Like comfort food, all the ingredients including the big competition that a parent makes it to at the last moment, the acerbic, conflicted wheelchair-bound cutie, the gay best friend, the school dance and the musical appear at the appropriate moments. And it is not a bad thing at all.

At the end of Season 1, Otis Milburn, awkward around girls, with trouble masturbating, but no trouble doling out sex advice, kisses Ola. The sex clinic Otis and bad girl Maeve run is in trouble as the two have a falling out and Maeve might be kicked out of school. Adam, headmaster Groff’s son, who bullied Otis’ best friend, Eric, for the longest time, kisses him. Rich, popular and pretty Aimee quits the mean brigade to stand up for Maeve. Headboy and swimming champion Jackson breaks up with Maeve. Lily, who writes alien erotica is no closer to losing her virginity.

The grown-ups from Otis’ commitment-phobic sex therapist mum Jean to her lover Jakob (who is also Ola’s dad) and teachers —Miss Sands, Mr Hendricks and headmaster Groff — have their share of troubles too.

Sex Education Season 2

Episodes: 8

Run time: 46 to 52 minutes

Created by Laurie Nunn

Starring: Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Connor Swindells, Kedar Williams-Stirling, Alistair Petrie, Mimi Keene, Aimee Lou Wood, Chaneil Kular, Simone Ashley, Tanya Reynolds, Mikael Persbrandt, Patricia Allison, James Purefoy

Season 2 opens with a bang with Moordale High in the midst of chlamydia outbreak. Otis is in a relationship and has to stop talking and put all his theory into practice. Adam is sent off to military school, Jean is asked to revise the sex education curriculum at Moordale much to Groff’s disgust. Jackson finds a new interest and Maeve joins the Quizheads. Absent parents Otis’ father Remi and Maeve’s mum, Erin, make an appearance.

New characters introduced this season include Rahim, a transfer student from France who is interested in Eric, Viv, a Brainiac who has no time for friends but coaches Jackson in English and Maths and new boy Steve who become Aimee’s boyfriend. Sex continues to be central to the show with discussions on pansexuality and how to douche. With Otis otherwise occupied, it is Jean who is dispensing advice to worried teenagers and a few grown-ups as well.

The excellent writing from season one continues this time around with arcs staying true to the character, and not going off on random tangents just for ratings or to push the story along. For instance, no one but Lily could have designed and staged that psychedelic sexy version of Romeo and Juliet. Aimee’s reaction to the incident on the bus also rings true as does her decision to bake cakes.

The acting is top notch. Leading the field is Asa Butterfield who makes for a very likeable Otis. Gillian Anderson is pitch perfect as Jean, the mum everyone would love and hate to have. Ncuti Gatwa is a show-stealer as the flamboyant Eric, while Emma Mackey as Maeve has traded her pink hair for black and is as rebellious as ever.

Apart from the big four, Connor Swindells (Adam), Kedar Williams-Stirling (Jackson), Alistair Petrie (Groff), Aimee Lou Wood (Aimee), Tanya Reynolds (Lily), Mikael Persbrandt (Jakob), Patricia Allison (Ola) and James Purefoy (Remi) have breathed life into their roles creating characters we care about. Season 2 ends with many fascinating openings for the next installment, which will be very welcome. It will be another chance to hang out with these cool dudes and dudettes as they figure out important life lessons, as well as the proper time to wait to respond to a text from someone you are interested in.

154,2020/01/18,‘Big Brother’ movie review: Excruciatingly predictable superstar outing,"Writing the kind of lines no one else would even have imagined is a dream for anyone who has picked up the pen. Big Brother, written and directed by Siddique, is filled with such lines, placed in situations where one would never imagine them.

Big Brother Starring: Mohanlal,Arbaaz Khan, Honey Rose

Direction: Siddique

The best of the lot comes early on, when Satchidanandan (Mohanlal) comes out of jail after 24 long years. One would expect an emotional sequence on seeing his younger brother Manu (Sarjano Khalid), who fought a long battle for his release, waiting outside eagerly. But, the very first thing Manu says is: “Oh brother! How handsome you are!” Even considering the fact that it is mandatory to praise the looks and intelligence of the superstars in all their films, this was quite an absurd placement of that customary line.

If that sequence was not enough, we are taken to the next one where the whole family is waiting for him at home, to break into a tacky dance song. An attempt is made to create some humour with his awkwardness in dealing with social situations, conditioned by years behind bars, a topic that should have been portrayed sensitively. These and the latter attempts at humour by the protagonist’s sidekicks evoke only boredom.

Superhuman too?

Not that the ‘serious’ part is any better.

While Satchidanandan plans to settle down to a peaceful life with his family, he is forced to get involved in many a conflict, after an IPS officer (Arbaaz Khan) launches a hunt against the drug mafia.

The twist in the tale is so evident for anyone who has watched the trailer, except of course for Satchidanandan, who gets it only at the end. The rest of us have to endure almost three hours of sheer agony, to be shown that big reveal, which we had known right from the beginning. Even diehard fans of Mohanlal would find it hard to get excited by even a single sequence in Big Brother.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b4ty0r/article30591826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvBigBrother,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/big-brother-movie-review-excruciatingly-predictable-superstar-outing/article30591827.ece

At G.R. Palayam in the Anaikattu block of Vellore district, it was held with much fanfare. As many as 150 bulls were on the track in designated routes. An estimated crowd of 10,000 gathered to witness the event.

According to organisers at Panamadangi village in the district, “Eruthu vidum vizha was held at Anaicut, Panamadangi, Munjurpet, and Keezhmuttukkoor village in K.V. Kuppam since Thursday. The district administration has imposed a number of new rules in the conduct of the sport. We have ensured all arrangements were made for the smooth conduct of the sport.”

In Anaikattu, about 150 bulls were brought by farmers for the race. Cheered by the youth and children the bulls ran at full tilt.

A bull race was also organised in Keezh Arasampet village, where hundreds of bulls took part for the the big prize money announced by sponsors of the event.

In Kalnarsampatti village in Tirupattur district a bull race was conducted under tight security. Tirupattur Collector M.P. Sivanarul read out the pledge to the participants before the race started.

156,2020/01/18,Schools must provide barrier-free environment: information panel,"The Tamil Nadu State Information Commission has highlighted the need for providing a barrier-free environment to differently-abled children on school campuses. In an order passed last month, Sate Information Commissioner directed the Chief Education Officer, Chennai, to issue a circular to all schools to establish basic infrastructure for differently-abled children, like ramps, handrails and disabled-friendly toilets under the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.

On a petition filed by M. Ravisankar of Chennai seeking to know details of admission under the Right to Education Act, fee structure and list of amenities provided to differently abled children in two private schools in Chennai, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj took strong exception to the stand taken by Sir Sivaswami Kalalaya Senior Secondary School that they were not a public authority as defined under Section 2(h) of the RTI. The school argued it was part of an NGO and was not substantially financed by the government.

“However, in the interest of openness, transparency and our own standards of governance, we give the information as directed by the District Education Office, Central Chennai,” it said. Reiterating that schools enjoyed various financial concessions from the Central/State governments, the Tamil Nadu Information Commission ruled that private schools too would come under the purview of the RTI Act.

“If a private school, i.e., an unaided school denies these information, parents won’t be able to prove their side before any authorities concerned or court of law,” he observed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/schools-must-provide-barrier-free-environment-information-panel/article30594267.ece
157,2020/01/18,"Darbar discussed in meeting with DMK chief, says K.S. Alagiri","Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Saturday, speaking in a light vein, said he and DMK President M.K. Stalin had discussed Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar in their meeting.

Mr. Alagiri met Mr. Stalin at Anna Arivalayam, as the recent tensions between the two parties have been dominating the news. Reporters posted a slew of questions to him after the meeting.

To a specific question on what was discussed in today’s meeting, he replied that they discussed Darbar, which evoked laughter. “Mr. Stalin said Darbar movie was good and asked me whether I have watched. I told him, I have not watched it yet,” Mr. Alagiri said.

Actor Rajinikanth’s remark at the Tamil magazine Thuglak’s 50th anniversary function that those reading Murasoli can be identified with the DMK, and those reading Thuglak can be termed as intellectual had stirred a controversy.

Asked about the remark, Mr. Alagiri said it would have been genuine slip from Rajinikanth. “He should not have compared both. I don’t think his remarks are intentional,” he said.

To actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s remark that he had predicted the rift between DMK-Congress, Mr. Alagiri alleged that the actor was playing a double game. On the one hand, Mr. Kamal claims he is a secular force and on the other hand he was seeking support from Rajinikanth even after knowing that the later is tilting towards the BJP, the TNCC Chief said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/darbar-discussed-in-meeting-with-dmk-chief-says-ks-alagiri/article30593218.ece

Mr. Alagiri met Mr. Stalin at Anna Arivalayam in the wake of the recent tensions between the two parties. The Congress leader insisted that the alliance would continue for the 2021 Assembly elections and beyond.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin took note of the clarification issued by Mr. Alagiri and said that in future, cadre of both parties should avoid talking about differences of opinion in public.

The friction between the alliance partners started after Mr. Alagiri and Congress Legislature Party leader K.R. Ramasamy publicly accused the Dravidian party of not adhering to “coalition dharma” in the recently held rural local body polls. The statement attracted a sharp reaction from DMK treasurer Duraimurugan, who said that the Congress was free to leave the alliance.

159,2020/01/18,Four killed in road accident near Thoothukudi,"Four persons, including two teens and a 23-year-old college student, were killed in a road accident near here around midnight on Friday.

Police said A. Ramya, 17, of Shastri Nagar in Chennai, her brother Virendran, 15 and their friend V. Barghavi, 23, a college student from Nanganallur in Chennai, were going to Tiruchendur to offer special prayers at Lord Subramaniya Swamy Temple. Ramya’s grandparents were following them in another car. When the car reached the rail over-bridge at the SIPCOT Industrial Complex on the outskirts of Thoothukudi around 11.30 p.m., the speeding sedan collided head-on with an oncoming lorry. The rail over-brdidge is being used for one-way traffic flow for the past several years, as road-widening work is not yet completed.

Ramya, Virendran, Barghavi and driver Joevin Remigious, 29, of Tiruchi, were killed on the spot. After the victims’ grandparents alerted the police, the police and fire and rescue services personnel rushed to the spot to retrieve the bodies. While a crane was used to lift the lorry, a recovery van retrieved the mangled remains of the sedan.

The bodies were sent to Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examinations. Police said over-speeding of the car may have caused the accident.

Police said candy and biscuit stockist Santhanam, 52, of Rose Garden in Keezha Aambur, his wife Lakshmi, 47, a teacher with a government-aided school in nearby Pottalpudhur, and their son Arockiya Sridhar, 22, who was working in a private firm, allegedly consumed poison on Wednesday around midnight after celebrating Pongal, as the moneylenders from whom the family had borrowed money exerted pressure on them to settle their loan immediately.

Santhanam and Lakshmi’s daughter Jothi, found her parents and brother battling for life in the early hours of Thursday and alerted the neighbours who rushed them to the hospital. After first-aid, the couple and Sridhar were referred to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital. While Santhanam died on Thursday, Lakshmi died on Friday evening. Sridhar, who was undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit died around Friday midnight.

Police said one of the moneylenders had already forcibly registered the couple’s house in Vickramasingapuram in his name, prompting the couple to move to Rose Garden in Keezha Aambur. As the moneylenders’ threat continued even after the couple had repaid a major portion of the loan with interest, they might have taken the extreme step, the police suspect.

161,2020/01/18,Wait for T.N. BJP president continues; delay disappoints leaders,"The Tamil Nadu BJP’s wait for a new president continues, as contrary to the expectation in party circles, no announcement regarding the post was made on Friday.

BJP sources had said on Thursday that the name of the president-appointee would be announced at a press conference addressed by Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Sidharth Nath Singh in Chennai on Friday.

However, on Friday, Mr. Singh said the new president of the party’s State unit will be appointed “very soon”. “Our Central Parliamentary Party will meet… and with the new [national] president (J.P. Nadda) coming in next week and taking over, a formal announcement will be made,” he said.

“Till this [Friday] morning, we were under the impression that they will announce the [name of the] appointee. We are disappointed,” a state leader said.

The party will now wait for Mr. Nadda to take charge and then seek to evolve a consensus on who will steer the State unit.

On JNU violence

On the violence unleashed on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus and the calls from certain quarters for shutting down the university, Mr Singh said, “I don’t think any senior leader in the BJP has spoken like this. But on anything, everyone has a view; articles are written about [the topic]. The government is of the opinion that JNU is a premier organisation which has given many stalwarts to the country, and the ethos will have to be maintained, and I’m sure the government is committed to it.”

The Uttar Pradesh Minister said the government had not taken steps to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “The BJP as a government has never spoken about the NRC or [said] we are going to implement it,” he said.

When it was pointed out to him that Home Minister Amit Shah had said the NRC will be implemented and that was the official position of the government, he said, “The Prime Minister has made it clear. Whenever it will come, it will be in discussion (sic) with everybody and will be discussed in Parliament.”

“Amit Shah ji has never spoken about the NRC at length in Parliament. He has spoken about the CAA.

When Mr. Chidambaram was the Home Minister, he too had spoken about the NRC. But they never implemented [it]. It has to go through a process,” Mr. Singh said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wait-for-tn-bjp-president-continues-delay-disappoints-leaders/article30589958.ece

Ramasamy.

DVK Coimbatore city unit president Nehrudass alleged that the actor had, at a function organised by the Tamil magazine Thuglak in Chennai on Tuesday, claimed that Periyar had, in 1971, undertaken a rally in Salem in which the images of an unclothed Lord Ram and consort Sita were displayed.

Seeking apology

Alleging that Mr. Rajinikanth was “spreading falsehood”, Mr. Nehrudass sought action against him for promoting enmity between different groups and causing public mischief under Sections 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code.

Mr. Nehrudass sought a public apology from the actor, failing which he said the organisation’s members will stage protests, including at cinemas where the actor’s latest film Darbar was being screened and near his residence in Chennai.

DVK members in Tiruppur submitted a similar petition, demanding action against Mr. Rajinikanth. They submitted the petition to Tiruppur City Commissioner of Police Sanjay Kumar.

Elsewhere, members of the outfit submitted a petition to the Tiruchengode Town police against the actor, alleging that he had deliberately made the comments to defame the Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar.

The petitioners alleged that Mr. Rajinikanth had made assertions about Periyar without any evidence to back up his claims. They said such comments would only cause misunderstandings regarding Periyar among those who believed in God.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w033d5/article30570449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16THUGLAK504,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/complaints-against-rajini-over-remarks-on-periyar/article30589935.ece
163,2020/01/18,Taming bulls to help their sisters tie the knot,"Two years ago, S. Kannan, a daily-wage worker and a bull tamer from Palanganatham, realised that he did not have the wherewithal for his 23-year-old sister’s wedding. Coming to his aid were 10 of his friends, who pooled the articles they had won as prizes at Jallikattu events.

“I managed to marry off my sister by gifting her the refrigerator, stainless steel utensils, electric wet grinder and steel almirah that had been provided by my friends,” Mr. Kannan says.

For the bull tamers who participate in Jallikattu events across the State, the prizes they win are not only a symbol of achievement and pride, but also help them in sponsoring their sisters’ weddings and act as a cushion during times of financial distress.

In the earliest form of the sport, the victor would win the hand of the bull owner if that person is a woman, or the bull owner’s daughter. But over the years, the prize for the successful tamer has morphed into household goods like utensils, almirahs, refrigerators, LED television sets, chairs, brass and silver kuthuvilakkus (lamps) and mattresses. Top tamers are even awarded cars and two-wheelers.

R. Siddiq, a bull tamer from Usilampatti who works as a driver, says each player has a huge collection of articles that he has won over a period of time. “A professional bull tamer participates in at least 50 Jallikattu events a year, in places like Erode, Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Tiruppur,” he says.

Most bull tamers are daily-wage workers who risk life and limb by taking part in Jallikattu, says P. Sakthi, a tamer from Pothumbu. “The prizes I have won are a testament to my talent and valour. But when my family faces a financial crisis, I sell the gold or silver coins to meet their needs,” he says.

Mr. Sakthi, who has taken part in Jallikattu events in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur this year, and has tamed eight bulls and won several prizes, says: “My younger sister, aged 21, will get married within a year. All the articles that I have won will be used to fund her wedding.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jkzsd8/article30589817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA18MDUPRIZES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/taming-bulls-to-help-their-sisters-tie-the-knot/article30589818.ece

165,2020/01/18,Over 100 injured in Jallikattu events across delta districts,"Over 100 people were injured in three Jallikattu events in the delta districts of Tiruchi, Karur and Pudukottai on Friday.

In Avarangadu, the event was jointly organised by villagers of Palakurichi, Kalingapatti, Solayamapatti and Keeranipatti. The event, which lasted over five hours, saw as many as 592 bulls released from the vaadivaasal. As many as 289 tamers took to the arena in batches.

Police sources said two among the injured – a tamer and a spectator – were referred to hospitals. The other 41 injured, including 17 tamers, 14 spectators and 10 bull owners, were treated by the medical team deployed at the venue.

166,2020/01/18,BJP leader mocks Minister’s 24x7 water supply promise,"Karimnagar MP and senior BJP leader Bandi Sanjay Kumar has ridiculed Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar for seeking votes with the promise of 24x7 water supply to the people of Karimnagar town.

Talking to newsmen here on Saturday, Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the Minister had assured 24x7 water supply during the last municipal elections, failing which he wouldn’t ask for votes. “Why is he seeking votes for TRS on an unfulfilled poll promise again,” the MP asked.

The BJP leader seemed confident about his party’s prospects and said they would sweep the municipal elections. Stating that the State government had not allocated any funds for the municipalities, he said it was taking up developmental works only with Central government funds without acknowledging that. He also questioned whether Mission Bhagiratha works were taken up with AMRUT funds extended by the Centre and alleged that the 14th Finance Commission funds released to gram panchayats were diverted by the TRS government to purchase tractors and pay power bills.

Mr. Sanjay Kumar also sought to know what Mr. Kamalakar had done for the development of Karimnagar during his 12-year tenure as legislator.

“Was the town transformed to be on par with London and New York as promised by TRS,” he questioned. He also faulted the State government for not contributing its share for Smart City works.

“When the State government became bankrupt with no funds for developmental works, why did it create new municipalities,” was another question put forth by the BJP MP.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kegoro/article30596157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-BANDI-SANJAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-leader-mocks-ministers-24x7-water-supply-promise/article30596151.ece

Addressing a public meeting at Kanteswar after taking part in a motorbike rally in the run-up to the municipal polls, Mr. Raja Singh said if his party is given a clear mandate in Nizamabad, he would rename the city to Indur as it was originally called and added that the name ‘Nizamabad’ reminds one of Nizam Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan, who was known for his “draconian regime”.

‘No credit for PM’

He also criticised the TRS government for not giving credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite getting funds for its all schemes from the Centre, and instead, claiming those to be his “own greatness and achievements”.

Party activists from across the district besides Bhainsa in Nirmal district, where riots recently took place, also participated in the rally. The MLA appealed to the people to defeat the TRS and its ally AIMIM by electing BJP candidates in all divisions.

169,2020/01/18,TRS makes development pitch to win over voters,"After facing a big setback in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when it lost the sitting MP seat to BJP, the TRS is leaving no stone unturned to bag the coveted post of Mayor in the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar.

TRS workers are upbeat after the two of its corporators from 37th and 20th division were unanimously elected following the withdrawal of nominations by Opposition contestants. Incidentally, TRS alone has fielded its candidates in all 60 municipal divisions and is campaigning vigorously.

Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar conducted a closed-door meeting with all party contestants and briefed them about campaigning strategies and wooing voters through developmental works in the town. The Minister dived headlong into electioneering on Saturday by conducting a whirlwind tour of around nine municipal divisions, accompanied by the respective candidates, and speaking about developmental work undertaken by the TRS.

BJP also intensified campaigning in town under the leadership of Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar. Flaying the TRS for neglecting the town, the party leaders claimed Smart City works were taken up with Central government funds.

Leaders and workers of the Congress party, which occupied the coveted Mayor post since the first election to Karimnagar Municipal Corporation until it lost in 2014 polls, have shifted loyalty to the TRS and BJP in the town. Faced with a leadership crisis, Congress announced Pyata Ramesh as its Mayor candidate, to the shock of other contestants of the party. The campaigning is progressing as a low-key affair with TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar boosting the morale of the contestants by participating in their campaigns.

The Minister along with Lok Sabha member Kotha Prabhakar Reddy and former MLA Chinta Prabhakar participated in an election campaign here on Saturday and held a road show.

“The only party that would win the municipal elections is TRS. Our candidate will become chairperson of the municipality. We will win 30 wards on our own. Vote for TRS. I will adopt the town and address all problems,” said Mr. Harish Rao during the campaign. While admitting that there is a drinking water crisis in the district, the Minister said Mission Bhagiratha water would be supplied to every house shortly and within three or four months, Kaleswaram water would reach Singur.

“There was no rain in the catchment area of Manjeera. We are aware of the prevailing water crisis here. That is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has decided to divert Kaleswaram water to Singur. This will address drinking water problem once and for all. Mr Chandrasekhar Rao has always kept his word, including formation of a separate Telangana state and hiking the pension amount. Vote for those who will work for development,” he urged the voters and promised to develop five wards of Pothireddypalle village that were merged with the municipality.

171,2020/01/18,Hyderabad regains crown of World’s Most Dynamic Cities,"Hyderabad has grabbed back the crown of World’s Most Dynamic Cities in the City Momentum Index-2020 from Bengaluru in the ranking released by JLL, the American real estate services firm. In the 2018 index, Hyderabad was the top rank city, a position which it lost in 2019. The ranking ‘identifies the cities that have the strongest positive momentum in their economies and real estate markets over the short to medium term.’

In 2015, Hyderabad began at the bottom, ranked 20th, inching its way up among the 130 major and established markets. The ranking identifies dynamic cities from a real estate perspective and factors in office space off-take, real estate growth, transportation issues, pollution, business environment and policies.

Chennai (5), Delhi (6), Pune (12), Kolkata (16) and Mumbai (20) are the other cities showing strong Indian presence despite a slowing economy. Hyderabad and Bengaluru made it to the top of the list as they have embraced and adapted themselves to the innovation economy and have a favourable demography and business climate. A more active real estate market helped Hyderabad push ahead of Bengaluru. According to the researchers, Hyderabad recorded the highest office net absorption in 2019 of any city in the world.

Noting the environment challenges being face by the world with heat island effect, the report notes how Hyderabad has tackled it: “This (Cooling Action Plan) has been implemented on a large scale in Hyderabad, where the state government has introduced the Telangana Cool Roof programme.” It also noted the new metro line in the city that has added to the transit solutions for citizens and businesses, as well as enhanced micro-mobility and ‘last mile’ connectivity with the introduction of smart bikes and e-autos.

The report also logs the challenges faced by the city planners as the development has been concentrated in the western part, resulting in massive congestion and bottlenecks faced by commuters. “The Telangana state government is formulating a ‘Look East Policy’ (LEAP) as a way of alleviating congestion by encouraging development on the city’s east side,” notes the report.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hyderabad-grabs-back-crown-of-worlds-most-dynamic-cities/article30595968.ece
172,2020/01/18,Face recognition mobile application in 10 polling stations,"The Telangana State Election Commission has decided to use face recognition mobile application in 10 polling stations of Kompally municipality in Medchal-Malkajgiri district in the coming elections on a pilot basis to strengthen its voter verification system.

The technology was aimed to reduce impersonation cases by applying the latest technologies of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning which were completely driven by the system developed by Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) with full digital trail.

The Commission has, therefore, directed the district Collector to arrange one new 4G Android smart mobile phone (with dual SIM facility) with minimum specification of 2 GB RAM, 4 MP camera and appointment of one additional polling official of Assistant Polling Officer rank for each of the 10 polling stations.

Process explained

A circular of the Commission on Saturday said the mobile app will help in identifying and confirming the voters based on the photograph taken by the additional polling officer who will be in-charge of the mobile phone. He will first verify the identity proof of the voters and then take their photographs and upload them to the server using Face Recognition App installed in mobile phone so as to compare the same with the already available photographs of all voters of the concerned polling station.

The app will display the result of verification based on the match established with voters with an appropriate message. The system was not in lieu but an additional tool to the existing identification system comprising identification of voters by first polling officers, checking electoral rolls and Electors Photo Identity Cards or alternate documents and subject to satisfaction of polling agents.

No storing of data

The Commission warned that the photographs taken were not stored or used for any other purpose. They will be erased from the memories of the mobile phone and also the server of TSTS which is supposed to give an undertaking to the effect.

The entire transmission process was properly encrypted and the IDs were anonymised as it was a type of information sanitisation whose intent was privacy protection. It was the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets so that the people whom the data described remained anonymous. The input files (encrypted live photo data) was deleted immediately after the purpose was fulfilled.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hmi80h/article30595769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10votersrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/face-recognition-mobile-application-in-10-polling-stations/article30595770.ece
173,2020/01/18,Ministers and MLAs campaign hard to impress KTR,"Municipal elections in Telangana have a distinct flavour this time as despite the ruling party being in a strong position all the ministers and MLAs are sweating it out like the Assembly or Parliament polls.

The reason is to impress the all powerful young boss, TRS working president and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao rather than Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao with whom most of them don’t have much access. However, access to KTR is much easier and faster.

Public representatives strongly believe that KTR may take over the State reins sooner or later from his father and no wonder they are keen on impressing the young boss for their better future in the party and the government.

Sources in the party say signals are quite clear to the leaders and the cadre about the party’s future boss and the way KTR handled the ticket distribution and ministers reporting to him on day-to-day basis on the rebels issue further consolidated their view.

Strong competition

“There are strong second rung leaders as well in each constituency and the MLAs don’t want to lose out to that layer of leaders. The result is we see even senior ministers touring small wards everyday as any local leader would do,” revealed a senior leader wishing anonymity.

They are not only afraid of their future but also their kids future whom they want to handover the political baton. They are not ready to accommodate even a little bit space to second layer of leadership in the constituencies. More so with KTR putting the onus of selection, spending and success on the MLA and the ministers.

Heavy expenditure

The kind of money being spent is just unheard of, and a direct reflection of the fear factor that they would have to face the axe for laxity in the poll management and the end result. “In some wards our candidates are spending ₹ 7,000 for each vote due to the pressure from the local MLA or the Minister,” a senior leader revealed. “This is just mind boggling for local body polls.”

The result, irrespective of its nature and size, will not impact the TRS government in any way but KTR sees it as a stamp of approval from the cadre and the voters as the successor of KCR. He has already made the first successful move with TRS party flag flying high in the sarpanch, ZPTC and MPTC elections.

Senior party leaders argue that this win will be the final nail on the opposition’s coffin as well. They are in a disarray, divided among themselves, and nowhere near the strong poll management tactics that TRS had become a master at. “Of course, the dissidents within the party too will be relegated to the background,” they say.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6c0k3z/article30595613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19TRSCAMPAIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ministers-and-mlas-campaign-hard-to-impress-ktr/article30595615.ece

Mr. Saidi Reddy who was on a door-to-door campaign in several wards of the constituency, said development of Huzurnagar was possible only by the TRS.

“Our party has been among people since the time of my father late Sultan Salauddin Owaisi and Kamareddy is not new to it. We have fielded candidates in six wards of the 49 wards town, and hence I exhort you to vote for them,” he said while addressing a public meeting, here on Saturday evening.

The writ of whichever party had strength would run and people naturally support the strongest party. Some parties were campaigning that AIMIM was confined only to Hyderabad, which was not correct, he said adding that his party was gaining presence all over the State. “At present Majlis wind is blowing and our party has been fighting on the public issues for the last 70 years,” he said.

Appealing to people not to vote for the Congress in Kamareddy, he urged the party to introspect as to why it was getting defeated in every election. Without directly taking the name of former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, he said that he should realise that only the Muslims were voting for him.

“Some have taken up a smear campaign against me saying that I have two wives and there is no iota of truth in it. Wherever I go there the Congress party is experiencing damage. Congress feels that it is only the secular party. Its leader Rahul Gandhi lost election in Amethi and how can the party which could not ensure his victory expect to fight with me,” he questioned.

Mr. Owaisi said that it was he who fought for the victory of Congress in Bihar by defeating Nitish Kumar, but the Congress leadership did not thank him. “Our party secured victory in 3 Lok Sabha seats and is expanding its base all over the country,” he said.

176,2020/01/18,OU professor held for ‘Maoist links’,"Osmania University Associate Professor Chintakindi Kaseem was arrested by Mulugu police of Siddipet Commissionerate on Saturday in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case registered against him in 2016.

Around 7 a.m. on Saturday, a police team reached the professor’s house in the staff quarters on the university campus, after they obtained a search warrant from a local court, marking fresh developments in the case.

“Recently, some inputs were received that Kaseem had more documents in his house. We searched the house only after serving court warrant to him and his wife Snehalatha,” said Siddipet Commissioner of Police D. Joel Davis, adding that the search continued till 10.05 a.m. in the presence of the accused and his family members.

The police have seized incriminating evidence, including laptop, personal computer, mobile phones, pen drives, and other electronic devices, in addition to banned revolutionary literature, the officer said.

Kaseem was in contact with CPI (Maoist) State Committee member Hari Bhushan alias Jagan and other top leaders of the Central Committee, the Commissioner said. He was appointed general secretary of Revolutionary Writers Association (Virasam) a week ago.

“He is not a ‘frontal’ guy. He is working as an organiser of ‘united front vertical’ of outlawed Maoist party in the State, which coordinates protests, funding and propagation of revolutionary ideology to different groups, including students,” Mr. Davis said.

In 2016, a fatal car accident took place at Mulugu, in which a girl died on the spot. The accused driver, Shyam Sundar from Adilabad, left the car and fled from the spot. “Later when police reached the scene, they found Shyam Sundar was transporting important documents, including communications from Kaseem to top Maoist leaders,” the officer said.

“We seized those documents and later Shyam Sundar, who was working as a courier for the party was arrested. Based on his confession, Kaseem was made one of the accused in the case,” he said.

“During the course of investigation, we gathered more documents on Kaseem’s links with CPI (Maoist) and recently, we got inputs that he had more documents at his house, following which today’s search was carried out,” the Commissioner said.

Meanwhile, the arrested professor’s wife Snehalatha alleged that the police barged in and ransacked their house in the early hours.

“They broke open the doors and gained access to our house. The police ransacked the entire house during the search,” she told the media.

Ms. Snehalatha appealed to the State government to close the case and release her husband, as he raised his voice against unemployment, discrimination and other social issues in Telangana.

“The police arrested him in a 2016 case, where two books written by him were found in a car that was involved in an accident,” she said.

Earlier in the day, mild tension prevailed on the campus with several students carrying out a protest rally condemning the arrest of the professor, following which Osmania University police reached the spot to control the situation. Forum Against Repression - Telangana and State Civil Liberties Committee condemned the arrest and demanded the immediate release of Kaseem and others.

“How many Congress MLAs went to the TRS after winning election? And those who didn’t embrace the ruling party still remain loyal to it. Congress is a duplicate and covert party of the TRS,” he said.

Obstructing campaigning

Mr. Rao also believed that the TRS and AIMIM are maintaining a strategic relationship in Nalgonda for the urban body polls, evident in “red carpet for MIM and obstacles for BJP electioneering”.

The BJP leader said the party fielded most candidates for the contest and has been campaigning intensely.

For Nalgonda, Mr. Muralidhar Rao said, ₹ 116 crore was sanctioned under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, and assured that more would be done from the Centre.

However, TRS leaders, including its working president K.T. Rama Rao, were spreading lies, he said. “We are ready with all evidence, bank statements on funds sent to each gram panchayat, AMRUT, housing development, and for many other schemes in Telangana,” he added.

Mr. Muralidhar Rao also alleged that the communal violence in Bhainsa, in Nirmal district last week, was an outcome of ‘TRS methods’.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3qj96y/article30595113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19NLG-BJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-is-a-covert-party-of-trs-muralidhar-rao/article30595114.ece
179,2020/01/18,Give votes to only official TRS candidates: KTR,"TRS working president and Minister for IT and Municipal Administration K Taraka Rama Rao urged people to vote only for the official TRS candidates on car symbol in the ensuing municipal elections.

“Do not vote for the TRS rebels, who are contesting as independents and claim that they would rejoin the TRS after winning the election. How can we accept them into the party when they are fighting against the car symbol?” he pointed out and appealed to the electorate to vote for the car symbol after seeing him and not the candidates.

The Minister organised road shows as part of electioneering in Vemulawada temple town and Sircilla textile town on Saturday. The road shows were well attended with both towns turning pink with party flags.

Addressing well-attended gatherings at both the towns, Mr Rama Rao vowed to develop the Vemulawada temple shrine on a par with Tirupathi temple. He also assured to develop Sircilla as one of the best towns in the country. Appealing to elect only TRS candidates in the municipal elections for the continuation of the development works in the coming four years of TRS government, he promised to develop all municipalities and accordingly enacted a new municipal Act for transparent and corruption-free administration.

The provisions of the new Act are so tough that errant elected representatives, including TRS leaders, would be punished, the Minister said. Officials indulging in corrupt practices would be dismissed from service, KTR added.

Ridiculing opposition leaders’ claim that any leader who visits Vemulawada shrine would lose his power, he said Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had proved them wrong and visited the temple on four occasions. He said the TRS government had constituted Vemulawada Temple Development Authority (VTDA) and taken up developmental works to the tune of ₹ 218 crore in the temple town.

Stating that his dream of providing Godavari waters to upland Sircilla district was fulfilled with MMD reservoir, he promised to operate train services in the district with links to Hyderabad and Mumbai routes within two years. He also promised a JNTU engineering college in Sircilla.

There is no point in voting Congress candidates as they are not in power both at the Centre and State, he said and urged people to quiz BJP leaders on why the Centre had not given national project status to Kaleshwaram lift irrigation scheme.

181,2020/01/18,"Vote against TRS, if you oppose CAA and NRC: Uttam","The continuing silence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens in Telangana is not only puzzling, but sending a wrong signal.

“The TRS will convene a special Assembly session to pass resolution against it, if only it tastes a humiliating defeat in the local bodies. Vote against TRS if you oppose CAA and NRC,” Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy told people here on Saturday.

Touring in various wards of Huzurnagar and meeting party cadre as part of his electioneering, the Congress leader pointed that KCR did not take a firm stand against the citizenship legislation, as the TRS had a ‘secret alliance’ with the BJP.

Clear stand

He reminded that Kerala, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha were vocal against the implementation of the legislation in their States, however, KCR has been maintaining a “questionable silence”.

He wondered why AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, who took a delegation of leaders to Pragathi Bhavan in December over the legislation, is not anxious about an Assembly resolution against it now.

“People, especially minorities, should understand the nexus of the TRS, BJP and MIM. Remember to vote against them when you go to polling booths on January 22,” Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy repeated.

The TPCC chief also trained his guns against the TRS on neglect of the Madiga community in the State.

“Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi leader Manda Krishna is often targeted and humiliated. The community, largest by population, is being suppressed politically and economically by the TRS. The same discrimination would continue if the TRS wins the local body polls,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ykzy81/article30594951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19UTTAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vote-against-trs-if-you-oppose-caa-and-nrc-uttam/article30594952.ece

183,2020/01/18,OU professor held for Maoist links; 20 students detained,"Osmania University Associate Professor Chintakindi Kaseem was arrested by Mulugu police of Siddipet Commissionerate on Saturday in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case registered against him in 2016.

Around 7 a.m. on Saturday, a police team reached the professor’s house in the staff quarters on the university campus, after they obtained a search warrant from a local court, marking fresh developments in the case. “Recently, some inputs were received that Kaseem had more documents in his house. We searched the house only after serving court warrant to him and his wife Snehalatha,” said Siddipet Commissioner of Police D. Joel Davis, adding that the search continued till 10.05 a.m. in the presence of the accused and his family members.

The police have seized incriminating evidence, including laptop, personal computer, mobile phones, pen drives, and other electronic devices, in addition to banned revolutionary literature, the officer said.

Kaseem was in contact with CPI (Maoist) State Committee member Hari Bhushan alias Jagan and other top leaders of the Central Committee, the Commissioner said. He was appointed general secretary of Revolutionary Writers Association (Virasam) a week ago. He hails from Ambatipally village in Nagarkurnool dist.

“He is not a ‘frontal’ guy. He is working as an organiser of ‘united front vertical’ of outlawed Maoist party in the State, which coordinates protests, funding and propagation of revolutionary ideology to different groups, including students,” Mr. Davis said.

Car accident

In 2016, a fatal car accident took place at Mulugu, in which a girl died on the spot. The accused driver, Shyam Sundar from Adilabad, left the car and fled from the spot. “Later when police reached the scene, they found Shyam Sundar was transporting important documents, including communications from Kaseem to top Maoist leaders,” the officer said.

“We seized those documents and later Shyam Sundar, who was working as a courier for the party was arrested. Based on his confession, Kaseem was made one of the accused in the case,” he said.

“During the course of investigation, we gathered more documents on Kaseem’s links with CPI (Maoist) and recently, we got inputs that he had more documents at his house, following which today’s search was carried out,” the Commissioner said.

‘Barged in’

Meanwhile, the arrested professor’s wife Snehalatha alleged that the police barged in and ransacked their house in the early hours.

“They broke open the doors and gained access to our house. The police ransacked the entire house during the search,” she told the media.

Ms. Snehalatha appealed to the State government to close the case and release her husband, as he raised his voice against unemployment, discrimination and other social issues in Telangana.

“The police arrested him in a 2016 case, where two books written by him were found in a car that was involved in an accident,” she said.

Earlier in the day, mild tension prevailed on the campus with several students carrying out a protest rally condemning the arrest of the professor, following which Osmania University police reached the spot to control the situation. Forum Against Repression - Telangana and State Civil Liberties Committee condemned the arrest and demanded the immediate release of Kaseem and others.

184,2020/01/18,All civic body permissions online: KTR,"With the introduction of ‘deemed to have been permitted’ norms for buildings in the new Municipal Act, those planning to construct houses are facing a problem of bankers denying loans in the absence of permission letters from the municipal authorities concerned.

Keeping in view the difficulty, the government has asked the municipal commissioners to issue letters of permission to such persons immediately. These letters will be as good as permissions granted by the municipality for all legal purposes.

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao, who interacted with a select group of reporters on Friday ahead of the municipal elections, said that the municipal commissioners have been asked to act fast on this after several complaints came to his notice.

He said the new Municipal Act of the Telangana government is revolutionary and all permissions have to be obtained online, and they will be cleared in 21 days. The onus is on the officials to give reasons for rejections within six days and if the applications are kept pending after 21 days without any reason, they are deemed to have been cleared.

Mr. Rao said the new Act allows people to construct houses in less than 75 yards without any permission and this he hoped will minimise corruption and root out red tapism.

Self-certification

To ensure participatory governance, he said the new Act will also allow self-certification for those construction houses in plots up to 500 square meters. But there are enough checks and balances to stop the misuse of the self-certification facility.

He said the new Act empowers officials to demolish unauthorised structures without any notice unlike earlier period when notices have to be served first. Constructions in disputed lands and in government lands will be also demolished without any notice.

People will be allowed to assess their property tax minimising the intervention of officials but those who under-assess the property tax or misuse the facility will be levied 25 times penalty of the tax amount.

Green plan

Mr. Rao said municipalities now have to earmark 10% of the funds necessarily for the green plan. It is mandatory and the officials and elected representatives will have to take the responsibility.

The government will train the officials and conduct special training classes for the elected representatives on the new Act as soon as the process of elections are over, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vg5l70/article30591798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18KTRAMARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/all-civic-body-permissions-online-ktr/article30591799.ece

The Panchayat Raj and the Roads and Buildings departments in particular should focus on completion of the roads and culverts as well as other patch work leading to Medaram before January 25. The Chief Secretary held teleconference with senior officials to review the arrangements that are being made for the jatara on Friday.

He wanted the officials concerned to ensure that sign boards indicating directions and information relating to amenities are put up in three languages while volunteers should be roped in for regulating the movement of vehicles at the designated parking lots.

Arrangements like setting up public address systems at all important points should be completed ahead of the commencement of the jatara and the officials should take utmost care in maintaining sanitation.

The officials of the district could be stationed at the venue to supervise the progress of the ongoing work and ensure their speedy completion.

The district Collector, Superintendent of Police, ITDA project officer and other officials should work in coordination for ensuring that work is completed within the set deadlines. The Chief Secretary said he would soon visit Medaram for first hand information on the ongoing work.

186,2020/01/18,"Residencies, retreats and destination festivals: the new ‘it’ thing for artists","The workshop mode — for writers, artists, craftspeople, designers, musicians, chefs et al. — was and continues to be a popular learning and exchange format. It usually entails intensive exposure and practice for performers of all kinds, newbies and old hands. There are also the one-off master classes from maestros and experts from various disciplines, during which much cogitation, questioning and discovery takes place.

However, the new ‘it’ thing to do seems to be the retreat or residency. Once a hard-won, all-expenses-paid, fellowship or sabbatical of sorts offered by various hallowed institutions, this coveted format was made available only to people who would have to apply and compete with others to land a berth. At the end of it, the artist-participant would need to show work of some kind that grew out of the residency. It was an enviable break from the mundanities and minutiae of daily living that are part of almost every householder-artist’s life.

It was also an opportunity to interact with other saadhaks, seekers, like themselves. These could be from diverse disciplines, and while you were free to pursue your own work through the day, many residencies required participants to exchange thoughts, ideas and beliefs during one designated part of the day. Most fruitful, all this came with the promise of time to yourself, yet not complete isolation. And the stipend or expenses paid part helped — materially, as well as in making the participant feel valued. Someone was saying, “Come, let me take care of the routine rigours of living, and you just luxuriate in your work.”

Festive atmosphere

However, quite suddenly, the residency/ retreat is all around us, and to get into one, participants need simply pay their way. Yes, some organisers say they must have some kind of body of work, and a stated intention about what they wish to get out of this retreat. However, most such retreats — or ‘destination festivals’ as they are called — will book a spot for anyone who has the required time and money.

And why not, really? (I ask, sensing a kind of snobby eyeball roll from many who immediately think of this as nothing more than a self-indulgent kitty party, an artsy assignation.) Why must everyone wait to be invited to some high table of learning based on someone’s notion of merit or on your ability to jockey for a slot at these creative meets? Why not just pay your way there?

Well, one does know that there is a difference in the two approaches, but whether you like it or not, this new phenomenon is out there, and possibly here to stay. One art teacher recently took her students, mainly women in their mid-40s, on a destination trip, in which was included learning to make sangrias, dance the salsa, and snorkel (talk about total immersion). Only, they had to come back with a thick drawing book quite full of sketches and paintings and tell the story of this trip, airport to airport, via their visual journals. And they had to pay their way.

Musical symposium

Later this month, there is going to be a residential festival in Goa at which Indian classical musicians and their audiences will stay together at a resort. There will be music performances almost round-the-clock. Food and conversations are expected to flow, along with music.

A group of artists recently went to a picturesque island in a river in south India. The person organising it was at first hard-pressed to find takers — even though it promised solitude, beauty, inspiring fellow artists, a complete change of pace from home. Many old-school sculptors and painters she approached simply said, “If you get us a sponsor for the 30k needed, we will come; else, our studios, albeit a small corner of our house, will suffice, as they always have.” The trip did materialise, however, perhaps with a different set of artists than who the retreat was originally aimed at.

No doubt, the travel and tourism industry will quickly wake up to this new ‘segment’ — the artist in search of inner indulgence.

187,2020/01/18,Black and white stories from Fort Kochi,"Cochin Babu lounges on a chair in Chavittu Nadakam gear staring right into the camera, oozing attitude. The black and white, 36x24 inch photograph, printed on canvas, accompanies another of Babu in his shop carrying tools of his trade — a weighing balance — as a provision store owner. Babu runs a provision store and is a junior artiste in films when he is not busy with Chavittu Nadakam, the Latin Christian art form.

The portrait, clicked by photographer Shaji N Jaleel, is his ode to the familiar faces he sees around Fort Kochi and Mattancherry — his home. These are a part of his first solo show, ‘Unconfined’, at Eka Art Gallery, featuring 18 photographs on canvas and paper.

“With Cochin Babu’s photographs I wanted to show how one takes two aspects of life together, hand in hand — art and everyday life,” says Shaji. His subjects are a motley crew. Gemini Nazar, a constant, compulsive traveller. Thamby chettan who at 74 still fells coconuts, and has been for as long as Shaji can remember, “And he is very fit despite his years.” Hameedikka who has, for the last 50 years, been living in Jew Town where he used to ferry passengers on his cycle rickshaw before auto rickshaws became common. He now does odd jobs, such as running errands for shop owners and moving merchandise. The women in his photographs are fisher folk going about their daily chores.

The photographs are gritty and rich with details that only a black and white image can highlight. Interestingly the portraits seem to be largely of older people, “It wasn’t a conscious decision. I was more interested in how they looked, their attitude and how they carry themselves,” says Shaji, a still photographer for films. He has assisted Shyju Khalid as cinematographer in Traffic. He has made short films such as The Rim (2011), Expire (2011), No Spaces (2012), which was screened at IDSFFK, and Portrait (2017).

Of why he has shot in black and white, he says, he likes the medium because it gives him the results he likes in a photograph.

“The other reason is that I started my career shooting black and white photos, and somehow I am attached to that despite all the digital technology available,” he adds. These pictures have been shot with a digital camera, Canon N50. However, for his next show Shaji plans to go with old-fashioned, film roll and develop it. “I have been a photographer for more than 20 years, and I started my career with black and white photographs in a dark room. I want to do that, it is not difficult to do. Anyone can do it - printing paper, processing chemicals are all available,” he says.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hamp62/article30593095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpshajijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/shaji-n-jaleel-captures-some-of-fort-kochis-familiar-faces-for-his-exhibition-of-photographs/article30593102.ece
188,2020/01/18,Pride and prejudice,"Artist Dr Willie Hooker’s ‘Black Man Looking into a White World’ sums up the soul of the exhibition of African American art on at the Durbar Hall Art Gallery. The sculpture is a face with one half painted black and the other half white — a powerful representation of a black man living through the 1960s civil rights movement in America. Willie is a professor of art at North Carolina

.

Much of the works on display are nuanced narratives of African American history mingled with contemporary realities. Organised by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, ‘Negritude’ is the first show of its kind in Asia held by the National Alliance of Artists from Historical Black Colleges and Universities (NAAHBCU), USA. After its run in Kochi, the exhibition will travel to Ahiwasi gallery, Banaras Hindu University in March, followed by Gallery Nandan, Kala Bhavan Santiniketan, West Bengal. In April, it will be hosted by DakshinChitra, Chennai, and then move to Art Gallery Sanskriti Bhavan, Department of Art and Culture, Government of Goa.

Curated by Dr Peggy Blood, artist and teacher, the show explores “the black identity” in art. As a student in the segregated South of the US, Peggy was the first American of African descent to receive a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.

Edited excerpts from an interview with Peggy Blood.

How would you describe the current African American art scene in the US?

African American art today in the USA is more visible and popular than in the past especially after the ‘Black Lives Matter Movement’ ( an international activist movement that campaigns against violence and systemic racism), although no more than 2% of USA’s major museums display art created by African Americans. Since 2014, there has been a gradual recognition that the populace wants to experience diversity in museums, purchase African American art and engage with it.

The slow acceptance of Black art has mostly been due to prejudice, stereotypes and the misconception that the white world is not able to relate to works by African American artists. If one takes the race component out, Black art is relatable to all groups regardless of race or ethnicity.

The works of most African American artists are as political as they are personal.

African American art is just as diverse as any ethnic group. Although some works by Black Americans are political in nature, this is because the culture still faces discrimination. Artists have always been the chief visual communicators and translators of society’s temperature. Since Black artists are part of the political nucleus in USA, it is natural that their creative expression will communicate the temperate and raw soul of the nation.

How much of a role does race play in art ?

As artists, we want to be viewed as “artists”, however, whenever you live in a racial environment, one cannot escape the term; you must take the lemons with the lemonade.

How would you describe your artistic journey?

My journey as an artist is intertwined with my being an educator. The two life paths complement each other, both provoke inquiry from the creator and the observer, this has been a wonderful challenge throughout my life.

Could you tell me a bit about your association with the NAAHBCU?

In 1998 I was among many who were contacted by Dr Lee Ransaw, NAAHBCU Board chairman, to explore the possibility of starting an organisation that focused on members of and from Historical Black Colleges and Universities. In 1999, we met and the organisation was formed and I served as a board member and treasurer and in 2010, I became president of The National Alliance of Artists from Historical Black Colleges and Universities (NAAHBCU). (It is a non-profit professional organisation that educates, promotes artists and art programs within Historical Black Colleges and Universities).

What does the word “colour” mean to an African American artist?

I am not able to speak for all black artists but usually its use is associated with power and strong emotions.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bi3fqn/article30592677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPEXHIBITION1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/negritude-a-show-of-african-american-art-explores-the-black-identity/article30592687.ece
189,2020/01/18,Art has no borders,"It is difficult to tell if artist Sudip Roy’s depiction of the Imambara in Lucknow is a photograph or a painting as it is highly detailed and real. The water-colour painting is among the many stunning art works on display at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. This is no ordinary exhibition. It is one that brings together masters from neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh. It has been organised by the collaborative programme Art Beyond Borders, which, as the name suggests, is about using the power of art to transcend socio-political boundaries. On view are approximately 48 paintings, by artists Swapan Das, Radhika Surana, RB Bhaskaran, Late Dhiraj Chaudhury, Sudip Roy, and Bharati Prajapati from India; GB Gurung, Anita Bhattarai, and Ragini Upadhya from Nepal; and Vinita Karim, Sultan Ishtiaque, Jamal Ahmed, Ranjit Das, Muniruzaman, and Kanak Champa from Bangladesh. Sandhya Parmar is the force behind Art Beyond Borders. The exhibition has also been organised by Ajit and Kalpana Singh.

Sandhya says the exhibition is relevant in the times we live in. “I think we need to stop scratching our wounds and start healing. Only art can provide that healing.” She lived in Bangladesh for 30 years and in that time has interacted with local artists and art communities. Through her interactions, she realised that art has no boundaries. “People connect at different levels beyond socio-political borders. We are part of the same human heritage, hence the desire to bring these two communities together.”

Sandhya says Art Beyond Borders has held residencies where stunning art work has emerged. “Our journey began in October 2014 by bringing together renowned artists from Bangladesh and India in an art residency in Lucknow. With over 19 participating artists from both countries including pioneers, the unique diversity of each artist was celebrated as they crossed cultural barriers of religion and limiting nationalisms to let art speak through the simple medium of colour and canvas.”

The second residency was held in Varanasi in 2016. “It was aimed at promoting a diffusion of art beyond national borders, and to revive the historical significance and celebrate the age-old beauty of the Ghats.”

She adds: “These art works opens up thought processes.” She, then, shows us two art works (an acrylic and watercolour) that depict the same ghat but with two completely different perspectives. “Artists tend to imbibe the surroundings into the art work.” She adds: “Sultan’s painting shows fog over the ghat. If you look closer, you will see it starts coming alive.”

She adds it was “electrifying to see the artists work on the floor together.” BR Bhaskaran, a Chennai-based artist who was recently awarded the national-level award, named after Professor Nanjunda Rao, founder of Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, has created an arresting painting in acrylic. Bharati Prajapati’s oil painting is colourful and soothing, and Radhika Surana’s painting incorporates shlokas she heard in the Ghats.

Bangladeshi artist Muniruzaman’s painting of a barber tending to his customer catches your eye. ‘He does it in layers that brings the work alive,” Sandhya explains. A painting by Bangladeshi artist Sulekha Chaudhuri captures the theme of Art Beyond Borders. Sandhya says: “The theme is a portrayal of a more global world. She has painted a woman as the mother land. But the borders divide her... it is man who divides.” Sandhya speaks highly of Bangladeshi artist Nisar Hossain’s works. “He is the dean of the fine art college in Dhaka. His works are often Gothic but symbolic of the human mind. His painting (in the exhibition) depicts a human figure turning into animal form, which reflects how we have often descend into our basest selves.”

The paintings are on display and sale at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath till January 19, from 10 am to 7 pm.

She claimed the 800m race with 9:26.19, while her closest competitor, Delhi’s Bhavya Sachdeva, managed 9:30.06.

Could’ve been better

“I did not get my best timing as my training was not proper due to exams. If there was someone to push me, I would have produced even better results,” said Khushi.

Khushi, who won gold medals in National championships and finished 20th in the World junior aquatics event last year, had last competed in the Asian Age Group championships in Bengaluru in September.

191,2020/01/18,"Odisha Police win friends, trust with a skating rink","A skating rink in Odisha’s backward and remote Nuapada district, which lacks even a decent community park, appears incongruous — a facility out of sync with its bucolic setting.

But for the State police, the modern recreational facility set up on the campus of a police station is a means to glide straight into the hearts of the people in a region affected by left wing extremism via the steady stream of children who visit the rink everyday.

The rink at the police station at Odisha’s Dharambandha, a tiny panchyat bordering Chhattisgarh, has been receiving batches of children every day. And they are not afraid of interacting with the police.

The idea of having a banked skating rink in Dharambandha, a tiny panchayat bordering Chhattisgarh, unavailable even in many of the State’s urban centres, took shape when Smit Parmar, a young IPS officer, assumed charge as the Superintendent of Police of Nuapada. Mr. Parmar was recently transferred out as the SP of Mayurbhanj district.

“We wanted a structure that could bring the police and the people closer. There was a vacant place on the Dharambandha police station campus. We decided to lay a skating track where children could play in close proximity to the police establishment and grow up without harbouring a fear of security forces,” said Mr. Parmar.

The outlawed CPI (Maoist) considers Dharambandha part of its Mainpur division. A few years ago, security personnel were afraid to move alone in the area and a sub-inspector of police was killed by the ultras. A company of the India Reserve Battalion is now stationed in the region for area domination.

Security forces find it difficult to challenge Maoists without cooperation from the people. The extremists often cross over to Dharambandha for refuge after incidents in neighbouring Chhattisgarh.

“Local children unfailingly come to the rink for a round on the skating board. When these children grow up, we are confident that they will be friends of the police as they are watching us from close quarters,” said the IPS officer.

Dharambandha sarpanch (headman) Om Prakash Kalar is effusive in his praise for the public skating rink. “It is unfortunate that children grow up with the mindset that police officers are to be feared. A small step like this will definitely bridge the gap between them,” he said.

Given the remote location, the children learn skating by a process of trial and error in the absence of trainers and coaches.

“Sometime, we help them by giving clues we have picked up from the internet. The children are no longer reluctant to ask us questions,” said Dillip Lakra, police officer in-charge of Dharambandha police station.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/p7j7ds/article30596129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19thrink-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-police-win-friends-trust-with-a-skating-rink/article30596130.ece
192,2020/01/18,Two men trampled to death by elephant in Odisha village,"Two persons were trampled to death by an elephant in Odisha’s Khordha district on Friday night, taking the total human casualties in man-elephant conflict to 96. The figure is at an all-time high in a single year (April - March) in the State.

The incident took place in Kalarajhara village and the victims were Bansidhar Chhualsingh and Sanatan Pradhan. Another person who sustained serious injuries was admitted in AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.

Multiple encounters

According to the Wildlife Society of Orissa, a non-government organisation, as many as 96 persons have been killed in more than 160 encounters with elephants since April 2019. Last year, a total of 92 persons had lost their lives in man-elephant conflicts. This year, more than 90 persons were injured.

In the last six years, 509 villagers have been killed in over 760 encounters with elephants. “With another two months left in the year, the human casualty is most likely to cross 100.

193,2020/01/18,Two convicted for 2013 rape of minor in Delhi,"A special court in Delhi on Saturday convicted two men of raping a five-year-old girl at Gandhi Nagar in East Delhi in 2013, observing that the victim had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality at their hands. Arguments on the quantum of sentence will be heard on January 30.

Stating that the case had shaken the collective conscience of the society, Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra of the Karkardooma court held Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar guilty.

The gruesome incident, which had triggered widespread protests, took place on April 15, 2013, after which Manoj and Pradeep went underground. About 40 hours later, the victim was traced to a ground-floor room of the building where she lived with her family on the first floor. Manoj had taken the room on rent a few days ago.

The police seized three candles and a hair-oil bottle that were inserted inside the girl. While Manoj was arrested from his in-laws’ residence in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, Pradeep was arrested from his maternal uncle’s place in Lakhisarai, also in Bihar.

Based on the investigations, the police said the two men were inebriated when Manoj lured the girl into his room. They then subjected her to unnatural sex and also attempted to strangle her, as alleged.

The victim was later shifted to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences for treatment.

While the victim’s family expressed satisfaction over the conviction, they said the trial should have been concluded faster.

The police had filed a charge sheet in the case on May 24, 2013, following which the court framed charges against Manoj and Pradeep in July that year. During the trial, statements of 57 prosecution witnesses were recorded and considerable forensic evidence presented before the POCSO court.

Also Read 39 years after the 1981 Behmai massacre involving Phoolan Devi, verdict likely on Jan 18

Special judge (UP dacoity-affected area) Sudhir Kumar pulled up the court official for the absence of the case diary at the time of delivering the verdict and asked him to place it before the court on January 24.

The court is likely to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu. While Posha is still in jail, the rest are out on bail. Three other dacoits, including Man Singh, are absconding.

The judge postponed pronouncement of the verdict after finding out that the original case diary was missing from court record, district government counsel (criminal) Rajeev Porwal told PTI.

The court has now listed the case on January 24, asking its staff to trace the missing case diary and place it before it on the next date, Mr. Porwal said.

“The court decided to fix another date for pronouncing the judgement only after the original case diary is located,” he said.

The court also issued a notice to the sessions clerk concerned for the case diary going missing, Porwal said, adding strict instructions have been issued to find it.

Though the disappearance of the case diary came to light only recently, Mr. Porwal denied any conspiracy behind it.

An advocate of the complainant later said that the Allahabad High Court will be moved in view of “undue delay in pronouncement of judgement” in the case and “mysterious disappearance” of the original case diary.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t1q9f2/article30587098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/phoolan-devijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/judge-postpones-verdict-in-1981-massacre-involving-phoolan-devi-as-case-diary-goes-missing/article30593931.ece
195,2020/01/18,Doctor detained in Maharashtra for sending suspicious envelopes to Pragya Singh Thakur,"The Madhya Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has detained a doctor from Nanded district of Maharashtra for allegedly sending suspicious envelopes to controversial BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur, the police said on Saturday.

Ms. Thakur lodged a complaint with the police on Monday alleging that she received some envelopes containing poisonous chemicals in them. The police seized 3 to 4 envelopes from the BJP MP’s residence, some of which had letters written in Urdu.

Talking to PTI, inspector Pradeep Kakade of the Itwara police station in Nanded said during the probe, the M.P. ATS found that Dr. Sayyed Abdul Rehman Khan, 35, who runs a clinic in Dhanegaon in the district, had sent these suspicious envelopes to Ms. Thakur.

“The Madhya Pradesh ATS detained Khan on Thursday evening from Dhanegaon. He had been on the police’s radar for the last three months, as he had previously written letters to some government officials, claiming that his mother and brother had terror links and they should be arrested,” Mr. Kakade said.

The officer said Khan was also previously arrested for writing these letters. “The police tried keeping a tab on him using his mobile phone location. However, he would leave his phone at home and travel to Aurangabad, Nagpur and other cities to post these letters,” Mr. Kakade added. Khan also had a dispute with his brother and was earlier arrested for assaulting him, the official added.

He was suffering from terminal cancer and had been admitted to Medanta Hospital about three weeks ago, hospital sources said.

Chopra died at the hospital this afternoon.

He was the editor of Punjab Kesari, Delhi.

Condolences pour in

Congress President Sonia Gandhi condoled his death and said Chopra’s long and distinguished innings as an editor and also as a social worker and MP shall be long remembered.

His friendship cut across political boundaries and he was known for his forthright views on most issues undeterred by the opposition he faced, Ms. Gandhi said while extending her condolences to Chopra’s family and friends.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also condoled the death of the former parliamentarian.

“Anguished by the passing away of Shri Ashwini Kumar Chopra ji. He will be remembered for his contribution to the media world.

197,2020/01/18,"Those opposing Bharat Ratna to Savarkar should spend time in Andaman jail, says Sanjay Raut","Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said those opposing Bharat Ratna award for Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar should be made to spend two days in the Andaman Cellular Jail, the erstwhile colonial prison, where Savarkar was lodged during his incarceration.

Mr. Raut’s statement can potentially put his party, which shares power in Maharashtra with ideologically different Congress and NCP, in a spot.

The Congress is against offering the highest civilian honour to Savarkar, who is hailed in high esteem by the right wing parties.

“Savarkar’s opponents should spend two days in the (erstwhile) Andaman Cellular Jail to understand the hardships he was put through by the British,” Mr. Raut said.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had kicked up a row in December, 2019, when he refused to apologise for his “rape in India” remark, saying “My name is Rahul Gandhi, not Rahul Savarkar.”

Reacting to Mr. Raut’s comments, Maharashtra minister and Yuva Sena president Aaditya Thackeray said there was no need to delve into the past.

Mr. Thackeray said he was not aware in which capacity the Shiv Sena leader made the statement.

“The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) speaks of the aspirations of people. Many people are feeling bad that there is no conflict between Congress and Shiv Sena. Despite having different ideologies, the two parties have come together in the interest of the country and the state. Democracy means different ideologies can work together in the interest of the country,” he told reporters.

The 29-year-old Yuva Sena chief further said he respects all stalwarts of the freedom movement.

He said the people of Shirdi, which houses the famous Saibaba temple, might start a “legal fight”.

Congress leader Ashok Chavan, on the other hand, defended the government’s decision to provides funds for Pathri. “It will be improper to deprive them of facilities due to the controversy over the birthplace,” the State PWD minister tweeted.

The controversy began after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a grant of ₹100 crore for development of Pathri in Parbhani district, believed to be Saibaba’s birthplace by a section of devotees.

The probe is based on an FIR registered by Surat’s Crime Branch against R.A. Distributors Private Limited and others, for alleged illegal outward remittances of foreign exchange using bogus bills of entry submitted to ICICI Bank in Surat, it said.

206,2020/01/18,"Sangli bandh directed at Raut, not Sena or CM, says Bhide","The Sangli shutdown was not directed against the Shiv Sena or Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, said Sambhaji Bhide, the octogenarian radical Hindutva leader, on Friday.

Mr. Bhide urged the Chief Minister to remove Sena MP Sanjay Raut from his post of spokesperson for his remarks against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and ex-Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

Sangli city observed a complete shutdown as members of Mr. Bhide’s outfit, the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, along with BJP activists and supporters of Mr. Bhosale demonstrated against Mr. Raut and Nationalist Congress Party leader and State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad.

Earlier, at an event, Mr. Raut had demanded ‘proof’ of whether Mr. Bhosale was indeed a descendant of the 17th century Maratha ruler. His remarks triggered a controversy, with Mr. Bhosale’s supporters as well as pro-Maratha outfits criticising the Sena leader.

“We cannot bear this insult to Udayanraje, who is a representative of the Chhatrapati’s dynasty… Our shutdown is not against any political party or the Shiv Sena, but against Sanjay Raut. In fact, it is my ardent wish that the Sena, built on the ideals of King Shivaji, expands its base and establishes its presence throughout the country,” said the Hindutva leader, while demanding that the Chief Minister expel Mr. Raut from his parliamentary post for defaming Udayanraje.

“I strongly urge Uddhav Thackeray to remove such persons [Mr. Raut] from their posts. His comments are poisoning the political clime,” he said.

Mr. Bhide also hit out at the booklet Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi authored by BJP leader Jai Bhagwan Goyal, remarking that there was no need for Mr. Goyal to compare the Prime Minister with Shivaji.

Prior to the shutdown, Mr. Bhide, whose name was linked to the Bhima-Koregaon clashes of January 1, 2018, urged his followers not to indulge in any form of violence or stone-pelting and peacefully observe the shutdown.

An activist from Mr. Bhide’s outfit said, “Udayanraje is the soul of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan. We cannot tolerate such insults against him … While political slanging matches may be fine, Sanjay Raut’s remarks are in bad taste … We are planning to register our grievance with Mr. Thackeray in the coming days.”

The outfit’s members have warned that if Mr. Raut did not publicly recant his statement and apologise, the agitation would intensify across Maharashtra.

The bandh cast a shadow onMr. Thackeray’s visit to Sangli later in the evening despite activists of Mr. Bhide’s outfit stressing that the shutdown was not aimed at disrupting the CM’s tour.

Meanwhile, Baramati MP Supriya Sule criticised the Sangli shutdown, calling it a political conspiracy. “It is wrong to call for a shutdown on the eve of the Chief Minister’s visit … It appears to be a political conspiracy against the government,” said Ms. Sule.

Mr. Bhide’s affinity with Mr. Bhosale, the 13th direct descendant of Shivaji, is well known. Mr. Bhosale had defended the Hindutva leader when he was alleged to have orchestrated the violence between two social groups on the bicentenary anniversary celebration of the 1818 battle of Koregaon Bhima on January 1, 2018.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ww7uqb/article30385955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMSAMBHAJIBHIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sangli-bandh-directed-at-raut-not-sena-or-cm-says-bhide/article30590199.ece
207,2020/01/18,"Nothing political about meeting Prasad Lad, says Ajit Pawar","A hush-hush meeting between Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLC Prasad Lad in Pune on Friday raised eyebrows, even as Mr. Pawar sought to downplay its significance.

Mr. Lad, who is also the vice-president of the BJP’s State unit, conferred with the National Congress Party (NCP) leader for more than half an hour.

Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Pawar said thre as no political angle to the meeting. “There is no need to attach any meaning to our meeting … several leaders from other parties keep meeting me regarding projects or work,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.

Mr. Lad, considered to be a confidante of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, is believed to have played a pivotal role at the time of Mr. Pawar’s temporary defection to join hands with the BJP last year.

Meanwhile, the Deputy Chief Minister, who is also Pune’s Guardian Minister, chaired a series of meetings to fast-track pending projects like the Pune Metro. Determined to wrest his ‘lost bastion’ of Pimpri-Chinchwad from the BJP, Mr. Pawar has been holding meetings for the past week with civic officials and taking snap decisions to regain his party’s fortunes by expediting major development works.

On Friday, he said the ambitious Pune-Mumbai hyperloop project, which could be to be the first operational high-speed hyperloop line in the world, was “not feasible”.

It was a pet project of the Fadnavis-led government, which had approved the Virgin Hyperloop One-led consortium’s plans for the high-speed line between Mumbai and Pune last year. The project is estimated to cost $10 billion.

“This is a still-untested mode of transportation … it has not been tried anywhere in the world. I doubt if we have the capacity for a trial here. First, let there be a 10-km hyperloop in some other part of the world … if it is successful there, only then shall we think about its possible implementation here,” said Mr. Pawar.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qn3xee/article30570477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMAJITPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nothing-political-about-meeting-lad-says-ajit-pawar/article30590194.ece
208,2020/01/18,Sanjay Daund elected unopposed to Council,"Beed Zilla Parishad member Sanjay Daund, of the Congress, is set to be Member of the Legislative Council after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opponent Rajan Teli withdrew his nomination on Friday for the January 24 bypoll.

Though Mr. Daund is a member of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), he filed the nomination as Congress candidate after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) decided to give this post to the Congress.

Members of Legislative Assembly, where the MVA enjoys support of around 169 MLAs out of 288, and the BJP has a support of around 114 MLAs, were to vote in the byelection.

The bypoll was necessitated after Dhananjay Munde, who was Leader of Opposition in the Council, got elected to Assembly from Parli in October last year.

After Mr. Teli filed his nomination papers, the BJP had claimed that the number game may turn against the ruling MVA. “This election will throw a surprise as numbers can change any time,” Leader of Opposition in council and BJP leader Pravin Darekar had said. The BJP however was left with no option but to withdraw its candidate.

Following Mr. Daund’s election, the opposition BJP is left with 22 MLCs. The MVA constituents — Shiv sena, NCP and Congress — have 12, 14, 14 respectively. There are six independents while Lok Bharti, Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), People’s Republican Party (PRP) and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) have one each.

The Sena and BJP will face-off in the Council election for the second seat vacated after the election of Sena’s Tanaji Sawant to the Assembly. Dushyant Chaturvedi from Sena will take on BJP’s Sumit Bajoria.

Mr. Chaturvedi is a son of senior Congress leader Satish Chaturvedi who had joined the Sena before Assembly elections while Mr. Bajoria is a brother of former NCP legislator Sandip Bajoria.

The MVA however faces rebellion within after former Sena legislator Shrikant Munginwar and Congress leader Shankar Bade filed their respective nominations as well.

209,2020/01/18,MVA govt may not push for tariff hike by MahaVitaran,"Fearing a backlash over the proposed increase in tariff by the State electricity distribution company (MahaVitaran), the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Friday clarified that domestic consumers and farmers won’t have to bear the burden and will continue to get power at the current rate.

The State government’s move comes after the MahaVitaran, in a proposal before the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), has sought an average 5.8% increase in tariff.

Power Minister Nitin Raut, who met MahaVitaran officers, was categorical that it was not binding on the government to accept the proposed tariff hike.

“We do not want to pass on the burden of any additional tariff hike to the consumers. So far MahaVitaran has given its proposal to SERC which has yet to deliver its order. The tariff relief given by the previous BJP government for industries in underdeveloped Vidarbha and Marathwada regions will continue,” he said.

Maharashtra State Consumer Association’s Pratap Hogade opposed the tariff hike proposal saying that cost of power is already too high in Maharashtra. “The tariff revision sought by MahaVitaran is unwarranted,” he said.

MahaVitaran has submitted annual revenue requirement and tariff proposal for five years in which it has asked for an average hike of 5.8% for 2020-21, 3.25% for 2021-22, 2.93% for 2022-23, 2.61% for 2023-24 and 2.54% for 2024-25. It has argued that tariff revision is necessary to ensure recovery of full cost of services from consumers to sustain its operations, bridge revenue gap and meet additional costs due to increase in generation and transmission costs, regulatory assets and its legitimate expenses.

MahaVitaran has stated that its revenue gap has surged due to additional costs which are beyond its control. The revenue gap for the period between 2020-21 and 2024-25 has been estimated at ₹46,476.66 crore and the net recovery required from tariff works out to ₹60,313.11 crore.

210,2020/01/18,Auto driver who invested in DSK’s scheme ends life,"A 60-year-old autorickshaw driver, who had invested in jailed developer D.S. Kulkarni’s fixed deposit scheme, allegedly committed suicide at his residence in Mundhwa in Pune early on Friday.

The police said that in his suicide note, Tanaji Ganpat Korake has held Mr. Kulkarni, or ‘DSK’ as he is known, as being fully responsible for his death.

“In the note, the deceased said he had invested ₹4.5 lakh in the fixed deposit scheme in 2014, which was expected to mature in 2017. He needed the money for the wedding of his fourth daughter. He despaired of ever receiving his money as DSK is now behind bars,” said an official from the Mundhwa police station. A case of accidental death had been registered in this regard, he said.

According to Right to Information activist Vijay Kumbhar, since the the first FIR against DSK and his relatives was lodged in 2017, at least 18 investors, all of them senior citizens, have been driven to an early grave due to financial stress or tensions in their families.

“A number of investors have sunk into depression as hopes of retrieving their money has steadily receded. State governments, helmed by whichever party or coalition, have usually displayed apathy when it comes to taking steps against shady developers like D.S. Kulkarni … it is doubtful how much money will be passed onto investors after the sale and valuation of DSK’s assets, as banks will have the first claim on whatever amount is retrieved,” Mr. Kumbhar said.

Mr. Kulkarni and his wife, Hemanti, have been remanded in judicial custody at the Yerwada Central Jail since March 2018 and are accused of defrauding thousands of investors across Pune, Mumbai, and Kolhapur. At least five FIRs have been lodged against the developer and his family across the three cities since October 2017, with more than 3,000 investors filing cheating complaints.

Since then, Economic Offences Wing (EOW) officers have been probing two schemes floated by the developer and his group. These are DSK’s fixed deposit scheme, which promised lucrative gains, and Aadhi Ghar, Nantar Paise (first get the house, then pay the money) scheme in which initial deposits were taken from customers, and the group then assured payment of the EMIs on bank loans till the possession as granted.

More than 8,000 people, a majority of them senior citizens, are said to have invested in the fixed deposit scheme.

After local courts and the Bombay High Court repeatedly turned down their bail pleas, Mr. and Ms. Kulkarni were arrested by the EOW of the Pune Police from a New Delhi hotel in February 2018.

Soon after, the EOW arrested the builder’s sister-in-law Anuradha Purandare; his son, Shirish Kulkarni; his brother’s son-in-law Kedar Vanjape; Mr. Vanjape’s wife Sai; and company officials Dhananjay Pachpor and Vinaykumar Badgandi.

211,2020/01/18,"Amid slump, govt. mulls stamp duty on TDR deals in Mumbai","Faced with a sluggish property market, the Maharashtra government for the first time has proposed a stamp duty on transactions of transferable development rights (TDR) in Mumbai.

A TDR is issued to owners who surrender their land, reserved for playgrounds, markets, gardens and other amenities, to the municipal corporation. The generated development rights certificate is tradable in the market, and can also be loaded on a relieving plot north of the city.

In 2019-20, the revenue collected by the government on property deals dipped by 5.93%, while there was a 14.23% drop in registration of conveyance documents across the State, as per the latest data from the office of the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps.

To shore up revenue, the government is considering levying a stamp duty of 30% on every transaction in the TDR market, estimated to be worth over ₹5,000 crore in Mumbai alone by industry experts. The decision is estimated to generate ₹250 crore, officials said.

As per the latest data presented to Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat during a meeting, the number of property deals registered in Maharashtra dipped to 8,10,717 in 2019-20 from 9,45,296 in the previous year — a drop of 14.23%. The revenue collection on these transactions dropped to ₹12,409.67 crore in 2019-20 from ₹13,192.49 crore, a drop of 5.93%. The Stamp and Registration Department has now proposed a slew of measures. including 30% stamp duty on market value of land on which the TDR is generated.

“This is a significant move to increase revenue. This has been difficult to propose since the consideration for a TDR deal is hard to ascertain most times. We have adopted the market value of land on which TDR is traded as the basis of this levy, if and when approved by the government,” State Inspector General of Registration and Stamps Anil Kawade told The Hindu.

The drop in document registrations — including conveyance deeds, mortgages, and leave and license agreements — has also been significant, falling to 19.60 lakh in 2019-20 from 28.82 lakh in the previous year.

Mr. Thorat and Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar held review meetings this week to suggest a number of measures to increase revenue. The target for 2020-21 is expected to be set at ₹30,000 crore as against the ₹21,741 crore realised in 2019-20, once the measures are implemented, officials said.

“We are looking at a number of measures to shore up revenue, including rationalisation of the ready reckoner rates, which have not been increased for the past two years,” Mr. Thorat told The Hindu.

Apart from rationalising ready reckoner rates, the government will also amend Article 51(a) of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958, to incorporate changes suggested by the Centre to collect higher duty on sale and purchase of shares/securities and commodities traded in authorised exchanges. The department has also suggested 13 new corporations and councils be considered in valuation of the ready reckoner.

“Additionally, land around major projects such as the Navi Mumbai Airport, which is currently valued in square metres, while the ready reckoner continue to base the valuation on a per hectare basis, will also change. This is one of many other types of ready reckoner rationalisation we want to carry out,” said a senior government official.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7tzwy9/article30590159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bmstampdutycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amid-slump-govt-mulls-stamp-duty-on-tdr-deals-in-mumbai/article30590160.ece

216,2020/01/18,Coimbatore Corporation issues notices to contractor over stalled project,"How to break the jinx, is perhaps what the Coimbatore Corporation is thinking of, as part of its plan to float a fresh tender to resume the construction of a multi-level car parking (MLCP) on D.B. Road in R.S. Puram.

The civic body is considering floating a fresh tender as the project is more or less stalled, says an officer on condition of anonymity. “Discussions are going on in this direction and it (Corporation) may soon take a decision to float the tender.”

The Corporation’s likely decision to float a fresh tender comes after it issued two show-cause notices to the contractor asking for reasons for the tepid progress in the project, worth ₹40.78 crore.

The civic body awarded the contract sometime in the first quarter of 2019 to Annai Infra Developers Erode, to build the MLCP on a 60-cent ground within two years of awarding the contract. Thereafter, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani kick-started the work with a ground-breaking ceremony in March 2019.

The Corporation had asked the company to build the MLCP as a ground-plus-four-storey structure to accommodate 370 cars, to ease traffic congestion in R.S. Puram and D.B. Road, in particular. The Corporation had said that the MLCP would be a fully automated structure with elevators and shuttle and folly taking cars to parking lots and retrieving them between 60 and 90 seconds.

The Corporation had given the contract to the company with the condition that it would be responsible for defects and liabilities for a year after the completion of construction and maintenance for five years thereafter.

After starting the construction and completing part of the ground work, the contractor was unable to show satisfactory progress and that is the reason that the Corporation issued a show-cause notice, says the officer. And, after the first show-cause notice, the Corporation issued another one sometime ago seeking explanation for the delay. If the contractor does not respond within the stipulated time, the Corporation will have no choice but to cancel the contract after following the law and float a fresh tender, the officer adds.

The Corporation floating a fresh tender to restart the stalled work will be the latest in its chequered history to somehow build an MLCP in the city. The Corporation first floated the proposal to build not one but three or four MLCPs to de-congest the city. It first invited contractors with the condition that they will have to bear the cost of construction and then recover the investment by collecting parking fees. As the contractors felt that the model would force them to recover the investment after at least 20 years, none evinced interest.

The Corporation then changed the financial model saying it will invest upfront but the contractor will have to share a portion of the parking fees. After a long wait, it finally floated a tender and found successful bidders.

But now this setback has almost put Corporation back on square one, the officer adds.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/38p639/article30591766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18-PROJECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-issues-notices-to-contractor-over-stalled-project/article30591767.ece

219,2020/01/18,MP seeks modifications in Sungam flyover design,"Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan has written to the National Highways pointing out that the current design of the Sungam flyover in the city can lead to traffic congestion on Trichy Road.

In a memorandum to the Divisional Engineer of the National Highways wing of the State Highways, the MP said that assuming that the ramp planned in Ukkadam bypass is only for exit, there is only one entry and exit point for the flyover.

This is a major limiting factor and so buses will not use the flyover.

Vehicles coming from Ukkadam side will have to go to the entry point on Trichy Road and this will lead to traffic congestion at that point.

Similarly, coming from the Nirmala College Road and will have to proceed towards Singanallur will also have to take the entry point near the Highways office. There are no entry points from Nanjundapuram Road or Pankaja Mill Road. This will lead to problems when the flyover is opened for use by the public.

The MP suggested that an entry ramp, at least a single-lane one, should be provided from Nirmala College Road.

In a reply to the MP’s petition, the DE has said that the exit ramp is planned on Ukkadam Bypass Road without any land acquisition.

According to the Indian Road Congress standards, any entry or exit ramp should be two-lane and the minimum width should be 8.5 metres.

To construct such a ramp near Nirmala College, the project should be re-designed to include land acquisition.

There is provision in the design to include entry ramps from Nirmala College Road, Pankaja Mill Road and Nanjundapuram Road whenever land is made available at these locations. Even with the current design, the number of vehicles using Trichy Road will reduce considerably when the flyover is inaugurated, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tv5hjp/article30589737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mp-seeks-modifications-in-sungam-flyover-design/article30589738.ece

The most important of these are in the senior men’s selection committee, with chief selector M.S.K. Prasad and Gagan Khoda reaching the end of their terms.

BCCI has also posted advertisements on its website for two slots in the junior selection panel and all five members of the women’s selection committee.

While Gyanendra Pandey and Rakesh Parikh have served their optimum term in the junior panel, the five members of the women’s committee, headed by Hemlata Kala, are ineligible to continue.

Pandey, L. Sivaramakrishnan and Venkatesh Prasad are in contention for the senior selection panel. It would be interesting to see if all three apply before the deadline of January 24.

223,2020/01/18,K.L. Rahul — soldiering on against challenges,"Seldom would a cricketer have faced as many challenges as K.L. Rahul has over the last six months.

From losing his place in the Test squad to being shuffled in the batting order in white-ball formats to being stand-in wicketkeeper, Rahul has had to combat various situations.

On Friday, his role was to keep wickets in the absence of Rishabh Pant and bat at No. 5 in India’s must-win ODI.

And, Rahul got the job done as nonchalantly as his more famous namesake from Karnataka (Dravid) used to in his heyday. He first ensured India didn’t collapse like it did in Mumbai three days ago and then unleashed himself on the Aussie pacers.

The result was a 52-ball 80 that propelled India to 340 for six.

In the last couple of years, with Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan on song in the openers’ slot, Rahul realised he had to create a niche for himself in the middle-order.

After his knock at the SCA Stadium, Rahul explained he had adopted a watch-and-improve approach to do justice to his role in the middle-order.

“I don’t think technically I’ve practised anything different. I just spoke to some middle-order batsmen and watched a lot of videos. I spoke a lot to Virat and watched a lot of videos of AB (de Villiers) and Steve [Smith], and how they build their innings. Kane [Williamson] is also somebody I’ve tried to go back and watch,” Rahul said.

“I’m trying to learn how to use my game and be better in a situation. My reading of the game’s gotten a lot better now that I’ve played in different positions and batting has become a lot more enjoyable,” he said.

His batting rubbed off on his skills with the other pair of gloves. Having been a ’keeper during his formative years, Rahul is no stranger to the job. He has also kept wickets in the IPL.

A nightmare

His work behind the wickets on Friday was far from that of a stand-in ’keeper. Not only did he keep a clean slate in terms of byes but also effected a brilliant stumping to dismiss Australia captain Aaron Finch.

“We have seen for guys who are regular ’keepers, Jasprit (Bumrah) is still a nightmare to keep to, but I am enjoying it,” he said.

“Sometimes I couldn’t pick Kuldeep, and Jadeja, at the pace he bowls, is just pretty difficult, it’s not what I get in my First Class team.”

224,2020/01/18,Young black players need equal opportunity: Jonty Rhodes,"South Africa’s decision to overlook Temba Bavuma for the second Test against England earlier this month turned the spotlight on the complicated, sensitive issue of racial representation again.

By omitting Bavuma, who had recovered from injury, South Africa fell short of its transformation target — which requires the team to field six coloured players, including two black Africans, averaged over a season — for the second straight Test match.

Real issue

The absence of a big pool of talented, black players on the domestic circuit is a real issue, leaving South African cricket with a tricky balance to strike during what is clearly a painful phase of transition.

Jonty Rhodes understands the difficulty of the task before the team management. “Now you have a scenario where (Kagiso) Rabada is suspended (for the fourth Test).

“If (Lungi) Ngidi is injured and can’t play, that will mean Bavuma has to play. You’re dropping a fast bowler but you’re bringing in a batsman. From that perspective, it really is tough,” he says.

Quotas needed

But Rhodes, who grew up during the apartheid era in a racially-segregated South Africa, is in no doubt about the need for racial quotas in sport. “We in South Africa have a legacy of apartheid. How many generations does it take to address that?

“You still have disadvantaged communities based on race. So they might have political freedom but they don’t have economic freedom,” he says.

Rhodes is brutally honest in reflecting on his own privileges when he started out, as a white cricketer. “I certainly benefited from the fact that I wasn’t really competing with 50% of the population. I literally was competing only with the white players.

“You talk about white privilege and it raises a lot of heat and debate on social media but it is the case. I’m very aware of that. My cricketing statistics as a player were very average when I was selected.

“If I was competing with the rest of the country then possibly I wouldn’t have been picked. And I would not have been diving around the field.”

Rhodes is here for the Global Sports Injury Conclave (GSIC) 2020. The two-day conference aims to build an injury-free sports ecosystem, with the participation of experts from various sporting disciplines.

The 50-year-old believes that South Africa’s failure to produce a steady stream of young black cricketers is due to lack of opportunity.

Struggles

The country’s triumph at the Rugby World Cup — the side was led by a black captain and both the Springboks’ tries in the final were scored by players of colour — put into stark contrast cricket’s struggles with transformation.

“The biggest question for me is why in over 20 years have we not produced opportunities for young players in disadvantaged communities? It’s not about racism. It’s about equal opportunity and that’s not happening.

What rugby has done well is in building their structures, working in disadvantaged areas. Cricket has a lot to learn.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/14wuw/article30595639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19JONTY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/young-black-players-need-equal-opportunity-jonty-rhodes/article30595640.ece
225,2020/01/18,Mumbai needs to turn the tide,"Effective away, lame ducks at home.

With the kind of Ranji Trophy season Mumbai has had so far, time is running out for the domestic giant to turn the tide and keep its hopes of regaining the coveted title.

The Group B game against Uttar Pradesh, starting at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, is perhaps the last opportunity for Mumbai to set its home record straight and keep itself in the hunt for a knockout spot.

Despite starting the season with six points in Baroda and returning from Chennai last week with three points against a formidable opposition, it’s the two losses at home that have hounded Mumbai so far.

While Railways derailed its campaign at Wakhede last month, Karnataka virtually crumpled the 41-times champion with another convincing win at the Bandra-Kurla Complex facility the following week.

As a result, with just nine points from four games, Mumbai still find itself in the lower half of the joint tally of 18 teams in Groups A and B, five of whom will qualify for the quarterfinals.

But more than thinking about the qualification, stand-in skipper Aditya Tare, who starred with a century against Tamil Nadu, is banking on building a character in the younger lot in the Mumbai dressing room.

‘Nothing to lose’

“Now that we have our backs to the wall, the only way is up. We have nothing to lose and that’s why I want the team to be fearless. It’s important to build the culture of playing the brand of cricket Mumbai is renowned for,” Tare said on Saturday.

Tare admits that Mumbai’s season suffered major setbacks in its first two games at home. “It was unfortunate. Both the matches could have gone our way but unfortunately we couldn’t perform to our potential,” he said.

While Mumbai, which handed two debuts last week, has been turned into an inexperienced bunch in the middle of the tournament, a young Uttar Pradesh has fared reasonably well so far.

Saurabh Kumar’s unit has garnered 13 points in five games, thus keeping its hopes of a knockout berth alive. It would be interesting to see how the battle of young outfits pans out on a sporting strip at the Wankhede Stadium.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mumbai-needs-to-turn-the-tide/article30594729.ece
226,2020/01/18,Vidarbha could find conditions more challenging than Delhi,"After a week’s break, Delhi resumes its Ranji Trophy campaign by hosting two-time defending champion Vidarbha at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground in a crucial tie beginning on Sunday.

The return of Ishant Sharma and the inclusion of left-arm pacer Kulwant Khejrolia have strengthened the home team in conditions that could assist fast bowling. Vidarbha clearly has the batting to deal with the challenges. Delhi’s third change is opener Hiten Dalal.

Favourite Vidarbha is currently tied third with Karnataka on the points table with 17. Andhra (21) and Punjab (18) are ahead but have played a game more than Vidarbha.

Delhi, which has also played four matches like Vidarbha, has 10 points. Before getting a mandatory week’s break, Delhi did well its previous two outings. It beat Hyderabad here and claimed three points from host Punjab.

Overall, Delhi’s batting has stuttered in most matches while its bowling has not been particularly threatening. Indeed, injuries to some of its fast bowlers — Pradeep Sangwan, Vikas Tokas, Pawan Suyal — and the call of National duty for Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant and Navdeep Saini has hurt the team seriously.

As a result, this depleted unit could find it tough to deal with an upbeat Vidarbha. With cold wave returning to the Capital, the visiting team could find the conditions more challenging than the opposition.

Vidarbha has two outright wins at home against Bengal and Rajasthan (with bonus point) and gained the first innings lead against leader Andhra. Only Punjab snatched three points from the team so far this season.

Satish on a roll

Former Karnataka batsman Ganesh Satish has been on a roll, scoring 445 runs including a double century and a century. Skipper Faiz Fazal, Mohit Kale and Akshay Wadkar have all aggregated over 200 runs with an average of 50.

Among the bowlers, left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate has claimed 22 wickets, followed by off-spinner Akshay Wakhare with 11.

It remains to be seen how effective these slower bowlers prove over the next four days.

Delhi’s batting mainstay remains vice-captain Nitish Rana (321 runs). Opener Kunal Chandela, Lalit Yadav, skipper Dhruv Shorey and Anuj Rawat have tallied over 150 runs in the season so far.

Surely, lack of big runs from its top order has consistently hurt Delhi.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vidarbha-could-find-conditions-more-challenging-than-delhi/article30594342.ece
227,2020/01/18,All set for a grand series-decider at Bengaluru,"The Indian team came away with several positives from Friday’s second One-Day International against Australia at Rajkot, but has a few injury concerns ahead of the series-decider at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Sunday.

The availability of openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan hangs in the balance. While Rohit injured his shoulder while fielding at Rajkot, Dhawan was hit on the ribs by a Pat Cummins snorter. Dhawan, however, batted on to score a terrific 96.

Dashing duo

The home side will hope the two regain fitness quickly, as they have been in good form. ""Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are progressing well. Their recovery is being closely monitored, and a call on their participation in the final ODI will be taken before the match,"" a BCCI statement read.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant is another injury concern, struck on the helmet by Cummins in the first ODI. His replacement, K.L. Rahul, ensured that Pant was not missed. Rahul adapted wonderfully to an unfamiliar three-down position and smashed a crucial 52-ball 80.

The local lad could face yet another batting-order change, returning to the top if either Rohit or Dhawan miss the action. Rahul also showed smart glovework, his stumping to take out Aaron Finch prompting suggestions that he is qualified to be picked as regular wicketkeeper. There were many more signs that augur well for India.

Skipper Virat Kohli got going with a fluent 78, and the bowling attack — led by fit-again Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav — was effective. Even Manish Pandey, who failed with the bat, contributed with a stunning one-handed catch to dismiss the dangerous David Warner.

Australia, meanwhile, has enough quality in the ranks to hit back strongly.

The visitors were on track in the Rajkot chase until the 30th over, before losing three wickets in the space of eight overs.

Steve Smith, who fell at this crucial stage after making 98, believes that the series is set for an exciting finish. “It sets up a nice grand finale, doesn’t it? One-all going into Bangalore, which is usually another pretty good batting wicket. I think it’s going to be an exciting game, with both teams having played some good cricket throughout this series,” Smith said after the loss on Friday.

Smith expects the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium to be full of runs. “Bangalore is a nice batting wicket. It feels like the ball goes further in the air. It sort of travels, and you see lots of sixes generally there. It’s also quite a fast outfield, and it’s usually a nice-paced wicket. I can see perhaps another high-scoring game,” Smith said.

On the injury to Rohit, Smith said, “Rohit is a world-class player — we wish him all the best, and hope he’s all right. But if not, that does leave a hole for them, because he’s phenomenal at the top of the order. His record speaks for itself.”

Only cricket, please!

A full house is expected on Sunday. The Karnataka State Cricket Association urged spectators to enjoy the cricket without using the occasion to make political statements.

To enforce this directive, fans will be barred from bringing placards, banners and marker pens into the stadium.

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

228,2020/01/18,"Rahul likely to come back for Tests, Hardik may return for ODIs, if fit","KL Rahul’s stupendous white ball form makes him a firm favourite to get his place back in the red ball team even as selectors fret on all-rounder Hardik Pandya’s fitness before picking ODI and Test squads for the New Zealand tour here on Sunday.

Rahul has been India’s most consistent player in T20 and ODIs but he lost his place in the Test squad after tour of Australia.

But as skipper Virat Kohli said that it’s difficult to leave a player like Rahul from any squad, he has better chance than fit-again Prithvi Shaw or Subman Gill who was reserve Test opener during home series last season.

The other change in Test squad could be fast-rising Navdeep Saini going as an extra pacer rather than Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner since only one among Ravichandran Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja will make the playing XI.

Similarly, Indian team management is eagerly waiting for Hardik to become “bowling fit” for white ball matches post back surgery and will be automatic choice for ODIs if fit.

He had failed the mandatory “bowling workload test” after which his personal trainer S. Rajnikanth advised him to pull out of India A’s shadow tour.

In case, Hardik can’t make it, selectors might either look at hitting prowess of Suryakumar Yadav since the ODIs in the Kiwiland will be an extension of T20s in World Cup year.

There is also a possibility that Ajinkya Rahane will be considered due to his better technique compared to Kedar Jadhav who is slowly falling off in pecking order.

“Kedar is certainly not going to play 2023 World Cup and doesn’t even bowl now. Since he is not in T20, no point in carrying him to New Zealand.

Though Dhawan carried on after receiving treatment, he didn’t field during the Australian innings. While a team spokesperson said Rohit was being assessed by the physio, he insisted that Dhawan “looks fine.”

Kohli was even more happy that Rahul batted at No 5 and also kept wickets which will now give India some serious options moving forward.

“It’s very important to figure out the best team you can put on the park and when you see how KL was batting today, it’s very difficult to leave someone like that out. Batting at No. 5 and batting like that for the team, this is probably the best he’s played at international level. That knocked showed maturity and class,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Kohli himself was back at No 3 and contributed an effortless 78 off 76 balls.

Asked about the change from the last game, the skipper said: “We live in the days of social media and the panic button was pressed too early. ....We know exactly what we’re doing in the dressing room. On the outside there’s a lot of panic that we don’t really focus on.”

He was happy that Shikhar Dhawan contributed a stylish 96, which he believes augurs well for the team.

“Back to No. 3 was good for the team so I’m happy from that point of view that it helped the team. In ODI cricket, Shikhar has been one of our most consistent performers. I am very happy that he scored runs as well. It always augurs well when he and Rohit score runs.”

The skipper assured that Rohit, who sustained a shoulder injury is doing fine and is expected to be available for the next game.

“I asked Rohit briefly just now. It’s that left shoulder that has popped out a few times.

“Very sad to hear about the demise of Shri Bapu Nadkarni. I grew up hearing about the record of him bowling 21 consecutive maiden overs in a Test. My condolences to his family and dear ones,” Tendulkar tweeted.

For Gavaskar, it was more of a personal loss as he fondly recollected Ndkarni’s pro-active role as an assistant manager who doubled up as a tactician during India’s tour of Australia in 1980-81.

“He came as an assistant manager for quite a number of our tours. He was very encouraging. His favourite term was “chhoddo matt” [hang in there]. He was a gritty cricketer despite playing in the days when gloves and thigh pads were not very good, not much protective equipment as you would get hit. But still hang in there as he believed in “chhoddo matt”,’ Gavaskar told reporters in Rajkot on Friday.

BCCI secretary Jay Shah also expressed his grief at Nadkarni’s death.

“It is with profound sadness that BCCI has learnt of the passing of former India all-rounder Rameshchandra Gangaram ‘Bapu’ Nadkarni.

The iconic opener also recalled how Nadkarni helped Sandeep Patil to recover quickly from concussion that he suffered after being hit on the head by a Len Pascoe bouncer. Patil came back in the next Test and scored a memorable 174, a knock that was the highlight of his inconsistent career.

“He was probably the main guy instrumental in having Sandeep Patil come back after a blow on his head. He was the one who kept urging Sandeep that ‘it doesn’t matter, you are here and you should go out and bat again’

The West Delhi MP had earlier this week said mosques constructed on encroached government land here are certain to be demolished.

The Delhi Assembly elections will be held on February 8 and results for the 70 Assembly seats declared on February 11.

“The government land on which religious places are constructed will be vacated after BJP forms government in Delhi. Complaints have come regarding more than 54 mosques and madrassas on government land in Delhi. The list has already been given to the Lt Governor,” Mr. Verma tweeted in Hindi.

On Monday, he had said if anyone complains to him about encroachment of government land in Delhi by any temple or gurudwara, he will take up the matter with authorities.

“But no temples or gurudwaras are found on government land, only mosques are found on government land,” he had said at a press conference.

In June last year, Mr. Verma had written to Lt Governor Anil Baijal seeking action against mosques and graveyards allegedly constructed on government land.

He had also furnished a list of 50 such encroachments to the LG for action.

236,2020/01/18,30 experts hired to curb cybercrimes across country,"In a fortnight, about 30 people will join the National Cyber Forensic Lab (NCFL) to assist security agencies in preventing, containing and investigating complex cybercrimes across the country, sources told The Hindu.

A senior officer said that the idea was conceived a few months ago to strengthen the NCFL and upgrade the existing cyber forensic facilities in order to help the investigating officers across the country to “prevent, contain, mitigate, investigate and prosecute latest and complex cybercrimes,” he said.

Delhi Police Cyber Prevention, Awareness & Detection Centre (CyPAD) which hosts NCFL was tasked by the Ministry of Home Affairs with the hiring of personnel and a Public Sector Undertaking was engaged as manpower consultant.

Selection process

“A committee comprising experts from the Capital’s noted technical institutions conducted the selection process,” the officer said, adding that about 30 have finally been selected for the role. The approved number is 50 and the remaining will be hired depending on the requirement.

The hired personnel, the official said, have varied backgrounds and experiences in forensic science. “They will be manning different labs like Cryptocurrency Lab, Cloud Forensic Lab, and Network Forensic Lab among others,” the officer said.

The team will be working under the supervision of senior officers at CyPAD, sources said.

The MHA is executing a scheme called I-C4 (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre) through its Cyber and Information Security division of which NCFL is one vertical. The CyPAD was inaugurated by former Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in 2019 with an aim to provide cyber investigation, cyber forensics, cyber safety and security-related services to the citizens as well as to police units and agencies of Delhi.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fl55kn/article30579728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VZ3CYBERCRIMEKI22,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/30-experts-hired-to-curb-cybercrimes-across-country/article30590110.ece
237,2020/01/18,Chandrashekhar Azad vows to continue fight against new citizenship law,"Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad returned to the iconic Jama Masjid on Friday to a rousing welcome by hundreds of supporters, a day after walking out of the Tihar Jail on bail and hours before a deadline requiring him to leave Delhi.

Holding a copy of the Constitution and wearing his trademark blue ‘safaa’, Mr. Azad read out the Preamble to mark his protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

On December 20, Old Delhi witnessed high drama when the flamboyant Dalit leader dodged police to reach the mosque to participate in a planned but unauthorised protest after Friday prayers.

He was arrested the following day.

While addressing reporters, Mr. Azad launched a strong attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying when the voices of lakhs of women sitting in protest at Shaheen Bagh in the national capital has failed to reach him, “how will he listen to the people in remote areas?” He added that it would be “shameful” if he doesn’t speak up at a time when the Prime Minister is making statements asking to “identify people from their clothes”.

Reading out eminent poet Rahat Indori’s lines “...sabhi ka khoon shaamil hai yahan ki mitti mein, kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai” (this land has witnessed sacrifices from everyone/Hindustan is not anyone’s property), he criticised the religion-based criteria for the CAA. He said that in the past, the exact opposite of what Mr. Modi promised has happened, be it the creation of two crore jobs or measures to check inflation, “so when he says the law will give citizenship to people, I feel it would end up taking it away from people”. Referring to the CAA that paves the way for citizenship to people from six religious minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, he said the government is more concerned about the people from these countries, “but we will worry about our Indian people first” without any discrimination.

‘Politics plan shelved’

Asked about his plan to enter electoral politics — regarding which he announced in December — he said politics can take a back seat when a “black” law such as CAA, that threatens to damage the country, has come to the fore. The movement will continue, he said, adding that the need of the hour is to unite. He said he will not let the ""people’s movement"" lose momentum.

What has been labelled as an “inflammatory speech”, were merely lines he read out from the Constitution, he said. Mr. Azad urged Mr. Modi to respect the Constitution and not weaken it with controversial legislations. He also slammed the recent violence in Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University, saying “our sisters were beaten up. In this country, women are hailed as ‘devis’[goddesses] ... Everyone saw what happened in JNU…” He added that students were the “strength” of the country.

On Tuesday, during Mr. Azad’s bail hearing, Additional Sessions Judge at the Tis Hazari courts Kamini Lau had slammed the Delhi Police for failing to produce incriminating evidence against the leader. She underlined that the right to peaceful protest was constitutional, but the police were behaving as though “Jama Masjid was in Pakistan”. She noted that people were protesting on the streets because what should have been said inside Parliament was not said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rn81ze/article30590107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18JAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/azad-vows-to-continue-fight-against-new-citizenship-law/article30590108.ece

A Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed both the States to take remedial action and ensure that prior approval is sought from the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA). “Before any such permission is granted, the CGWA may ensure actual compliance of conditions of replenishment of groundwater with regard to the water table in areas so that there is no further deterioration of critical, semi-critical and over-exploited areas in terms of groundwater availability,” it said.

The Tribunal also specified that approvals should be granted based on a study of the availability of groundwater and periodical report that the “replenishment had resulted in improvement in ground situation”.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), along with the two State governments, were also directed to ensure recovery of compensation from violators by taking appropriate coercive measures. “The CPCB and the State pollution control boards may file further compliance status report as on April 30 after carrying out detailed inspections,” the Bench said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/take-action-on-illegal-groundwater-extraction/article30589977.ece

A Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel also directed that an ‘environment monitoring cell’ has to be set in the offices of Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories.

While observing that there was a huge gap in the amount of waste generated and treated, the Bench said, “Current processing of waste generated and collected is also not taking place on a regular basis. For any person travelling by train, hot spots of scattered garbage and overflowing sewage are common sights.”

Fix accountability

“Satisfactory sewage management also remains a far cry. This unsatisfactory state of affairs must be remedied at the earliest and in a time-bound manner by initiative at the highest level. Accountability needs to be fixed and consequences for failure clearly provided and enforced,” the Bench said.

The green panel also specified that financial burden may be shared with the State governments in case the local bodies are unable to bear the costs for remedial action.

“Apart from compensation, adverse entries must be made in annual confidential reports of CEO of the said local bodies and other senior functionaries in department of urban development, etc. who are responsible for compliance of orders of this Tribunal,” the Bench added.

240,2020/01/18,Court acquits man after police fail to follow procedures under NDPS Act,"A Delhi court has acquitted a man, who was caught with 12 gm of smack, as the police failed to follow the procedures for search, seizure and arrest in a Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act case.

The Mangolpuri police in north-west Delhi had arrested the accused and recovered the contraband following a tip-off.

The prosecution examined 10 witnesses to prove the case.

Three of the witnesses gave contradictory statements.

The court also found that the sample of the seized drug sent for forensic examination was tampered with.

Under the NDPS Act, if there is prior information about the recovery of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances from any person, the power to arrest such a person or to make a search or to make a seizure are not vested with the police officer. Only a Metropolitan Magistrate or a First Class Magistrate or specially empowered second class magistrate has the right to issue search and arrest warrants against a person who is believed to have committed an offence under the Act.

“Whenever the raids are made on the basis of prior information, the search, seizure or arrest by officers other than the empowered officer or duly authorised officers as enumerated in Section 41 (2) and 42(1) of NDPS Act would vitiate the proceedings against the accused and the compliance to this extent is mandatory. The accused is thus entitled to be benefited for non-compliance of these provisions,” Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Pandey said.

On the tampering of the sample, the Judge said: “Since the Forensic Science Laboratory forms were not deposited, the same could not have been sent to the laboratory. Hence, there is a possibility of compromising with the integrity and tampering of the case property.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-acquits-man-after-police-fail-to-follow-procedures-under-ndps-act/article30589968.ece
241,2020/01/18,HC holds Tomar’s 2015 victory ‘void’,"The Delhi High Court on Friday held as void the election of former Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar in the 2015 Assembly polls in the Capital for giving false declaration regarding his educational qualification in his nomination papers.

Mr. Tomar, who had contested from Tri Nagar constituency last election, has again been named by AAP as its candidate from the same constituency for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections on February 8.

“It is held that the false declaration by the respondent no.1 [Tomar] of his educational qualification and vocation has resulted in the inducement and thwarted free exercise of the electoral right of the voter,” said Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw.

‘Not an advocate’

“It is held that the respondent no.1 has not lawfully obtained LLB degree and was not duly enrolled as an advocate at the time of filing his nomination,” the court said.

The order came on a plea by BJP leader Nand Kishore Garg alleging that Mr. Tomar’s election had been “materially affected by deliberate concealment, misrepresentation, wrong declaration and wilful suppression of the educational qualification in the affidavit filed along with the nomination form”.

In response, the former Law Minister said: “I will file my nomination on Saturday only as decided earlier.

“The Congress was putting thrust in using the social media platform in a creative and positive manner,” he said.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will list the key promises to be fulfilled in the next five years for the people of Delhi in the “guarantee card”, he said.

At the rally, she was joined by Education Minister Manish Sisodia. Amid chants of “lage raho Kejriwal” and announcements pertaining to Ms. Atishi’s contribution in the education sector, the over two-hour rally covered Govindpuri Extension, Giri Nagar, Kalkaji Extension and the adjoining slum clusters.

“Several governments have come and gone with their endless promises but we can only hope for the government which has worked for us to be back in power. The development work is done by the Delhi government in the last five years, including providing basic amenities like hospitals, schools and toilets, is commendable. What else do we, the common people need?” said 66-year-old Ramashree Yadav.

A 45-year-old housewife, Savitri from Navjeevan camp, said: “Mehngai ne kamad tod diya hain [The rise in the price of things has broken our backs]. At this time, it is only Kejriwal’s government which has thought about people like us. Free bus rides for women, electricity and uninterrupted water supply have benefited us a lot. While roads and infrastructure here need improvement, we can only hope that the Kejriwal-government is back so that they work for us.”

At Govindpuri Extension, owner of a photo studio Baldev Raj, said: “These days there are CCTV cameras across the locality, which is a good step towards safety. The government which has worked will definitely find the support of the people.”

Shailesh Kumar, a priest from Kalkaji, complained that the party has not fielded a local face from the constituency.

“What is the point of a representative who is not a local? Traffic over the years has increased and the condition of the roads is the same. We can only hope that other parties field a local so that we can vote for them,” Mr. Kumar said.

As for 65-year-old Balchandra Rajvar, a resident of JJ cluster, “new leaders are only reaping benefits off what Sheila Dikshit did”.

“Delhi saw the maximum development during her [Dikshit] tenure. The metro, flyovers and several other developments were done by her. Others just seem to be taking the credit. Free electricity, announced just before elections, seems to be a two-month thing only.

247,2020/01/18,BJP releases list of 57 candidates,"The BJP on Friday released its first list of 57 candidates for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections on February 8.

After a marathon meeting on Thursday night, the party’s Central Election Committee (CEC), which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, listed 57 names but refrained from clearing a candidate against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to be fielded from the New Delhi seat.

Announcing the list, BJP Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari said the names include 11 Scheduled Caste candidates and four women among others. All three sitting MLAs of the party — Vijender Gupta (Rohini), Jagdish Pradhan (Mustafabad) and O.P. Sharma (Vishwas Nagar) — have been repeated.

Rebel AAP MLAs also found space in the BJP list with Kapil Mishra to be fielded from Model Town and Anil Bajpai from Gandhi Nagar. No Muslim candidate has been announced so far. However, two other leaders who joined the BJP from AAP — suspended Bijwasan MLA Devender Sehrawat and Guggan Singh — did not make the cut.

Mr. Tiwari, who did not field any questions, said another CEC meeting will be held soon to determine the remaining 13 candidates.

Meanwhile, the party seemed to have relied on the electoral and administrative experience of its cadre while selecting them with four former Mayors and many councilors among those selected.

In addition to the three sitting MLAs of the party, former Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma’s brother and former Mayor Master Azad Singh, who will be fielded from Mundka, also figured among the candidates.

The party also fielded former Mayors — Khushi Ram from Ambedkar Nagar, Ravindra Gupta from Matia Mahal and Yogender Chandolia from Karol Bagh — in addition to its National Secretary R.P. Singh, who will contest from Rajender Nagar.

Most of the candidates announced on Friday were also nominated by the BJP in 2013 and 2015 Assembly polls and also include two former Deputy Mayors and a senior leader in the BJP-led South Delhi Municipal Corporation.

Greater Kailash candidate Shikha Rai is the former SDMC Leader of the House and an ex-chairperson of its Standing Committee. Rekha Gupta, a former councillor, will contest from Shalimar Bagh.

Lata Sodhi, fielded from Ballimaran, is a former councillor. Her father-in-law Motilal Sodhi also represented the seat as an MLA. Kiran Vaid, who will be in the fray from the Trilokpuri seat, is a sitting councillor and has also served as a Deputy Mayor of East Delhi.

248,2020/01/18,Notice to CBI on plea by Sengar against conviction,"The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notice to the CBI on a plea by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a minor girl in Unnao in 2017, challenging his conviction in the case.

A Bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal asked Sengar to deposit in two months time the fine amount of ₹25 lakh. Out of the money deposited, an amount of ₹10 lakh will be released to the rape survivor without any condition.

The High Court, during the hearing, noted that it was not inclined to suspend the sentence or fine amount of Sengar as he is an undertrial in other cases also. Following this, Sengar’s counsel withdrew the application for suspension of the sentence.

“Too much tragedy happened with the victim in this case. In the facts of the case, we are not inclined to suspend the sentence. You have to pay ₹10 lakh to the victim. There can be no condition to it,” the court said.

The counsel appearing for Sengar claimed that his client does not have money to deposit the fine amount as he was the sole earning member of the family, has two daughters of marriageable age.

The court posted the appeal for hearing on May 4.

In his plea, Sengar has sought quashing of the December 16, 2019 judgment of the trial court here which convicted him. He has also sought setting aside of the December 20 order sentencing him to imprisonment till remainder of his life. Sengar has claimed that he has been wrongly convicted.

The trial court had awarded him the maximum punishment of life term with a rider that the convict will remain in jail for “remainder of his natural biological life” and also imposed an exemplary fine of ₹25 lakh on him to be paid within a month.

250,2020/01/18,Death sentence for rape-murder in 2019 highest in 4 years: NLU report,"Higher number of death sentences awarded in India in recent years relate to cases of sexual offences, a report by National Law University (NLU), Delhi, revealed.

The fourth edition of ‘The Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics’ published by Project 39A of NLU-Delhi said the number of death sentences awarded for murders involving sexual offences in 2019 was at the highest in four years.

Cases and convictions

The trial courts in India imposed 102 death sentences in 2019, a significant drop from 162 death sentences in 2018. However, the percentage of sexual offences in these cases increased from 41.35 (67 out of 162) in 2018 to 52.94 in 2019 (54 out of 102 sentences). This trend was also seen at the High Courts where 65.38% (17 out of 26) cases of confirmations of death sentences involved sexual offences along with murder, the highest in four years.

The Supreme Court in 2019 dealt with 27 capital punishment cases, highest number since 2001, primarily under former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi’s tenure.

The report said that this can be linked to the priority given to such cases by Chief Justice Gogoi. The Supreme Court last year confirmed the death penalty of seven cases out of which four were of murder involving sexual offences. It commuted a total of 17 cases of death penalty.

The report stated that there were widespread discussions on capital punishment in 2019 involving sexual offences against women and children.

POCSO Act amendment

It observed that the amendment to The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, introducing stringent mandatory minimum punishments and death penalty for penetrative sexual assault on children was a major development in this direction.

Additionally, in response to the public outcry following a brutal gang-rape and murder in Hyderabad, the Andhra Pradesh amended the Indian Penal Code to introduce the death penalty for rape.

“National debates and legislative trends, as well as data on administration of death penalty in this report, indicate that the issue of sexual violence against women and children is now at the heart of the debate on capital punishment in India,” the report said.

It added that the “rampancy and impunity of sexual violence and the fractures within the criminal justice system perpetuating this cycle has led to a public outcry for harsher punishments”.

There was also a corresponding increase in death warrants issued last year, six against one in 2018, with all warrants eventually stayed by the courts, the report stated.

“All warrants that were issued indicate a lack of compliance with the guidelines issued in the case of Shabnam vs. Union of India, which requires that a warrant for execution not be issued until reasonable time for exhausting all remedies under the law has lapsed and specifies procedures to be followed in issuing such warrant,” Project 39A report stated.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/endd4b/article30590246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/criminal-justicejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/death-sentence-for-rape-murder-in-2019-highest-in-4-years-nlu-report/article30589789.ece
251,2020/01/18,Unravelling a hidden gem at Orchha,"Orchha literally means ‘a hidden gem’. For the most part until the last decade, Orchha remained pretty much hidden from the rest of the world, apart from the handful of loyal visitors who would keep going back time and again. The monuments and palaces of Orchha date back to the 15th and 16th centuries, adorned by the cenotaph or chattri architecture. At about 500 kilometres from Delhi, Orchha is already on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites and was also awarded the best heritage city by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.

In an effort to preserve and sustain the local, while exposing it to the global, the Madhya Pradesh Tourism has announced a three day festival called Namaste Orchha, that seeks to trace the natural and cultural landscape of this quaint town. Yasmin Kidwai, Festival Director and Curator of Namaste Orchha says, “It is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. When you visit (the festival), you will know that our priority is the revival of the space, to focus on rural employment, to uplift the economy which is in a really bad state, and also make people proud of their history, maybe.”

On the evening of March 6, there will be an inaugural programme with cultural performances, along with a 3D projection mapping at the Jahangir Mahal, a part of the Orchha Fort Complex (housing the Jahangir, Raja and Sheesh Mahals). The town of Orchha, owing to its location on the banks of the Betwa river, lends itself to a number of nature trails, surrounded by a wildlife sanctuary as well. The activities will also include rafting, along with workshops on local handicrafts and art forms, offered by the communities in Orchha. For the evening, there will be a Maha Arti, similar to the one performed on the banks of the Ganga in Varanasi, followed by a cultural evening by a beautiful Baobab tree or Kalpavriksh.

Through the three days, there will also be a food and crafts bazar, displaying cuisines, arts and crafts of the whole of Madhya Pradesh. The last day will display the organic farming offerings and potentials of Orchha and its surrounding areas.

“More than a festival, it is an ongoing story, an effort to connect with the syncretic culture and the warmth of the Bundelkhand region. As a part of this festival we have already started working with the locals on skill development and language, etc. It will also give a chance to the local musicians and artistes to share the stage with the artistes we would be bringing in. It is for the locals, they need to feel ownership of the festival,” says Yasmin.

The music and dance shows will be held on the first day at the Jahangir Fort. The fort is a subtle reminder of its secular history; the grandiose monument was built by Maharaja Bir Singh Deo in honour of a visit by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Also a part of the Orchha Fort Complex is the iconic Ram Raja Temple, built in honour of Lord Ram as this is the only place where he is worshipped as a god and as a king. The local artistes will perform in collaboration with national and international artistes, including artistes like Shubha Mudgal and the band Indian Ocean. Designer Anupamaa Dayal and renowned sculptor and nail art painter Wajid Khan are some of the other artistes roped in for the festival. Without divulging the details, Yasmin said the music, dance and theatre shows will showcase some of the best in the country.

Namaste Orchha will be held in Orchha from the 6th to the 8th of March, 2020

The accused, Y Manivardhan Reddy of Hyderabad and Selvam Ramraj of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, threatened and demanded money from various persons facing cases with Central law enforcement agencies.

The duo had contacted one of the accused in a CBI case pertaining to a bank fraud, and demanded huge amount of money in the name of senior CBI officials posted at New Delhi, for which they used a malicious software to obtain the landline telephone number 011-24302700 of the agency.

Speaking at a conference on “Integrating Women’s Development with Nation’s Development: Role of Stakeholders,” held at NALSAR University of Law, she said that women’s potential has not yet been realised and even if 50% of Indian women start working, the GDP of India will increase by at least over 9%.

Chairperson of the Telangana State Human Rights Commission Justice G. Chandraiah emphasised on the importance of human rights, particularly Right to Dignity and Rights of Women.

257,2020/01/18,High Court forms panel to monitor work on city canals,"The Kerala High Court on Friday constituted a monitoring committee to verify the progress of work proposed by the Government for maintenance of the drainage system and major canals in the city.

Justice Devan Ramchandran constituted the committee with member secretary, Kerala State legal Services Authority (KELSA), as its convenor and secretary, Ernakulam District Legal Services Authority, Amicus Curiae, and the District Medical Officer as members and the District Collector as ex-officio member.

The court ordered the committee to verify the progress of work and file a report by February 5. It also directed the panel to ensure that the Kochi Corporation carry out the day-to-day cleaning of canals and drains. The court passed the order on a petition on cleaning of the Thevara-Perandoor canal.

Operation Breakthrough

When the petition came up for hearing, the Advocate General pointed out that 202 projects had been identified under Operation Breakthrough, a pilot project to ensure maintenance of the drainage system and canals. As many as 36 projects have been identified for immediate execution.

The Government has allocated ₹65 crore for the projects, and ₹10 crore has been sanctioned from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and kept ready for disbursement for 36 projects. The initiative will be completed by March.

The court expressed hope that the State would disburse the remaining ₹55 crore as and when a requisition was made by the high level committee.

258,2020/01/18,HC unhappy with Corporation’s claim on removal of encroachers,"The Kerala High Court has directed the Kochi Corporation Secretary to appear before it on January 27 in a case seeking the removal of encroachers from the Kothuruthy river in the city.

The court ordered the appearance of the Secretary as it was unhappy with the statement of the Corporation. The Corporation had said that it had decided to prepare an action plan in this regard and construct a new bridge and rehabilitate the evictees after restoring the river.

Supporting documents

The court described the statement as bereft of supporting documents. The statement had not considered earlier steps taken by the Corporation and their outcomes. The issue relating to the removal of encroachers had been pending since 2012.

The court also noted that despite a High Court directive to file an affidavit explaining how the width of the river had come down to 16 metres, no affidavit had been filed.

Possession certificates

It also pointed out that as per a report filed by the District Collector, as many as 178 families had encroached on the river, of whom 165 had been given possession certificates. However, the report of the Revenue Additional Secretary said that only 42 families had been rehabilitated.

The court said that it was discernible that there was no coordination among stakeholders. If the Government had decided to rehabilitate encroachers, steps ought to have been taken for it. But nothing seemed to have been done since 2012 except for the sanctioning of ₹4 lakh for planting boundary stones. The court directed the District Collector and the Corporation Secretary to produce all the files on the action taken for removal of encroachers and their rehabilitation.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/esj4s4/article30590071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KIKONTHURUTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-unhappy-with-corporations-claim-on-removal-of-encroachers/article30590072.ece
259,2020/01/18,Priest critical of Synod’s reference to ‘Love Jihad’,"The observations of the Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church on alleged ‘love jihad’ at a time when the country was being communally polarised was “mistimed”, said Kuriakose Mundadan, presbyteral council secretary of the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese.

Father Mundadan had written on the same lines in his column in Sathyadeepam, a weekly published by the Ernakulam Archdiocesan Publication Trust.

“The Church leaders should have displayed more restraint and desisted from making such a needless reference, which would only worsen the current volatile situation prevailing in the country. Common sense dictated at least maintaining silence on the issue since there was no evidence to suggest organised efforts towards love jihad,” he said.

Father Mundadan was also critical of the inability of the Church to project a united front against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He noted that while the Thiruvananthapuram Archbishop (Latin rite) Soosa Pakiam M. had taken a stern stance against the CAA, the Synod had merely urged the Government to allay fears over it.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/priest-critical-of-synods-reference-to-love-jihad/article30590035.ece
260,2020/01/18,‘Women will be worst-hit by CAA’,"It is women who will be the worst-hit by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), according to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader M.K. Kanimozhi, MP.

Talking at a women’s meet against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at an event organised by the Muslim Educational Society (MES) here on Friday, she said the discriminatory legislation did not target Muslims alone. “It is true that the RSS is out to take on the Muslims, but it is against anyone who thinks India is a secular country. But women will be the worst affected as not many are in possession of land ownership documents,” she said

Ms. Kanimozhi, who spoke in a mix of Tamil and English, said Kerala and Tamil Nadu belonged to the same family, as the rest of the southern languages and cultures. The fight, she said, was for the idea of India, with diversity at its core and accused the BJP of trying to break India by making it a Hindu, Hindi-speaking nation.

The protest against CAA was not exactly a political protest, as it was driven largely by the civil society, she said. Referring to attempts to appropriate and saffronise Thiruvalluvar and rechristen Onam as ‘Vamana Jayanti’, she said Tamils and Keralites fought such attempts fervently. Ms. Kanimozhi also criticised the Centre on the Triple Talaq Bill and the haste it showed in abrogating Article 370 and stopping internet services in Jammu and Kashmir.

Drawing parallels between the Indian Government at present and Nazi Germany, she said “who are the rightful citizens was the question raised then too” and asked everyone to join the protest.

“Silence is not the answer. There are several people who don’t agree with what’s happening but think it’s not their problem. But silence is tantamount to standing with the oppressor,” she said.

Ms. Kanimozhi said the decision of the AIADMK to support the CAA upset her. “How can a Dravidian secular party do that?”

But then, Tamil Nadu had a shadow government at present, with the BJP controlling the State’s affairs, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/orqghs/article30590011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KIKANIMOZHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/women-will-be-worst-hit-by-caa/article30590012.ece
261,2020/01/18,Crime Branch arrests two in Binanipuram gold heist case,"The Crime Branch has arrested two persons in connection with the heist of 20 kg of gold valued at ₹6 crore from Binanipuram in May last year.

The arrested have been identified as Deepak, 48, of Kavalam in Alappuzha, and Ajmal, 36, of Maddakkathanam near Muvattupuzha. They are accused of disposing of around 2 kg of the stolen gold to various jewellers in and around Kottayam. They were arrested over the last couple of days. It is learnt that the accused have identified more persons involved in the case.

The robbery took place on the night of May 9 last year. A car transporting 20 kg of gold to be refined and enhanced in purity came under attack by two motorcycle-bound assailants after it halted for the security guard near the gate at CGR Metalloys Private Limited, Binanipuram.

The accused were produced before the Aluva Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, which remanded them for 14 days.

“We will shortly file a custody application as the accused have to be taken to various places for collection of evidence,” said an official associated with the investigation.

Tracing gold

The Crime Branch is continuing its probe to trace the remaining lot of stolen gold and suspects that more people might have been involved in the heist.

Though the Crime Branch had arrested five persons involved in the heist last year, they had hit a wall in terms of recovery of the gold as the accused misled them. Eventually, the accused managed to secure bail.

CCTV footage

The case, which was initially investigated by a Special Investigation Team drawn from the Rural Police, was transferred to the Crime Branch team led by DySP Jossy Cherian after the former failed to manage any breakthrough. Though SIT had received CCTV footage of the assailants, neither their faces nor the registration number of the motorcycle on which they had fled could be identified.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/crime-branch-arrests-two-in-binanipuram-gold-heist-case/article30590006.ece
262,2020/01/18,Poor internet connectivity affects RTO operations,"Poor internet connectivity in offices under the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) in Ernakulam has slowed down the use of web-based ‘Vahan’ software aimed at automating various operations under the Regional Transport Office.

The offices under the MVD use network connectivity under the Kerala State Wide Area Network (KSWAN). According to senior department officials, the average network speed under KSWAN in majority of offices was under 10 Mbps on most days. “We need at least 100 Mbps speed for an office having at least 10 to 20 computers. The situation turns worse in offices where the staff strength is more than 50,” they said.

MVD officials pointed out that they had to log on to Vahan portal umpteen times daily for a variety of services, including registration and ownership or transfer of all vehicles. It is enabled with e-payments of taxes, fees, and uploading of all scanned documents onto a centralised server.

All the user processes are done via OTPs sent to the registered mobile number of the user.

“On an average, we used to complete 100 temporary registrations on the portal daily. There are hundreds of other purposes for which we need good internet speed. Most of the work gets delayed due to lack of internet speed in most offices,” they said.

With poor internet connectivity slowing down works, a few offices are now planning to enable the fibre optic broadband connectivity offered by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).

“The speed is expected to go up to 40 to 50 Mbps after adding BSNL’s fiber optic broadband. The idea is to use the BSNL broadband along with KSWAN connectivity. At least half of the systems can use BSNL broadband to improve the efficiency of services being offered to the public,” according to a senior official.

Senior MVD officials admitted that they were still getting used to the various applications under the Vahan software.

“Even though we were given training, the processes can be learnt only by trial and error method and by continuously working on the new platform,” they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ew5gkn/article30589991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/poor-internet-connectivity-affects-rto-operations/article30589992.ece
263,2020/01/18,Here lies buried a love story that enriched English literature,"This bustling city of about 5 million people has tiny pockets that are insulated not just from the noise but also time, the South Park Street Cemetery being one of them.

While Muslim women raise angry slogans against the new citizenship law at the nearby Park Circus Maidan, here young lovers and curious students — cut off from the chants of the protesters — stroll 200 years back in time, sometimes admiring the monuments and sometimes seeking privacy in their shadows.

The cemetery could well belong to 18th-century London, but inscriptions on certain tombstones nudge you to the fact that this is Kolkata, because those who lie buried under them are a part of Indian history: Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, Sir William Jones, Col. Robert Kyd, Lt. Col. Colin Mackenzie, Maj. Gen. Charles Stuart and so forth.

Most lovers visiting the cemetery are perhaps oblivious to the love story behind one of the graves — that of Rose Whitworth Aylmer. The story contributed to English literature in more ways than one. Rose was only 17 when, in 1797, she happened to meet poet-writer Walter Savage Landor, then 22, in Wales. Together they would take long walks on the hills. Rose’s family, not very happy with this budding relationship, packed her off to stay with an aunt in Calcutta. She died in 1800, almost immediately after arrival in India, at the age of 20.

Landor went on to write a poem in her memory, Rose Aylmer — one of his best known works — and the lines were subsequently inscribed on the gravestone:

‘Ah, what avails the sceptred race,

Ah, what the form divine!

What, every virtue, every grace!

Rose Aylmer, all were thine.

Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes

May weep but never see

A night of memories and sighs

I consecrate to thee.’

Landor earned critical acclaim but not the public fame he deserved, but he had friends who went on to become household names. One of them was Robert Browning, who was deeply influenced by Landor, and another was Charles Dickens, who named his second son after Landor in honour of their friendship.

And by a strange coincidence, the mortal remains of that son of Dickens — Walter Landor Dickens — today lie buried in the same cemetery. They were shifted here from the Bhawanipore cemetery in 1987.

The cemetery was opened in 1767 and closed in 1790, only to be reopened again and it remained in use until the 1830s. It is run by the Christian Burial Board but its caretaker is a Hindu — Bijay Singh from Odisha, who inherited the job from his father — and people responsible for its upkeep are Muslims.

“Do you have any ghost stories?”

‘Ghosts?’ Mr. Singh laughs. “200 years is a long time for the ghosts to be loitering around. By now those buried here would have been reborn several times.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/nv9p91/article30594183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG0077,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/here-lies-buried-a-love-story-that-enriched-english-literature/article30594184.ece
264,2020/01/18,Fashion for every mood,"For her first collection that will be unveiled on Monday at Ogaan, Banjara Hills, designer Sunaina Khera wanted a little bit of everything so that anyone browsing through that section of the store will get an idea of her design aesthetics. “I picked ensembles from my different collections, to be able to display a wider colour palette and hand embroideries,” says the designer who debuted in the GenNext segment of Lakme Fashion Week last year.

Her spring summer showcase ‘A Long Way from Home’ had garments representing five stages of grief. How does one translate such an idea into fashion? “My ideas begin that way, from a thought or a mood and seems abstract; I need a starting point and it all comes together organically,” says Sunaina.

The line had evening and occasion wear with feminine silhouettes and an understated glamour. “We do a lot of hand embroidery — ari, bead and sequin work,” says Sunaina. Some ensembles had 3D embroidered flowers on sheer fabrics. To go with the theme of the collection, the colours ranged from midnight blues to silver greys and whites.

Sunaina’s winter/festive 2019 collection ‘Dear Mom’ was more vibrant and an ode to the strongest women in her life. She mentions one of her senior most teachers and mentors at the National Institute of Fashion Design, Delhi, Banhi Jha, and says, “She helped me own by design and aesthetics and guided me.”

The Hyderabad showcase will include curated ensembles from both these collections, with a colour palette that has everything from ivory whites and pastel pinks to blue-greys. A few warmer tones were chosen keeping in mind the warmer South Indian winters as well.

The showcase, Sunaina is confident, has something for different age groups. She admits that when she started her label, she thought she would be catering to women like her in the mid 20s. “But I was proven wrong. I realised that women in every age group look for something classic when it comes to occasion wear; so I’ve been happy to have clients of different ages,” she says, signing off.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/rbw289/article30593645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sunaina-Khera---A-Long-Way-Home-31,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/fashion-for-every-mood/article30593648.ece

266,2020/01/18,DCD gears up to tackle misuse of antimicrobial drugs,"Aimed at curbing the misuse of antimicrobial drugs and the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, the Drugs Control Department (DCD) has decided to embark on a series of awareness campaigns among pharmacists and medical shop owners in Kozhikode, Malappuram and Wayanad districts. The first such session will be held for the target group within Kozhikode city corporation limits on January 21.

DCD officials said the overuse or misuse of drugs was often cited as the factor that contributes the most to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Poor compliance with statutory provisions under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 had also led to the misuse of such medicines, they added.

Inappropriate prescription practices, prescription errors and lack of proper treatment guidelines have also been cited as possible reasons aggravating issues in the sector. The DCD believes that better awareness among pharmacists in the area will help surmount the challenge as the World Health Organisation has identified anti-microbial resistance as the biggest threat to public health, food security and development.

K. Sujith Kumar, Assistant Drugs Controller, Kozhikode, said the community pharmacy sector, being a major conduit for the distribution of antimicrobial agents, had a major role to play in deciding the outcome of any activity designed to regulate the use of antimicrobial agents.

267,2020/01/18,Murder accused taken to collect evidence,"The Crime Branch (CB) squad on Saturday took Birju, the accused in the Manassery twin murder case, to two more spots as part of the continuing evidence gathering process. On the second day, he was taken to the premises of Agastianmuzhi bridge from where he allegedly threw the surgical knife used to cut the body of Ismail, the second victim.

Another spot near Manassery where the suspect had allegedly abandoned a severed organ of the victim too was covered by the squad. More such suspected locations, including a village near Thondimel in Karassery panchayat, where the dismembered body was spotted by locals in July 2017 will be covered on Monday based on the confessions of Birju, who was arrested and remanded in police custody on January 16.

The CB squad hinted that some of the other suspected individuals related to the arrested man would be quizzed soon. Birju’s wife would be summoned for interrogation on Monday.

An officer attached to the CB special investigation team said probe was also under way into the suspicious death of Birju’s father. Though it was recorded as a case of suicide a few years ago by the police, the investigation team had reasons to suspect it to be a case of murder, he added.

Birju’s alleged role in strangulating his mother for grabbing her property with the help of Ismail in March 2016 was a shocker to villagers in Manassery. Her death had been recorded as a case of suicide. The murder plot came to light when the CB squad managed to identify the second victim in the case and the reasons which led to his murder June 2017.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/murder-accused-taken-to-collect-evidence/article30596349.ece
268,2020/01/18,A glimmer of hope for revival of Nirdesh,"Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command (SNC), has dropped a few hints about reviving the National Institute for Research and Development in Defence Shipbuilding (Nirdesh) under the Department of Defence Production, Ministry of Defence, functioning at Chaliyam here.

Speaking after releasing the book Calicut Heritage Trails written by Captain Ramesh Babu, former Project Manager, Nirdesh, at the Malabar Palace here on Friday, Admiral Chawla said the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala, situated near Nirdesh, had a close connection with the Indian Navy. “We hope to further strengthen our presence in the city in the years ahead,” he added. Capt. Babu also mentioned the future prospects of Nirdesh.

The fate of ₹600-crore Nirdesh has been hanging in the balance for the last several years. At present, the project is funded by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Hindustan Shipyard, Goa Shipyard and Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers.

Admiral Chawla said the Southern Naval Command and Kozhikode city shared a special relationship. After Independence, an Indian naval training establishment for senior sailors was based here, which was later shifted to Coimbatore. “Two of our major shore establishments - INS Kunjali at Mumbai and the INS Zamorin at Ezhimala - are named after Kunjali Marakkar and the Zamorins of Calicut. Our ships also regularly visit the port of Beypore,” he said.

Stating that the favourite port of call of a long list of seafarers was Kozhikode, he said Capt. Babu’s book recounted interesting tales of several visitors who left an indelible mark on the social and cultural landscape of this area.

Quoting diplomat and historian Sardar K.M. Panikkar, he said, “India never lost her Independence until she lost command of the seas around her in the first decade of the 16th century.”",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ucen70/article30596339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KINIRDESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-glimmer-of-hope-for-revival-of-nirdesh/article30596340.ece

The bishop alleged that the Orthodox group had adopted “inhuman” approach to burials in the name of the Supreme Court judgment of July 2017. There had been instances when burials were delayed on account of the dispute over the control of the churches in the past with the Orthodox group insisting that the last rites would be performed by priests belonging to its group while the Jacobites objected to the stand.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/govt-intervention-justified-jacobites/article30596207.ece

Elayidam, Congress leader Kapil Sibal, journalist Karan Thapar and television personality Anu Menon were some of the major crowd-pullers on the third day of the Kerala Literature Festival here on Saturday.

Ms. Kanimozhi, highlighting the importance of Dravidian culture and the celebration of indigenous local culture “in the days of saffronisation and homogenisation”, declared that the anti-CAA protest was the new Quit India movement. Speaking to journalist Anjana Shankar in the session ‘Envisioning Quit India’, she said that the return of the youth to politics was a good sign.

The session on ‘English as India’s National Language’ saw heated discussions between Urwashi Butalia, Manu S. Pillai, K.R. Meera and Ashutosh Potdar. Ms. Meera declared that she would rather look after her children than that of Queen Victoria, while Dr. Potdar said how nothing could be on par with writing in one’s mother tongue. Mr. Pillai, while agreeing to both, maintained the middle ground that English was necessary in the fast moving society to overcome the language boundaries within the country. Ms. Butalia batted for English as a weapon for Dalits to fight for their rights and needs.

Mr. Thapar, in the session titled ‘Devil’s Advocate’ defined Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “god’s gift to journalism” with him doing a disastrous thing in every three months or so. He noted that the government’s practice of boycotting the journalists and media that criticised it was a reflection of its intolerant attitude. He criticised the “spineless” nature of some of his fellow journalists who support BJP’s interests as “depressing, disillusioning and disturbing”.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/discussions-veer-onto-contemporary-issues/article30595561.ece

272,2020/01/18,Kerala did a disastrous thing by electing Rahul Gandhi: Historian Ramachandra Guha,"A “fifth-generation dynast” Rahul Gandhi has no chance in Indian politics against a “hard-working and self-made” Narendra Modi, and Kerala did a disastrous thing by electing the the Congress leader to Parliament, historian Ramachandra Guha said here on Friday.

Mr. Guha said the reduction of the Congress from a “great party” during the freedom movement to a “pathetic family firm” now is one of the reasons for the ascendency of Hindutva and jingoism in India.

“I have nothing against Rahul Gandhi personally. He is a decent fellow, very well-mannered. But young India does not want a fifth-generation dynast. If you Malayalis make the mistake of re-electing Rahul Gandhi in 2024 too, you are merely handing over an advantage to Narendra Modi,” said Mr. Guha on the second day of the ongoing Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) during his talk, “Patriotism Vs Jingoism“.

Addressing the crowd, he said, “Kerala, you have done many wonderful things for India, but one of the disastrous thing you did was to elect Rahul Gandhi to the parliament.”

Mr. Gandhi, who in 2019 general elections lost from his family bastion of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, had won from the Wayanad seat in Kerala.

“Narendra Modi’s great advantage is that he is not Rahul Gandhi. He is self-made. He has run a state for 15 years, he has an administrative experience, he is incredibly hard working and he never takes holidays in Europe. Believe me I am saying all this in all seriousness,” he said.

But, even if Rahul Gandhi was “much more intelligent, more hard-working, never took a holiday in Europe, as a fifth generation dynast he still will be at a disadvantage against a self-made person”, the 61-year-old author said.

He took on Congress president Sonia Gandhi too who, he said, reminded him of the “late Mughal dynasty” and how aloof they were of the state of their kingdom.

“India is becoming more democratic and less feudal, and the Gandhis just don’t realise this. You (Sonia) are in Delhi, your kingdom is shrinking more and more but still your chamchas (sycophants) are telling you that you are still the badshah,” he said.

Further, he quoted his teacher and noted Indian sociologist Andre Beteille to describe the story of Nehru-Gandhi family as a classic “reversal of the famous Biblical injunction“: the sins of the father will be visited upon seven successive generations.

“In the Nehru’s case, it is the sins of the seven successive generations have been re-visited upon Nehru... look at the national debate today. Why is Nehru evoked everytime? Why does Modi always say Nehru ne kashmir mein yeh kiya, China mein yeh kiya, Triple Talaq mein yeh kiye ... because Rahul Gandhi is there.

“Now if Rahul Gandhi disappears, Modi has to talk about his own policies and why they failed,” he said.

According to Mr. Guha, “Hypocrisy of the Indian Left— the fact that they loved other nations more than India”, “rise of aggressive nationalism worldwide” and “the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in neighbouring countries” are some other reasons behind the evident leap of Hindutva in India in the recent times.

Historian William Dalrymple, novelists like Benyamin, Namita Gokhale, Chetan Bhagat and journalists Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai are among the many other writers who will be attending the four-day festival.

273,2020/01/18,Token stir planned against permitless e-rickshaw services,"Protesting against permitless services conducted by electric autorickshaws (e-rickshaws) in the city, a district-level coordination committee of various autorickshaw drivers’ unions will hold a token strike on January 20.

Over 4,000 autorickshaws will keep off the road, urging the Motor Vehicles Department, police, and local bodies to address their concerns.

Leaders of the coordination committee said drivers running petrol and diesel vehicles would also stage a hunger strike in front of the KSRTC office to highlight the continuing uncertainty in the sector.

“The lack of proper guideline or service regulation has caused confusion in the operation of e-autorickshaws. Now, they are free to operate anywhere in the city, but such a freedom is not granted to a majority of conventional autorickshaw drivers,” said Sajeev Kumar, a leader of the coordination committee.

He added that the rule should be same for all operators. All major trade unions, including the All India trade Union Congress, Indian National trade Union Congress, Hindustan Mazdoor Sangh, and Swatantra Thozhilali Union, have declared their support for the strike call.

Trade union leaders claimed that the lack of a proper city permit system for e-rickshaws was causing huge loss to traditional operators.

They also alleged that the district administration and the MVD authorities were cold-shouldering their demands to implement a separate city service permit system for electric vehicles. According to them, traditional drivers have been campaigning for their demands for a year.

Meanwhile, MVD sources said trade unions were unaware of the Road Safety Authority’s plan to implement a separate numbering system for e-rickshaws to streamline its services. It will come into effect soon, and traditional drivers should cooperate with the process, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/token-stir-planned-against-permitless-e-rickshaw-services/article30590148.ece

275,2020/01/18,Mukkom murder: Crime Branch collects evidence,"Birju, 53, who was arrested by a Crime Branch (CB) squad on Thursday on the charges of murdering his mother and another partner in crime, was brought to his house at Manassery in Mukkom for collecting further evidence in the case on Friday.

CB officials said Birju was suspected of executing both the murders at his house in Manassery. It was in March 2016 that Birju allegedly murdered his mother with the help of his friend P. Ismail for grabbing her property.

Later, Ismail, the partner in the crime, too was allegedly strangulated at the same spot in June 2017. According to CB officials, Birju was annoyed with Ismail’s frequent demand for more money to hide the crime, and that he had decided to kill him.

To destroy evidence and divert inquiry, Birju had allegedly cut the victim’s body into pieces using a surgical blade and dumped them in various locations. It was the inquiry launched to identify the victim that eventually helped the special investigation team zero in on Birju and expose his suspected role in killing his own mother.

The local police had made elaborate security arrangements around the house to prevent all possible manhandling attempts on the suspect. The CB squad was led by Deputy Superintendent of Police M. Binoy. Hundreds of local residents thronged the location to watch the proceedings.

As part of the investigation, Birju’s wife too will be grilled by the CB squad on Saturday.

She was served notice on Friday to appear before the investigation team.

Barghavi, 23, a college student from Nanganallur in Chennai, were going to Tiruchendur to offer special prayers at Lord Subramaniya Swamy Temple even as Ramya’s grandparents were following them in another car.

The police identified the victim as S. Vishwa Ajith, son of Selvakumar of Thondi.

The Forest Department has been running an eco-tourism project at Karankadu where tourists are taken in mechanised boats inside the mangrove forests on a one-hour ride. The site has been attracting many tourists in the past few days as it was Pongal holidays.

Sources in the department said that on Saturday, around 12 persons including seven adults, three kids and two forest department personnel were taking a ride in one of the boats. When the driver swerved the boat to take a turn, the boat swayed due to strong winds. As all the occupants, in a state of panic, shifted to one side of the boat, the boat lost its balance and four of them fell into the shallow water.

According to sources, three of them were rescued immediately, while the small boy drowned.

“The entire stretch of the mangrove patch has only three to five feet depth. All the occupants of the boat were given life jackets. It was a freak accident,” said an official from the forest department.

However, sources said that the life jackets were larger in size for small children and did not serve the purpose in this case. They added that the department should have arranged for jackets for children before taking them onboard the boat.

An official from the temple says that the footfall since Pongal is estimated to be around 30,000 while the average number of visitors is between 12,000 and 15,000.

“Foreign tourists particularly choose to visit Madurai during the harvest festival because they not only get to see the temples but also have visits to villages,” he says.

Tour guide N. Ravichandran says that during pongal time, foreigners get to experience a festival- making it a packaged tour. Apart from the visit to the temple, they also taken to villages to witness the boiling over of the pongal pot over a traditional stove.

“The temple is usually the final touch. Small groups of tourists often come back to the temple after a first visit because they are astounded by the architecture and wish to learn about the place in a detailed manner,” he says.

Apart from foreign tourists, a sizeable number of Sabarimala devotees who have finished their darshan at the temple in Kerala, later visited Courtallam and eventually made their way to Madurai, have also been visiting the temple during this time.

L. Annappal from Kuppam in Chittoor district says that most devotees who visit ‘Makarajyothi darshan' usually complete a short temple trip before returning. “We enter through Coimbatore and eventually end by going to Palani and back to our homes. It becomes like a tour for us,” he said.

282,2020/01/18,Man arrested for murder of his wife,"Rajapalayam

Virudhunagar district police have arrested a casual labourer S. Gunasekaran, 29, of Thenmalai for the murder of his wife Palaniammal, 32, whose disfigured body was found in a secluded place under Keelarajakularaman police station limits on January 7.

The police said that they found a highly decomposed body of the woman in a bushy area in Sankarapandiyapuram near Chatrapatti.

Earlier, the police could not identify the deceased and hence, pasted posters in and around Rajapalayam. A few days later, the family members identified the woman with her jewels and clothes. It was then the police started to look for her husband, who went missing and his mobile phone was switched off.

Gunasekaran and Palaniammal were married for one year and they did not have a child. “Gunasekaran thought that his wife had an infertility problem and started torturing her. He even cut her hair and harassed her under the influence of liquor,” the Inspector of Police, Rajapalayam North, P. Parthiban, said.

He took her to Palladam, where he had already worked. But, even there he started to harass her and she fled back to Thenmalai where her family members were living. Gunasekaran who returned to his village again tortured her and sought more jewels.

On January 2, he had told his wife that they should offer worship at a temple as per a fortune-teller’s advice as a solution to the domestic problems.

He took his wife to a secluded placed and then assaulted her with a sharp weapon. After killing her, he left her body amidst bushes and fled. The family members did not lodge woman missing complaint as they thought that Gunasekaran could have taken her back to Palladam.

Even as the police were on the lookout for him, he surrendered before the village administrative officer and confessed to have murdered his wife, the inspector said. The police arrested him and recovered the blood-stained weapon.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/man-arrested-for-murder-of-his-wife/article30595049.ece
283,2020/01/18,Robotics lab aids in improving creativity,"On Saturday morning, R. Diwakar, a Class 7 student of Thiru. Vi. Ka. Corporation Higher Secondary School here and his group of friends were seen building and operating robotic models. “This model titled ‘City Shaper’ is a futuristic city where a robot will be used to solve problems in a city. For the past one month we have been working on this model to take part in a global-level robotics competition which will be conducted in February,” he says.

Thanks to the initiative of Madurai Corporation and HCL Foundation, six Corporation schools students in the city have access to a robotics lab in their school. This has helped to improve the critical thinking and creativity among the students, say teachers. They also say that it has promoted scientific temperament among students.

The lab has been operational at Thiru Vi Ka Corporation HSS since January 2019. It has been functioning at Elango Corporation HSS, EVR Nagammai Corporation Girls HSS, Velli Veethiyar Corporation Girls HSS, Kasturiba Gandhi Corporation Girls HSS and Ponmudiyar Corporation Girls HSS since October 2019. Experts from American India Foundation (AIF), a non-governmental organisation, train students from Class 6 to 9 every week.

Attending the robotics class has helped in better understanding and application of concepts learnt from textbooks, says R. Angaleshwari, a Class 8 student of Kasturiba Gandhi Girls HSS.

“For instance, when we build a robot, we learn how many times the wheel of the robot has to roll to cover a particular distance. Usually, we memorise a math formula to solve such questions in an examination. But, now we can practically understand the concept behind it,” she says.

During this three-year training programme, the students are taught to program and build their own robotic models.

The students construct their own model and this helps in improving their creativity, says J. Sindhu Bharathi, Economics teacher from EVR Nagammai HSS. “Each student has his or her individuality and that gets reflected in their models.

284,2020/01/18,"We have buried our differences, couple inform HC","Taking cognisance of the fact that a married couple from Nagercoil had buried their differences and were living together, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court closed a divorce application pending before the Additional District Judge, Nagercoil.

It was hearing the appeal filed by the husband, Solomom Banerji from Nagercoil, who challenged the trial court’s order granting ₹ 8,000 towards maintenance to his wife and children. During the course of the hearing, it was informed that the couple had settled their differences amicably and were living together.

Taking note of the submission made by the couple who were present before the court, Justice N. Sathish Kumar said since the matter was settled, the divorce application pending before the lower court could be closed. Additional District Judge, Nagercoil, is required to close the divorce petition as infructuous as the matter had been amicably settled between the parties, the court said.

The court said that as far as the appeal was concerned, the trial court had taken note of the factual scenario then and awarded the maintenance. Since both parties were residing together, the question of executing the order does not arise. However, the court said that if the husband in future neglects to maintain his wife and children, the trial court order can be put in execution and enforceable by the wife.

Members of a scheduled caste community have moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to restrain caste Hindus from constructing a temple on a kanmai at Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district.

The petitioner S. Karuppaiah of Madurai and State general secretary of the Dalit Liberation Movement - Tamil Nadu said that the land in Sengulam in Aruppukottai taluk where the temple was planned to be constructed was classified as kanmai water catchment area and water channel, as per survey numbers.

However, a section of caste Hindus belonging to the village was planning to construct a temple on the land, which would affect the water catchment process. This area was near the residences of the members of the scheduled caste community, he said.

He said that authorities should construct a bridge over the kanmai for the villagers. Otherwise, during the monsoon the villagers would be affected, he said and added that though a representation was already sent in this regard, no step had been initiated.

292,2020/01/18,Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement needed between India and the European Union: Edgars Rinkevics,"India-EU trade cannot increase substantially until the Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) between the European Union and India is negotiated, said Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, expressing the hope that there will be movement on the BTIA when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Brussels in March this year.

“We know that there are many issues with free trade negotiations, but we need to give it a good try, one more time. Only if we have a comprehensive trade deal, there is a chance for improvement of trade figures,” Mr. Rinkevics told The Hindu in an interview, referring to potential for IT companies in Latvia to outsource business to India as well as recruit “skilled and talented” Indian professionals. Mr. Rinkevics discussed the issue in talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi this week.

Mr. Rinkevics is one of the longest-serving EU foreign ministers, and was in office when the EU-India trade negotiations that began in 2007, were suspended in 2013. Since then, despite several attempts by Brussels and New Delhi, the two sides have been unable to agree to revive the talks.

‘Growth has not stopped’

Striking a different note on the BTIA, EU Ambassador to India Ugo Astuto said that despite the hiatus in trade talks, trade between India and the group of 28 European nations has not stopped growing. The EU is India’s largest trading partner with about $108 billion trade in goods in 2018-2019, and $42 billion in services. It is also the largest source of foreign direct investment.

“The EU is in any case India’s biggest trading partner, so without the agreement we are growing trade. The WTO remains the mechanism for dispute resolution. We both believe in a global system with a level playing field, and we hope to continue to talk about the FTA,” Mr. Astuto said at an event on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue.

However, several EU countries are hampered in investing in India without an investment agreement in place, and officials now suggest that will be put in motion when PM Modi attends the India-EU summit in Brussels on March 13, which will be held after a two-year gap.

The date for the next summit, where Mr. Modi will engage with the new European Commission and Council leadership including EC President Ursula Von Der Leyen, was decided when the European Union High Representative Josep Borrell Fontelles met with the PM on Friday, said the officials.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ucepwh/article30598966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/suhasinijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bilateral-trade-and-investment-agreement-needed-between-india-and-the-european-union-edgars-rinkevics/article30595688.ece

295,2020/01/18,Reliance Retail beats slowdown,"Reliance Retail became India’s largest and most profitable retailer amid a general slowdown in 2019, as it became the first in its segment to cross the ₹1-lakh crore mark over a nine-month period.

The company posted a 66% growth in its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) to ₹7,098 crore on a 33% growth in revenue to ₹1,24,725 crore for the nine months ended December, 2019.

December metrics

Reliance Retail reported Ebitda of ₹2,727 crore on revenue of ₹45,327 crore for the December quarter. In comparison, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which owns and operates the D-Mart chain of stores, reported a profit of ₹394 crore on revenue of ₹6,752 crore for the December quarter.

In the first nine months of FY20, the retail arm of the conglomerate surpassed its full year FY19 profit numbers as consumer electronics, fashion & lifestyle and grocery delivered higher growth at 36% year-on-year.

“Strong and broad-based performance across consumer electronics, fashion & lifestyle and grocery led to double-digit growth and margin expansion across consumption baskets.

“Operating leverage and efficiencies contribute to sustained Ebitda margin improvement,” said Gaurav Jain, head of strategy and business development at Reliance Retail told The Hindu.

The company crossed the 11,000-store milestone opening over 1,000 stores in the first nine months of this fiscal; new store openings contributed to balanced growth across segments, according to the company.

Electronics at one-third

Consumer electronics and connectivity accounted for one-third of the growth in revenue while grocery contributed 19%,followed by fashion and lifestyle at 9% and petro retailing at 8%.

297,2020/01/18,"Market is slow, decision cycles are longer, says L&T Technologies","Things are now a bit slow in the marketplace. As a result, business decision cycles are getting longer and this environment is likely to continue as most matured economies around the globe are expecting low GDP growth in 2020, cautions Keshab Panda, MD and CEO at L&T Technology Services Limited (LTTS).

In an exclusive chat with The Hindu, Mr. Panda, however, said, “The reality is that the engineering world has changed rapidly and today it’s all about digital, automated reality and virtual reality.”

And, therefore, it was important for manufacturers and factories globally to keep their operational costs down, increase up-time, ensure better energy utilisation, enhance productivity and push up profitability. “Technology is the only thing that will help them achieve all these at one go,” he said.

Hiring freshers overseas

Mr. Panda said his company had taken a conscious decision to hire freshers from campuses in the U.S., Europe and Israel.

“There are areas where data can’t go out of the customer country, especially in aerospace and defence projects. We will hire local employees for such projects,” he said. LTTS plans to hire over 200 freshers in the quarter ending March. Foreign employees now account for 29% of the company’s total strength of 16,787.

“We are minimising our lateral hiring as we understand youngsters are much better when it comes to newer technologies and they with an open mind and are quick to learn.”

LTTS’ new joinees would be from multiple disciples including instrumentation engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, automotive engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, production engineering and computer science.

In the December 31 ended quarter, LTTS raked in total revenues of ₹1,423 crore and a net profit of ₹206 crore, a 8% and 10% y-o-y growth respectively.

On LTTS’ Q3 performance, he said, “We had strong performance in three segments — transportation, plant engineering, and medical devices that are each growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. Digital and leading-edge technologies — the growth driver for ER&D, contributed to 41% of Q3 revenues and grew by 29%.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/4q8ft6/article30589060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUPANDA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/market-is-slow-decision-cycles-are-longer-says-lt-technologies/article30589061.ece
298,2020/01/18,"One government proposes, the next disposes","Since sweeping to power in Andhra Pradesh last May, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government have cancelled or put on hold a number of high-profile State contracts and projects, many involving foreign partners who now face huge losses. Officials say reviewing commitments made by the previous government will increase accountability and decrease corruption in the State, but outside critics fear that the goal is to refashion deals to benefit new government officials and their supporters. Analysts caution that it will be extremely hard for the State to attract foreign investors in future.

The fallout

Other newly elected State governments (most recently Maharashtra) are also considering cancelling public work commitments made by their predecessors. However, is it prudent to risk alienating current and potential investors? In the case of Andhra Pradesh, potentially at risk is the reputation of what has been considered one of the most business-friendly States in India. Without investments, it will be harder for the State to raise the revenues it needs for social programmes and economic development. Further, if more States follow suit, the dependability of India as a foreign direct investment destination may be negatively affected.

The case of Amaravati

On their face, some of the Jagan government’s actions have merit, most notably in the case of planning for Amaravati, the proposed new State capital city, by Mr. Jagan’s predecessor, N. Chandrababu Naidu and President of the Telugu Desam Party. The project of Mr. Naidu, the then-Chief Minister, was always exceedingly ambitious and never without controversy. As Chief Minister from 1995-2004, Mr. Naidu oversaw the growth of the then-united Andhra Pradesh capital of Hyderabad into a major information technology and pharma centre. But Hyderabad was already a functioning metropolis.

For Amaravati, Mr. Naidu was trying to transform a rural area into a massive, advanced greenfield city. In doing so, he rejected recommendations from a Central government expert committee to expand an existing city in the State, instead choosing a reportedly flood-prone area well away from the nearest significant population centre. Funding was never assured, even with Central government money, private bonds, and loan pledges by the World Bank and Indian government building authorities. There were rumours too of slow decision-making and lack of focus by the then-State government, and disagreements with two prominent architectural firms working on the project. Today, over four years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid Amaravati’s foundation stone, little is there save a number of temporary government office buildings.

The cancellation, by Andhra Pradesh, of a convention and hotel complex in Visakhapatnam awarded to the Lulu Group (United Arab Emirates) at allegedly uncompetitive pricing was even praised by the head of the State’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Nor is Andhra Pradesh the only Indian State to attempt to renegotiate existing power purchase agreements in the light of falling power prices and consumption: Karnataka and Gujarat have done the same.

The new Chief Minister and his government also face external hurdles to attracting investment. As Mr. Jagan himself has noted, the Central government reneged on a previous promise to grant Andhra Pradesh “Special Category Status”, which would have enabled the State to provide tax holidays to new investors. Another issue is the State’s lack of a sizeable metropolitan centre for the foreseeable future, with or without Amaravati. Neighbouring business-friendly Hyderabad has attracted many ambitious Andhra Pradesh residents and foreign investors. These obstacles also made the Naidu government’s schemes to attract investment fall short, with few notable exceptions such as the Sri City manufacturing hub. Many investments announced during the Naidu era, such as a Tesla-created energy grid, failed to materialise.

During my last year in India, I was fortunate to have met Mr. Jagan. I was struck by the seriousness with which he said he planned to create a better future for all people in Andhra Pradesh. However, were I able to advise him today I would suggest that cancelling multiple high-profile public projects may imperil his ability to deliver on his most important goal: to create new jobs and opportunities in the State.

A checklist

First, cancellations risk exposing the State to potentially costly and damaging legal challenges. The relative lack of information about how the reviews are being made, and whether stakeholders have a real voice in the outcome, will likely be a concern to investors.

Second, investors look to the overall commercial environment before deciding whether to commit funds. In addition to project cancellations, the YSRCP government has made other reversals, including challenging the contracts awarded towards the massive national Polavaram dam project, sacking a large number of Naidu-era State bureaucrats, and restricting liquor licences and sales. Investors may regard the number and fast pace of dismantling prior government policies and programmes, no matter how justified, as signals that Andhra Pradesh is changing from an ease of doing business leader to a less transparent, predictable, and open economy. Andhra Pradesh and other States should rather create governing rules and bureaucracies that are more durable than any one leader or administration. Establishing procurement regimes that allow for open tendering, stakeholder engagement, and outside audits would reassure domestic and foreign investors that governments are fair and open to all for business.

Third, any new Indian State government must take into account the Modi government’s encouragement of competitive federalism. Increased numbers of potential Indian business destinations mean that investors can look elsewhere if things in any State get tough. Granted, there is room for improvement in how the Central government encourages more States to liberalise commerce. The government could for example provide fiscal rewards to States that reduce investment barriers, even if the State is not BJP-led.

Newly-elected governments certainly have the right to review potentially unjust or unwarranted deals. However, a State must be careful to provide explicit and clear evidence when making its case to trigger such reviews; it must also make clear which prior projects were reviewed and found to be sound. Recent events in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra — two of India’s largest State economies — have chilled investor enthusiasm just as the Indian economy slows. Indian States and the Central government have a shared interest in reversing this trend.

299,2020/01/18,"Quiet, for now: On trade deal between US and China","The phase one trade deal U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He signed on Wednesday is but a temporary truce that leaves the key issues of the trade dispute unresolved. The pact that Mr. Trump has touted as a step toward creating a fairer and reciprocal partnership still leaves intact nearly three-fourths of punitive tariffs slapped on China since the onset of the trade rift in 2017. Even so, the limited terms the two largest economies agreed upon sets the political stage for further bilateral negotiations and to stem a further deterioration in the global growth scenario. China is to buy $200-billion in goods and services in the coming two years — purchases in 2017, were valued at some $187-billion. The proposed increase in exports is believed to be unprecedented in U.S. trade history and caused speculation on the impact these steep targets could have on China’s other trading partners. Agricultural exports form the smallest proportion of the latest offers relative to manufactured goods and services. This has been an important area of concern for the American farming sector ever since China imposed retaliatory tariffs on soyabean imports from the U.S. But Beijing has promised to open its markets in dairy products, poultry, fish and allied sectors. Whereas China has given assurances to remove barriers for American banking, insurance and other financial services, Washington would be more wary of guarantees on IP protection and alleged forced technology transfers; the last two have been among the more contentious aspects of the trade dispute, as seen in the attacks on Chinese telecom manufacturer Huawei. Separately, Washington has invoked provisions on threats to its national security to punish adversaries, an exceptional measure in the international trading arena. Crucially, the timing of the package enables Mr. Trump to claim some success in narrowing the trade deficit with China ahead of his November re-election bid.

Mr. Trump has said that negotiations on a phase two agreement would begin immediately and even hinted that he could travel to Beijing. However, questions over government control of China’s state-owned firms and industrial subsidies — at the core the bilateral dispute — are not expected to be resolved until after the 2020 U.S. Presidential elections. In parallel is the agreement to revive an erstwhile Obama-era mechanism for economic dialogue that was abandoned under the Trump administration. The step signals hope just as Washington’s decision this week to withdraw the tag of a currency manipulator upon Beijing, accusing it of artificially devaluing the renminbi to gain competitive advantage. The new forum could set the tone to address sensitive issues that have dogged Beijing’s relations with the U.S. and its allies after China joined the WTO.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/quiet-for-now-on-trade-deal-between-us-and-china/article30588863.ece
300,2020/01/18,Fighting radicalisation: On CDS Bipin Rawat's comments,"Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has a curious habit of saying things that raise the hackles of those who are concerned about military propriety and also officers in uniform speaking about civilian matters. Addressing a panel on countering terrorism at the Raisina dialogue organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and Observer Research Foundation at New Delhi, he argued that there has been a significant increase in radicalisation among young people in Kashmir — “girls and boys as young as 10-12”, included. He suggested that youth should be “isolated from radicalisation in a gradual way” and to be “taken out separately and possibly taken into some deradicalisation camps”. He also revealed that such camps existed in the country. There is no doubt that radicalisation must be countered at all levels, whether in Kashmir or elsewhere. But the government should reveal the nature of these camps that the CDS claims are functioning as they raise questions about their legal status and the identity of the youth there. In the last few years, there has been a rise in protests and violence in the Kashmir Valley, besides disaffection that has peaked following the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and its conversion into a Union Territory. This is unlike a decade ago, when terrorism and violence had reduced drastically when compared to the 1990s, and there was a spurt in participation in democratic processes, besides a gradual diminishing of the Valley’s radical voice. Today, however, with political representatives, this includes those from among the mainstream polity, either facing curbs or under detention, the ground has become fertile for the revival of radicalism, which has been expressed either as a shrill form of separatism or invoked as extremist Islamist ideology.

However, while deradicalisation is certainly an imperative, Gen. Rawat’s solution is way off the mark. Segregation of youth and individuals from family and community — many could be juveniles — is a recipe for further alienation and public revulsion and also plainly illegal. It is not the job of the Army or security forces to undertake what is a mandate for the agencies of the civilian State. Deradicalisation is best achieved through effective teaching and incorporation of civic studies in the school curriculum for children who are getting radicalised due to the prevailing circumstances in the Valley. Besides this, there has to be an administrative outreach to the citizenry not to give in to radical demands and the rhetoric of extremists. More importantly, the reversal of repressive conditions such as limited Net access and the detention of political representatives is a must. Winning Kashmiri hearts and minds is a long battle; short-sighted and illiberal measures from an authoritarian playbook could prove counter-productive.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fighting-radicalisation-on-cds-bipin-rawats-comments/article30588862.ece
301,2020/01/18,Karnataka HC relief for principal in student death case,"The High Court of Karnataka has quashed the criminal proceedings initiated against the principal of a city school on the charge of abetting a class 10 student’s suicide by way of extreme warning for allegedly damaging a computer while trying to repair it.

Justice B.A. Patil passed the order while allowing a petition by Parveen Taj, who was working as principal of St. Paul’s English High School, Yeshwantpur, at the time of the incident.

The boy was found dead at his house on July 26, 2015, and his father lodged a complaint with the police alleging that extreme warning given by the principal had forced his son to end his life. The police subsequently filed a charge-sheet against Mr. Taj.

It was alleged that the boy had damaged the computer while trying to fix a problem with its speaker unit on the instruction of the principal. According to the charge-sheet, the principal told the boy to reimburse ₹40,000 towards damaged the computer and to bring his parents to the school. It was alleged that this action abetted the boy’s suicide.

However, the court held that there was no prima facie case made out against the petitioner. It also observed that there was no instigation or intent on the part of the principal to force the boy to end his life.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/karnataka-hc-relief-for-principal-in-student-death-case/article30595945.ece
302,2020/01/18,Good response to walking tour of NIMHANS,"The Department of Mental Health Education of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) conducted the first ‘Stories against Stigma: Walking tour of NIMHANS’ of this year for the public on Saturday.

The objective was to remove the stigma associated with mental health institutions and the idea that they are dark, dingy places where patients, often violent, are locked in dark rooms and administered shock treatment and more.

K.S. Meena, additional professor in the department, said the initiative had received an overwhelming response from the public in the last two years. “Following the overwhelming response, we now plan to conduct the tour once in three months,” she said.

The three-hour tour covered the history of NIMHANS along with a visit to 15 departments with a faculty from each department briefing the 26 visitors from various backgrounds about their work.

The participants got an opportunity to visit the NIMHANS Heritage Museum, Psychiatry Department and Wards, Yoga Centre, Neuro-imaging Lab, Psychiatric Emergency Unit, Behavioural Medicine Unit, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit and Family Therapy Unit. They were also shown a video demonstrating the procedure of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), commonly known as shock treatment, to clear misconceptions.

The tour included a visit to the ROSes (Recovery Oriented Services) cafe, which is run exclusively by persons recovering from mental illness, at NIMHANS.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a7eqb/article30595746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGNIMHANSWALKINGTOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/good-response-to-walking-tour-of-nimhans/article30595747.ece
303,2020/01/18,‘No reason why governments can’t fund antibiotics development’,"There is no reason why governments, non-profit organisations and international organisations cannot fund the development of antibiotics, said biologist and Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan on Saturday.

Part of the problem is that new-generation antibiotics are expensive because of the huge investment on clinical trials; the pool of patients is small; and it will not be a lifelong drug — “the ideal patient for a pharmaceutical company is a diabetic with high blood pressure and cholesterol and possibly with impotence as well,” Dr. Ramakrishnan said, in answer to a question from the audience after his lecture ‘My Adventures in the Ribosome’ as part of the TNQ Distinguished Lectures in the Life Sciences.

Dr. Ramakrishnan said the business model for developing new antibiotics is flawed. A company, founded by the late American biochemist and Nobel laureate Thomas Steitz and chemist Peter Moore, produced several inhibitors that seemed promising. “But to go from an inhibitor to a drug is a very long and expensive process."" They decided to launch an IPO, but when they tried to go public, they couldn't command a share price that would allow the investors to even get back what they put in, so the IPO was withdrawn.

Ironically, the same month, “a company whose main product was the ability to share gossip and fake news very easily was worth many 100 billion dollars,” said Dr. Ramakrishnan, adding “I don’t have a Facebook account.”

In his lecture, he spoke of his journey unravelling the complex structure of the ribosome — “the mother of all molecules made in every cell” as he once described it, which synthesises all the thousands of types of proteins in every cell. The breakthrough took place when he created a pure preparation of the ribosome, which could make crystals that could be studied at very high resolutions.

Dr. Ramakrishnan spoke of the need for job opportunities in biotechnology. “If you look at most countries, they spend three to four times of what India spends on research and development. India’s contribution is about 0.7%. And of the 0.7%, only 25% is by private R&D.” The OECD average, he said, is 2.4%, of which more than two-thirds — the majority — is private R&D.

“What this does is that it allows large industrial job opportunities — most people cannot be faculty members; there aren’t enough faculty jobs. And so they have to have industrial jobs to absorb them in a meaningful way.”

Bengaluru, he said, is one of the exceptions where there is a large biotech sector. “But you probably need a dozen of these.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/il36nt/article30595660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGAUDIENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-reason-why-governments-cant-fund-antibiotics-development/article30595663.ece

306,2020/01/18,FIR against caterers of Indira Canteens,"A cheating case has been registered against the two companies catering to the Indira Canteens of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

The Halasuru Gate police on Friday registered a cheating case against Cheftalk Food & Hospitality Services Pvt. Ltd., situated in Bommanahalli, and Rural Environment & Water Assets Reproductive & Development Society (REWARDS) situated in J.C. Nagar.

Based on the complaint filed by S. Venkatesh, Joint Commissioner (Finance), BBMP, the police booked the two firms for allegedly duping the government through over-billing to draw more subsidies for supplying food to Indira Canteens in the city.

Venkatesh, in his complaint, said that the government had set up 191 canteens – 173 stationary and 18 mobile canteens – for the 198 wards across the city.

The two companies, which bagged the contract, allegedly supplied substandard food and over-billed and cheated the exchequer of crores of rupees.

The police have summoned representatives of both companies for questioning and also sought detailed records from the BBMP.

In August, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had ordered a probe into alleged irregularities. The BBMP had also taken up an internal audit of Indira Canteens and kitchens. A senior BBMP official said that the internal audit is in progress.

“Once we get the report, we will have a clear picture of what has happened. The police complaint has been filed based on a complaint submitted by a councillor to the CM,” he said.

Ever since the Indira Canteens were opened, there have been allegations of over-billing and inflation of the number of meals being sold.

Complaints have been filed against the BBMP with regard to the allegations with the Lokayukta, Anti Corruption Bureau, and Bengaluru Metropolitan Task Force.

A representative of REWARDS claimed that the company was not aware of the complaint.

312,2020/01/18,Rohith Vemula remembered on death anniversary,"Over 100 students from multiple colleges gathered at Freedom Park on Friday evening to launch a 48-hour satyagraha against violence on students across universities and against CAA.

This was among several events that were organised to mark the fourth death anniversary of Rohith Vemula, a PhD student who committed suicide in 2016 allegedly after facing caste discrimination at the University of Hyderabad.

However, as the police had denied permission for the satyagraha, they locked out students to prevent more of them from gathering at the spot. They were let in around 8.30 p.m.

Tension ensued as police asked the students to vacate, but the students refused. One of the organisers alleged that police called up principals of various colleges asking them to identify students at the protest and take them back.

Students decided to take back their protest around 9.30 p.m. and dispersed. Slogans against CAA, NRC, NPR and ‘Amit Shah go back’ rung the air. Mr. Shah is scheduled to visit Karnataka on Saturday.

With student organisations mobilising large numbers for the CAA protests in the city, a few student unions in alliance with 'We the people of India', a social activist group, organised a meeting in remembrance of the Ph.D scholar. The group has named his death anniversary as National Students Resistance Day.

The day started off with a protest at Mysuru Bank Circle organised by the DSS. Later, a meeting at St. Joseph's College began with students mourning the death of Vemula and mooting various contemporary issues in the education system, casteism and CAA.

Several activists as well as faculty members spoke about the importance of student activism. One of them said, ""We have not done enough to take Rohith's dream forward. In that direction, we all should work together, especially in today's circumstances. Education should be made available to everybody, irrespective of caste and religion.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/epqrtf/article30591145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGROHITVEMULAREMEMBRANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rohith-vemula-remembered-on-death-anniversary/article30591146.ece

314,2020/01/18,"No toilets, drinking water facility at this terminus","The bus terminus at the Besant Nagar First Avenue is kept spic and span. But, it is the easily the most neglected one across the city. The spacious terminus lacks toilets. With no toilets available, commuters relieve themselves wherever possible.

The walls of Besant Nagar Community Hall at the intersection of Besant Nagar First and Second Avenue has become a public urination compound wall, a commuter, and a long-time resident of Besant Nagar, said.

Toilets aside, the sprawling bus terminus has no provision for drinking water, he pointed out.

Besides, the commuters have to be careful when they alight from or wait to board a route number bus. Of late, the terminus (Private Area) has become a thoroughfare for the cyclists, who traverse at a good speed.

On Monday afternoon, a school boy riding a geared cycle at a high speed hit a youngster. In the impact, the school boy fell from the cycle. Luckily, the cyclist nor the youngster wasn’t injured.

The crew of the route numbers and the staff remained a mute spectator. In a few minutes time, a host of cyclists were seen negotiating through the terminus.

Besides, the commuters have requested the MTC to increase the frequency of the existing route numbers.

At present, 29C, 23C, 5E, and 47 plies from the terminus to Perambur, Ayanavaram, Vadapalani and Villivakkam.

“ The frequency of route numbers 23C and 29C should be increased. Recently, I waited for nearly half-an-hour at Adyar Depot to board 23C (Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur) to go to Purasawalkam. I boarded 29C and walked from Kilpauk Medical College to Gangadeeswarar Koil Street, Purasawalkam. The frequency of the route number 29C used to be very regular. Now, it has reduced drastically,” L. Venkatesh, a commuter, and a resident of Besant Nagar, said.

S.Venugopalan, a resident of Vannandurai, says, “ Over the years, route numbers to Chennai Central such as 4G and 4C, and Tollgate 6A has been discontinued.

“ Many people from Besant Nagar go to North Chennai on work. I have written many letters to MTC to introduce buses to areas in north Chennai.”

E. Lakshmanan, a senior-citizen, says, “ The services of the route numbers 23C, 47 and 29C should be increased. To add to the woes of the commuters, the routes of route numbers 47A, 23C, and 29C, which was plying from the Besant Nagar bus terminus has been extended till Thiruvanmiyur bus terminus. At times, the commuters have to go to Adyar Depot bus stop and board these route numbers. Besides, steps should be taken to re-introduce 6A, and 23A plying from and through Besant Nagar bus terminus.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/no-toilets-drinking-water-facility-at-this-terminus/article30594462.ece
315,2020/01/18,Where is the space to walk?,"On Shastri Nagar First Main Road, Adyar, the pavements are as good as non-existent. The pavements are used by everyone and for everything except by the pedestrians. Starting near Shastri Nagar First Avenue, till Mahatma Gandhi Road, Shastri Nagar, the pavements are inaccessible. The walkers path is used by traders, welders, waste paper dealers and two- and four-wheeler mechanics to run their business.

To add to the woes of the road users, haphazard parking of vehicles on the stretch has reduced the width of the carriageway and has pushed the pedestrians to walk on the middle of the road, who face the risk of being knocked by the speeding motorists.

For years, complaints to the authorities concerned in the Chennai Corporation and to the traffic police in this regard have only fallen on deaf ears. The authorities concerned are blind and deaf to the woes faced by us, residents said.

T. D. Babu, a long-time resident of Shastri Nagar, says, "" Years ago, the stretch was a bus route with pavements on either side. After bus services were stopped, the pavements were encroached rapidly between First Avenue and Third Cross Street intersections.

The commercial establishments have faciltiated additional entrances facing First Main Road apart from the main entrance along the interior lanes in the residential locality.""

Between Third Cross Street till the intersection of Mahatma Gandhi Road, commercial establishments and an under construction residential apartment have encroached the footpath and have built a high-rise ramp till the carriageway.

The stretch is used by a good number of students studying in schools in and around Shastri Nagar.

On the stretch, at frequent intervals, many accidents have taken place. Hope the authorities concerned take action at the earliest to alleviate the woes faced by the pedestrians and the motorists before any major accident occurs, residents said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/where-is-the-space-to-walk/article30594382.ece
316,2020/01/18,Plea to re-locate the dump yard,"The residents of T. Nagar, have made a request to the Greater Chennai Corporation to re-locate a trash

disposal point, located on Guild Street, T. Nagar. Residents say the disposal point is nothing short of a trash

yard. Though, steps are taken to clear the garbage every day, either in the night or early in the morning, the

conservancy staff collect and dispose the trash from residential apartments and homes and other commercial

establishments in the vicinity for the conservancy truck staff to clear the garbage.

On days, the garbage is spilled on to the roads affecting free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. To add to

the woes of the pedestrians, especially women, men relieve themselves in the open. Of late, the space near

the trash yard has become a parking slot.

“In the mornings and evenings, countless number of pedestrians walk through the stretch to reach the railway

terminal and a couple of educational institutions. Stray dogs roam in large numbers on the stretch, creating a

fear in the minds of the pedestrians. We have complained several times in this regard to the authorities

concerned in the GCC to re-locate the dumping point. But, no action, has been taken till date. We are being

asked by the authorities concerned to re-locate a trash disposal point,"" residents say.

Besides, while clearing the trash from the disposal point, the walls of a prestigious educational institution

located on the stretch have been damaged by the conservancy vehicle for fifth time in a row. A similar

situation prevails on Police Quarters Road.

Despite, a washroom near the T. Nagar bus terminus, men relive in the open on the stretch, making it horrible to commute through the stretch to gain access to bus terminus, residents, add.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-re-locate-the-dump-yard/article30594296.ece

Starting near the intersection of Medavakkam Main Road and Radial Road, either side of the road resembles a parking lot.

“Sometimes, water tankers are parked along the roadside, blocking the walkable space completely. Pedestrians are pushed to walk on the carriageway and since the stretch lacks lamp posts, walking is quite the risky affair after dusk,” says J. Nandhini, a resident.

Residents of Tranquil Acres, an apartment complex in Periya Kovilambakkam, say they are unable to turn left from their street to enter Radial Road because of the stationary vehicles at the intersection.

They have also requested the Traffic Department to facilitate a signal at the intersection of Pallavaram – Thoraipakkam 200 Feet Radial Road and Tranquil Acres Road.

“The chaos is mainly due to the delay in the construction of a flyover at the intersection of Medavakkam Main Road and Pallavaram – Thoraipakkam 200 Feet Radial Road and lack of effective traffic management. A few motorists jump signals at the intersection, putting themselves and other motorists at risk,” S.

Commuters complain that visitors to commercial establishments near the bus stop park their bikes here, forcing them to wait on the carriageway.

Says T.M. Raj, president, Lakshmipuram Extension Welfare Association (LEWA), “We sent many petitions to the officials of Tambaram Municipality requesting the relocation of the bus stop, but no action has been taken yet. Women passengers often wait at the intersection of Mudichur Road and Lakshmipuram Extension First Main Road to board buses.”

Commuter A. Gayathri says, “The bus stop has become a two-wheeler parking lot. Adding to our woes, auto drivers often park near the bus stop. Even crossing the road is a difficult task, as the flow of vehicles is continuous on the stretch.”

Raj says that the Municipality should consider establishing a bus stop at the intersection of Mudichur Road and Mullai Nagar Main Road. “Pedestrians will benefit if the authorities also install a traffic signal and a pedestrian crossing here,” he adds.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lakshmipuram-bus-stop-in-west-tambaram-turns-parking-lot/article30594116.ece

The service lanes are riddled with potholes and the condition of the road worsens during rain and turns slushy and slippery.

Says G. Thangaraj, a resident of Otteri, “Motorcyclists are the worst affected and they face the risk of losing balance and falling off the vehicles. To make it worse, motorists often indulge in rash and reckless driving.”

The situation is the same on Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road and near its intersection with GST Road. The bad condition of the road often stalls traffic.

“Despite the poor condition of the road, the officials concerned have not even carried out patchwork. The stretch is prone to accidents. The State Highways should relay the road on war-footing as the stretch witnesses heavy flow of traffic,” says another resident.

Stray pigs are flocking the neighbourhood to feed on the trash dumped in the open by residents who do not practice proper waste management.

Tambaram Municipality took away fout bins from the neighbourhood, in an effort to make it a binless street.

“The Municipality did not notify the residents before removing the bins. Though the conservancy staff collect the garbage from residences and clean the street every day, some residents continue to dump the garbage in the open, which is attracting the pigs. The Municipality should conduct an awareness campaign and penalise those who litter,” says N. Ashok, a resident.

Association president M. Anbalagan and additional general secretary Ramanujan C. have been going from one street to another distributing pamphlets on waste segregation and disposal.

Says M. Anbalagan, “We are urging the residents to segregate the trash before handing it over to the conservancy staff and not dump them on the streets if the workers don’t turn up or come late. We have suggested that the residents can instead leave the bins on the premises for the workers to pick up.”

The Association, after obtaining permission from Greater Chennai Police, have put up information boards on Sadasivam Nagar Third Cross Nagar warning against unauthorised parking.

“Tipplers visiting a liquor outlet on Madipakkam Road often park their motorcycles on the streets and pavements, blocking pedestrians path. Some tipplers often pass out outside the gates of residences, causing inconvenience to the residents,” claims Ramanujam.

The sewage lines on the stretch from T.T.K. Road till the intersection of Bawa Road and Ananda Road were damaged a few years ago and have remained in that condition, contaminating the groundwater in the neighbourhood.

“Our open wells and borewells have been contaminated with sewage water from the broken pipelines. We cannot clean the wells until the pipes are replaced. We sent multiple representations to officials of CMWSSB and also took up the issue at public grievance redressal and open house meetings. Every time, the officials assure us of corrective action, but nothing happens after that,” says Rajan E. Murali, a resident of Alwarpet.

He adds that the residents are dependent on water cans.

As a temporary arrangement, CMWSSB staff carry out patchwork to arrest seepage of sewage from the pipelines. “However, the residents need a permanent solution,” he says.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-want-sewage-pipes-replaced-at-bheemanna-garden-street/article30593948.ece
323,2020/01/18,‘MTC should increase frequency of route numbers 6D and 2A’,"Commuters using the services of two bus services in the city — 6D (Tollgate-Thiruvanmiyur) and 2A (kondungaiyur-Anna Square) — want the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to increase the frequency of the buses.

Commuters say that there is a considerable time lag in services and they are forced to wait for long at the bus stops.

Says T. Shantha, a commuter from Besant Nagar, “The wait time can go up to 30 minutes on most days. The only other option we have is to board a connecting service. Last week, even after waiting for more than 20 minutes at the All India Radio bus stop, there was no sign of the bus. So, I boarded route number 109 to Adyar bus depot and took another bus to Besant Nagar.”

On Tuesday evening, passengers waiting at Chepauk complained that they had been waiting for nearly an hour. “MTC has cut down the services which has left commuters in the lurch,” says a passenger.

The situation is not any different at Anna Square bus terminus, especially for those dependent on the services of route number 2A. They claim that the frequency of this service is almost nil during the evening rush hour, forcing them to rely on other modes of transport such as trains and share autos.

“We board trains from Chennai Central suburban terminal to Vysarpadi Jeeva and Korukkupet and take share autos to reach Kodungaiyur. The other option is to go to High Court terminus and board route number 116, which plies between Kaviarasu Kannadhasan Nagar and High Court. if the frequency of 2A is increased during the rush hour, we need not have to take detours like these,” says B. Pandian, a commuter.

He says that multiple representations to MTC officials on the issue have evoked no response.

New services sought

Meanwhile, residents of New Washermenpet and Royapuram, have urged MTC to introduce bus sevices between Thiruvottiyur and Ennore via Cemetery Road, Royapuram, and New Washermenpet, from High Court bus terminus. At present, only 6D plies between Toll Gate and Thiruvanmiyur.

“Sometimes, it is very difficult to board the bus as it gets very crowded at Government Raja Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar (RSRM) Lying-in Hospital at Royapuram. So, some commuters walk till Bharath Theatre Bus Stop near the intersection of Thiruvottiyur High Road and Cemetery Road and Washermanpet bus stops. At times, route number 32A plying between Foreshore Estate and Toll Gate bus terminus does not halt at Bharath Theatre bus stop,” says a commuter.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mtc-should-increase-frequency-of-route-numbers-6d-and-2a/article30593928.ece
324,2020/01/18,Corporates drive a safety message,"On Rajiv Gandhi Salai, you are likely to encounter volunteers swooping down on a traffic intersection and exhort motorcyclists to wear a helmet, and pedestrians to use the foot-overbridge. They are employees of organisations on the IT Corridor who have signed up with the Chennai Road Safety Council, which is working to improve road safety through volunteering.

The Council was launched last year following a corporate round-table conducted by iVolunteer. One of the main aims of the initiative is to encourage companies to take ownership of a traffic junction or a stretch near them. The companies that sign up for the programme will be expected to effect a change in the attitude of motorists and pedestrians.

Towards this end, member-companies would conduct sensitisation programmes for their associates with the support of NGOs working in the field of road safety. These employees are also encouraged to volunteer on the road at least once.

“We have eight corporates and four NGOs on board and we want more companies to join us,” says Gazal Raina, CSR Lead, Ford Motors.

Though Rajiv Gandhi Salai is the main focus area as it has many companies, the Council will be looking to extend the programme to many other areas of Chennai.

Under the traffic awareness programme, one can see employee-volunteers from each of these organisations visiting important junctions, some on fixed days of the week.

Cognizant employees, for instance, conduct their awareness drive every Thursday at multiple junctions on OMR. Donning reflector jackets and blue caps, Ford volunteers descend on the Sholinganalur junction every Friday between 9 a.m. and 10.30 a.m.

Similarly, Navis India Technologies employees can be spotted at the Tidel Park signal. Tech Mahindra, PayPal, L&T, Royal Enfield, TVS Sundaram Fasteners and Groupon are other partners in the Council.

These trained volunteers politely advise motorists who are seen breaking traffic rules — such as those waiting on the zebra line and driving on the footpath and those engaging in motoring behaviour that can easily lead to accidents.

They do not perform the role of traffic police personnel.

“We seek to present the Munna Bhai style of positive reinforcement and avoid reprimanding them,” says Gazal, adding that the initiative has received good feedback. When people abide by the rules of the road, traffic chaos is regulated to some extent.

Many of the volunteers themselves saw a need to change certain behaviours. A lot of other initiatives, she says, have come up at Ford.

Associates are getting trained in batches by Alert on how to offer first-aid care during an accident.

“We don’t have a fixed team of people volunteering on the road. In fact, we encourage teams to go with their managers,” she says.

The forum also meets once a month to brainstorm about collaborative campaigns. Aarti Madhusudan, consultant, iVolunteer, says share autorickshaw drivers are also an important stakeholder in ensuring safety.

“Why not have a biryani party with them and see how they can play a role?” she asks.

325,2020/01/18,‘Make Fifth Street in Padmanabha Nagar one-way’,"Residents of Padmanabha Nagar in Adyar have requested the Greater Chennai Traffic Police to make the stretch Fifth Street one-way lane for vehicular traffic.

The stretch witnesses continuous flow of vehicular traffic through the day, said H. Vembu, secretary, Shri Padmanabha Nagar Residents’ Association, said. It is a common sight to see motorists indulging in rash driving and jumping lanes much to the dismay of their counterparts coming in the opposite direction and pedestrians.

Motorists from Thiruvanmiyur and other areas negotiate through the stretch to go to R. A. Puram, Mylapore and other areas.

The stretch facilitates quick connectivity to Sardar Patel Road and Durgabhai Deshmukh Road. There are more than five signals on Lattice Bridge Road, starting near Jayanthi Theatre. To avoid taking the intersections on Lattice Bridge Road, motorists drive and ride through the stretch, say residents.

There is no space for pedestrians to walk. The walkers space on the stretch is being used to park vehicles. Minor collisions occurs on this stretch due to over-speeding and wrong-side driving, they say. Steps should be taken at the earliest to make the stretch an one-way and deploy traffic police personnel during rush hours, residents added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/make-fifth-street-in-padmanabha-nagar-one-way/article30593893.ece
326,2020/01/18,"Chennai residents, here is a steep but exciting target for the 2020s","This may be counter-intuitive, but when a lot has to be done in a short time, a spot of “creative pausing” to take in the overall picture would be absolutely necessary. Because, hurrying into something purely on the basis of motivational rhetoric can pose the additional problem of having to undo the effects of an erroneous approach, which would further shrink the paltry time.

This thinking should be applied to tree-planting drives, most of which are usually solely numbers-focussed and rhetoric-driven. A greening initiative would be laudable if a focus on numbers is combined with the wisdom of marrying trees to their rightful space.

In this context, it is worth revisiting a tree-planting study that was conducted two years ago, and whose final recommendations were submitted to the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) in the first quarter of 2019. There is a scientific back-story to this exercise, which also had the right motivation points to drive residents’ welfare associations to action.

Here is its grand theme — two lakh trees to be planted every year, for five years with the net result that Chennai would have one million additional trees from that sustained exercise. The study came up with lists of tree species to address various topographical and geographical features. There were lists for coastal sections, arterial and sub-arterial roads, waterbodies and wetlands, parks and institutions and so on.

S. Balaji, retired Principal Chief Conservator of Forests at Government of Tamil Nadu, and now advisor to Care Earth Trust, who led this study, presents the background to it.

“The study was instituted by the Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL) on behalf of GCC. The detailed report was prepared by the Care Earth Trust with the support of INMASS and Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT), and submitted in March 2019.”

Balaji says that when the study had cystalised into a noticeable form, and collected all the necessary data points about all parts of Chennai and their specific greening requirements, a public consultation was organised (in February 2018), inviting residents’ welfare associations from across the 15 zones. The response is said to have been heartening.

“Besides the tree-planting exercises by the Corporation, there is a need for involvement of residents’ associations in greening activities,” says Balaji, suggesting that “One million trees in five years” is essentially a people’s target.

Altogether, 91 native tree species were identified as suitable for various parts of Chennai with their unique soil and topographical conditions.

With Chennai being largely defined by its coastal component, great thought has to be given to what trees thrive best in the coastal environment. In that context, thespesia populnea and terminalia catappa are among the trees that make the cut on account of their high level of salt-tolerance.

The recommendations for coastal areas, as also for the others, including waterbodies and wetlands in interior regions, the choice of native trees from a shortlisted group was also dictated by practical considerations such as space and the aesthetics of the area in question.

The study also looked at the existing greenery, defined by both native and exotic species.

On the question of exotic trees lining avenues, “We can’t entirely wish away these exotic trees.”

Pointing out that a good number of existing trees in Chennai are exotic — one of them is the ubiquitous raintree — he adds that while the goal should be promoting native trees, the city’s green exercises should also factor in making the best use of what already exists.

He drives home the point by referring to a situation along the Marina. “The few native thespesia populena trees found at the beach have, as expected, withstood the sustained spray of salt-laden air. And then you have a row of kigelia pinnata trees — an exotic species — which have also done well in these conditions. They are around for over 30 years, and they provide a lot of shade, at a section of the Marina where it is much needed,” says Balaji.

A stand of kigelia pinnata trees with their widely-spread branches are found near the main and much-visited section of the Marina.

Harini Nagendra, professor of sustainability at Azim Premji University, who has authored “Cities and Canopies: Trees in Indian Cities” along with Seema Mundoli, is on the same page about achieving city-greening goals by integrating existing exotic trees into the strategy.

“In Bengaluru, raintrees and copperpods are found in significant numbers, and they give a lot of shade, and the local butterflies and insects have adapted to these trees. They promote bio-diversity considerably,” says Harini.

On the question of putting tree species with high salt tolerance to best use, Harini states that they would be best utilised if they were planted in estuarine environments such as the one provided by the Adyar estuary.

Balaji says residents’ groups can get the lists of tree species, from the Greater Chennai Corporation.

327,2020/01/18,Three for the coast,"Between Kelambakkam and Kovalam lies a four-kilometre road, curled up like a bloated boa constrictor. For most motorists, this winding road signifies just an exciting drive either to ECR or OMR, two arterial roads that it connects.

For nature lovers, it provides a striking view of the backwaters, which during winter, would attract birds and birders.

So, if you have missed a stately Portia tree (poovarasan in Tamil) on the way, you are part of the majority. Most passers-by miss it. It forms a natural facade for a heritage building, striking with its tiled and saddle-back roof. Yet, it is likely to be ignored.

However, if you pause to read its back-story, you will marvel at its location.

The Portia tree has a natural connection with salt: It has salt high-tolerance, which means it can withstand soil salinity. Not too long ago, this section was known for its salt pans. Similarly, it has a built-in “bulwark” against the salinity that comes wafting in the air from the sea.

This tree seems to be an apt symbol for the kind of thinking that should go into tree-planting — matching trees with conditions that are best suited for them, or conditions that they will prove equal to.

There should be more such trees along the coast.

Fortunately, efforts seem to be under way to have salt-resistant trees planted on East Coast Road.

The Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC) has planted thespesia populena, tabebuia rosea and millingtonia hortensis saplings on certain sections of East Coast Road.

“Over 600 thespesia populnea trees have been planted starting from Vadanemili; 1,200 tabebuia rosea trees have been planted from the Tamil Nadu tourism hotel to the Mahabalipuram bus stand; 500 millingtonia hortensis trees have also been planted from Kovalam to Vadanemili,” says V. Ramkumar, senior manager, landscaping, TNRDC.

Shobha Menon, founder-trustee, Nizhal, says that thespesia populnea do well in a variety of conditions, and this conviction springs from the fact that she saw thespesia trees hold out well in water-logged conditions.

She further explains, “Nizhal volunteers are engaged in a work to green MRTS stations. Thespesia trees have withstood heavy water-logging conditions at the planting sites along the Taramani, Perungudi and Velachery MRTS stations.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/op769b/article30593857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DC19CentreSpreadPoovarasanBloomKelambakkamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/three-for-the-coast/article30593859.ece
328,2020/01/18,A battle against accidents,"A road accident took their daughter’s life; parents now fight to make roads safe for others

Potholes are fixed at a colony in Bengaluru by volunteers of Arundhati Foundation

In Bengaluru, there is only a slim chance of crater-like potholes being spotted in and around Cambridge Layout. Depression on the road surface that is likely to cause accidents are fixed by the Tambwekars, who live in the area, either by registering a complaint with the civic body’s helpline number or on their own. Or sometimes with the help of a few professionals summoned by them.

Dangerous road conditions can cause accidents and the Tambwekars don’t want another fatality on the road.

In 2014, the couple — Dr. Shubhangi Sanjay Tambwekar and Sanjay Achyut Tambwekar — lost their daughter, Arundhati, in a gruesome road accident in Vellore. Later, they started The Arundhati Foundation in her memory through which they are fighting for safer roads and responsible driving.

Under the project ‘Vikram’, the non-profit organisation takes up road safety, with focus on accident prevention and creating awareness of bad road conditions. “When we have to fill potholes in a road, we try to involve the citizens in the area,” says Shubhangi.

Safety Ambassador Programme is another initiative where they go to schools to drive the message on road safety through events like painting and experimental lessons. Recently, children at a school were taught how to use the fire extinguisher to put out a fire. “We are open to more schools approaching us,” says Shubhangi.

The Foundation also works towards influencing policies and towards this, they have teamed up with ‘Save Life Foundation’..

A changemaker’s plea

Concerned by the number of fatal accidents happening on Yamuna Expressway — a 165-km road that connects Delhi to Agra — Rinki Sharma decided the least she could do was push the authorities to take preventive steps.

As per a report in The Hindu, the Expressway witnessed over 150 deaths in road accidents in 2019, the maximum ever since it got operational in 2012.

“I travel on this six-lane often and have witnessed many accidents,” says Rinki who is head of projects and CSR at Consumer VOICE.

Through an online petition on Change.org she has been appealing to the officials to take immediate steps to prevent fatalities in the future. The petition says that there is only a barbed wire separating the two sides of the Expressway. The Central Road Research institute has recommended that crash barrier be installed to prevent accidents, which must be done at the earliest, reads the petition. “I recently met the transport commissioner of Uttar Pradesh and he has given me some hope,” says Rinki.

Meanwhile, she has been visiting schools and colleges spreading the message on road safety. “Many a time, accidents happen due to human negligence, so if we can follow road discipline, a lot of heartache can be averted,” she adds.

329,2020/01/18,Pedalling a sustainability message,"Just ten minutes of cycling on Chennai roads in rush-hour traffic will show you how low down the commuting totem-pole the cyclist is. It’s not just about the glaring lack of cycling infrastructure, but also the disdainful nonchalance with which they are treated, much like an ant would be in a room full of partying behemoths.

So, the humble cycle, which once ruled the roads, is now fighting for its rightful space. ‘Commute Bi Cycle’ (CBC), an initiative started by WCCG – Chennai Cyclists Group, is in the vanguard of this battle.

Being cycle-dependant

The initiative was kick-started — oops, pedalled off — only about a month ago, and it is already rich with 100-plus riders from across Chennai who have signed for it.

They would cycle down their regular commute — at least once or twice a week, if not all days of the work-week. Though the spotlight is on commuting, this initiative is not restricted to it, and aims at engineering shift in thinking, which can best be described as “being cycle-dependant”. So, it is about being open to the idea of cycling to the supermarket, school, college, theatre and while running any local errands — on an everyday basis.

As it seeks to make the cycle more than an fitness prop, and integrate it into one’s lifestyle, the “Commute Bi Cycle” initiative brings together experienced as well as amateur cyclists to use their bikes as their major mode of commute.

Locality-based groups

Right now, CBC has five locality-based groups for Anna Salai, GST Road, OMR, 100-Feet Road and Mount-Poonamallee Road. They will soon be expanding to more localities. The commute groups are a platform for knowledge-sharing on cycling as well as for ensuring group rides for those who are alone.

Commuting challenge

They also discuss common issues faced during their commute and solutions based on experience. CBC has also rolled out a ‘2020 Commute Champion Challenge’ where participants are expected to commit themselves to a certain number of commute days and fulfilling the commitment during the month and year.

With three categories to compete for, a pro commuter commits to 100 to 140 days, an ace commuter commits to 141 to 180 days and a champion commuter pledges to ride for 180+ days in 2020. Winners will be rewarded with a certificate and a memento, for encouragement. The group overall has accomplished 350+ commuting rides in the month of January 2020 so far.

Lack of infrastructure

Lack of cycling infrastructure, which include dedicated bike tracks, and the lack of empathy from other road users towards cyclists are two of the major challenges faced by these cycle commuters. But an increase in the number of riders on the road, the organisers believe, the Government will take notice and come forward to build the necessary facilities to promote this green mode of transport.

Across the world, cities like Copenhagen are making their roads cyclist-friendly by creating exclusive cycling superhighways with suitable facilities for cyclists such as appropriate signals, safer intersections, air pumps and foot rests. These connect study, work and residential areas and are located close to stations making it easy for combining public transportation with biking.

The Commute Bi Cycle initiative also envisions to make Chennai, bicycle-commute-friendly, propagating the concept of #WeToo — We too share the road. Divakaran, an avid cyclist who has been using his cycle regularly for fitness as well as commuting, shares some tips on riding stress-free on Chennai roads: “Time, safety and fuel are key. Start early, do not listen to music to distract yourself from ambient traffic.

Always wear a helmet and find a spot where you can have a short break for tea/coffee/snacks”.

With global and local conversations around air pollution, environment conservation on the rise, commuting by cycle is one of the ways to reduce your carbon footprint.

330,2020/01/18,Over 600 Olive Ridley eggs collected in Chennai over the last fortnight,"The Chennai Wildlife Division has collected close to 616 Olive Ridley Sea Turtle eggs, and recorded six nests over the last two weeks. A stakeholders consultative meeting will be conducted soon to ensure the safety of the eggs, turtles and their hatchlings.

Last year, a total of 50,600 eggs were collected and 44,000 hatchlings were released into the sea. This year, 16 forest staff and 10 local fishermen started patrolling the coastline from Marina to Neelankarai a month ago, to remove obstructions as well as predators from egg-laying areas.

“Two weeks ago, the turtles started laying eggs. The collected eggs are kept in hatcheries in Besant Nagar, Kovalam and Pulicat. Prior to this, we were involved in beach cleaning and patrolling ,” said C.H. Padma, Wildlife Warden, Chennai.

During one such patrol session, the staff spotted a turtle on the shore that had been injured by mechanised boats. “It was taken for treatment to the Theosophical Society Hospital by volunteers of the Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) and later released into the sea,” she said.

The Olive Ridley turtles nesting season is between January and May every year. “The peak season is February and March. The hatchlings emerge after 45 days and they are released into the sea safely,” she said.

The Wildlife Warden added that the SSTCN has been permitted to coordinate with the division for awareness activities. Earlier, the NGOs had their own hatcheries but the forest department has decided not to permit these.

“All the eggs will be deposited in the forest department’s hatcheries,” Ms. Padma said. The NGOs were not permitted to undertake any activity that will disturb Olive Ridleys, in the egg-laying zones of Chennai, she added.

Meanwhile, the Wildlife Division will be holding a meeting with various departments to ensure safety of the eggs, turtles and their hatchlings. While the Chennai Corporation will be requested to switch off street lights between 11.00 p.m. and 5.00 a.m., resorts near the nesting zones, will be advised not to host any events beyond 11 p.m.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bt0tuj/article30593510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18JANTH-Turtlejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/over-600-olive-ridley-eggs-collected-in-chennai-over-the-last-fortnight/article30593511.ece
331,2020/01/18,"In a few days, scanning your baggage at Chennai airport’s domestic terminal will be easier: here’s why","Passengers travelling through the domestic terminal of Chennai airport can finally heave a sigh of relief, as the scanning process of their check-in baggage is all set to become seamless in a couple of day.

By Wednesday, Chennai airport’s domestic terminal will have new Inline Baggage Screening (ILBS) system and will replace the old X-Ray machines. So passengers will not have to carry their heavy baggage and send it for scanning through the X-Ray machines. Like the international terminal, where passengers just go to collect their boarding cards at the check-in counter and drop off their baggage, here too, this will happen henceforth.

Officials of Airports Authorities of India (AAI) said, they are waiting to get some manpower which they plan to have by Monday. “For the next few days, we will run a few checks and trials to see if the working mechanism is fine and to check for issues. Once we fix all this, we plan to open it on Wednesday itself,” an official said.

The domestic terminal has had long queues during peak hours in the morning and passengers are usually forced to wait for a long time to scan their baggage.

“As such, the domestic terminal is getting congested with the growing passenger traffic. Between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., each passenger has to wait in the queue to first get their baggage scanned in the X-Ray machine and then once again at the check-in counter too. The whole terminal looks congested. Now, if these inline scanning machines come in, it certainly will ease congestion inside the terminal,” he added.

Soon, as part of the phase II modernisation work that is on, there are plans to install self-baggage drop machines too in both departure halls of the international and domestic terminals of Chennai airport.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jfx5j5/article30593136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18JANTH-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-a-few-days-scanning-your-baggage-at-chennai-airports-domestic-terminal-will-be-easier-heres-why/article30593137.ece
332,2020/01/18,Chennai’s jewellers welcome Union government’s move to ensure hallmarking of gold jewellery,"Jewellers in Thyagaraya Nagar, the gold hub of Chennai, have welcomed the announcement pertaining to mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery by the Union Consumer Affairs Minister. They also said that they have been selling 100% BIS hallmarked gold even before this announcement had come.

Earlier this week, Consumer Affairs Minister, Ram Vilas Paswan announced that no jeweller will be permitted to sell gold jewellery without hallmarking from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) from January 15, 2021.

“This is a good move by the government and will infuse more confidence into the minds of customers while they purchase gold. All the gold that we sell is hallmarked and we have been doing this for several years now,” G.R. Radhakrishnan, Managing Director of GRT Group said. “The gold that we sell even in the smaller towns like Thanjavur is hallmarked. We even have purity-checking machines across all our stores,” he added. The group has 37 stores across Tamil Nadu.

Amarendran Vummidi, Managing Partner, Vummidi Bangaru Jewellers (VBJ), said that this was a good move -- both for the jeweller and the consumer. He added that adequate time had been given to jewellers to allow infrastructure to come into place. “We have been hallmarking all our gold for over five years now,” he said.

“In metro cities such as Chennai and mini metros including Madurai and Coimbatore, awareness about BIS Hallmarked jewellery is very high. More than 95% of our customers are well aware about these benefits and those purchasing diamonds jewellery are familiar with the caratage and 18K or 22K jewellery. The same is the case with customers exchanging old gold jewellery,” said T.S. Kalyanramanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Kalyan Jewellers. It is only in the smaller towns of Tamil Nadu that we get some customers -- less than 30% --who need to be educated about BIS Hallmarking and its benefits,” he said.

While big players are already hallmark compliant, smaller ones have indicated that they would get this done in the coming months. A small jeweller in T. Nagar, said that only 60% of his current consignment is hallmarked. “The announcement has just come in and going forward we will ensure that all our gold is hallmarked,” he said on condition on anonymity.

Another jeweller who requested not to be named said that only 40% of his consignment is hallmarked. “Customers who come here are not specific about whether gold is hallmarked or not. They just look at the designs and patterns when they purchase,” he said. Several other small jewellers in T. Nagar and in Sowcarpet said that since ample time has been given by the Union government they will soon ensure that all gold sold by them is hallmarked.

Statistics show that India is the largest importer of gold, with annual imports of 700-800 tonnes. According to a World Gold Council report, hallmarking could largely wipe out the malpractice of gold jewellery and ornaments of inferior purity being sold as 22-carat. “Trust in the industry would increase. This would benefit consumers, retailers and exporters,” the report said.

Hallmarking of gold has four main components – BIS mark, carat purity and fineness, assaying and hallmarking centre number, and jewellers’ identification mark.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iyfd9l/article30592844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18JANTH-GOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-jewellers-welcome-union-governments-move-to-ensure-hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery/article30592845.ece
333,2020/01/18,Tribunal directs liquidation of Nathella Sampath Jewellery,"The Division Bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Chennai has ordered liquidation of Nathella Sampath Jewellery Private Limited. In 2018, the company had filed a voluntary insolvency petition which was admitted by the NCLT.

Nathella had said it defaulted a sum of ₹385.37 crore to 58 financial creditors (banks), ₹67.25 crore to 62 operational creditors (vendors and suppliers) and other payable expenses include ₹8.32 crore. The total amount owed, comes to ₹461.40 crore.

In addition, the firm said an amount of ₹63.7 crore is due as on January 15, 2018, towards advance received from customers for supplies to be effected at a future date in the form of cash, gold and includes amounts received on instalment basis to be repaid within 11 months.

Ram Ratan Kanoongo, resolution professional said it has been difficult to find any resolution plan for the revival of Nathella and the committee of lenders had recommended liquidation with 97.90% voting in favour. He also pointed out that The Enforcement Directorate had provisionally attached 37 immovable properties valued at about ₹328.44 crore including all the properties mortgaged by the company with lenders, as well as that of directors, guarantors and related parties. The attachment was made under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the case is pending. Mr. Kanoongo said the 330-day deadline for the insolvency process expired on November 14 last year, and the process is at a standstill due to multiple proceedings pending.

NCLT ruled that ordering liquidation soon after completion of the insolvency period will not have any bearing on the PMLA proceedings, because action against erring management will not be affected by its order. It also asked The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India to propose the name of a liquidator and said Mr. Kanoongo will act as liquidator still such time.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kanoongo has called the stakeholders of Nathella to submit their claims along with proof on or before February 9, 2020.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/u1vgle/article30592108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18JANTH-INSOLVENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tribunal-directs-liquidation-of-nathella-sampath-jewellery/article30592109.ece
334,2020/01/18,Arvind Swami’s MGR act evokes praise,"While Tamil Nadu was celebrating the 103rd birth anniversary of former Chief Minister and AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran on Friday, actor Arvind Swami, who is playing the role of MGR in Thalaivi, a biopic on Jayalalithaa, surprised everyone with a ‘first look’ poster, which convincingly evoked the image of the legend.

While Kangana Ranaut’s appearance as former Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa with heavy prosthetic make-up came in for a lot of criticism when posters and a short video appeared online, Arvind Swami’s performance, which mirrored MGR’s in the famous song Naan Ungal Veetu Pillai, garnered much appreciation.

A video clip featuring MGR in the original song Naan Ungal Veetu Pillai and Arvind Swami’s performance went viral and fans were amazed at the close resemblance of Arvind Swami’s performance to the original.

Arvind Swami later tweeted: “Thank you for the phenomenal response. On behalf of the entire team, I thank you for your acceptance. A special mention to Pattanam Rashid for the make-up, Nagendra Prasad for the choreography and Neeta Lulla for the costumes.”

Directed by Vijay, Thalaivi, starring Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami, is one of the three biopics on Jayalalithaa in Tamil that followed a few years after her death in 2016.

Filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon’s Queen, which starred Ramya Krishnan as Jayalalithaa, was recently released on an OTT platform to largely favourable reviews.

Filmmaker Priyadarshini’s The Iron Lady, featuring Nithya Menen, is under production.

The care included ventilator support for breathing, surfactant therapy to enable adequate lung expansion, inotropes to support heart and blood circulation, and nutrition through intravenous route.

N. Chandra Kumar, senior consultant, said that the twins attained the weight of 1.65kg and 1.43kg, respectively, after treatment. “They do not have any major morbidities.

336,2020/01/18,IIT-Madras students continue protest,"Students of IIT-Madras continued to sustain the momentum of the ongoing protest against the closure of Krishna Gate, with a group carrying out a demonstration near the main gate on Friday evening.

Students gathered near the gate, raised slogans and sang songs against what they termed the ‘dictatorial’ decision of the administration to close the gate. “Though we are still deliberating on further course of action, everyone is sure about continuing the protest until the administration relents,” a student said.

A girl student, who took part in the protest, said, “The management is saying that they have closed the gate keeping our interests in mind. If they are really concerned about us, they should listen to us.”

Students have opposed the closure, stating that it has caused inconvenience in terms of accessibility, particularly to facilities available outside the gate. Scholars, who are residing outside the campus but closer to Krishna Gate, have also strongly opposed the move.

Opposing the closure, people residing near the gate have complained of loss of livelihood for shops outside, apart from inconvenience in accessing the campus for housekeeping staff and students studying in the schools inside the campus.

Chidambaram MP and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan and Chennai South MP from DMK Thamizhachi Thangapandian have met IIT-Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi over the closure.

337,2020/01/18,NCLT approves takeover of Frontier Lifeline,"The UAE-based First Step Ventures is set to take over Frontier Lifeline Private Ltd, after its ₹75-crore resolution plan was approved by a division bench of the National Bench of the Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai.

Promoted by senior cardiac surgeon K.M. Cherian, the company runs the 100-bed Frontier Lifeline Hospital in Chennai. The hospital and Dr. K.M. Cherian Heart Foundation also promoted the 360-acre Medical Science Park, Frontier Mediville, at Elavur village in Tiruvallur district. It was the first medical research park in the country, and also a medical special economic zone (SEZ).

The commencement of the proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, was initiated against the company by the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. The petition claimed that the company had defaulted the payment of about ₹79.93 crore to SBI and ₹78.30 crore to Bank of Baroda, as on November 17, 2017. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, had granted liberty to consider First Step’s resolution plan as a scheme under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013, after NCLT ordered the liquidation of Frontier Lifeline.

Section 230 of the Companies Act is a mechanism to ensure institutional settlement of disputes between creditors and the company. It ensures that the company has a chance to save itself from insolvency or liquidation by doing a deal with at least a majority of creditors.

S. Rajagopal, who was appointed the liquidator, had filed an application under Section 230 of the Companies Act for convening meetings of both secured and unsecured creditors of the company to consider First Step’s plan.

NCLT ordered the convening of the meeting of both the secured and unsecured creditors, but noted that the committee of lenders was the ultimate authority to take a call in the management and affairs of the company, once it comes under the corporate insolvency resolution process, and the shareholders will not come into the picture, since they do not have economic interest in the company.

In the meeting, 97.58% of the secured creditors and 96.10% of the unsecured creditors of Frontier Lifeline Private Ltd voted in favour of the plan.

First Step will pay ₹75 crore in one shot, settling creditors’ dues as well as meeting the expenses on the corporate insolvency resolution process and liquidation. The NCLT, while approving the plan, directed the liquidator to pay the PF dues immediately. It also appointed the liquidator to continue on the monitoring committee, as provided under the plan.

It also rejected a plea sought by the South Indian Bank, on various grounds, for modification of the plan. One of the key things sought by the bank was to proceed against the promoter/guarantor to recover the money over and above what it received under the scheme.

Attempts to reach out to the hospital for quotes were futile.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nclt-approves-takeover-of-frontier-lifeline/article30589984.ece

To ensure safety and comfort of visitors, the AAZP had made arrangements. Over 300 policemen and 150 forest staff were deputed, along with 200 NCC cadets and NSS volunteers.

“As a special attraction this year, the zoo management arranged video shows of recently-born tiger cubs, gaur calves, nilgai fawn and other zoo animals. No untoward incident was reported due to the special arrangements,” said an official.

At the children’s park, the augmented reality (AR) animation show was a hit among visitors.

Marina Beach, Elliot’s Beach in Besant Nagar and the Thiruvanmiyur beach remained the most favoured attractions in the city.

The Mass Rapid Transit System and buses bound for Anna Square were packed with people bound for Marina Beach.

To tackle the huge crowds thronging the Marina, the city police had made fool-proof security arrangements — installing watch towers, temporary police help booths, deploying fire and rescue vehicles and stationing trained swimmers at various places. The police had also put up temporary barricades on the shore of the Marina to prevent visitors from entering the sea.

A senior police official posted at the Marina Beach said this year, the system to make more tags available for children, to ensure they are not lost in crowds, had helped reunite over 25 children with their families. He said over four lakh people were estimated to have visited Marina Beach.

A senior police official said in addition to various regular security measures, a helicopter from the Indian Coast Guard was pressed into service to conduct aerial surveys of the beaches, at scheduled intervals, even as police personnel on horses and all-terrain vehicles routinely moved around to provide help to the visitors. “Self-motor vehicles (Segway-like) and five drones were deployed at the Marina Beach,” he said.

The Metropolitan Transport Corporaiton (MTC), despite it being a holiday, operated nearly 500 special buses, in addition to the regular ones, specifically to various tourist destinations in and around the city, on Friday.

A senior MTC official said more than 500 special buses, in addition to 1,500 regular buses, were operated to important tourist places, including Anna Square, Guindy Children’s Park, Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Vandalur Zoo, Kovalam, Muttukadu, and theme parks on the ECR and Tambaram.

340,2020/01/18,A cry against hollow public life,"The turmoil witnessed in many university campuses over the recent weeks brings into fresh relevance many fundamental issues in educational theory. Autonomy of universities as public institutions is the foremost among these issues. Substantive autonomy has been fading away for some time; now we cannot escape worrying about its summary loss.

Education and politics

Another issue is the relationship between education and politics. It is one of the oldest questions posed in social philosophy. Human beings have always been concerned about what their progeny know or what all they can find out. This concern has driven curriculum wars in all societies, and these wars are inseparable from politics.

Then comes the third issue: the role of youth in shaping the social ethos. People engaged in active politics love to imagine that the young are on their side. After all, youth represents the future, so why would not politicians claim the support of youth? And therein lies the ironical truth, namely that the young are known to be unpredictable. No matter how much you try to shape their minds and habits, they can throw a total surprise at you.

All education, no matter what its stage, is about knowledge and learning. Howsoever poorly a system of education imparts knowledge to the young, it has its own dynamic which arises from knowledge itself. When educational opportunities expand across social classes, new social processes are unleashed. Our system of education has gone through radical expansion over the last three decades. It has widely disseminated the values enshrined in Constitution. The system has also conveyed to the young a general memory of the freedom movement, especially the memory of Gandhi, his ideas and methods.

Reading the Preamble

By the end of elementary classes, many children know that there is a problem with inequality. Quite a few among them know from personal experience how it feels when you face discrimination. That the Constitution is against discrimination in any form or sense brings both solace and anguish. The solace comes from the realisation that the Constitution prohibits discrimination; the anguish is caused by the widespread acceptance of discrimination.

It is hardly surprising that during many agitations held in the recent weeks, the Preamble to the Constitution was publicly read aloud. The obvious purpose was to convey the question: ‘How is equality before law possible if a law does not mention all religions?’ Harping on the specific context or meaning of the law in question cannot address the anxiety aroused by the law in question. The agitated youth of India is drawing attention to a more general, basic point. It will be terribly unfortunate if someone doubts the integrity of the young or perceives them as pawns in a power game.

Two campuses located in the nation’s capital have witnessed extraordinary scenes of violence. The chief administrator of one of these institutions has asked the students to forget what has happened and move on. This advice sounds strange, because education is all about reflection on experience. Violence represents a breakdown, not merely an aberration. Pedagogic relations are basic to education, and these relations call for maintenance of trust and peace.

Second, no memory of violence is easy to bury. Corporally punished children remember their experience throughout life. Injuries suffered in a library or in a hostel cannot heal easily. The thought that you had gone to an institution to acquire knowledge, but you got badly thrashed as you sat reading will linger and hurt. Educational sites of violence must allow the memory of violence to be used as a resource for learning. Restoration of peace is not like registration for a new semester. Participatory introspection — in which the administration and teachers join the students — is the only way to move forward. Inquiries and investigation are fine; properly carried out, they might establish the truth, but they will not restore peace which is essential for teaching.

Many people are puzzled by the intensity of recent events. Indeed, no one had expected that the generation ostensibly engrossed in a distracting technology would prove so sensitive to a legal shift. Custodians of higher education are shocked because a vast majority of our colleges and universities are simply unaware of the knowledge that students bring from schools. Higher classes ought to introduce the young to a wider perspective, but our universities ignore the intellectual needs of students and underestimate their potential. The opportunity to go deeply into a subject should enable the young to see things from a higher perspective. This is the real meaning of the term ‘higher’.

Going deep into knowledge, irrespective of the subject or discipline, permits the mind to draw linkages between knowledge and life and between different fields of knowledge. The Chief Justice of India has recently emphasised the importance of inter-disciplinary learning for judges. His appeal is equally applicable to other professions. It is unfortunate that the institution best known for putting serious efforts to introduce inter-disciplinary teaching, namely Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), has faced sustained prejudice towards it and polarisation within it. In general, the system of higher education has treated the young quite poorly. They are protesting today on their own — as a generation let down by the institutional and political order. This is not merely a matter of poor economic prospects or frustration with the conditions prevailing in the institution. It is a cry of the young against the ethical and intellectual hollow they have spotted in the nation’s public life.

Structural rift

The recent turmoil has also brought a structural fact into focus. The system of higher education in India is sharply divided between a beleaguered public sector and an insulated private sector. The latter has remained isolated from the suffering of the former. A handful of private universities flaunt their global connections and eminent faculty in social sciences and humanities. But faculty fame cannot compensate for disengaged pedagogy. Advertisements of inter-disciplinary studies and critical thinking remain hollow if an institution hides cocooned behind its security.

The silence one notices in high-fee charging campuses over what is troubling the young in public institutions offers an unexpected lesson in the real cost of privatisation. It explains why maintenance of good public universities is essential in a democracy if we define it as a system that encourages empathy across social divisions. It is not news anymore that India has neglected the state-funded higher education system and encouraged privatisation. Saving public money in the name of opening up opportunities for private spending has grave implications for the political role of education. Denying or decrying this role is bad for nation-building if democracy is its chosen path.

Recovery of institutional and systemic health is never easy, especially when it is not recognised as a policy goal. It will be a pity if the current unrest in some of our best institutions of higher learning intensifies the prejudice and disdain they have suffered over the years. If violence has vitiated the atmosphere in some of them, that is all the more reason why the role the public universities has played in building the nation is recalled and given due respect. JNU is not the first university to be hollowed out by indefensible appointments. Nor is it the only one to have lost its autonomy. But its loss is symbolic of a systemic misfortune.

China seems determined to keep its all-weather friend, Pakistan, in good humour, however illogical the stance it has to take for this.

While core member nations have stood behind India on the Kashmir issue, New Delhi cannot bask in the glory of past diplomatic successes. In the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s observations on the Net curbs in the Valley, the Centre has much work to do in convincing the world on its plans.

343,2020/01/18,Amazon comments,"The Union Commerce Minister seems to have jumped the gun in his laconic observations on the recent Amazon investment proposal (Inside pages – ‘In Brief’, “Amazon not doing favour to India: Piyush Goyal”, January 17). We may recall that Amazon had promised to create more than 25,000 jobs on a new campus in Long Island City, NY, in return for nearly $3 billion in government incentives. It was a cocky and raw business approach in a nation that is a votary of pure capitalism. Yet the venture failed mostly due to the growing influence of the progressive left in New York. In its current home in Seattle, Amazon is being criticised on rising house prices and inequality that has damaged the city. Now a Minister in our own right-of-centre government has chosen to cast a barb on its predatory pricing policies. This might well be due to the party’s concerns on saving its trader vote bank. But the remarks, credible they may be, could as well have come from a party functionary than from the Minister concerned.

344,2020/01/18,Celebrity activism,"The two debaters seem to argue with the presumption that celebrity political activism’s utility as a social good is unchallengeable (OpEd, ‘Parley’: “Should celebrities avoid political activism?”, January 17). Since one cannot talk politics without taking sides, most celebrities pick up politically correct and popular causes rather than fearlessly speak truth to power. For instance, Kerala’s stars have rarely spoken against political violence that snuffs out innocent lives and lockouts that violate the freedoms of ordinary citizens.

Instead of wasting their time in chasing unproductive and acrimonious political issues, the stars can perform as part-time social activists. Why don’t the stars use their popularity to shine the spotlight on social issues such as the high rate of road accidents, women’s safety in public spaces, harassment of women in workplaces, the need to wean the society away from intoxicants, sexual violence against children, the importance of blood donation, educating teenagers to negotiate their relationships, etc?

Social activism is also a safer sanctuary than political activism, as it poses no threat to the careers of luminaries. This is not to say that celebrities should be apolitical; it is only that social activism unifies people and makes a lasting impact on society.

345,2020/01/18,‘Taming’ the bull,"The Jallikattu “sport” is being held every year in Tamil Nadu around Pongal to show the valour of youth in taming bulls. As seen from the photograph on Page 1 (“Bull owner killed, over 50 hurt in 2 events”, January 17), it was only the raging bull that made the “tamers” run helter-skelter and responsible for inflicting injuries.

Close observation of this sport shows that no bull has ever been tamed in the true sense, while human deaths and injuries are on the rise. Where is the valour in this sport? Are the “tamers” facing the bull from the front? The so-called tamers hang on the bulls for some distance and are then declared winners. Something needs to be done to discourage this “sport”.

346,2020/01/18,Actor Shabana Azmi injured in road accident,"Actor Shabana Azmi suffered several injuries after her car met with an accident on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway on Saturday afternoon.

According to the Khalapur police, the incident occurred around 4 p.m. when Ms. Azmi was heading to Khandala, just before the toll plaza in Khalapur, Raigad. The police said her husband, writer and poet Javed Akhtar, was in another car with three others, while Ms. Azmi was in an SUV driven by her chauffeur.

“The driver tried to overtake a truck in front from the wrong side, using the lane on the far left next to the shoulder, and ended up ramming into the truck,” Inspector Vishwajeet Kaigade of Khalapur police station said.

Assistant Police Inspector Subhash Pujari said while the driver did not sustain any injuries due to the car’s airbag, Ms. Azmi sustained several injuries.

“Mr. Akhtar, who was following close behind, immediately stopped his car and called for help, and Ms. Azmi was rushed to the MGM Hospital in Kamothe,” police said.

Doctors at the MGM Hospital said Ms. Azmi had suffered whiplash injuries due to the collision. Later in the evening she was shifted to the Kokilaben Ambani Hospital in Andheri. where she is currently in the ICU.

The Khalapur police, meanwhile, have detained the driver, identified as Amalesh Kumar, and the truck driver for inquiries. Superintendent of Police Anil Paraskar, Raigad said that prima facie inquiries indicate that the driver was at fault and that action will be taken accordingly.

Ms. Sule made the statement at a protest attended by thousands of women at the YMCA ground in Agripada on Friday evening. The women gathered holding hundreds of Tricolours and anti-CAA placards, shouting ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and reciting Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’.

Ms. Sule said the Bharatiya Janata Party is coming out with such laws as it is unable to run the Central government.

“The Prime Minister and Home Minister give contrasting statements which makes me doubt that they might not be talking to each other. I was in Parliament when the Home Minister said he will implement the NRC across India,” Ms. Sule said.

The NCP leader said the Maharashtra government will stand by the citizens of the State in opposition to the laws. “We know what is in the people’s mind and the same thing is on our mind as well. In Mumbai, nobody is Hindu or Muslim, everyone is a Mumbaikar and these laws will not be able to discriminate between us. A woman can run a house but can also break a governnment. This is the power of a saree or a burqa,” she said.

The protest was also attended by students from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University. Nabiya Khan from JMI said the police have an Islamophobic attitude towards the university.

“Violence against students has been seen in every university but there is a difference in how police is treating JNU and JMI. We have called things like ‘Jinnah ke pilley’ [Jinnah’s children] and told ‘kalma padh lo yeh tumhari aakhiri raat hai’ [say your prayers, this is your final night]. But women have been and will continue to be at the forefront of protests,” she said.

Devika Menon, a student from JNU, said the laws are in favour of the rich and will send the poor to detention camps to make slaves out of them. Advocate Qurratulaen Ganchi said, “The Constitution gives women equal rights as men and Islam also promotes education of women. It says women should be ahead in social issues.

348,2020/01/18,Jalees Ansari held in Kanpur,"Jalees Ansari, a Mumbai serial blasts convict, was arrested on Friday afternoon in Kanpur, the Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh Police has said.

Ansari (68), convicted for the 1993 blasts, went missing on Thursday from his Mominpura residence while on parole from Rajasthan’s Ajmer Central Prison. A missing person’s report was lodged at Agripada police station when he did not appear for his usual attendance as part of his parole conditions, the police said. On December 26, Ansari was released for 21 days on parole.

Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) sources said local informants gave them a tip-off about Ansari’s movements and confirmed that he had taken the Pushpak Express to Kanpur on Thursday. “We rushed a team to Kanpur and kept the Uttar Pradesh Police in the loop. From Thursday evening to Friday afternoon, we visited scores of locations in the city in pursuit of him,” an ATS officer said.

Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police O.P Singh said a team of the STF, which was in touch with the ATS, nabbed Ansari outside a mosque in Kanpur. Ansari was arrested from Faithfulganj around 1 p.m., the police said. Around ₹47,000 in cash, a diary, a mobile phone and an Aadhaar card were recovered from him.

“It is big success for the Uttar Pradesh Police, especially the STF. [He was arrested] in a very dramatic way, when he was coming out of a mosque, and was moving towards a railway station holding a child by his finger,” said Mr. Singh.

ATS officers confirmed that Ansari planned to cross the border and enter Nepal on Friday night. His escape could have had serious implications. Called the “poor man’s al-Zawahiri” in law enforcement circles, Ansari is known to be committed to Jihad, much like Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man who heads the al Qaeda.

A police officer said, “After his arrest in 1994, Ansari told his interrogators that he was simply doing god’s work and would continue to do it without regret the minute he was released. He has said more than once that he gets his orders directly from the almighty.” Making such statements prevented Ansari from obtaining bail and he was granted parole only after he had approached the Supreme Court.

‘Actions not surprising’

The officer added, “His patient fight in court to get parole, daily reporting to the local police to avoid arousing suspicion and fleeing on the last day of his parole do not come as a surprise to the people who knew him.”

A religious man, Ansari completed his MBBS in 1982 and became radicalised after the riots in Bhiwandi and Malegaon. From 1989 to 1992, he carried out blasts across the country with help from a small module from Mominpura that he had radicalised, earning the sobriquet ‘Dr. Bomb’. He was arrested in 1994 by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

As per the terms of his parole, he was required to present himself at the Agripada police station every day and be escorted back to the prison on Thursday. However, he was found missing after he left his house with a bag at 4.30 a.m. on Thursday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/au6u7r/article30590231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Jalis-Ansari,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jalees-ansari-held-in-kanpur/article30590232.ece
349,2020/01/18,Mumbai marathon: police to keep eye out for CAA protests,"Apart from the usual potential disturbances that are on the list every year, the Mumbai Police will be looking out for any unscheduled protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during the Tata Mumbai Marathon on Sunday.

The annual marathon, which is immensely popular with the running community, is expected to witness participation from over 55,000 people this year. The Mumbai Police as well as the traffic police take detailed measures every year to ensure that the event goes off without a hitch.

Protests against the CAA, the National Register of Citizens, the National Population Register and the police brutalities against demonstrators have had the entire country abuzz for the last one month. The attack on students and teachers on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus in New Delhi had sparked an impromptu protest at the Gateway of India earlier this month.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranaya Ashok, Mumbai Police spokesperson, said over 3,000 police personnel would be enforcing bandobast for the Mumbai marathon. He said, “We will keep an eye out for any untoward incidents related to the ongoing protests and take swift action. The action will be taken based on the situation and in a manner that does not disturb the runners or cause inconvenience to the people gathering along the route to cheer them.”

Sources said the Social Media Lab of the police is trawling the internet to see if any flash protests during the Marathon are being discussed. The local police station personnel will be supplemented by specialised units like the Riot Control Police, the Quick Response Teams and the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad to ensure tight security.

Police to guide motorists

Mr. Ashok said, “The traffic police have put several diversions and restrictions in place for the duration of the event.

350,2020/01/18,Man gets five years in jail for killing wife,"The Alibaug sessions court on Thursday sentenced Sriram Chitturi (45), a resident of Kharghar, to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for killing his wife, Pushpa (41), on suspicion of infidelity in 2016. A fine of ₹20,000 was imposed on the accused.

Chitturi, who worked in the Gulf, had returned home after two years in December 2015. The police said Chitturi began suspecting his wife, who worked as a teacher at Ryan International School.

Around 5 p.m., on January 25, 2016, Chitturi hit Pushpa’s head with a hammer during an argument. He then covered the body with a sheet and left the house with his six-year-old son and a bag of clothes.

Assistant police inspector Bhanu Khatavkar, who had probed the case, said, “Chitturi’s brother had married Pushpa’s sister, Madhavi, and he went to their house in Thane. Chitturi’s 16-year-old daughter was at the house on a visit. Chitturi narrated what had happened and they rushed to Kharghar to check on Pushpa. They found her dead.”

Madhavi then filed a complaint and the police registered a case and arrested Chitturi. The police recorded their statements before a magistrate and the son’s statement was taken in the presence of a social worker.

Mr. Khatavkar said, “The accused’s blood-stained clothes was the vital evidence.

351,2020/01/18,"In Mumbai, protests, tributes mark Rohith Vemula’s death anniversary","The death anniversary of Rohith Vemula, a PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad who committed suicide due to alleged harassment over his caste in 2016, was observed in the city with protests and tributes. While a candlelight vigil was held in his memory on Thursday night, a rally from Kotwal Udyan to Chaityabhoomi in Dadar was held on Friday.

Vemula, who was also a member of the Ambedkar Student Association, committed suicide on January 17, 2016, and his death led to protests and outrage in the country. Those who gathered to pay their respects, spoke about how the current atmosphere was on the same casteist lines as the one that led to Vemula’s death.

Participants in the gathering on Thursday and the rally on Friday protested the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Jamila Eathakula, national coordinator, National Alliance of People’s Movement, Maharashtra, said, “The circumstances that racists had created provoked Rohith to take the extreme step. These people will never let a person who is not an upper caste Brahmin succeed and achieve their goals. Government servants know that this government is no good for the country, but are still supporting it because they are greedy for power. Only students are worried about the country.”

The rally was attended by former Indian Police Service officer Abdur Rehman, who resigned from his post after the CAA was passed in the Rajya Sabha. “How can we keep quiet when our children are being beaten up by goons? This Act is not going to give us citizenship but will snatch it from us,” he said.

Manan Desai, a self-confessed ‘bhakt’-turned-protester, was also at the rally. “I am a Gujarati Brahmin, and am still here to protect the Constitution. I was a ‘bhakt’ earlier, but have realised what the ruling regime is doing. They are ignoring our concerns regarding unemployment, lack of education and a drop in the economy, while focusing on Article 370, CAA, NRC and NPR to divert us from questioning their failures. I am a privileged upper caste Brahmin and when I took a stand against the CAA, supporters of the BJP started threatening me as well. Think of what they can do to quell the minorities,” Mr. Desai said.

The rally, organised by NGO Hum Bharat ke Log, witnessed participation from organisations working for the rights of minorities, including the Bhim Army.

On Thursday night, around 300 people, mostly students, gathered for a candlelight vigil at Chaityabhoomi. Suvarna Salve, a member of Joint Action Committee for Social Justice, said if students like Vemula and Payal Tadvi were alive today, they would have protested these dark laws. Tadvi, a second year resident at Nair hospital, had committed suicide last year, allegedly due to harassment by her seniors.

Ms. Salve said, “The government wants to bring the laws of Manusmriti and force Hindutva on people. We have gathered to take an oath that we will not let the martyrdom of the students, who lost their lives for our Constitution, be wasted.”

The gatherings on both days saw participation from members of the transgender community and tribals. “I am lucky my parents support me and let me live with them. Other transgenders abandoned by their families at a younger age will face problems. Even if documents are available, our gender would not match with the one mentioned in the papers,” Vicky, a transgender, said. on Thursday.

Christie, a transgender, said the trend of getting documents issued is still new in the tribal community. “Tribals have been living on Indian land before anyone else, and now the government wants us to prove our citizenship,” she said.

352,2020/01/18,"Maharashtra govt., BMC release funds for Wadia hospitals","A day after the Bombay High Court had pulled it up for not releasing funds to the Wadia hospitals, the State government on Friday said it had released ₹24 crore.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) told a Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla that it had also released ₹10 crore to the Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children and ₹4 crore to the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Sarva Shramik Sanghatna seeking release of funds for the hospitals.

As per the trust deed signed by the hospitals, the maternity hospital receives grants from the State government and the BMC, while the children’s hospital gets funds only from the civic body. The BMC had held back money from its December payment, citing irregularities. This led to protests by current and former employees over unpaid salaries and pensions.

The BMC’s counsel told the court that claims about non-payment made by the hospital was without substance and needed verification. The Bench said, “If you think the bills are illegitimate, people are drawing double salary... withdraw from the partnership.”

The court also questioned why the issue of irregularity was not raised earlier. Referring to the BMC disbursing some money, the court said, “If there was large-scale irregularity, you shouldn’t have released the funds. What did you do in the board meeting, as you were part of the management...? If you want an inquiry... there will be an independent inquiry against your officers too. If these are the discrepancies, nobody will come forward for philanthropic activity, and you [BMC] want strategic partners every day.”

The court has directed the State, the BMC and the hospitals to convene a meeting.

353,2020/01/18,Mumbai malls to be open 24x7 from January 26,"State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray’s dream project, Mumbai Nightlife, has finally taken shape.

On Thursday, the State government ironed out the policy, as per which malls, shopping complexes in commercial areas, gated communities and mill compounds will be allowed to remain open 24x7 if they wish to. The move is set to boost Mumbai tourism, besides honouring the city’s culture and taking a step towards making it a global city.

Mr. Thackeray had conceptualised the Mumbai 24x7 project when he was still in the Yuva Sena. The move was seen as another attempt by the Shiv Sena to distance itself from its former ‘anti-Valentine’s Day’ avatar, to make it more inclusive. In 2018, the Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party government gave it a green signal and even issued a notification but it was subject to approval from the Mumbai Police. The police had concerns related to law and order, owing to which it was never implemented.

On Thursday, Mr. Thackeray, now Tourism Minister and Guardian Minister for Mumbai suburbs, convened a meeting with Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve apart from representatives of various establishments. In the meeting, it was decided to give the go-ahead to the policy.

“Any commercial establishment that does not serve alcohol located inside a gated community, mill compound or a commercial area will be allowed to stay open 24x7. They do not need separate permissions. Several mall owners have already expressed interest. They can choose to start the same any time now, but the rules for serving alcohol stay the same,” said a senior civic official. Alcohol can currently be served only up to 1:30 a.m.

Malls, stores, restaurants, multiplexes, salons and all establishments that do not serve alcohol can now stay open 24x7. They will not require any additional permissions, provided they have all the requisite permissions from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Fire Brigade and police. This does not apply to residential areas, though. Around 25 establishments have expressed willingness to stay open 24x7.

Kunal Vardhan, owner of Atria Mall in Worli said, “This is a step towards making Mumbai a truly global city. Awareness is key and over a period of time, it will become popular. We want to start from January 26 and I will hold meetings with store owners about the same. The timing can be staggered for retail stores, multiplexes and salons among others .”

Sandip Runwal, managing director, Runwal Developers, which owns R. City Mall in Ghatkopar said, “This is done globally and we are very happy it has happened in Mumbai. Now it is up to citizens to behave responsibly and make it work. Mall security will definitely be increased but transportation will also be required late at night. Besides, we will have more guards, including women, apart from our CCTV camera network. Prices will have to be kept low initially to attract people; we should not look at costs right now. Eventually it will become a culture,” he said.

Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India said, “It is a brilliant move; it was our old demand. It will give a new lease of life to Mumbai and is a step towards the government’s $5 trillion economy. Ideally, alcohol should also be allowed.”

Mr. Pardeshi and Mr. Barve were not available for comment. Not everyone however, is elated at the move. BJP’s Ashish Shelar tweeted, “Urge Maharashtra government to clarify full details about bar/pub/malls and eateries staying open 24x7. Peace, safety and security of Mumbaikars in residential areas is topmost priority. Any bar/pub/mall/eatery which is a security threat for residential areas or puts burden on police will be opposed.”

Addressing the media on Friday, Mr. Thackeray said, “From January 26, the policy will be implemented in Nariman Point, Kala Ghoda, BKC and mill compounds. It will not cause any trouble. A similar thing has been implemented in Ahmedabad. Those making allegations, do they want Mumbai to lag behind? This move will also generate employment,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hxaf5a/article30590149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMMALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-gets-a-rocking-nightlife-aaditya-has-a-dream-fulfilled/article30590150.ece
354,2020/01/18,Devendra Fadnavis backs Mumbai University professor,"Former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking a roll back of the action taken against a Mumbai University professor for an “objectionable” tweet on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

Mr. Fadnavis, who is also Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, said in his letter that by sending Professor Yogesh Soman, director of the Academy of Theatre Arts at Mumbai University, on forced leave even as he had spoken with pride on V.D. Savarkar, is an embarrassing event for the State and must be rolled back immediately.

“The professor has only spoken with pride and respect for V.D. Savarkar, and for this was sent on a forced leave just because Congress-affiliated youth bodies had protested. This decision has hurt every person who holds national pride in their hearts. A similar punishment has been doled out against a professor in Madhya Pradesh. This is not expected from a State whose Chief Minister is believed to be holding similar respect for V.D. Savarkar,” he said.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has announced it will take action against Mr Soman.

On December 14, the professor had posted a video on Twitter targeting Mr. Gandhi, and referring to him as ‘pappu’, for his statement against Veer Savarkar.

The professor has since been sent on forced leave by the university administration.

“A university professor’s job is to teach children, not give statements like these [on Mr. Gandhi]. He has been sent on leave for now but action will be taken once he is back,” Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had said on Thursday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-backs-mumbai-university-professor/article30590101.ece

What I was saying? Ok, it’s night. I am reading novel, and suspense emotions are coming like anything. It is almost 11 o’clock. Suddenly I heard one sound. It was like dum dum dum dum. I said, “Kamalam, did you hear that?” But Mrs. M already sleeping like fallen coconut tree lying on ground. Then sound is gone. I said maybe air conditioner in some flat causing problem. Reading and reading. Then suddenly one more dum dum. Nearby coconut tree is still sleeping.

I went to phone and called Dr. Shankaramenon. “Hello doctor,” I said, “noise is coming in the night.” He said, “Mathrubootham how many times I have told avoid non-veg items at dinner time otherwise noise only will come?” I said, “What nonsense you are talking, noise is not coming from me.” He said, “Apologies, please tell Mrs. Mathrubootham to have some control when eating bread, bun and other baking powder type items, otherwise nonstop sound will come.”

I said, “Dr. Madashiromani, if you will keep quiet for one second, I can say something? Some sound is coming inside house. Whether you can hear also? It is sounding like dum dum dum.” He said, “Mathrubootham, no sound in my house, I will come to your house in five minutes.”

Madam/ Sir, we stood in the living room. No noise. Then we stood in the kitchen. Pindrop silence. I said, “Doctor, sorry for wasting time, maybe it is my imagination.” Then I went and sat in the bed and immediately I heard, dum dum dum. What nonsense is this I shouted in low volume due to sleeping of Mrs. M. I ran out of flat and said, “Doctor, doctor, come back. Dum dum dum is returned.” He came with me to bedroom. I said, “Can you hear now? God promise, I am hearing sound just now.” “Nothing.”

I said, “Dr. Shankaramenon, do one thing. You sit on the bed. Within two minutes you will hear sound.” He said, ok.

Madam/ Sir, whether I was born under some shani dosham? Why so much bad luck in one life? Till that moment Mrs. M is sleeping like polar bear in Christmas season. Next moment she is awake. And what did she see next to her in the bed? Dr. Shankaramenon.

Shouting means export quality ISI mark shouting began. Then she said, “Next time doctor I see your face within 100 metres means immediate police station phone call, get out of house now.” Afterwards she said, bloody fool old man where is my phone? I said, “How I will know; you were only doing YouTube.” She searched and found it stuck under mattress. She took out phone and some film was still playing. I asked, “Kamalam, whether any dum dum dum songs are there in this film?” She said, “It is full of dum dum dum songs, why you are asking?”

I said, “No, no, just curiosity.” Then I quietly went to sleep.

Yours in embarrassment,

356,2020/01/18,How healthy is your paint?,"Considering we spend 90% of our time indoors, isn’t it important to ensure the finishes used in our building interiors are safe? One such material that we are directly exposed to at all times is paint.

Paints were first seen about 30,000 years ago when they were used to decorate walls of ancient rock dwellings. Naturally available pigments such as charcoal, red and yellow ochre from minerals, and white from ground bones were mixed with binders such as water, animal fat, vegetable juice and even blood to enable easy application on walls.

The first paint mill was established in Boston, United States in 1700, but it was not until 1867 that the first ‘ready mixed’ paints were patented in the US.

What are VOCs?

Over the years, the paint industry has developed chemicals to enhance the properties of paint: colour effectiveness, drying time, ease of maintenance, shelf life and so on. These chemicals include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are organic chemicals that have a high vapour pressure at ordinary room temperature.

VOCs vaporise as soon as they are exposed to the atmosphere. As the material dries, it is the strong paint odour that lingers. In fact, this vaporisation can continue for years after application. Some of these VOCs include ethyl acetate, benzene, methylene chloride, etc., which lead to poor indoor air quality and are potentially harmful to human beings as well as the environment.

Long term exposure can put people at risk of developing ailments. At the ground level, these can lead to formation of smog, leading to poor outdoor air quality.

Natural paints

The good news is that the market now has several paint variants which come with low or zero harmful ingredients. Most of these are water-based paints which are odour-free and are made using natural materials such as clay, milk, casein and natural dyes.

International standards such as Green Seal-11, product certification systems such as GreenPro and green building rating systems such as LEED and Indian Green Building Council have specified limits for VOCs and other harmful ingredients in paints.

The VOC limit for indoor paints is 50 grams/litre. However, today there are many paints in the market that do not contain VOCs. It is important to look for this data while selecting the right paint for our buildings. The following labels can be used while selecting a paint: Green Seal Certified, Green-Pro Certified, or labels which note ‘zero or low-voc’. Similar precautions should be used while selecting other indoor finishes such as adhesives, sealants and varnishes.

357,2020/01/18,Homecoming: Truth is out,"The story so far: Akash and Dharti began teaching English while the other children chipped in by teaching them Kannada.

“Akash! Dharti! Get ready. We are going to Daksh uncle’s house today.” By noon, they arrived at Daksh uncle’s house. The kids played outside and when they went indoors for water, Akash spotted it.

“You have a television?” he asked. “But Appa, you said nobody has television in the village and that you don’t get the signal. You lied.” Akash said angrily.

Appa said, “You kids were spending too much time with electronics. Now, you’ve learnt so much about plants and animals.”

“Do you ever ask what I want? Do you even spend any time with us?” shot back Akash. “You are either on the farm or at the hospital. You don’t care about us.”

“Of course we do,” said Amma. “That’s why we came back.”

Akash ran out of the house and found a tree to climb.

His father followed him.

Mending mistakes

“Akash, I’m sorry, I should not have lied. I know you miss your life in England. I realise I have not been spending time with you. Will you forgive me?”

Silence. After some more coaxing, Appa sighed. “I’ll tell you what. Let’s go to a theatre in town and see a movie. Why don’t you and your sister choose a movie?” Appa fetched a paper and Akash, who had now climbed down from the tree asked, “Can I choose?”

After a lot of debate, Akash and Dharti chose an action film.

The movie was great and everyone had a great time.

* * *

“I don’t want Akash on my team,” sulked Rudra. “He can’t aim, throw or catch.”

“I can play,” said Akash his ears going hot.

Rudra who was piling up the seven flat stones, said “Okay, last chance, English boy.” Rudra took the ball and aimed at the pile of stones. He struck the pile and the stones toppled. It was while Rudra was making his way to the stump to pile up the stones that he heard a loud wail.

It was Akash...crying. The boys had hit him with the ball. Rudra was irritated. “I told you, you can’t play! You can’t play any of the games. Now you are crying also.”

“I hate these games. I hate all of you,” Akash screamed and ran into the house and hid under the bed.

Ajji had seen all that happened and went looking for the boy. She heard his sniffles under the bed. She sat on the floor and persuaded him out. “I know a game you will like; your mother loved it too.” Ajji brought out Chowka baara. She explained the game.

“It’s a cooler version of Ludo,” said Akash, his eyes brightening. Soon, he was playing like a pro with Ajji and his sister. Rudra came around and watched them play. He joined the game.

Akash lost. But Rudra grunted, “Well played, we will play again tomorrow.” Akash had lost this round, but he felt he had won.

358,2020/01/18,Saved by the alarm,"It was Atul’s 13th birthday. He looked adoringly at the stack of gifts he had received from his family and friends. But the best, as usual, he was sure, was the one given by Appa. What’s more, this time it would be more special since he had stepped into his teens, thought Atul excitedly.

He was, however oblivious to the financial crisis his parents were going through. He wanted something trendy and smart. But unfortunately, things didn’t go as expected.

When he opened his gift he was surprised. “Oh! He must have bought this at an exhibition that sells cheap imitations!” he said in disgust.

“A gift should be appreciated as a token of one’s love,” said Amma, trying to reason with him.

A few days later, he was invited to a friend’s birthday party. Everyone was excited about this party as the return gifts were always expensive.

That evening, the party was everything that they had expected with grand decorations and delicious food. Atul and his friends had a whale of a time. Before leaving, they were all given return gifts packed in beautiful boxes.

Atul waited for his father to pick him up. Unfortunately, his father called saying he was delayed as his bike had a puncture. After a while, unable to reach his father on his mobile, Atul decided to leave on his own hoping to catch up with him on the way.

Darkness having set in early, the street was deserted. Suddenly he realised that someone was following him. He panicked as the footsteps got closer. He turned around to see who it was and found a man just behind him. The man looked fierce and he tried to snatch the gift packet from Atul.

Danger ahead

When a terrified Atul tried to resist, the man took out a knife, threatening him to hand over the gift and all other belongings. Atul had little time to react. Gathering courage, he blurted out, “Look who’s behind you?” As the man turned around, Atul pushed him away forcefully and ran.

He hid behind a tree and watched the man searching for him.

Atul looked at his watch and realised that time was ticking. The watch had a small torch and an alarm attached to it. And, this was the gift his father had given him on his 13th birthday!

Atul had an idea. He shone the torch on the thief, and pressed the alarm button. A shrill whistle filled the air.

The powerful light and the loud whistle misled the man into thinking that a policeman was around. He ran away.

Atul came out of hiding and resumed his walk home. He was overjoyed when he saw his father.

Amma was right, thought Atul. One should appreciate the spirit in which a gift was given and not put a price on the gift. His father’s gift not only wonderful but had came to his rescue too. He felt bad for having disapproved of the gift earlier.

“Sorry, Appa,” said Atul as he climbed onto the bike.

“Why? I should be sorry for being late,” said his father.

“You won’t understand,” said Atul, flashing a smile at his puzzled father.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/wkkoal/article30592877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17YTTALESPIN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/saved-by-the-alarm/article30592878.ece
359,2020/01/18,Digital detox?,"So, the year has gotten off to the worst start ever. I have been put on a one month digital detox! And I have no one to blame for it but myself.

It started last year when I complained to my teachers about my eyes hurting. Of course, the eye ache was caused by getting hit by multiple spit balls (I know, gross) during a free period spitball fight, but it’s not like my teachers knew that. I got to miss a double period of History (take that Indus Valley Civilisation) and go to the sick room where I took a sweet nap. When I came home and told my parents about it, they were so concerned that I was allowed to skip homework ‘till I felt better’.

I know, I know. I shouldn’t have, but can you blame me for using this to my advantage? You understand, right? Well, every time I had more homework than I could handle, I got an ‘eye ache’. It was only till the end of the year I promised myself, and as a New Year resolution I vowed that I would stop using such underhand techniques to get out of homework.

Well, apparently the Universe thought I needed punishment. Over the vacation, my folks took me to the doctor to see if everything was okay with my eyes. At first, it was a standard appointment, you know where they make you look at that chart and read the alphabets? But then, the doctor said I needed to have my eyes dilated. Have any of you ever had your eyes dilated? No? Let me tell you what this form of torture is like.

Modern day torture

A perfectly nice looking nurse comes and adds drops to your eyes and then tells you to keep them closed for 35 minutes and sit still. My two least favourite things in the world: darkness and being told to sit still. I totally started to freak out, and okay, yes, maybe I overreacted a little bit, but you would too if you were in my situation. Amma kept telling me to stop acting like a weirdo which did not help. And then to make matters worse, she started to play Dragon Mania Legends on her phone on my account! I could hear her tickle my snow dragon!

Well after 35 minutes the doctor strapped me into another machine of torture, shone bright lights in my eyes and asked me a series of terrifying questions like ‘Look at my right ear lobe!’. After being subjected to all of this, he shared his verdict — diagnosis I mean: My eye balls were dry from excessive screen time and I would have to stop using a phone or tablet for a month! Four weeks! 120 days! 43,800 minutes! Many, many, many seconds!

I should have accepted my punishment and kept my mouth shut. But to get out of no screen time I told my mom the truth. No surprises what happened next: I got grounded too!

What they say is true, folks: crime doesn’t pay. And if you ask me, neither does honesty!",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/5byhtp/article30592517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17YTBUGBOYJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/children/digital-detox/article30592518.ece
360,2020/01/18,Exhibition of graphic art gets under way in Puducherry today,"An extravagant oeuvre of graphic art, ranging from paintings to calligraphy, maquettes and comics will be on show at Adishakti on Saturday.

The event, scheduled at 7 p.m., lights up the third lantern of ‘The Krr Krr Graphic Arts Festival’ initiated by Malavika PC, an artist who has set up a studio near Auroville, and features a pop-up exhibition, a performance and a special dinner.

The first was Vanam, an exhibition of 16 paintings at Maiyam Past Food in Kuyilapalayam and the second was Kudai Kaalam - Canopy Season, a collaborative installation of Manushi’s Tamil poetry and Malavika’s typography at the 150-year-old Thumbai House in Edayanchavadi.

Both venues can be visited by appointment till March.

The third part of the exhibition is peppered with representative past work of the artist while exploring graphic art through picture books from The Krr Krr Project, initiated in 2017 as an arts practice grant from the India Foundation for the Arts, Bengaluru.

Under the ‘Krr Krr’ project, Malavika has sought to redefine the idea of children’s book, its standard fairy-tale approach and the canonical understanding of their production where the children’s book is imagined to have a simplistic understanding of their surroundings.

The exhibits from two picture books will showcase paintings, drawings, prints, blocks, accordions, calligraphy, maquettes, collages, posters, comics, photographs, manuscripts, installations, sketch books, studies, stationery, tools, notes, practices, two abstract offset printed picture books and a selection of drawings from previous workshops that have defined the course of the artist’s exploratory journey. The performance of the night is an experiment called ‘The Ringarotus’, a long form drawing demo based on three hand-painted large-scale picture books. It explores the ways in which the eyes are habituated to pause, capture and make meaning, it explores the idea of studying length and abstractions in picture books.

Adishakti has planned the event as a family visit by throwing in a special dinner by Maiyam Past Food, a concept restaurant whose menu is dictated by organic flavours, hand-picked from home-grown soils.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ub7w6u/article30591759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18GRAPHICARTS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/exhibition-of-graphic-art-gets-under-way-in-puducherry-today/article30591761.ece
361,2020/01/18,Manju virattu a big draw at Kuyilapalayam village,"A festive spirit permeated Kuilapalayam, a nondescript village near the international township of Auroville as a large number of tourists, including foreigners flocked to the village square on Friday to catch a glimpse of the manju virattu or bull race event.

Tourists from countries in Europe turned up in large numbers in front of the local Ellai Pidariamman temple to watch the event.

Manju virattu, hosted by the hamlet for the last six decades, served as a grand finale for the three-day Pongal festivities. The event was a huge draw for the villagers. Unlike jallikattu, manju virattu does not involve taming the bulls.

The event commenced at 12.00 p.m. after pujas were performed at the temple. The deity was brought in a procession near the temple, where cattle, including bulls, cows and calves, from the surrounding 22 villages decked up with balloons, bananas and posters of actors were lined up for the race.

The bulls wkere let loose and made to run through the streets in the village. People including foreigners converged on both sides and cheered the bulls and clicked photographs

For Aurelie, a tourist from Switzerland, the event was full of fun with the cows beautifully decorated. “This is my first visit to Auroville. It is very nice to be here and see and experience the local traditions,” she said.

According to Srinivasan of Yatra Art and Culture Foundation, an organisation from Auroville, “The Pongal festival is very significant here as none of the villagers from the Auroville bio region celebrate such an event. Jallikattu and manju virattu is held on Maatu Pongal across Tamil Nadu. But in Kuilapalayam our forefathers celebrated the event on the day of Kaanum Pongal,” he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/m3gnxd/article30589926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18PONDYRACE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/manju-virattu-a-big-draw-at-kuyilapalayam-village/article30589927.ece

Ms. Bedi, who undertook a review of public infrastructure projects with heads of departments, also asked officials to strictly follow the timeline for completion of riverside walkway phase II.

Mahe MLA V. Ramachandra, Mahe Regional Administrator Aman Sharma and other officials participated.

Among the projects reviewed were completed and ongoing works including construction of the municipal town hall, reconstruction of the public library, repair works on the fishermen community hall, Mahe Riverside Walkway, repair works on the NH-17 and municipal roads.

The reviewed projects also covered work on the Boulevard road, upgradation of energy meters to smart devices, LED street lighting, installation of new transformers and repairs to the government school building.

Some of the novel initiatives undertaken by the administration were green protocol, micro composting sites, waste-to-energy initiatives and the Lahari Mukta Mahe campaign to make Mahe drug-free. Ms. Bedi also undertook visits to a few sites, including the riverside walkway.

Ms. Bedi suggested making optimum use of the Municipal Town Hall and to run a focused social message films every month at the venue free of cost for the public.

The Lt. Governor noted that Mahe administration had succeeded in generating more revenue, through sources like commercial tax, excise, transport, municipality & tourism sector. Mahe had saved ₹50 lakh through DBT in manure subsidy to farmers, undertaken other good practices such as digitisation of records of patta and online certification.

363,2020/01/18,Revised action plan on climate change stresses on saving water,"Transitioning to less water- intensive crops and groundwater conservation have been flagged as areas of emphasis while drafting the revised Puducherry State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) for the Union Territory.

Addressing a recent inception workshop for revision of the SAPCC, Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar underscored the need to include as priorities rejuvenation of ponds and waterbodies using traditional methods and harnessing solar energy.

Mr. Kumar, who chaired the session under the auspices of the Department of Science, Technology and Environment, sought emphasis on tackling pollution, tree plantation campaigns and greening the transport sector by promoting electrical vehicles.

The DSTE had prepared the draft action plan in 2013 which was submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change with the objective of mainstreaming climate change actions in the Union Territory’s planning process. This followed the Government of India releasing the first National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008 and subsequently tasking States to evolve sub-national plans by the States in 2009.

Challenges ahead

According to DSTE officials, the sub-national plans on climate policy are dynamic documents that need to be updated constantly. The challenges faced and learning therein from the planning and implementation of the first stock of the SAPCC prepared by the States and the Union Territories had necessitated their revisions especially in the light of the recent developments such as the Paris Agreement and India’s commitment under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).

The revised plans were being drafted in synergy with the goals of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) for post 2020 committed by the Government of India and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) taking into account recent scientific assessments and projections on global warming, vulnerability and impacts.

In Puducherry, the SAPCC was being drafted by the Puducherry Climate Change Cell in the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee, DSTE with technical support of UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi, had been engaged as consultant for conducting the required studies and preparing the report.

The DSTE would be incorporating feedback from various nodal departments on the proposed structure for the revision of SAPCC, the different chapter components and methodology to be followed therein, along with a proposed plan for stakeholder consultation in revising the SAPCC.

The inception workshop was led by Arjun Sharma, Secretary, Science, Technology and Environment; Smitha R., Director (Science, Technology and Environment); Atul Bagai, Head of Country Office, UN Environment Programme (UNEP); and R.R. Rashmi, Programme Director, Earth Sciences and Climate Change, The Energy Research Institute (TERI).

K.M. Abhijith and M.N. Jesil, students of the Barton Hill Government Engineering College, developed the smart collection centre, under the incubation centre at the college.

The set-up displays the amount of waste that has already been collected under each head as a graph database. Each of the six compartments, with a top-loading arrangement, has a capacity to collect 40 kilograms of waste at a time.

The location of the collection points and the material recovery facilities can be tracked using the city Corporation’s Smart Trivandrum mobile application.

The information about the amount of waste collected in each of the smart hubs can be tracked from the proposed control room at the Corporation office.

The students, who shared the experiences of the ongoing struggles in their respective universities, enlivened the proceedings with an extended version of the ‘azadi’ sloganeering, with the percussionists and the crowd joining them with matching energy.

Chandankumar from Jamia Milia Islamia University questioned why the Narendra Modi government was wasting crores of taxpayers’ money on pointless exercises like the NRC.

Dolan Samanta of Jawaharlal Nehru University said PM Modi was right in saying troublemakers could be identified from their clothes. She said the protesters believed in debate and discussion, while the State responded with violence. Aktharisa Ansari from Jamia said the intensity of the attack from the police, inside the university library and on the campus, showed the aim was not just to disperse, but to injure and create a war zone-like situation.

Amutha Jayadeep of JNU paid tributes to Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula who committed suicide three years ago on the same day.

366,2020/01/18,Take CAA stir to the next level: Shabnam,"Activist Shabnam Hashmi has called for the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to be taken to the next level, with the launch of a civil disobedience movement when the actual process gets going.

Speaking at ‘We the People’, a civic gathering here on Friday against the CAA and the NRC, she said convincing people to be part of such a movement was the most challenging part.

Road ahead

“While we celebrate the protests, it is important to reflect on what lies ahead. We have to go door to door, convincing people to not submit their papers when some official knocks on their doors. That will be the most difficult part for us,” she said.

The NRC and the CAA are going to affect not just Muslims but all the marginalised sections.

“It is important that farmers, workers, and various sections of women also continue protesting, along with the students. There is enough to protest against in every sphere of activity,” she said.

Ms. Hashmi said the awakening now was unlike anything seen in the country after the struggle for Independence. “We have to remember that irrespective of the resistance, the fascist State has not given in. We have to understand the actual strength of the protests and not romanticise. It is very important to understand that we are fighting a strong force, the RSS,” she said.

Criticising the Opposition for being ineffective in countering the Sangh Parivar, she said, “It is unfortunate that we did not see these kind of protests when Article 370 was repealed. It was the first major attack on our Constitution.”

When Nigel Pearson took over at Vicarage Road last month Watford looked doomed for relegation but he has put together a remarkable run of results to lift the club out of the relegation zone.

It is a different story for Jose Mourinho’s Spurs which, without the injured Harry Kane and with uncertainty over the future of Christian Eriksen, could be 11 points off fourth spot by the end of the day.

But Watford boss Nigel Pearson will feel his team should have wrapped up all three points after squandering some golden chances and captain Troy Deeney have his penalty saved.

Michael Gregoritsch scored on his Schalke 04 debut and helped set up the other goal as it beat second-placed Borussia Monchengladbach 2-0 on Friday as action in the Bundesliga resumed following the winter break. David Wagner’s team turned up the heat after halftime with Suat Serdar slotting in from a Gregoritsch pass in the 48th minute.

The Austrian, who joined Schalke during the winter break on loan from Augsburg, then finished off a fine break 10 minutes later, tapping in Benito Raman’s assist to lift Schalke to fourth place on 33 points.

368,2020/01/18,Premier League | Liverpool treading cautiously despite lead,"Liverpool can widen the chasm between itself and Manchester United to a staggering 30 points if it comes out on top in the battle between England’s two most successful clubs at Anfield on Sunday.

Jurgen Klopp’s men look destined to end a 30-year wait to win a top-flight title, with a 14-point lead over defending champion Manchester City plus a game in hand.

Klopp, however, that his team will be wary of United after being held earlier this season. The 1-1 draw between the teams in October was the only time the European champion has dropped points this season.

“Our team has winning mindset. We always think about the next game, we don’t look too far ahead,” said Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who has conceded just one goal in his past 10 games.

Rashford a doubt

The Brazilian number one will be confident of another clean sheet on Sunday, with United’s top scorer Marcus Rashford a serious doubt after lasting just 15 minutes as a second-half substitute in Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Wolves in the FA Cup.

But the striker will be given the maximum time to prove his fitness. “We will give him the absolute amount of time to find out,” said United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who will also be without injured midfielders Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, on Friday.

Liverpool, meanwhile, has been handed a double injury boost with defender Joel Matip and midfielder Fabinho both fit, Klopp said on Friday.

However, the league leader will be without defender Dejan Lovren (thigh) as well as midfielders Naby Keita (groin) and James Milner (thigh).

“Yes, it looks like Joel and Fabinho (will be back). They trained completely normally yesterday and the day before. So that means they are likely to be in the squad,” Klopp told a news conference.

Full of confidence

Solskjaer said fifth-placed United was heading into the clash full of confidence.

369,2020/01/18,"ISL | Bagan, East Bengal ready their arsenal ahead of derby","The oldest club rivalry of the continent will see another chapter getting added to its long and interesting history when the city giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal face off for the 368th occasion in 99 years, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.

With Bagan migrating to next season’s ISL, announcing a merger with the former champion ATK, this probably will be the last Kolkata derby of the I-League.

There is another derby scheduled in the return phase of the league but that match is unlikely to be held in the city or at the Salt Lake Stadium as its host East Bengal is reportedly looking for a cheaper alternative outside the city.

On the count of performance this season, Bagan is enjoying the momentum currently having won four, drawn two and lost just one in its last seven outings. This makes Bagan the current league leader and it will be looking to forge ahead this advantage against its traditional rival.

Interestingly, Bagan’s only loss so far has been against Churchill Brothers on December 8. Ever since, the Green-and-Maroon brigade under its Spanish coach Kibu Vicuna has won four and drawn one in an unbeaten run extending for the last five matches.

For East Bengal, the path so far has been quite bumpy as the team progressed haltingly winning two, drawing two and losing as many to tally eight points from six matches.

East Bengal, also managed by a Spanish coach in Alejandro Menendez, started the season well and the team enjoyed a brief stay on top of the standings. Things started going wrong in the new year as the team suffered consecutive defeats and lost its preeminent status to drop down to its present fifth position.

After a fairly moderate performance in the local Calcutta Football League, where it lost the crown to unheralded Peerless SC, Bagan seemed to have stepped on the gas when it came to performing in the national format.

The team has struck a nice balance with its young domestic recruits like Nongdamba Naorem, Subho Ghosh and Sheikh Sahil combining well with its foreign recruits like Fran Gonzalez and the play-maker Joseba Beitia.

East Bengal is yet to find the right combination among its ranks and will hope that the likes of Jaime Colado and Juan Mera tilt the balance in favour of the Red-and-Golds with their creative abilities.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bagan-east-bengal-ready-their-arsenal-ahead-of-derby/article30595091.ece
370,2020/01/18,ISL | Cuadrat questions quality of refereeing,"Bengaluru FC (BFC) chief coach, Carles Cuadrat, criticised his players for the mistakes at the back against Mumbai City FC (MCFC). Gurpeeet Singh and Harmanjot Khabra were at fault, resulting in two ‘gift goals’ in favour of the home team at the Mumbai Football Arena.

The defeat did not change the league placing for the second-placed visitor, which had a goal by Sunil Chhetri disallowed for off-side.

The Spaniard, prowling on the sidelines near the BFC bench, called for foreign referees in the Indian Super League (ISL) to ensure better decision-making.

Referee R. Shrikrishna had blown the whistle for off-side after seeing the linesman raise the flag, just before Chhetri twisted into position on the line near the left post for a shot high into the net from a difficult angle. Later in the game, the striker was shown the yellow card for dissent.

On BFC’s third loss in 13 games and the second in a row to MCFC this season, Cuadrat noted: “We made a few mistakes, but sometimes this happens in football. As I said before the game against Mumbai City, if you concede, it becomes very difficult because they are very good defensively and they try to go for the counter-attack.”

The coach added: “We gave them two presents, so congratulations to Mumbai (City) to receive so many presents. The referee was making a nice present (to MCFC) by not giving the goal to Sunil (Chhetri). I don’t understand... if I am in a winger position and can see it, this linesman cannot see that.”

BFC would have drawn level 1-1 had the goal stayed.

Cuadrat pointed out: “They don’t know the game. I am sorry (to state that). This week we have been in meetings, talking about what can everybody do to improve football in India. We have to bring foreign referees.”

Defensive blunder

His team went on to commit another defensive blunder, leading to the home team doubling the lead through Amine Chermiti. Modou Sougou headed in the first goal.

Responding to the success MCFC, coached by Jorge Costa, is having against the ISL champion, the Spaniard was blunt. “I don’t really think it was a very good game of football (for BFC), there was a lot of tension. Mumbai knew what they need to do. We had a plan too but after 1-0, it changed. Mumbai have a plan and it is working for them.”

He signed off on a humorous note: “I have been trying to change things in every game against Mumbai, to get the points but it is not happening. I will tell my defenders to try to reach the play-offs (from here) and try not to find Mumbai City in the play-offs.”

Costa’s side is now fifth with five wins in 13 games and within range of a place among the top-four.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rkf2cl/article30595735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19CUADRAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/cuadrat-questions-quality-of-refereeing/article30594506.ece
371,2020/01/18,Opposition parties will besiege Secretariat: Balabharathi,"Former CPI(M) MLA K. Balabharathi on Saturday said Opposition parties might besiege the Secretariat if the Tamil Nadu government failed to announced that the Citizen Amendment Act would not be implemented in the State.

Addressing the media after participating in a demonstration against CAA held at Kumbakonam, Ms. Balabharathi said 13 State governments had announced that they would not implement CAA and two, Kerala and Punjab, had filed litigation against the Act.

Since it was announced that the registration process would commence by April, the Tamil Nadu government should give an assurance that the Act would not be implemented in the State, failing which the Opposition parties would take a decision to besiege the Secretariat during the forthcoming Assembly session, she added.

Kumbakonam MLA K. Anbazhagan, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, Haja Gani and representatives from political parties such as Congress, CPI(M), Thamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi participated in the demonstration held near the old fish market.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/opposition-parties-will-besiege-secretariat-balabharathi/article30594771.ece
372,2020/01/18,PWD to finalise DPR on new barrage across Kollidam soon,"The Public Works Department has begun work on drawing up the design of the new barrage proposed between Thoothur in Ariyalur district and Vazhkai in Thanjavur district across the Kollidam.

It was one of the schemes recently announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to harness water during rainy season. The new barrage is aimed at storing at least at least one tmc of water so as to facilitate ground recharge to support drinking water supply to residents of Thoothur and Vazhkai and neighbouring areas.

Soon after the announcement, K. Satyagopal, Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Water Resources Conservation and Rivers Restoration Corporation, visited the proposed site at Thoothur. The State government subsequently allotted ₹25 lakh for carrying out investigation at the proposed site.

After conducting a number of studies in association with geologists, the planning and design wing of PWD is drawing up the design and structure of the proposed barrage. A team of PWD engineers of the wing based in Thanjavur have been tasked with designing of the new barrage.

“Various studies conducted at the site have shown positive results for constructing the new barrage between Thoothur and Vazhkai. A few models have been taken into consideration for designing the new barrage,” a senior PWD official told The Hindu.

The barrage will not only serve for storing water during raining season but also connect Thoothur in Ariyalur district and Vazhkai in Thanjavur district. There is a possibility for allowing vehicular traffic on the bridge. The design of the barrage is being drawn in such a way to allow vehicular traffic.

The barrage is one of the schemes proposed by the State government to harness water during excessive flow in the Cauvery and rainy season. The ground water table at Mayanur has gone up considerably after construction of a new barrage across the Cauvery. It facilitates the storage of about 1 tmc of water. Similarly, the Thoothur barrage can act as a tool to increase the ground water table in at at least 20 to 30 villages in Ariyalur and Thanjavur districts, the official said.

The estimate of the proposal will be arrived at after completion of the detailed project report. It is likely to be completed within one to two months, the official added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/pwd-to-finalise-dpr-on-new-barrage-across-kollidam-soon/article30594723.ece
373,2020/01/18,Musical tribute paid to Thyagaraja,"A musical tribute was paid to saint composer Thyagaraja at a function organised by Sri Thyagabrahma Sabha here on Saturday.

Sadguru Sri Thyagaraja Swamigal Aradhana began with a song in praise of Lord Ganesha and followed by pancharatna kritis — Jagadanandakaraka, Dudukugala, Sadhinchene, Kana Kana Ruchira and Endaro Mahanubhavulu — composed by Sri Tyagaraja Swamigal.

Supporting artistes such as violinists, mridhangam, ghatam and other instrument players stole the show with their performance though vocalists, most of them non-professional musicians such as Savithri Gopal, rendered the kritis from their heart.

Budding Carnatic musicians also took part in the event and rendered songs along with seniors. The audience also joined the musicians in singing the kritis. The pancharatna kriti rendering event was coordinated by ‘Thiruvaiyaru Brothers’ S. Narasimhan and S.Venkatesan.

After conclusion of the aradhana, a special music programme by vocalist, Abilash Giri Prasad of Chennai, supported by R. Ambika Prasad of Pudukottai in violin, G.

374,2020/01/18,Subway to be opened soon,"A subway between Golden Rock and Tiruverumbur railway stations, which is being constructed in place of a manned level crossing, will soon be thrown open to public use.

Construction of the subway at a cost of ₹5.13 crore began nearly six months ago after residents wrote to Southern Railway.

The work did not take long as pre-made hollowed concrete boxes were used. “Earthmovers took a few weeks to dig up the required area and a total of 16 of the concrete boxes were placed. Corrugated roofing sheets have been used over the subway,” a railway official said.

The subway came up to a length of around 25 metres covering all three tracks. “A special feature to be noted is that railway movement was not hindered at all. The subway is ready for use by the public, who had to earlier line up for at least 20 minutes causing traffic congestion in the area,” he said.

376,2020/01/18,Youth should take the lead in following road safety norms: Collector,"District Collector A. Md. Imtiaz highlighted the need for citizens to comply with the traffic rules to make roads safe, particularly when the number of accidents due to negligence is going up.

Mr. Imtiaz inaugurated the 31st National Road Safety Week celebrations by the police and transport departments at Maris Stella College here on Saturday. Mr. Imtiaz flagged off two road safety campaign vehicles.

“Compliance and enforcement of rules could bring down road accidents and make roads safe. The bigger responsibility lies on the citizens who need to comply with the safety rules from wearing helmets and seat belts to responsible driving. Enforcement of the rules comes next to compliance,” he said.

Mr. Imtiaz called upon youth to turn into agents of change and create awareness on the need for the following road safety rules.

“Road safety can be achieved through youth who have the power to bring change in the society,” he said.

He said that 31% of the accidents involving two-wheelers were fatal and most of the victims were youngsters. Youth should be responsible while driving by wearing safety headgear, fastening seat belts and particularly avoid rash driving, he added.

Helpline

Deputy Transport Commissioner S. Venkateswara Rao said that several road safety awareness campaigns would be organised during the week with focus on youth.

He said any issue that poses a threat to road users could be brought to the notice of the department by capturing and sending pictures or videos to 95482 00800 and immediate action would be taken.

378,2020/01/18,AG presents arguments in High Court hearing on petition against frequent Section 144 imposition,"Hearing on a petition against frequent imposition of Section 144 and alleged brutality by the police in the capital region villages against peaceful demonstrators was posted for January 20 by the High court.

When the petition come up for hearing on Friday, Advocate-General(AG) Subrahmanyam Sriram argued that all photographs submitted by the petitions as evidence had been analysed with accompanying videos and notes. He argued that the submitted photos could not be seen in isolation. All photographs filed by the petitioners were explained with comments and videos.

Photos in focus

Justice Satyanarayana Murthy asked several questions with regard to the photographs submitted to the court by the petitioners. The AG pointed to a few pictures and claimed that the photos were fake and morphed.

The AG argued that the march taken out in Mandadam village was permitted as per the AP Police manual.

He said that peaceful protest was not disturbed at any place. On January 10, an orchestrated effort was put to converge on Benz Circle and disrupt normal life and hence the police intervened. The State did not have a policy of condoning any police excess, the AG said.

With regard to imposition of Section 144, detailed counters are required to be filed, he said and sought ten days time. There was a call for laying of siege to the Assembly, the Collectorate and a jail bharo programme on January 20 and the police should have the liberty to deal with the situation in accordance with law, the AG argued.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ag-presents-arguments-in-high-court/article30591901.ece
379,2020/01/18,Here’s what you can expect from the Hyderabad Literary Festival 2020,"The 10th edition of Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF) will be held from January 24 to 26. The calendar event, as always, will witness book launches, author interactions, panel discussions, and book stalls. Beyond that, “there’s something for everyone” in the words of one of HLF’s four directors, Amita Desai.

New venue

After staying put at the Hyderabad Public School (HPS) since 2015, this year’s fest will move to Vidyaranya High School. “The dates of the literary festival clashed with an in-house event of HPS and we had to go for a new venue,” says professor T Vijay Kumar, a festival director. Vidyaranya was chosen for its central location and easy access. Vijay Kumar adds that a permanent venue in the city, similar to that of the Dilli Haat or the India Cultural Centre in Delhi, with all required amenities, would be ideal to host the festival.

Calling bookworms

Australia is the guest nation and Malayalam is the Indian language in focus in this year’s HLF, so expect dignitaries in both streams.

Manu S Pillai

This year’s line-up has established authors alongside emerging authors and poets — Manu S Pillai, Jerry Pinto, Andrew Whithead, Kala Ramesh, Sita Reddy and Serish Nanisetti, among many others.

Vijay Kumar, who has been closely associated with HLF since its inception, remembers the early years when the core team wrote to authors and publishers, hoping they would be a part of the lit fest. As the visibility grew, he’s glad to share that the tide has changed. “It’s a 1:4 ratio now, with we having to decline four resource persons (delegates/dignitaries) for every one author/poet we accommodate,” he says, adding that the HLF’s board of directors function autonomously, having complete discretion over whom they invite to host the sessions. A vetting process is followed in case of new authors and poets.

Any lit fest in the country tends to be compared to the biggest carnival of all, the Jaipur Literature Festival, and as Amita puts it, “We may not be a star-studded fest, but we have a line up of excellent speakers.”

Festival Fridays

Leading up to HLF’s turning 10, there have been outreach programmes organised as Festival Fridays in different venues in the last few weeks. “Despite our efforts in the past to promote the festival and let people know that they can attend it free of cost, we found that many aren’t aware of the fest. So this year we initiated the Festival Fridays and cultural partners such as the Saptaparni, Lamakaan, Our Sacred Space and Aaromale came forward and organised cultural events,” says Kinnera Murthy, another HLF director.

Fact file HLF 2020 is organised by the Hyderabad Literary Trust, in association with the Telangana government, and with the support of several academic, literary, cultural organisations and publishing houses.

Stall vendors do not use plastic bags and the lit fest takes an eco-friendly approach and minimises wastage.

A large part of the venue is accessible to wheelchair users. The HLF is ability sensitive and gender sensitive. Authors of different abilities LGBTQI+ members are also part of the line-up.

Where: Vidyaranya High School for Boys, opp. Telangana Secretariat

When: January 24 to 26

For the complete schedule and to enroll in workshops, check www.hydlitfest.org

Visitors to the previous editions would have noticed a large number of students from across the city attending the workshops — Nanha Nukkad for young children, Youngistaan for the pre-teens and teens, storytelling and slam poetry sessions. “We reach out to many schools, not just the elite ones. In 2019 we hosted 33 workshops and all of them were full,” adds Kinnera.

Crowd-funded festival

With the downturn in the economy making sponsors cautious, the HLF turned to the public and invited contributions through its website. “A few donors have been really generous and others have chipped in with smaller amounts,” reveals Amita. A crowd-funded model where literary enthusiasts pitch in, the HLF board feels, is the way forward.

Beyond books

Understanding that not everyone might be a literati, the HLF has been hosting events pertaining to art, theatre, music, cinema, and workshops. HLF 2020 will remember playwright and actor Girish Karnad through a session by The Little Theatre. A session will also pay tribute to writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen.

Vijit Singh’s theatre presentation will narrate the story of Delhi’s Mohd. Amir Khan who was falsely accused of being a terrorist, spent 14 years in prison before he was declared not guilty by court and released.

A conversational jugalbandi will delve into the conservation of Kerala’s art forms, Koodiyattam and Theyyam.

Since Malayalam is the language in focus, the Moving Images will screen Adoor Gopalakrishnan’s films Elippathayam, Mathilukal and the documentary Dance of the Enchantress.

Anuradha Kapur and Vidya Rao will present Banaras ka Thug, adapting Khwaja Ahmed Abbas’s story on stage, featuring actor Danish Iqbal on stage while Vidya presents the music.

Let’s tell stories

Storytelling is a full-fledged stream this year. There will be sessions for different age groups, in six languages — Telugu, Konkani, Hindi, English and Malayalam. The participating storytellers include author Jerry Pinto, Deepa Kiran, Santosh Mohan Veeranki with the Tale Tellers Troupe, Heta Pandit, Sarojini Gaonkar, Chamundeswari of ‘Katha Cheppava Ammamma’, the Dabaki group from Hyderabad, and artist Koeli Mukherji, among others. “The programming is done consciously to involve those who have different interests and in different age groups,” says festival director Ajay Gandhi.

380,2020/01/18,"In the mountains, you feel free: The IME Nepal Literature Festival","Do mountains have an inherent ability to unlock the artistic? I started chewing on this question the moment I looked out of the grimy window of the Buddha Air flight to Pokhara to glimpse the snow-dusted Himalayas stretching out like miles of sugar-dusted chocolate fudge. Mann’s Magic Mountain, Ray’s film Kanchenjungha, Caspar David Friedrich’s painting of the solitary wanderer standing above a sea of mist, all started buzzing in my head, setting the stage for the IME Nepal Literature Festival, where I was headed.

When I finally arrived at the venue, my heart leapt up and icicled immediately in the cold, like the thrashing fishtail-like form frozen in the sky that is Machhapuchhre, the glorious Himalayan peak that looms over Pokhara.

The IME Nepal Literature Festival was held from December 13 to 16 at the Pokhara lakeside. It seemed to be fuelled by youthful energy — young boys and girls browsed books, roamed around chatting animatedly, taking the mandatory groufie but also talking, listening to authors. The festival director, Ajit Baral, himself impressively young for his designation, spoke about the idea behind the fest: “We started the festival on a whim in Kathmandu back in 2011 — at that time we had very little idea of how difficult it is to run a festival, but the response from people was encouraging and that drove us on.”

Translation all the way

The team at the helm comprises writers, journalists, while Baral and his friend run a publishing house, Fineprint. He said, “If we hadn’t been into publishing, we wouldn’t have started the fest. We see a long-term interest in promoting authors, that, by generating interest in reading, expands the book market.”

The 2019 edition of the IME had attracted more attention because of its association with the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature — in the grand finale, writer Amitabha Bagchi got the award at a function attended by Nepal’s Foreign Minister. Baral hopes to build on this, to tap into the potential of Nepal as a neutral forum where writers from South Asian nations can talk freely about issues which they may not be able to discuss in their own countries due to political restrictions. So while many of the sessions in this edition were in Nepali, in future the fest may acquire a more international character.

Since translation is the only way the language gap can be bridged, it was discussed with urgency all through the IME. In the session, ‘Translating South Asia’, moderator Amish Raj Mulmi, himself an author and publishing professional, sought the advice of Arunava Sinha from India, Rifat Munim from Bangladesh and Carmen Wickramagamage from Sri Lanka (the latter two were part of the DSC jury) on how to take Nepali literature to the world through translation. A remarkable takeaway from the discussion was the similarity in the literary trajectory of these neighbouring countries — the spurt of translation in the 50s, 60s and 70s funded by Russia as its Progress/ Pragati Publishers translated Bengali, Malayalam, Sinhalese works into Russian and vice versa.

Memory and nostalgia

So a particular generation grew up reading Marx, Turgenev, Gorky in translation alongside the usual Famous Five, Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew in English, thanks to the colonial influence. In recent years, while Indian-writing in English and now regional-language literature translated into English have become a sizeable industry, the same is not true in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Nepal. As a fairly prolific translator, Sinha drew up a practical checklist that these nations could follow to take their literatures to the world.

If translations are opening up borders, the very opposite is happening at the political level not just in India but all over the world. Jeremy Tambling, former professor of literature at the University of Manchester and also one of the DSC jury members, analysed the nature of the parochial in the session, ‘Writing in the age of populism’.

He differentiated between nostalgia, “the wish for a state of affairs that never was” — which can be said to be the driving force behind, say, Brexit or the NRC — and memory, which “attempts to piece together that which really happened”, an effort to record the past objectively, warts and all. For him, populism is an appeal to fake emotions to make up for the poverty of real experience. The novel, an “expression of transcendental homelessness” as described by Marxist critic Georg Lukács, is the antidote to the imagined community of homogenous individuals conjured by nostalgia. It is the form that brings together exiles and the displaced, speaking in raucous polyphony to drown out homophonic narratives.

All these discussions seemed to lead naturally to the climax when Amitabha Bagchi’s Half the Night is Gone — a novel where voices of Hindi, Urdu poets, landowners, labourers, defiant women, browbeaten men fuse to narrate history as it happened, how it was felt in the bones rather than constructed in retrospect — got the DSC prize.

The festival had ended — the last rays of the sun oranged Machhapuchhre, the cold hardened its grip, and for one last time there in the mountains, I felt free. I am still holding on tight to that memory.

381,2020/01/18,"Come, and bring a pen: Applications are open for the International Writing Program, Iowa City","Last summer, 30 literary-minded young people from India, Pakistan and the U.S. met in the heart of the American Midwest, in Iowa City, the birthplace of the creative writing workshop, to participate in a unique cultural experiment. This was the International Writing Program’s (IWP) Summer Institute (SI), a fully-funded, immersive two-week creative writing and cultural exchange programme at the University of Iowa for university-age aspiring authors, designed to improve their craft and broaden their understandings of the worlds in which they write.

Focus on South Asia

All 30 of them had worked hard to be here, meeting a winter deadline for a sample of creative writing and a personal statement that formed the basis for selection. On this side of the Atlantic, we’d worked hard too, often staying up nights to read through the 1,000+ applications. SI’s goal is not simply to bring together individuals from the three countries who have exceptional creative writing prowess or potential. While a facility with words is high among the criteria for admission, SI is equally committed to convening a group of participants diverse in their backgrounds, personalities and life experiences.

Now, we’re looking for new applicants for the 2020 SI cohort — and we want to reach out to an even wider range of young people in India than last time. Here is a short overview of what makes the programme so exciting and unique — a glimpse, in other words, of what awaits you should you make it.

Ensuring SI is the place for dynamic literary learning and collaboration means organisers — in particular, the programme’s faculty — must provide ample space for the exploration of each individual’s identity as a writer.

This starts in the classroom, where attendees take part in master classes in the craft of writing, in collaborative workshops focussed on their creative work, and in discussions about Partition and its legacies.

These discussions naturally spill out into mealtimes, into walks by the river, and into friendships, conversations, and debates that we hope will last a lifetime. That’s because SI, unlike other summer writing camps and programmes, explicitly explores South Asian literature, culture, and history. Classroom discussions give focus to the complicated and challenging realities in and between Pakistan and India, past and present — and to the specific qualities of writing in the Subcontinent.

Critical thinking

When you come to Iowa, you join the ranks of a rich history in modern creative writing. The The program’s unique location on the University of Iowa campus means that those selected will quickly find themselves immersed in the literary community of Iowa City — a UNESCO City of Literature. Authors like Ann Patchett, Mo Yan, Orhan Pamuk, Kurt Vonnegut, Bharati Mukherjee, Abraham Verghese, and John Irving have studied and taught in Iowa City. SI attendees benefit from the workshop method developed at The University of Iowa, in which writers take turns sharing and reading, and then discussing their work critically with classmates.

Absorbing the merits of this method and practising it for two weeks with SI’s talented instructors, participants will depart the programme with new ways of thinking about their individual writing processes.

Much of the energy of the programme comes from our incredible mentors. In 2020, Chandrahas Choudhury (India), Anam Zakaria (Pakistan), and Dini Parayitam (U.S.) will lend their talents to the programme.

In addition to teaching lessons on craft and working one-on-one with attendees on their creative work, the mentors will devote time and attention to the SI participant’s writing development once they leave Iowa City. Attendees will engage in fruitful discussions about how they can begin pitching and publishing their writing within and beyond their respective countries.

The IWP provides a space for two equally very important things to have happen. First, attendees will come to see writing as a form of action, a personally empowering skill that can be employed for social change. Second, through time spent together and a shared love for writing, they will find deeper lines of understanding and empathy for one another and for those like and unlike themselves.

The IWP is looking for 30 more promising young writers who are over 17 and under 23 to be a part of SI 2020. Together, we can create the place for dynamic literary learning and collaboration between promising young writers from India, Pakistan, and the US. Applications are due March 1, 2020 at 12:00 midnight, Iowa time.

382,2020/01/18,The inheritance of flaws: What Indian bildungsromans tell us about our nation,"Somewhere in the collective Indian sensibility lives the image of our parents caressing each other while we the children feign sleep. Did it really happen, or was it a book or a film? That is where social class happens. For the comfortably middle-class and above, this may very well be an experience gathered from a telling text, about less-privileged children who fight for space in small rooms.

I’ve often wondered if privacy is a condition of privilege. What does it take for life outside to ram down on our inner space, to make everything private charged with the urgency of the public? The American literary critic Fredric Jameson thought that was true of the entire “third world”. For the good Marxist that he was, this is the heroic insight of the third world that was missing in the rich and spoilt first.

In an influential 1986 essay, ‘Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,’ Jameson argued that private and public lives are fused in the third world, which leads all narratives from this world to become national allegories, no matter how private they appear to be. Many critics pointed out the flaws in this sweeping argument. But the crowning vindication of Jameson’s argument had already appeared. It was Salman Rushdie’s novel Midnight’s Children. It told the story of Saleem Sinai, who, born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, grew up to make a bildungsroman that wasn’t just his own story but the story of independent India.

Mostly male, always white

The bildungsroman, combining bildung, or education, and roman, the novel, is the novel of personal development. It usually begins in childhood and narrates the growth and development of the key character, sometimes all the way to early adulthood, signalled by the end of formal education, marriage, or getting a job. The genre became popular in 19th century European literature, and novels such as Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship usually featured protagonists who were mostly male, and always white.

The Italian literary critic, Franco Moretti, pointed out that the bildungsroman usually involved the journey of a young man from the provinces to a major city. The journey is not his alone; his desire for development mirrors the aspiration of an entire nation. To leave the village or small town, to arrive at success in the big city: all this echoes the ambition of a community and a nation to become successful and modern.

Several iconic bildungsromans from modern English literature reveal this fusion of the private and the public. At the end of D.H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers, Paul Morel leaves the poor Nottingham mining village of his origin for a trek to the big city. James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artistas a Young Man is a künstlerroman — the bildungsroman of an artist — and is driven by the anxiety that no artistic success can be obtained in provincial Dublin.

At the end of the novel, the hero, Stephen Dedalus, leaves for Paris, then the cultural capital of Europe.

Condition of privilege

But what about Jameson’s “third world”? What about India? Has the bildungsroman here always reflected the nation and its aspirations? I feel it is a crucial question for the novel in English, running through the years of colonialism, anticolonial resistance, and postcolonial development. Young children, their growth, development and education, have made for compelling and iconic stories. Between R.K. Narayan’s Swami and Friends, The Bachelor of Arts, and The English Teacher, Swami, Chandran and Krishna make up the trinity of boys-to-men who grow and flourish among life’s joys and heartbreaks.

But growth is a condition of privilege that is not extended to all in India’s sharply stratified society. Mulk Raj Anand’s Coolie is a tragic anti-bildungsroman where the orphan Munoo makes the proverbial trek from a village to Bombay in search of prosperity, but on account of his poverty and helplessness, suffers mistreatment and misfortunes and dies as a teenager. The promise of personal development is indeed hard to come by in a poor, colonial country.

For the women, it is an even more elusive promise. Kamala Markandaya’s Nectar in a Sieve is the recollections of Rukmani, an old woman, on a long life of hardship beginning at the age of 12. Under poverty, natural disasters and human hostility, it is a life of work without hope, or as Coleridge called it, nectar in a sieve, that reminds us that growth is not just a function of time but also of privilege.

Down the decades, one senses a growing anxiety in the independent nation to tell its story. The 80s deepen the parallels between nation and private lives. Anita Desai’s Clear Light of Day chronicles the troubled growth not merely of individuals, but of a family, set in the tumultuous years of Partition and beyond. The crumbling destiny of Old Delhi and the burgeoning trajectory of New Delhi become the pointed edge of what Jameson has called the national allegory. The crowning text in this genre, Midnight’s Children, would appear the following year, in 1981, proving Jameson right like never before.

Amit Chaudhuri, who called Midnight’s Children a “Nehruvian epic” that “coincided, oddly, with the beginning of the end of Nehruvian India,” crafted minute, fractured bildungsromans in his first two novels, A Strange and Sublime Address and Afternoon Raag. His work was followed by other growth stories of delicate and unpredictable kinds, ranging from Rohit Manchanda’s evocative novel In the Light of the Black Sun, set in the coal-districts of Bihar, Sunetra Gupta’s Woolfian fiction of nuanced personal development, and Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, the story of a young Brahmin boy in Benaras.

Fled is that dream

The novel about the growing child has long fascinated me. It chronicles the wild and dreamy texture of childhood, its primal pleasures and terrors, and the way it unleashes the violence of education. For a writer in a fascinating, maddening, impossible country like India, I’ve come to feel that the aspiration for growth is more likely to be richly stunted than predictably successful.

Anand etched this tragic arc with Bakha and Munoo early in the century. In Indra Sinha’s Animal’s People, set in a Bhopal two decades after the Union Carbide gas tragedy, the young protagonist is called Janwar, or animal, a spirited boy who is born disabled thanks to the toxic aftermath of the tragedy, and can only move on all fours. Tragically, it recalls my favorite anti-bildungsroman from the diaspora, Akhil Sharma’s Family Life, where a freak accident curtails the growth of a boy and throws into ironic relief the bildung of his younger sibling, who grows up next to him, in pain and guilt.

If Rushdie’s iconic book evoked the Nehruvian secular socialist republic, we’ve finally arrived at a nation where we have inherited the loss of that dream. As the aspiration of that fair, tolerant, and peaceful nation slowly dies, our most recent bildungsromans play out the fear and nightmare. Abdullah Khan’s moving novel Patna Blues chronicles the aspiration of a provincial youth from a small town and the way in which it gets entangled in an illicit romance across the darkest religious divide in India today.

And at a time when India has bared itself as no nation for women through an unprecedented wave of sexual violence, the just-published novel Not Just Another Story by Jhimli Mukherjee-Pandey narrates a story of growth that replaces the trajectory of progress with a hopeless, inter-generational cycle of enslaved sexual labour — three generations of female sex workers in Kolkata’s iconic red-light district, Sonagachhi.

At the end of the second decade of the second millennium, is India even ready to imagine the horrors of how deeply we have fallen from the fractured aspirations of 1947? Perhaps only our smothered novels will tell.

383,2020/01/18,Through the painted door: Erin Morgenstern’s ‘The Starless Sea’ reviewed by Latha Anantharaman,"Probably every book lover fantasises about a library we never have to leave, with deep armchairs to lose ourselves in, food brought up as we need, and a place to flop into an exhausted sleep. In Erin Morgenstern’s second novel, The Starless Sea, there is such a place, not quite a library, but a labyrinth far below the earth in which countless stories are preserved. It is furnished with silks, upholstery and felines reminiscent of Angela Carter’s opulent narratives. There are acolytes and guardians to keep it all in good trim, and a polite but suspicious Keeper ready to help you out, often literally. The trouble with this fantastic storehouse of stories is that you are often not able to leave.

All meta

But let’s start with the first story, about a pirate imprisoned and facing execution. The night before he is to be killed he escapes with the girl who has come to bring him food. She asks him to tell her a story. The pirate is a metaphor, we are told. It’s metaphors all the way down into the bowels of this novel. It’s all meta, for that matter. Because soon we read the story of a fortune teller’s son faced with a door painted on a wall, a door that disappears the next day. And in the next chapter it is that boy, now grown up, who finds this book and is reading it. Zachary Ezra Rawlings is this man — the reader and the read.

Zachary is a second-year masters’ student of Emerging Media Studies, writing his thesis on video games, but sometimes, before

the term really gets started, he likes to goof off and read a book. It is an idle visit to the library that puts in his hands the odd book that recounts his own story. That evening he meets friends for a chat on video games. But they stray into the differences between video games and digital novels, where you choose alternative arcs, and into what makes a story compelling. Change, says one student. Mystery. High stakes. Character growth. Romance. And so on. So by page 35 the reader has a good idea what’s to come.

That kind of scene makes one suspect all of this was mapped out at a creative writing workshop somewhere in Maine, but Erin Morgenstern is a crafty writer and knows how to send her hero out on a quest. Zachary is intrigued, persuaded, seduced and intimidated by various characters until he ends up again in front of a painted door. This time, he opens it.

Enter the labyrinth

The painted door that actually opens, and opens for one person but not another, is not a new idea. It is as classic as the Road Runner. From Through the Looking Glass and The Chronicles of Narnia we know there are entire worlds behind a deceptively flat surface. In fact, we know it each time we pick up a book, an object sometimes less than an inch deep that draws us into a parallel universe.

So it is with this novel. Morgenstern packs in what look like one-off tales that ultimately fit into each other. One is the exquisite fable of the Sun and the Moon meeting each other in a place far from the eyes of mankind. Another is the story of the key collector who gathers lost keys and one day disappears.

Once Zachary begins wandering in the harbour on the Starless Sea, which is where the painted door leads him, he does not just explore, he intervenes. His storyline crosses the storylines of all those other people wandering the harbour. There are the lovers who struggle to find each other across time periods. Each time they cross a threshold there is a promise of reunion, but also the threat of another parting. The acolytes and guardians fight to preserve a disintegrating world. And behind it all are Time and Fate themselves, long separated but destined to reunite.

Like many fantasies, the novel becomes exhausting at times, as we try to remember, backtrack, and gather increasingly tangled narratives in our hands. Morgenstern can fully realise a character, no doubt, considering the emotion she stirs up with her individual fables, about the Sun and the Moon or about Time and Fate, but the light between the hero and his beloved is written rather than felt. Still, she does much more than tick the boxes she set up back on page 35. The quest is complex and unpredictable, the hero is worthy, the writing is a feast.

The novel progresses from quest to much more, till the book lover begins to question her fantasy of a labyrinth of stories. The story that does not end becomes a prison. We all must come back to our own world, where the sun rises and sets as expected and the sea reflects the stars in the sky.

384,2020/01/18,‘Reset – Regaining India’s Economic Legacy’ review: Flawed policies and a prescription for the future,"As a Harvard trained economist, whose work in Index Numbers with Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson is considered a seminal contribution in helping gauge macro-economic performance, Subramanian Swamy is clearly well placed to comment on the current state of India’s economy. In Reset: Regaining India’s Economic Legacy, Swamy additionally dons the mantle of economic historian as he seeks to lay out his case for what ails the economy and what needs to be done to engender a ‘renaissance’.

Over the best part of his 200-page book, the economist-politician looks back at the last 150 years of the country’s economic journey to flesh out the consequences of the economic ideologies adopted from 1870 through to 2019. While it is well established that Britain’s imperial exploitation of its numerous colonies left the colonial economies in varying degrees of disrepair, Swamy asserts that “by bleeding agriculture to the bone, exporting and draining national resources estimated at $71 trillion at current prices, and by blocking native innovation, the British rule set India two centuries back in development.”

In the first chapter ‘Imperialism Uproots Agriculture’, the author provides an interesting narrative of the extent to which Britain’s exploitative “revenue-extracting zamindari system” took a toll on India’s peasantry and the agriculture sector as a whole. Also, as someone who has studied the Chinese economy closely and written a fair amount on it, Swamy makes frequent and fairly compelling comparisons between the pre-independence economic trajectories of China and India, particularly in farm output. While in 1950, around the time that the two countries founded their new republics, China had a comfortable food surplus enabling it to finance rapid industrial growth, India’s two-century-long decline in foodgrain yield left it lacking such a cushion.

It is the second period, extending for four decades from 1950 that attracts the most trenchant criticism from the author, who makes no bones about his complete disdain for the socialist ideology that informed the economic policies of the era. Terming the Soviet command economy model with its focus on planning as ‘The Albatross around India’s economic neck’ Swamy is emphatic that it was this flawed policy approach that caused a “monumental loss of opportunity”.

Socialism, the economist submits, means a large government that needs finances through heavy taxation. “And nothing kills incentive as unthinking taxation does,” he writes. For contrast he cites Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore where the governments based their economic strategies on “incentives based on reasonable taxation of the individual.” And while acknowledging the roles of former Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and P.V. Narasimha Rao in the first wave of reforms of 1991 that helped free the economy from the restrictive shackles of the preceding years, Swamy (who served as commerce minister in the short-lived government headed by Chandra Shekhar) interestingly credits himself as the author of the reform proposals that opened India’s trade sector to the world.

Key remedy measures

But it is in his prognostication of the economy’s current trajectory that the national executive member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulls no punches. In a ‘tailspin’ since the “monumental blunder” of demonetisation in 2016, Swamy is emphatic that the economy is on the verge of a “serious crisis or crash.” With loads of data, backed by tables and graphs, the economist highlights multiple pressure points that have hobbled the Indian economy, most notably agriculture. Prescriptions to remedy the situation range from the seemingly straightforward to the radical. The key ones include abolishing income tax so as to incentivise savings, fixing the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar at ₹50, abolishing participatory notes and invoking a UN resolution to facilitate the repatriation of $1 trillion in black money hoarded abroad and the printing of rupee notes to fund infrastructure projects while suspending fiscal deficit targets.

Aside its excursions into the esoteric domain of “integral humanism”, which reflects the author’s abiding association with the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Reset offers an alternative perspective on the Indian economy — past, present and future.

385,2020/01/18,‘Women in Masjid: A Quest for Justice’ review: Injustice in the name of faith,"In the first winter rains, shortly after my father’s death, I felt a desperate need to visit his grave. To see if the grave was intact, that the earth hadn’t sunk in the kuchha grave. In a sad, inexplicable sort of way, also to assuage my guilt for being alive, warm and dry while he slept the eternal sleep under mounds of wet, cold earth. As I entered the graveyard, head covered, I was accosted by a bearded man who berated me for entering the graveyard knowing ‘full well’ that women ought not to. Locked up as I was in my own private misery, head down and tears streaming down my face, this reprimand from a rude stranger summed up everything I dislike most about misconceived religiosity and the uncouth patriarchs who practise it. Something snapped inside me as I told him that, before he dies, he must instruct his wife and daughter to not visit his grave, and that he should leave me alone to do as I deem fit.

Unpleasant run-ins

I was reminded of this and several other equally unpleasant run-ins with self-proclaimed upholders of faith as I read Zia Us Salam’s excellent book Women in Masjid: A Quest for Justice. Timely and important, it is a clarion call for Muslims to seize control of their religion and belief systems, to wrench it away from jaahil (ignorant) maulanas and to weed out all accretions, no matter how seemingly benign. More than ever before, the Muslim ummah must negotiate the choppy waters of tradition and modernity while steering a clear path towards a better understanding of their religious practices.

Drawing upon close readings of the Koran and Hadith, Salam makes a compelling argument: both men and women are enjoined to ‘establish’ prayer and the rewards, be they for prayer, fasting or charity, are the same for both. Spiritual aspects aside, the evident benefits of prayer, namely inculcating a sense of discipline, hygiene and piety, not to mention nimbleness of body, are the same regardless of gender.

After all, men and women from the world over pray at the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Masjid-al Nabawi in Madina during Haj and Umrah. Why, then, do women stay away from mosques and funeral prayers in the Indian subcontinent? Why, then, are they severely castigated from going to graveyards and Sufi dargahs in our part of the world? After all, a religion that gave women the right to seek education, the right over their own earning, to pay zakaat (poor due), to give or withhold consent for marriage, has also given them the right to pray in mosques.

As Salam, a prolific author, social commentator and journalist, notes: “Women in Masjid is a small attempt at righting a historical wrong... an attempt has been made to project the reality of women’s rights and responsibilities in Islam, drawing from the reservoir of history and religion.”

Urging women to “reclaim the space they have surrendered,” the book is an eloquent plea for men to “stand up against this injustice perpetuated in the name of faith.”

386,2020/01/18,‘The Unquiet River’ review: Bends in the river,"On September 26, 2018, two 1,000-tonne barges carrying fly ash reached Dhubri in western Assam after setting sail from Kahalgaon in Bihar on August 20. The 1,885-km journey was touted as a milestone — cargo transport on such a scale had never been attempted across two of the country’s largest river systems, Ganga and Brahmaputra. The government has bigger plans for waterway renewal on Assam’s mighty river.

Brahmaputra National Waterway II, an 890-km stretch from Sadiya in upper Assam to the Bangladesh border, is envisaged as a corridor that could position the State as the gateway to Southeast Asia. Mirroring ambitious Chinese projects, efforts are also under way to tap the steeper gradient and frenetic flows of rivers originating in the eastern Himalayas for hydroelectric power, starting with the lower Subansiri dam whose construction resumed this year after public protests put it in deep freeze for eight years.

Lifeblood of a region

The idea of harnessing the river to unlock the region’s economic potential has preoccupied colonial and pre-colonial governments too, though the accent was more on extending acreage in the floodplains and facilitating the movement of men and material. But can nature and natural formations be bent at will without the attendant consequences?

Historian Arupjyoti Saikia pieces together an intimate biography of the Brahmaputra to urge caution. The cause of many a woe in the eponymous valley inflicted by floods every other year, he argues the Brahmaputra has also been the region’s lifeblood, central to its political and material well-being right up to the mid-20th century. And elaborate plans to confine the river to a single channel trained into a series of easy bends have inevitably been swallowed by its swirling waters.

Using the longue durée (‘long term’) approach of the Annales school of history writing, Saikia pieces together the ebb and flow of the majestic river from its prehistoric origins right up to the present day.

The earlier sections, for lack of historical records, rely primarily on geology and archaeology to trace the river’s changing course over millennia and the history of human settlement from Neolithic times. While early settlers and scattered attempts to bring land under reclamation are found by the 2nd century BC and 11th century AD respectively, the first rush towards the river basin took place during the long rule of the Ahom dynasty (1228-1826 AD).

The British takeover in 1826 AD, and the need of the colonial state to maximise revenue, finally transformed the floodplains into an optimally populated and cultivated space.

From the vantage point

Saikia’s narrative puts the river at the centre of Assam’s history, gazing at unfolding events from the vantage point of the waters as the connecting thread between the lowlands and the hills. He illustrates the centrality of riverine transport to the local economy and its interface with regional and international commerce, a position dislodged only in the early 20th century with the arrival of an elaborate network of surface transport in the form of roads and railways.

The human is only an element in the interdisciplinary sweep that includes exquisite sections on the craft of boatbuilding, the now defunct art of gold washing on the upper reaches of the river, and the entry of the steamer that opened up possibilities of scaling up commercial cultivation of tea from the 1830s.

Waves of human migrations

Steamboat navigation also facilitated newer waves of human migrations, this time westward, from rural districts of eastern and central India to bridge the labour deficit in the plantations (a community now known as the ‘tea tribes’) and from present-day Bangladesh to cultivate jute and rice in the virgin agricultural frontiers of the lower Brahmaputra Valley.

Human habitation and natural disasters in a seismic zone exacted a huge toll on flora and fauna. The author notes the gradual disappearance of crocodiles from the river and tigers from the grasslands, the reduced habitat for the hoolock gibbon, as also the millions of fish that died in the 1897 and 1950 earthquakes that raised the Brahmaputra riverbed. The clearance of forests in the uplands to fashion a manicured landscape of plantations affected the subsoil system; extensive domestication of Camellia sinensis not only changed the wild tea plant but also sparked pestilence.

Living force

The Unquiet River is much more than a seminal contribution to environmental history. The story of the Brahmaputra it unravels is one of an unbridled river that has resisted taming, breaching embankments with yawning regularity.

As the modern Indian state seeks techno-bureaucratic solutions to yoke the river into service of the nation, the governing idea is of power generation, not flood prevention. Re-engineering a living force that has shaped the destinies of people over millennia through dams, run-of-the-river projects and dredging is fraught with consequences. Heed Saikia’s cautionary note.

387,2020/01/18,The kingdom of salt and silence: Review of Benyamin’s ‘Al Arabian Novel Factory’,"Tyranny breeds fear and despair. It can be a blatant or a secret celebration of violence. In Benyamin’s Al Arabian Novel Factory, it assumes a simmering intensity as the author breaks apart the illusion of pluralism, piece by piece, part by part. No matter how the world perceives it or the media spins it, he documents the angry dance of despotism — the baiting and detention, trials and torture chambers, mass disappearances and casual executions. And as the atmosphere sinks in, you can’t escape that suffocating sense of foreboding, that sudden flash of fear, as you recognise its uncanny resemblance to post-CAA India.

City blights

Al Arabian Novel Factory unravels in a nameless Arab country referred to as the City, a land where an authoritarian regime is using brute force to subdue the sparks of Arab Spring. The story is narrated through the POV of Pratap, a Keralite-turned-Canadian-citizen working with Toronto Sunday. James Hogan, his editor, offers him “an amazing opportunity to break new ground” by researching the geography and sociology of 17 West Asian countries from Egypt to Iran. He learns that an acclaimed author, who prefers to stay anonymous, has outsourced the work of assembling raw material for his latest novel. He soon joins a team of researchers who all land in the City to explore its soul.

Every team member has his own reason to choose the city, Pratap’s being Jasmine, his long-lost love. While Londoner Edwin is enticed by the legends of the Mesopotamian desert, Vinod Chopra, an Islamophobic Indian journalist, is there following Priyanka, “a woman who carries a storm of lust inside her”. Riyaz Malik, a Pakistani scribe and the fourth member of the team, has an air of secrecy. The narrative evolves through their pursuits as they wander the galis dotted with mosques and minarets in search of real and private testimonials. And at the heart of the plot is a mysterious book penned by a Pakistani radio jockey, connecting Al Arabian Novel Factory to its prequel, Jasmine Days.

Enveloping fear

The author shows how unrest spreads like wildfire in a state through an arsenal of brutal tactics. The Sultan and

his secret state police are busy silencing the dissidents and eroding civil freedom. Usual targets include activists, journalists and officials who have fallen out of favour, along with the second-class citizens of Shia Muslims. “Fear has enveloped the city like morning fog,” Pratap observes. It’s a kingdom where all democratic indicators are reduced to random tropes and the chance to engage in free discourse is zilch. The monarch commands an army of plainclothes policemen and CID officers: at one point Edwin wonders if there is anyone in the City who is not a double agent or spy.

The City also has a horde of loyal Malayali migrant who sing paeans to His Majesty, conveniently ignoring the dark backstage drama. For them the protesters are just a bunch of rowdies and religious fanatics.

Wave of unease

Then you are introduced to the Arab version of cartoons that depict Tom as an impoverished local and Jerry as an invading foreigner. Tom accuses Jerry of trying to snatch his ancestral land and solemnly swears to protect what belongs to his forefathers. The City is also home to bar dancers and suicide squads, a place where Pratap meets men who smell like salt and sadness. It has human bombs who wrap their penises in protective gear for the 72 beautiful virgins waiting in heaven.

Faisal, a 24-year-old driver belonging to the Shia faction, has several wounds that refuse to heal. He is beaten up with a cane and electric baton and then his tormentors pour acid over his wounds to keep them infected. His crime is that he wanted a passport. “Am I not a human being?” he asks.

Jasmine is an elusive presence in the novel though Benyamin tries to navigate the nuances of man-woman relationship through her and another couple. Perumal is threatened by Pratap’s sudden proximity to his wife, but he blames social media for it, insisting that Facebook mirrors one’s heart. He says social networking sites are like “devils whispering in women’s ears that there is a universe of happiness waiting for them beyond their husband.”

The novel, translated from the Malayalam by Shanaz Habib, has no chapters but nine sections with brief pieces thrown together. At some points the narrative meanders into the labyrinth of philosophy and political discourse, but easily springs back from the docu-fiction mode to a more engrossing tempo of storytelling. Benyamin is not an author who indulges in purple prose, nor has he ever attempted idiom-dripping poetry. It’s often some thematic quirk that defines his work and Al Arabian Novel Factory is no exception. But unlike Goat Days, which offered a slow-burning catharsis, this one explodes into a wave of unease as the din in the City reminds you of crowds chanting azadi. But above all, Al Arabian Novel Factoryshows how obscene silence can be in times of strife and resistance.

388,2020/01/18,Centre waives green clearance for onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration,"The Environment Ministry has exempted oil and gas firms, looking to conduct exploratory drilling, from seeking an environmental clearance. The clearance is for both on-shore and offshore drilling explorations and the process is an ecologically-intensive exercise that involves digging multiple wells and conducting seismic surveys offshore.

Until today, even exploratory surveys have merited the highest level of environmental scrutiny — called category ‘A’ — that required project proponents to prepare an environment impact assessment (EIA) plan, have it scrutinised by a Centrally constituted committee of experts and subject the proposal to a public hearing involving the local residents of the proposed project site. While public hearings, even for category A projects are frequently exempted if they are offshore, the new amendments demote exploratory projects to the category of ‘B2’. This means it will be conducted by the States concerned and will not require an EIA. The move is part of a larger process of ‘decentralisation’ by the Centre in that it seeks to farm more regulatory actions to State and local units. Environmentalists aver that this can mean lax oversight.

Developing an offshore or onshore drilling site as a hydrocarbon block will however continue to merit a “category A” treatment, the Ministry notification, made public on January 18, clarifies.

In 2019, the ONGC and the Vedanta group were granted permission to conduct exploratory oil surveys in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and this had led to protests led by the Opposition DMK and the Congress, which argue that the exploratory drilling will lead to destruction of agricultural fields in the Cauvery delta.

Neduvasal controversy: the story in pictures

Chennai-based environment activist Nityanand Jayaraman has argued that offshore drilling operations can possibly effect fish, lead to a build-up of heavy water contaminants, disorient whales and sea life that rely on sonar for navigation and exacerbate the risk of oil spills.

“This is part of a continuing trend by the larger lack of oversight by the Environment Ministry,” said Debi Goenka, of the Conservation Action Trust and who deals with coastal ecology issues.

The government in 2019 relaxed rules that incentivises companies conducting oil exploration surveys in less-explored oil fields to keep a greater share of revenue if they chance upon viable hydrocarbon blocks. This has led to a spurt in interest in oil and gas exploration with the Cauvery basin registering a spurt in activity.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/business/x9cppm/article23713047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ONGC-gathering-station,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/centre-waives-green-clearance-for-onshore-and-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration/article30595276.ece
389,2020/01/18,Live like an otter,"“A family that poops together stays together,” says Atul Borker. “That may as well be the motto of smooth-coated otters.” Spraint, as otter faeces is called, is often said to be aromatic like jasmine tea. The excreta of smooth-coated otters, however, has no floral overtones but instead has a “refreshing” fishy odour, he says with the aplomb of a perfume connoisseur. He ought to know, having sniffed hundreds to gauge their freshness.

Easing themselves at designated sites is hygienic behaviour no doubt, but such latrines are territory markers. To neighbouring clans, the sight and smell mean ‘No Trespassing’. The larger a clan, the longer the stench lasts, and the more dominant the family. But these olfactory warnings don’t always deter others.

With shrinking habitats, even dominant families cannot maintain an exclusive hold over their enclave. Dams, pollution, and sand mining squeeze these semi-aquatic mammals out of many stretches of riverbanks into a few remaining ones. In fact, 95% of smooth-coated otters in Goa live in brackish mangroves, says Borker. Some have colonised a rocky island 10 km offshore of Karwar, where they delight scuba divers. As suitable terrain diminishes, neighbours sneak in when the owners are elsewhere.

Newborn otter pups learn the etiquette of using latrines from their parents and siblings, says the researcher. While older ones poop within a well-defined area, the young go all over the place. As they grow, they take a dump with the others, creating an odorous signpost advertising their family’s domain.

Together they stand

Besides pooping in unison, otters reinforce their familial relationships by physical contact. They rub and roll against one other, and even when they have the space to sprawl out, they pile up together. This bond makes up for their small 10-kg body size, giving them the confidence to take on larger adversaries.

A would-be poacher learnt this to his chagrin. The overworked and underpaid sand-miner confessed to Borker later that he figured catching an otter pup and selling its hide would earn him a packet. As he approached a youngster through waist-high water, its mother leapt into the river and latched on to his groin. He thrashed his stick but couldn’t connect with the underwater assailant. Only when its offspring swam away to safety did the adult let go. The man was lucky he didn’t suffer any lasting injuries, says Borker. “Otters may look cute, but they can get aggressive when protecting their family.”

These close family ties make the researcher reluctant to study them with radio transmitters as he would have to catch them. He worries the closing door of a trap cage may injure an otter pup following an adult. Darting with tranquilizer is out of the question because the otters could drown.

Identity crisis

Even studying them with camera traps isn’t without challenges. The smooth-coated otters’ identical, uniform grey-brown bodies have no patterns, such as stripes or spots, which make identifying individuals impossible. Borker can’t tell who’s who from the images taken by remote cameras. He can identify only one otter, which he calls Floppy, with certainty because of a tail deformity.

Although they may be indistinguishable, otters don’t behave the same. Over the six years of observing them, Borker realised that science, with its focus on the species as a whole, misses a lot. “It fails to recognise individual personalities and family traits,” he says.

To highlight his point, he describes an otter clan that is street smart. Its members stand on their hind legs along the verge of a village road, watching the traffic before scooting across. Others aren’t as savvy in navigating their way among humans. All these difficulties have held back research, and biologists know little about their secretive lives and how they deal with the world.

“The more you learn about an animal, it makes a mockery of your existing knowledge,” he says. Until a technological breakthrough, Borker is forced to flip through photographs and sniff ‘refreshing’ spraints.

390,2020/01/18,Pro League Hockey | India’s dash rattles the Netherlands,"A 13th-second goal is a rarity even among rookies in modern hockey. India got one against World No. 3 The Netherlands here on Saturday to kickstart its Pro League campaign on a positive note. It was the first of five goals India struck in its 5-2 win against the Dutch, a result even the most ardent fans wouldn’t have predicted.

Quick off the blocks

It was the fastest-ever goal by India, overshadowing Ajit Singh’s 15th-second strike against Argentina at the Montreal Olympics in 1976. It came against a full-strength, well-prepared, on-the-offensive Dutch side that is looking to break its Olympic gold jinx at Tokyo. It was scored by a player — Gurjant Singh — who had forced his way into the side after more than year.

This was India’s first competitive game against a team ranked higher since the 2018 World Cup quarterfinal game against the same opponent. Through 2019, the team spent more time training than actually competing. That seemed to have borne fruit for Graham Reid and his charges.

The quick goal — courtesy a speedy run from Mandeep Singh and his give-and-take with Gurjant — and the aggressive start was not the only thing different in this Indian side. The entire structure was unlike what was seen the last time around. Reid had said he was not one to sit back and protect a lead and the team mirrored his philosophy. The opener only led to India increasing pressure on the Dutch defence and it finally paid off when Rupinder Pal Singh flicked to make it 2-0.

The Dutch gradually came back in the second quarter, levelling scores by the end of it and appearing to take control of the game. Both coach Max Caldas and Reid admitted it was the best period of play for the visitors.

Controlling the midfield was the key and Manpreet, Vivek Prasad and Lalit Upadhyay did well in this department. The biggest advantage for India was its referrals. In a game as fast and subjective, India got every one of its five reviews correct, four of them resulting in penalty corners and two in goals.

Sunday’s game would be a different ballgame.

The result: India 5 (Rupinder Pal Singh 2, Gurjant Singh, Mandeep Singh, Lalit Upadhyay) bt Netherlands 2 (Jeroen Hertzberger, Jip Janssen).",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/uowskc/article30595983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/pro-league-hockey-indias-dash-rattles-the-netherlands/article30595984.ece
391,2020/01/18,A great test for us to play the top-three teams of the world in the first three games of the Pro League: Graham Reid,"Graham Reid has been with the Indian team for almost a year now but the double-header against Netherlands would be his first big test. The Australian has inside knowledge — he was on the other side when they last came visiting for the 2018 World Cup and sent the host packing in the quarterfinals — but prefers looking ahead.

“It is a great test for us to play the top-three teams of the world in the first three games of the Pro League. This year is about us trying to continuously improve in the next seven months and take every opportunity to grab the lessons we need,” Reid said on the eve of the first game here.

The format is something the Indians haven’t played too often but Reid isn’t worried. “We actually played Spain in weekend games on our recent tour to Europe and played well in both games. As far as understanding these games is concerned, they are often the semifinals and the final of important tournaments and so they have to play accordingly. All you can do is prepare them for it,” he said.

Elusive gold

His opposite number, Max Caldas, claims he has lost over 20kgs, for a new look in the new year, but would gladly trade it for the elusive Olympic gold. “Of course every team wants to win gold at the Olympics. Difficulty is not balancing between Pro League or Tokyo, it is the fact that they all want to play in Tokyo. And every time you may not choose a player for a game, they might get anxious about the Olympics. As a team, we have discussed that we want to be at our top level in every HPL game. Because unlike India or Australia, we do not get a lot of time together,” Caldas said.

Asked about Reid, Caldas said, “Graham is a very committed individual. He is relentless in what he demands from the players, wants to involve them in the process and know what they think.” Dutch captain Billy Bakker added, “he was my club coach as well and always said the team didn’t dare to lose and to make sure you play at your maximum to win instead of being scared to lose.”

Reid, on his part, admitted he was aggressive but not reckless. “I have spent too long with Ric Charlesworth to go out and play reckless hockey. I agree that I love to win and also like to play attacking hockey. But I don’t like taking ridiculous risks. The principle should be that you play the same in the first minute as you play in the last minute. I don’t believe in protecting a lead.”",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/a-great-test-for-us-to-play-the-top-three-teams-of-the-world-in-the-first-three-games-of-the-pro-league-graham-reid/article30588859.ece
392,2020/01/18,India starts Olympic preparations in right earnest,"Constantly under the spotlight with the invisible burden of history, the Indian men’s hockey team will take its first step towards yet another Olympic dream with game one of the double-header against the Netherlands in its Hockey Pro League opener here on Saturday.

The upcoming six months would be the most comprehensive Olympic preparation for the team in recent times, both in quality and quantity. Having withdrawn from the inaugural edition of the competition in 2019, 2020 would see the team take on the world’s top-eight teams in similar back-to-back games in the run-up to the Tokyo Games. The coming weekend would be the first test in that series, in a format the team hasn’t played too often.

The last time India played in such a format competitively was during the Olympic Qualifiers in November 2019. But the opposition Russia would hardly have posed the kind of challenge that the Netherlands will. Also with most European players used to this format in their club engagements, the visitors, for once, should be in a more familiar territory than the hosts.

Crossing the divide

The previous time the two met, the Dutch came back from being a goal down to end India’s World Cup campaign in the quarterfinals in 2018. India coach Graham Reid, then, was on the opposition bench as deputy to Max Caldas and would be the insider in the Indian management. In the year since then, India has had outings against teams largely ranked lower while the Netherlands finished third in the inaugural HPL. Adding to the excitement — or pressure — would be the fact there would be a winner every game with drawn matches heading into shootouts.

Little to separate

Despite the general impression, there is little to separate the two sides in recent times with India winning four to the Netherlands’ five with a draw in the preceding 10 outings. The difference, though, is in the fact that while India’s wins against top sides have remained occasional high points in its kitty, the Netherlands has gone on to make the podium of major events more often than not.

That experience of being able to grab the big moments would be the biggest advantage for this Dutch side. India captain Manpreet Singh admitted that most of the team’s recent games could have gone either way but it was the ability to take the half-chances that made the difference. On Saturday and Sunday, it would be more of the same. Reid, across the line now, would be hoping to finish on the winning side yet again.",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/s2wp2w/article30587727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18HOCKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/india-starts-olympic-preparations-in-right-earnest/article30587728.ece
393,2020/01/18,"Leaders across the globe failing to invest enough in health, says WHO","“Leaders across the globe, are failing to invest enough resources in core health priorities and systems and putting lives, livelihoods and economies in jeopardy,” said World Health Organisation (WHO) releasing its latest list of urgent global health challenges for this decade.

“Public health is ultimately a political choice. Countries invest heavily in protecting their people from terrorist attacks, but not against the attack of a virus, which could be far more deadly, and far more damaging economically and socially. A pandemic could bring economies and nations to their knees. Which is why health security cannot be a matter for ministries of health alone,” noted WHO.

It added that countries have to realise that health is an investment in the future.

Reacting to this a senior health ministry official noted that the Union Health Ministry is looking at “more funds allocation for the coming year.”

A release issued by the central government noted that that department of health has sought for ""untied funds to help in funding gaps in primary health care in the States. It has also asked for performance based incentives – a Composite Health Index to be utilized to encourage States to demonstrate performance on year on year basis.""

“The Health Ministry projected the requirement of funds for a primary care for the purpose of addressing shortfall in infrastructure, health care professionals, supporting AB-HWCs, National Ambulance Service, and Funds for Medicines and Diagnostics. For a 5-year period, total of ₹5,38,305.38 crores fund has been projected,” noted the release.

Meanwhile, WHO also listed out -- climate change, access to medicines, epidemic, anti-biotic resistance, growth in harmful products etc as important challenges for this decade.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general in his statement said: ""We face shared threats and we have a shared responsibility to act. With the deadline for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals quickly approaching, the United Nations General Assembly has underscored that the next 10 years must be the “decade of action”.

395,2020/01/18,Question Corner: Geometry of lines,"Why do two parallel lines appear to meet at an infinite distance?

Kabir H. Biswas

College of Health &Life Sciences

Hamad Bin Khalifa University

Doha, Qatar

In flat space, two parallel lines never meet, however, they appear to meet at very distances for the same reason due to which objects appear smaller when they are at a distance than when they are closer. In order to understand this, we may consider that the space between the two lines are filled with thin but equal sized objects (another set of infinitely large number of lines) perpendicular to the lines themselves. Now, when we look at the perpendicular lines, the size of those lines decreases due to an increase in the angle of vision. Therefore, one of those lines that is located infinitely farther from the observer will appear to be a point object and this, the distance the between the parallel lines appear to be zero.

396,2020/01/18,"TB diagnostic test developed in India has high accuracy, says WHO","In a Rapid Communication published on January 14, the World Health Organization (WHO) had mentioned that the India-made Truenat MTB, a molecular diagnostic test to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB and rifampicin-resistant TB, has high diagnostic accuracy.

Truenat MTB has “high diagnostic accuracy as initial test to diagnose TB and to sequentially detect rifampicin resistance”, says the WHO Communication. Truenat MTB will be used as an initial test to diagnose TB thus replacing sputum smear microscopy.

Truenat is developed by the Goa-based Molbio Diagnostics. The company was provided with technical assistance and resources by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) to help commercialise Truenat. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had assessed and validated the diagnostic tool.

“Truenat will be cheaper per test than Xpert. The equipment and cartridges cost more in the case of Xpert,” says Balaram Bhargava, Director-General of ICMR. “Truenat is robust and most suited for Indian conditions.”

“With its better sensitivity, Truenat can be used as the initial tool for TB diagnosis,” says Prof. Bhargava.

Besides others, a multi-centric, prospective field evaluation study was carried out in four countries — India, Ethiopia, Peru, Papua-New Guinea — involving 744 participants, with final results on bacteriological culture.

Higher sensitivity

While sputum microscopy has only about 50% sensitivity, Truenat has been found to have higher sensitivity and specificity. According to WHO, the overall sensitivity of the Truenat MTB assay is 83% and specificity is 99%. In the case of Truenat MTBPlus, which uses two targets to diagnose TB bacteria, the sensitivity increases to 89% and the specificity is 98%.

In comparison, Xpert, which is also a molecular diagnostic test and has been widely used across the world, the sensitivity is 85% and specificity is 98%.

In cases where the sample is found to be positive for TB, tests can be done to know if the TB bacteria are already resistant to rifampicin, a drug used as part of first-line TB treatment. Truenat MTB-RIF test for knowing rifampicin resistance has 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

According to the WHO, the accuracy to diagnose TB using Truenat and Truenat MTB Plus is comparable with Xpert and Xpert Ultra. Likewise, the accuracy to detect rifampicin resistance using Truenat MTB-RIF is comparable with Xpert and Xpert Ultra.

Beats smear microscopy

Based on data available from around 230 TB diagnosing units located in primary health centres and community health centres in Andhra Pradesh, scientists at the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology found Truenat had better ability to diagnose more TB positive cases. “Compared with smear microscopy, there was 30% more number of positive cases diagnosed after Truenat was implemented in the 230-odd units,” says Manoj V. Murhekar, Director of NIE.

Battery operated

“Instead of smear microscopy, Truenat can be used as an initial and point-of-care tool for diagnosing TB,” says Dr. Murhekar. “Since not much expertise is needed to carry out the test, it can be used in peripheral units such as public and community health centres.”

While Xpert needs reliable electricity supply and air-conditioning, Truenat is battery operated and portable and so can be used in remote places. Truenat takes about 25 minutes to extract the DNA and another 35 minutes for TB diagnosis. Testing for rifampicin resistance takes an hour and is done only if the sample tests positive for TB. In the case of Xpert, it takes two hours to complete the TB diagnosis and test for rifampicin resistance.

Compared with a one ml of sputum sample required in the case of Xpert, only 0.5 ml sputum sample is needed for Truenat. In the case of TB positive samples, the actual bacterial load in 1 ml of sputum sample is given, while Xpert provides only a qualitative result.

Low cost

The main cost advantage while using Truenat will be in the manner the tests are carried out. Only when samples test positive for TB will the test for rifampicin resistance be carried out in the case of Truenat. This is unlike Xpert where both TB diagnosis and rifampicin resistance test are done at one go. Hence the use of reagents may be reduced, and this will help make the testing cheaper when Truenat is used.

Also, a peripheral-level TB test using Truenat will reduce the delay in diagnosis and when combined with improved treatment initiation rates will fare better compared with district-level Xpert testing. After all, early diagnosis and treatment initiation will help reduce TB transmission and incidence.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/5lz1xs/article30595096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-SCITruenatPNG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/tb-diagnostic-test-developed-in-india-has-high-accuracy-says-who/article30595097.ece
397,2020/01/18,IIT Bombay efficiently removes heavy metals from water,"Simultaneously removing heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cadmium and mercury from waste water with very high efficiency now appears possible, thanks to the work of researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. The carbon-based nanostructure that the team fabricated shows 80-90% adsorption efficiency for all the four heavy metals studied.

No electricity is required for the nanostructure to remove heavy metals from water as it allows for gravity-driven purification of the water. The nanostructures can be recycled and reused multiple times. While there is an initial drop of about 8% after the first cycle, the efficiency remains constant at 75-85% in the subsequent cycles. The carbon nanostructure is able to adsorb the heavy metals in the wide range of pH conditions — pH 2 to 13. The results were published in the journal ACS Applied Nano Materials.

To fabricate the carbon-based nanostructure shaped like a marigold flower, the team led by Chandramouli Subramaniam from the Department of Chemistry at IIT Bombay used dendritic fibre nanosilica spheres as template. The nanostructure is obtained through a single-step process of chemical vapour deposition followed by removing the silica template.

Marigold-like stucture

“What we get is a marigold-like nanostructure made of carbon that has high specific surface area, optimal porosity and pore volume. The nanostructure has 15-20% micropores (less than 2 nanometre) and 80-85% mesopores (2-50 nanometre),” says Prof. Subramaniam. “The reason it shows very high adsorption efficiency is its hydrophilic [water-loving nature] nature that allows for extensive and rapid interaction between the heavy metal-containing water and the carbon nanostructure.” Also, unlike activated carbon, the surface area of our nanostructure is easily accessible for heavy metals. So the adsorption is high.

When the water containing the heavy metals comes in contact with the nanostructure, majority of adsorption first takes place in the micropores. “It is energetically more favourable for the heavy metals to bind to the nanostructure in the micropores. Once the micropores get saturated then the heavy metals are captured by the mesopores,” says Maku Moronshing from IIT Bombay and one of the first authors of the paper.

For the four heavy metals to get adsorbed on the nanostructure the water has to be in contact with the nanostructure for at least 32 seconds. The team used a 1 cm long column of the nanostructure to make sure that minimum contact time is maintained.

Recovering heavy metals

“Since the heavy metals chemically react and bind to the surface of the nanostructure, they do not leach back into the water. They can be recovered by treating the nanostructure with mild acid (hydrochloric acid and nitric acid),” says Ananya Sah from IIT Bombay and the other first author of the paper.

“The heavy metals have greater affinity for acid and so they leach out into the acid. This allows us to reuse the carbon nanostructure multiple times,” says Prof. Subramaniam. There is about 10% drop in efficiency after the first cycle as the metals trapped in the micropores do not get leached out when treated with acid. But there is complete recovery of metals trapped in the mesopores.

The team tested the ability of the structure to adsorb heavy metals in industrial effluent over a range of pH conditions (pH 2-13). The industrial effluent was simulated by mixing 100 ppm of each metal. “Adsorption was as effective as the test case for all the four heavy metals. At very acidic pH of 2, some metals did not get adsorbed. But between pH 5-10 the adsorption was very good for all the four metals,” he says.

Most of the adsorbents known are effective against either one or two heavy metal ions. Even the chemisorptive scavenging ones need to have longer treatment column as they need to be multifunctionalised adsorbents. Also, the inlet pressure has to be more. However, the carbon nanostructure was able to scavenge all four metals simultaneously without the need for these.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/evo9ey/article30595086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-SCISAH-IITBJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-bombay-efficiently-removes-heavy-metals-from-water/article30595087.ece
398,2020/01/18,Stray dogs may have a natural ability to understand human gestures,"Stray dogs have the natural ability to understand human gestures, and respond to some cues better than the others, according to a study which may help improve our relationship with the canines. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, said free-roaming dogs, which have never lived with human companions, are capable of following pointing cues to locate food rewards.

For the first time, researchers, including those from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, tested 160 adult stray dogs across several Indian cities.

In the study, the scientists placed two covered bowls on the ground — one containing chicken, and another with just the scent of the food. Then a second experimenter, who didn’t know which bowl had food, pointed at one of the bowls.

“In the initial experiment we would bend down and take the pointing finger very close to the bowl so that a dog could understand that we’re trying to point to that bowl. And there we had actually seen that only 50% of the dogs could understand, perhaps because some of the dogs were apprehensive that the human is trying to attack them,” study co-author Anindita Bhadra from IISER Kolkata told Press Trust of India.

She said the 50% of dogs which approached the experimental set up comfortably were assessed further.

Distal pointing

“In another case, while standing upright, I put my hand out, pointing at the bowl. This is distal pointing,” Dr. Bhadra explained.

In distal pointing, she added, there are two kinds. “One is dynamic pointing, where I put my hand out with one finger pointing, and continued to hold it for a minute. And the other one is called momentary distal pointing, in which I point just for a couple of seconds, and then don’t giveany cues,” she explained.

In both dynamic and momentary pointing, the study noted that about 80% of the dogs, which could approach the experimental set-up, were able to follow the cues and get the food reward.

Based on the experiment, Dr. Bhadra and her team, believe that stray dogs knew where to look when a person points to an object, suggesting that their ability to pick up cues from humans could be a natural trait.

The researchers speculate that stray dogs pick some gestures, and don’t follow some, perhaps due to the typical way in which people in India provide food to free-roaming dogs. “While this has not been extensively tested, it is likely that dogs are more accustomed to humans throwing a piece of food away from themselves as a response to begging, or to a human dropping food on the ground and moving away,” the researchers write in the paper

“However, though the proximal pointing cue is considered to be a simpler cue to follow from a completely anthropomorphic perspective to an untrained dog, this might be a more difficult situation, with an unfamiliar human constantly pointing at the container, and thereby being in very close proximity to the food source,” they note.

If a bowl they had pointed at turned out to be empty, the researchers said that the adult dogs were less likely to follow the pointing cue again.

Dog personalities

Based on these observations and earlier studies, the researchers said, humans inadvertently play a role in shaping the personalities of stray dogs. Dr. Bhadra and her team suggest that the study may provide insights on how humans influence the behaviour of dogs on the streets, and help in better management of dog-human conflicts which commonly occur in India’s urban areas.

The findings also solve important pieces of the puzzle of what made dogs special for human domestication thousands of years ago, the researchers said.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/1j5xai/article30595073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-SCISTRAY-DOGS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/stray-dogs-may-have-a-natural-ability-to-understand-human-gestures/article30595074.ece
399,2020/01/18,"Eastern Ghats: land use policies, climate change hit endemic plant habitats","The broken hill-ranges of the Eastern Ghats, spread across Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, are home to unique ecosystems. Though it has over 450 endemic plant species, the region remains one of the most exploited and degraded ecosystems of India. With intensifying agricultural practices, urbanisation and pressures from mining and deforestation, the precious habitat of endemic and rare, endangered and threatened (RET) species could be reduced, even leading to species loss, notes a new study.

The study team looked at available plant species data and identified 22 endemic species recorded from over 250 locations and 28 RET species recorded from nearly 800 locations in the Eastern Ghats. They then studied the soil, land use, anthropogenic activities and climate changes in these areas. They used simulations to predict how the area will change by 2050 and 2070.

The results published in Environmental Monitoring and Assessment show that by 2050 the total human population in the Eastern Ghats region is expected to reach 2.6 million, raising pressure from anthropogenic activities. There will be a demand for land for food, road and other activities leading to encroachments and threat to the habitats of endemic and RET species. Parth Sarathi Roy from Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Hyderabad explains that unsupervised tourism also affects the distribution of these species. “Ecotourism with regulatory guidelines is a positive way to educate and promote conservation. The highly threatening human activities in the Eastern Ghats area are mining, urbanisation/settlements, dam construction, firewood collection and agricultural expansion,” he adds in an email to The Hindu. Prof. Roy is one of the lead authors of the paper.

The endemic species were found to be distributed in the core areas of the forests - Kalahandi, Mahendragiri, Nallamalai-Seshachalam, Kolli and Kalrayan hill forests. On the other hand, the rare, endangered and threatened species were distributed not only in the core areas but also in the periphery of the forests, thus taking a greater hit from anthropogenic disturbances.

The mean temperature and rainfall were all crucial for the plant species and simulations showed that the temperature is likely to increase by 1.8 degree Celsius by 2050 to 1.98 degree Celsius by 2070. The rainfall is also projected to increase by 113 millimetre by 2050 and 160 millimetre by 2070.

Climate change effect

The team adds that the regional or local climate change (warming) has led to frequent prolonged non-rainy days, increased number of days with maximum and minimum temperatures resulting in loss of soil moisture and soil degradation. These factors have also contributed to the occurrence of frequent forest fires, eliminating regeneration of the less-frequent endemic species in the forest.

Studies from across the globe have shown that the tropics are losing more plant biodiversity than other regions, stressing the need for urgent conservation strategies. The team adds that more studies and setting up species inventories to identify and record species can help on conservation efforts.

“It is of utmost importance that biodiversity conservation initiatives of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of Government of India and State forest departments focus on the Eastern Ghats to protect declining habitats of endemic and RET species. The boundaries of national parks and sanctuaries should be redefined based on the richness of endemic and RET species,” says lead author Reshma Ramachandran from the University of Hyderabad.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gxwf16/article30595055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-SCIgrazingthreatJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/eastern-ghats-land-use-policies-climate-change-hit-endemic-plant-habitats/article30595056.ece

Could an understanding of the structure of the ribosome help in discovering new therapies that target antibiotic-resistant organisms? And has research hit a roadblock in creating a new class of antibiotics against superbugs?

There are many ways of targeting bacteria. But nature’s selected the ribosome quite often, so in fact about half of the natural antibiotics target the ribosome or general translational machinery. And when the structures came out, it was thought that they would be very useful to study how natural antibiotics bound to the ribosome and inhibited them. But then, that would also allow you to design better antibiotics that might be more effective against resistant bacteria, and possibly have fewer side effects.

I think the problem is that antibiotics are not a huge profit-maker necessarily because it costs about a billion dollars to develop a new medicine. And the problem is a new antibiotic is only given to people to whom old or generic antibiotics don’t work. So, the patient pool is small, and also if it’s any good, the patient is cured. It’s not like a cholesterol or blood pressure drug that you have to keep taking the rest of your life.

The result is that for the last several decades, there has been no new class of antibiotics developed. So I question whether the business model is correct for developing new antibiotics. And, one has to remember that penicillin, the first of the big natural antibiotics, was actually developed by the British government in response to WW II with a massive effort at Oxford. There’s no reason why governments and non-profit organisations should not invest heavily in antibiotic research, and I think they should do it before the problem becomes a huge crisis. We’re already seeing superbugs. I think we always have to stay one step ahead of the bacteria, which will evolve to become resistant.

You recently made a strong statement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. What made it important for you, as a scientist, an Indian-born scientist, to speak out?

I don’t normally like to make statements about Indian politics; I like to stick to science. My concern about the CAA is — you know, technically it is not targeted at Indian Muslims — but it does send a message that somehow one religion is excluded, while others are okay. And the rationale is that the countries that people are coming from are Muslim countries, so why should them being Muslim actually be an issue?

Well I think it could be an issue because they are looking at Muslims as a homogeneous group. And they are not a homogeneous group. And so I think, rather than spelling it out that way they could have decided everything on a case-by-case basis. And I also think India has a secular Constitution, and it’s not clear that having a religious criteria for a particular law is going to hold up in courts. Science and technology always flourish, I think, in an atmosphere that is inclusive and tolerant.

You have cautioned against the rise of pseudo-science in India. Do you see a rising correlation between a new culture of science, the polity and the shift to majoritarianism?

Whenever these people make some outlandish statement, tying some ancient scripture to some major scientific discovery, whether it’s nuclear weapons or stem cells, I don’t think scientists in India take them at all seriously. I don’t even know if the politicians who make these statements actually believe in it. But I think it’s just generally bad to have people in authority make these pseudo-scientific statements because it brings India into ridicule. India then looks to be a sort of backward-looking, superstitious country, when, in fact, the majority of educated Indians and the majority of Indian scientists are very much like scientists anywhere else.

Could laws that exclude communities eventually undermine science?

History says that when you start becoming less open, and discriminatory, you end up hurting science; and the classic example, of course, is Nazi Germany, which effectively destroyed German science for probably two or three generations. It took about 50 years to recover. I think science flourishes best when people are free to talk, free to question ideas, free to question authority — because that is how progress is made.

Science really depends on being able to question authority. So, I think anything that excludes communities and creates an atmosphere of intolerance, is probably not a good thing for science. If you exclude a large fraction population you’re missing out on the talent in that population.

You are not a big fan of prizes because they apply a 'sports metaphor' to science; you have described the chronic hankering for a Nobel Prize, in your book, as ‘Nobelitis’...

In sports, you can have a very clear set of rules, and a clear set of measurement. So if you have a 100 metre race, there’s no question what the rules are, there’s no question who came first, second and third; you can measure it. In science, when there is a big discovery, it is not always clear who the big contributors were, because often different people make contributions in different ways. So it’s not always clear which was the important idea and it can be very subjective. For example, in the field of transcription, the Lasker Award went to one very good scientist, and the Nobel Prize went to a different, but also a very good, scientist. How could it be that distinguished expert juries picked totally different people in the same field? And so I think that’s in general not a great thing. The argument for it is that it brings attention to science. And also, human beings like to have heroes and villains and so they like these sort of prizes — to them that tells a more human story.

You have written in your book Gene Machine that you were extremely fortunate that your wife Vera Rosenberry, the children's book illustrator, could take on the responsibilities of childcare at home, allowing you to focus on academia. What can be done to help women scientists stay with research and get past the glass ceiling that often cuts short careers around the time of marriage and child birth?

Unfortunately, this is a problem everywhere, not just India. I think there are a number of things that have to be done. One is, people should be allowed career breaks. First of all, we call it ‘maternity leave’ but the more modern way is to think of it as ‘parental leave’. There’s no reason why the husband shouldn’t also be involved in childcare. And so the idea is to allow leave without penalty, so people can get back their job at the end of it. It is unfair to ask an individual employer necessarily to bear the costs of that. So it’s better a government reimburses people for being on leave.

Secondly, the question of childcare is very important. It’s very important to have good childcare facilities, close to work.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/itt6d0/article30589248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18VENKIRAMAKRISHNAN2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/science-depends-on-being-able-to-question-authority/article30589249.ece
